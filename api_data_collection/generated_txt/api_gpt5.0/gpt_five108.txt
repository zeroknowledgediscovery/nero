The day Maia stepped off the bus at the bottom of Dixon Street, the wind had already begun its usual Wellington hiss, curling around the cinema signs and snapping stray receipts up into whirling, papery gulls. It tugged at her jacket and at the gold string on her guitar case, and it made the lamb bones of the hills creak. On good days the wind made her breathe deeper, like filling up till her ribs were lanterns. On bad days it made her teeth ache. This was a good day. She decided to take the long way home, past the dairy with the hand-painted “PIES” sign and the bony cherry trees with their sad, righteous bark.

Wellington had that way of sitting on the edge of itself. A city that pressed its nose to the window of the sea and fogged it. Maia liked that. She was twenty-one and still learning how to press her nose to the window in the right places. A student old enough to go halves on a good kettle but young enough to text her mother every time the fire alarm went off and the flat turned into a hooting, blinking chaos. She was studying environmental engineering at Vic, because there were rivers she wanted to put back together and bridges she wanted to draw in the air the way you draw breath. She was singing because there were songs her bones remembered even when she forgot herself. The singing had come first. The rivers came later.

Her father had taught her the names of wind, or tried to, sitting in a brittle yellow kayak off the Pauatahanui inlet when she was nine. “Nor’wester,” he’d said, tapping the hull with the paddle, “and southerly and zephyr and gale. There’s the lazy wind, the kind that goes straight through you because it can’t be bothered going around.” He had grinned; the gulls had yelled at them; she had laughed and blown into her cupped hands as if to call up a private breeze. He died when she was thirteen: not dramatically, just a soft leaving in a hospital room that smelled like the inside of a seashell. After that, wind was their language for a while. It still was. Her mother would stand on the deck and tilt her head and say, “He’s back.” Maia would say, “Is that a nor’wester?” and her mother would say, “Nah, it’s your father looking for his hat.”

On the way home she bought strawberries and a packet of ramen and she tried not to check her phone on the street because she had promised herself this small dignity. She made it to the traffic lights before she blinked at the screen. Two missed calls from a UK number. A single text. Unknown number: IMPORTANT PRESS REQUEST — PLEASE CALL ASAP. Her stomach hopped like it’d seen a cat.

Her phone chimed again, insistent. A ring; then the voicemail icon.

In the flat there were socks on the couch and a sticky bowl that had contained something spiced and experimental. The ceiling had hair-line cracks like drawings of trees. Emery was stirring coffee in a jar. He wore a T-shirt with a badly-printed cat on it and I’m a DJ stamped across the chest. He was not a DJ. He was a law student who made beats at three in the morning and had a laugh like a car starting.

“You look beswizzled,” he said, making up words because he could.

“People are calling me from England,” she said, dropping the strawberries in the sink and the guitar case by the couch. The guitar made a small wail through the case, an offended hum.

“What did you do?”

“Nothing. Probably a scam.”

“Probably,” he said, and then, because he couldn’t help it, “You gonna call ‘em back or are you going to waste my perfectly good jar coffee being nervous?”

She sucked her lip, put her phone on speaker, pressed the unfamiliar number. It chirped a ring, another, and then a voice, crisp and fizzing, like it had a thousand places to be and they were all important.

“Hello! This is Brooke from Thames Television calling on behalf of Britain’s Got Talent. Is this Maia Wren?”

The flat air shifted. Emery’s eyebrows got lost in his fringe. The jar stopped stirring mid-air; the spoon clinked.

“This is—yeah. It’s me.”

“Oh, fabulous! Maia, we’ve been trying to reach you. We saw your video, the one recorded at the clifftop with the loop pedal? You had the tūī song—am I saying that right?—woven into your melody. Quite extraordinary. We’ve been trawling for a wildcard finalist to bring an international element to this season’s final—bit of a surprise twist—and your name kept coming up. Would you be available to fly to London next month?”

Maia leaned back against the counter. The kitchen floor felt too thin to hold her up. She could see, over the sink and out the tiny window, the slice of harbour like a fallen coin, the hills above it like backs of sleeping dogs. London. Next month. Britain’s Got. No. Yes. Emery was mouthing: OH MY GOD, as if a silent hymn.

“I— I’m in university.”

Brooke laughed. “Yes, well, the world is round, isn’t it? We’ll coordinate. Travel, accommodation, per diem, the works. Of course there’s a process, a few calls with producers, but the gist of it is we would love to offer you a place in the final. We’re doing a special wildcard feature. The judges are very excited.”

“The final? As in— I don’t have to go through—”

“Auditions and semis? Correct. It’s unorthodox, but this season has been unusual already. We think you’d be a perfect fit, very contemporary, very... fresh. And your story—the environmental engineering, the incorporation of native birdsong—it’s compelling television. It’s art.”

A kettle in her chest started to scream, quietly. “I need to— I need to talk to my mum. And to the university.”

“Absolutely,” Brooke said kindly. “I’ll email you the details. We’ll set you up with a liaison. Shall I give you my direct line? Is this your proper mobile? Are you in a position to talk for ten more minutes now, or would you prefer tomorrow morning, your time?”

“Now is fine,” Maia said, and the kitchen became a little soundstage, with Emery pouring coffee very slowly into his mouth like he didn’t trust his hands to hold it. They went through logistics. Maia tried to make her voice sit on its chair and not fall off. There were flights and a soundcheck and a rehearsal schedule that looked like someone had taken a highlighter pen to a calendar and gone berserk. There were big words like Brand Synergy and Intellectual Property and also some small words like Kind Regards and Welcome Aboard that made her eyes sting.

After the call ended, she and Emery looked at each other, faces paper-white and ridiculous. He made a noise that sounded like a kazoo strangled by a trout. Then the two of them screamed, soundless because the building was thin, their mouths open, faces bent toward each other like conspirators or birds.

“What,” Emery said finally, breathless, “what even is your life?”

“I don’t know.”

He grabbed her shoulders and shook her very lightly, terrified and thrilled. “You’re going to be on television. Proper television. In, like, England. With Simon Cowell. You’re going to wear sparkles.”

She thought of her loop pedal with its scratched red paint. She thought of the tūī in the pōhutukawa tree outside her mother’s house, catcalling, rude as summer. She thought of her father saying nor’westerly. She thought of London, which was colder and older than her whole life. “I might throw up,” she said frankly.

“Do it somewhere that can be cleaned. Should we tell people?”

“Not yet,” she said. The idea of other people’s faces made her vision prickle. “No, wait. I have to call Mum.”

Her mother answered on the third ring, breathless like she’d been running or laughing, and then neither; just that old careful voice. “Sweet?”

“Mum. Um. Are you—can you talk?”

“Always. Are you okay? You sound like you swallowed a bee.”

“I’ve been invited to the final of Britain’s Got Talent,” Maia said, as if reading from a card, testing each word before she set it free.

Silence. Then a small, disbelieving bark of laughter. “That’s a joke.”

“No. I’ll give you the number and you can call back. It’s real. They’re flying me to London next month.”

“Oho. Oho. It’s a scam. It’s definitely a—”

“It’s real,” Maia said, and then, because she heard the wobble, she said it again, gently. “Mum, it’s real.”

Her mother made a noise like something settling. The phone gathered breath between them. “Your father,” she said finally, and then couldn’t finish the sentence, not because she was crying, but because it felt private. “He would have laughed like an idiot,” she said instead, voice carefully bright.

The wind pressed at the kitchen window. Maia put her forehead against the glass and it was cool and thinking.

“Do you want to do it?” her mother asked. “You can say no, you know. Nobody will think less of you if you say No, not my storm.”

“I want to,” Maia heard herself say, surprised and sure at the same time. “I’m scared, but I want to. I think... I think I’m supposed to.”

“I’ll start brewing strong tea,” her mother said, which was her way of giving a blessing. “And I’ll book leave. I’m not missing my girl’s face on the telly. Oh my word. Do you need a new dress? You should wear something green. You look like a fern when you wear green.”

They talked about practical things until the practical things ran out. They said I love you and hung up before the tears found them.

The email came while she was twisting the tap closed. Subject line: CONFIDENTIAL: Welcome to Britain’s Got Talent. It had attachments that made her stomach give small, uncertain hiccups. There were contracts in calm PDF fonts. There were bullet points about media training. There was a photo of the stage in London, black and glittering, and the stage lights looked like bells turned upside down. She forwarded it to her university advisor, to Emery, to herself twice, as if that would anchor it to her inbox more firmly, as if the world might try to slip it away.

“Play something,” Emery said, and she did, because it was the one thing that put the floor back under her feet when the floor was threatening to become ocean. She took the guitar out of its case as if it were a sleeping animal, stroked the neck, tuned until the sounds felt like stepping-stones. The loop pedal blinked at her like a small red eye. She laid down a hum. Then a chord progression, a small ladder to climb. Then the mimicry, that particular tui stutter-burr-cough and the liquid g; not perfect, never that, but the song wore it like a brooch. She sang about gulls and train windows and jars of coffee because the world was suddenly large and ridiculous and dear.

She went to sleep with the email orbiting her like a shy planet. The wind found its way under the eaves and poked at them. She dreamt she was standing on a stage the size of a swimming pool, her feet bare, the floor cold enough to make her teeth ache. The lights were so bright they made a hole in the world. At the edge of the stage there was the shape of a person. Blurry. Familiar. She woke before the music started. She could still feel the stage burning the soles of her feet.

The next weeks were a tornado sewn to a clock. There were forms and then more forms. A university meeting with her advisor, Cathy, who wore a scarf that looked like a night sky. Cathy said yes quickly and without drama, which made Maia want to hug her. “You’ll learn more in those two weeks than in any lecture I could give,” Cathy said. “We’ll schedule makeup work. We’ll call it an independent study in applied resilience.” The lab team gave her a Mars Bar and promised to water her ferns. Her flatmates started leaving ridiculous notes on the fridge like: REMEMBER TO BREATHE. Hedgehog drawing. And: WHERE ARE MY SUNGLASSES also remember to breathe.

In their shared living room they taped a paper “international travel wall” to the plaster and wrote lists of things she should bring. Emery scribbled: International Adapter, Anxiety Drugs (lol), Good Socks, Loop Pedal, Emergency Snacks. Maia added: Dad’s pounamu, Tūī song trapped in throat. She drew a crude bird with a speech bubble: Kia ora, London. Someone (Emery) drew Simon Cowell looking disapproving and then wrote underneath: He’s just hungry.

The producer calls intensified. There was a woman named Lila who called at strange hours from stairwells, the sound of London behind her, a deep, endlessly polite murmur. “You’re our breath of fresh air,” Lila told her once. “They’re going to love you. You’re going to make them feel like they remember things they forgot. That’s your power.” Lila had a voice like a lift that dinged pleasantly at every floor.

In the kitchen late one night, Maia and Emery practiced small talk interviews, with Emery as Generic Television Host. “So Maia, where are you from?” he asked in a terrible British accent.

“New Zealand.”

“And what is that exactly?” he said, raising one eyebrow, and she hit him with a tea towel.

They took the ferry to Days Bay on a Sunday because the city was too noisy and she needed to hear the ocean correcting all the wrong notes. The ferry was a toy with grown-ups balanced precariously on it. The water was a black green; the hills spooned the bay like someone had put a hand over a candle to protect it. Emery held her phone and filmed her walking along the beach with the loop pedal on the pebbles and the guitar slung over her back, and he made a running commentary in a British sports voiceover: “Wren is on the move, she’s wearing gumboots, she’s lamenting the state of the world, what will she do now...” She did a take then and there, the wind lifting her hair and her voice fumbling and then catching, and she knew that later they would laugh at it, because there was too much sea, not enough song. But right in that moment it was perfect.

In her bag there was a piece of paper folded in quarters with a list of names. At the top was one name underlined and then scribbled out and rewritten. Saskia Vale. She had written it thinking maybe that would make it less sharp in her mouth. It didn’t. Saskia had been in school with her, a lifetime ago, when uniform skirts were weapons and lunchtime was a minefield taped around with gum wrappers. Saskia had sung like a bell, clear enough to make the hairs lift on your forearms. She had been kind in an offhand, bewildering way, except when she wasn’t. It was complicated, because girls are complicated. Because they had been thrown into rooms with a piano and told to both be the best, and that did something to your hands.

They had both applied for things. Scholarships, choirs, summer schools. They had both won things. They had both watched the other girl’s mouth when she sang, looking for a clipped consonant, a breath. The world had its hips set at a certain angle, its favorite girls. Sometimes Maia thought her life had been a series of attempts not to be bitter. She was good at it. She practiced it like scales. She forgave herself when she failed.

She hadn’t seen Saskia in years. The way her name made Maia bite the inside of her cheek was small and private and ridiculous. But it was there. She wrote the name on the list and pressed the fold sharply with her thumbnail. Then she went back to practicing the bit where the bird calls flowed into the chorus like a river losing its shyness.

Two nights before she left, her mother came to stay. She brought jam and two scarves and a swear jar, because she didn’t trust Maia not to say unsayable things on national television. They sat on the couch and watched old episodes of the show, pausing to comment on the staging and the songs and the judges’ eyebrows. “That woman is wearing a chandelier,” her mother said approvingly. “You should wear a metaphor.”

“What kind of metaphor?” Maia asked.

“A green one,” her mother said. “A metaphor that looks like a forest.”

“Okay, Mother of Lights,” Emery said, sitting at their feet like a very cheerful dog, “what does that even mean.”

“It means,” her mother said, “that when she walks out there she should take this whole messy little country with her. In her pocket. Like a shell. Like a sound she could hold up to their ears and say, hear this?”

The day of the flight, the airport looked like it had been built to fold itself up and become a suitcase. The wind pushed at the glass walls as if trying to get in. Maia wore the green scarf because she couldn’t not. The pounamu at her neck sat cool and weighty, like a small promise. Emery hugged her three times in a row and then one more because he was superstitious. Her mother didn’t cry, because she had made a pact with herself not to. She cried in the car after they dropped her at the curb, and that was fine.

On the plane everything smelled like electrical sockets and sleep. Maia put her headphones in and tried to imagine England beyond the cartoon map on the tiny screen. She thought of the video that had gotten her here. It had been an accident, a Sunday morning at the top of the Makara hill track, the wind smacking everything loose. She had set her phone against a rock. She had sung because if she didn’t she felt like the wind would take her voice away and keep it, a souvenir. A woman walking her dog had stopped and cried, and Maia had thought: Sorry, sorry, I didn’t mean to; and then later that night the video had gone clattering across the internet like a spoon dropped into dishes. That was the thing about singing: you did it in a corner, and then suddenly you were in a room you didn’t recognize.

Mid-air she woke to a dream where the aisle was a river and people were fishing with their arms. She woke again when the plane whispered itself down toward the lights. London, when it arrived, was gray and tilted and too big to be held in anybody’s pocket. It had old bones. It had a smell of baked bread and damp and something that felt like money.

A woman stood at arrivals with a sign that had her name in block letters and an exclamation mark. “Maia!” she said when she saw her; she looked like someone who had leaves in her hair even though she didn’t. “I’m Lila. We’ve decided to adopt you.”

“Hi,” Maia said, and then, awkwardly, “Okay.”

They drove through streets that had been laid down like stories and then overwritten and then underlined. Maia watched the trees outside the window as if they were telling her a secret. Lila talked, the London behind her voice. “We’ve got you staying near the riverside. The Thames is like a lazy animal. It’s very good for nerves. How are you? Don’t answer. You’re shaking—”

“I’m not,” Maia said, her hands obediently trembling.

“—with delight,” Lila said. “We’ll do a quick stop at wardrobe tomorrow, and then a run-through at the theatre. You’ll love the stage. It’s like a black swallow you get to stand inside.”

They put her in a hotel where the carpet had opinions and the bed held her as if it knew her name. She opened the window and London breathed on her face: damp and complicated. A gull by the river made a noise that was almost familiar except not quite. She made tea and stood with the cup in her palms and thought: I brought this country in my pocket. She thought: My father is laughing somewhere in the weather.

At the theatre the next morning she learned what it meant to be shepherded. People with clipboards moved in brisk lines. Microphones sprouted like mushrooms. There were lights that looked like they would agree with you to your face and then say something else behind your back. They pinned a backstage pass on her with the kind of safety pin that had thoughts. They gave her coffee she couldn’t drink. She stepped onto the stage and the floor was cold enough to speak itself into the bones of her feet. The seats were mouths. Empty and waiting to be fed.

“Don’t look at the mouths,” Lila advised, materializing at her elbow. “Look at the lights. Or look down. Or look nowhere. Everyone has a trick.”

“My trick is pretending I’m at the top of Makara hill,” Maia said, and the word Makara felt like a bird landing.

“Perfect,” Lila said, not knowing what it was and not needing to. “We’ll set up your loop. Sound want to see you step through—”

A man with a beard the size of a weather system waved from the sound desk. “We’ll need to run your pedal through DI,” he said. “We’ve got a thousand radio frequencies in here, don’t want your bird songs picked up by the security guards in the carpark.”

She smiled and her mouth felt like it had forgotten how. “Okay.”

“Do you want reverb like a church?” he asked. “Or like a bathroom? Or like a small cave with good insurance?”

She laughed, properly. “Church, please.”

They ran through her set, and it felt like stepping out into shallow water at night, when you can’t see your feet and you trust the sand to be where you left it. The first time she almost swallowed the chorus. The second time she found it again in her throat, the place where it liked to hide. The birdsong fit itself in, not exact, never exact, but right enough. People stopped to watch. That was the strange thing—how quickly you can get used to being watched. How quickly you can pretend it isn’t a factor.

She learned the stage’s sounds. A groan when someone walked too heavy. A click where a panel had been replaced. A whisper in the wings that might have been air, might have been memory. A woman from wardrobe tilted her head at Maia’s jeans and boots and said, “We can do better, darling,” and then brought back a dress like seaweed and light, green without apology.

In the corridor outside the dressing rooms, Maia saw a profile that made her stomach behave like a dropped plate. The girl turned. She had cut her hair. The bell tone was still there in her face. A golden, destructive innocent. “Saskia?”

The other woman’s eyes widened, then warmed, and in an instant all the small things they had been tug-of-warring over spilled out of Maia’s hands. “Maia bloody Wren,” Saskia said, and the vowels were taller, the Rs more recruited. “What are you doing here?”

“I was going to ask you the same thing,” Maia said, and her mouth had chosen to become a desert.

“I’m competing,” Saskia said, easy. “Last minute replacement for a magician whose rabbit did a runner.” She laughed, and it was the same laugh from the school hall. “What are the odds, right? Little New Zealand. Two of us.” She reached out and squeezed Maia’s shoulder; her hand was warm. The smell of her was new: expensive, London. “It’ll be so good to watch you out there,” she said. “You were always—” She stopped herself with a small, practiced smile. “We’ll catch up? I’ve got to go on stage.”

Maia watched her walk away like someone watches a fox that has refused to be shy. “That’s my arch enemy,” she muttered to no one in particular, and then laughed at herself, because she wasn’t thirteen and this wasn’t a school auditorium, and maybe the word enemy belonged to books. But the words you hold in your mouth change the taste of your day. The taste of hers shifted, a fraction. A small grit. She put her hand on her pounamu and it was cool and not interested in gossip.

She texted Emery: GUESS WHO IS HERE. There were no capitals big enough for the feeling. He wrote back instantly: OH NO. OH YES. ARE YOU SAFE. DO I NEED TO FLY OVER WITH A LASER POINTER TO DISTRACT HER. She sent him a photo of her shoes and the corner of the stage, and then one of the Thames, as if the river might explain something.

That night, jet-lag turning her bones to wet bread, she stood on the bridge and watched the water pretend to be going somewhere. London did its hum. The lights on the South Bank were earnest about themselves. She thought of all the people in the hotel behind her, their throats full of words. She thought of the judges and their faces like weather forecasts. She thought of Saskia, of the way the past kept its own small ledger and added up numbers you hadn’t meant to write down.

She took her phone out because when she didn’t know what to do with her hands she held something else. She wrote to her mother: Saw someone from school — the one who won the big choir thing. Mum wrote back three dots and then, Not that girl who wore pearls with her track pants. Maia laughed and wrote, The very same. Her mother: Oh well. Bake her into a pie. Maia: That’s not how singing works. Her mother: You’re right, I forgot, I’m not the expert, carry on.

In the morning, Lila gave her a schedule with boxes around it like a maze. There was a photo session where she had to smile with her mouth and eyes at the same time, an art she did not possess. There were interviews where she said careful sentences about home and wind and birds and school, and she saw the producers’ eyes light up like they’d found a string to pull. The world liked its stories to be coherent. The world liked to be told, You can put this in that box. Maia was trying not to be a box.

Saskia found her in the cafeteria carrying a plate with a sandwich on it that had ambitions beyond its bread. “So,” she said, sitting at the table with the kind of permission that didn’t ask, “you still do the bird thing. Your video went everywhere. My aunt sent it to me three times, like she discovered it personally. Like she discovered you.” She rolled a grape between her fingers. “It’s good. It’s really good.” The way she said it wasn’t unkind. It was a crown weighed and found appropriate.

“Thanks,” Maia said, warily. The sandwich on her plate was practicing being art. “You’re doing—what are you doing? I heard you’re not a rabbit.”

Saskia laughed. “No rabbits. I’m with a string quartet. I’m singing a Schubert that got a pop arrangement and then got a classical arrangement again. You know how they do. It’ll be dramatic.” She smiled without teeth. “You’ll be fine out there. You always were. God, your hands always shook before you sang. Do they still?”

Maia looked at her hands and found that yes, yes, they still sometimes did. “Less,” she said, lying.

“I used to watch and think, if she can do it with hands like that, there’s hope,” Saskia said, and looked at her in a way that might have been kind. Or something else. “Anyway. See you on the big black bird.”

“Bye,” Maia said, and afterward, she discovered she had eaten the entire sandwich without tasting it.

When she was alone in her dressing room, her face stripped of the layer they had painted on it, she sang to the wall. Quietly. It sounded almost like prayer and almost like practice and almost like panic. The walls didn’t mind. That’s what walls were for. She put her palm against the mirror and imagined it was the skin of the night. The word final lurked somewhere in the corners; she ignored it. She had vowed she would not make this anything but the same small thing she did in her room, alone, when the wind was making the windows say ow.

They were all small things until they weren’t.

She thought of New Zealand, perched back there on the lip of the water, keeping secrets. She thought of her mother’s hands, the way they informed the world of its boundaries. She thought of a point in the hills above the city where you could see three different kinds of blue and each one had an opinion. She thought: When I stand on that stage, I am carrying that place in me like a seed. Like something that is going to root, whether you want it to or not.

That night, she slept like a person who had bought sleep second-hand. It worked but had a faint smell of someone else’s life. She woke at three and wrote in a notebook, because that is what you do when you are trying to tie yourself to the ground. She wrote: Every stage is a hilltop. She wrote: Dad would laugh at this, in a good way. She wrote: If she wins, you won’t disappear. She rubbed those words like a talisman until they were smooth. She wrote: It’s okay to be terrified. She wrote: sing, sing, sing until you are water.

When dawn came it came shyly over the river, pretending not to be a spectacle. Maia made tea and stood at the window. The city inhaled, exhaled. She put on the green dress and it fit like the segment of a dream where you can breathe underwater. Lila arrived and said, “You look like a fern and a secret,” which made Maia feel oddly brave.

On the ride to the theatre, London was exactly as it had been and also smaller, tugged into perspective by the string at her sternum. Lila talked about cues and timings. Everything bracketed around the main event. There were so many doors. So many doors.

Backstage, it smelled like dust and perfume and electricity. The contestants moved around each other like fish in the dark. There were ribs and shoulder blades and nervous laughter. The stage manager had a face like a helpful thundercloud. She said, “Ready, love?” to everyone with equal sincerity.

Ready was a funny word. Ready was a door. Maia stood at the edge of it and put her hand on the handle. She heard the opening bars of another act’s piece and the audience’s appreciative noise like the sea smacking the hull of a boat. She had a brief, absurd vision of her own feet running in the opposite direction. They didn’t.

She laid the loop pedal where it needed to be. The guitar waited, patient as a dog. She looked down at her hands and thought of them as plants: always a little tremble in the leaves.

Her name was called like the first slice into a cake.

She stepped into the lights, and they were bells rung over her. They were too much and just enough. The mouths of the seats opened and the world leaned. She didn’t look at the mouths. She looked at her memory of a hill and a mad wind, and she found the bird in her throat and coaxed it. The first sound she made shook so hard it almost broke. Then it didn’t. It steadied into a line. She laid it down and stepped on the pedal and it began that quiet trick, becoming more of itself.

It was not perfect. There was a breath she took just before the chorus that made a hiss that she hoped the microphones forgave. There was a note that didn’t quite decide which way to tilt. But in the middle she felt something in the air lean toward her, and that was enough. That was everything. It was like catching someone throwing you a bottle of water after a long run, and you drink it without thinking who threw it.

She finished and the clapping did that thing the sea does at the shore: came in hard, then went out, leaving you surprised by your own feet. She bowed because that’s what you do when you’re done pretending you don’t care. One of the judges said something about bravery and originality and a sense of place, words that tasted like TV, and it didn’t matter. Another judge made a light joke about birds signing contracts. She smiled and didn’t sweat.

When she went off they took the guitar gently and set it down on its fake grass. The stage manager put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed, a quick flicker of human. Then there were other people to be shepherded and other doors and the backstage gently forgot her. That was fine. She had a phone in her dressing room with missed calls from the other side of the world like small red mouths going O. She pressed connect and her mother’s face was a square miracle. “You were,” her mother said, and then shook her head. “You were yourself.”

“That’s all I’ve got,” Maia said, and felt the shuddering in her hands lift at last.

She went back into the corridor and almost collided with Saskia, who was in a dress like poured gold. They stopped, friends or enemies or old ghosts, and made room for each other. For an instant they stood so close the air caught between them. “You were beautiful,” Saskia said simply. No tilt. No hook.

“So were you,” Maia said, because she had watched, breath held, and it was true. It was the first and last time the truth would be this uncomplicated.

Outside, the Thames pulled her edges. In the green dress, under the foreign sky, with dust still in her throat, with the day caged around her like a song, Maia felt something open and something else close. She didn’t know which one would matter.

Back at the hotel, the elevator doors swallowed her reflection and spat it back. She stood alone inside and watched herself breathe. For a foolish second she pressed her palms together in the old way of the child who is looking for something to pray to. Then she laughed at herself softly and did it anyway. The laugh was a kind of prayer too.

In bed, she woke to the sound of her own name, except it was just the river hitting the bank. She turned and put a hand over her face, pressing hard as if to hold the pieces in place. In the morning the city would want statements and reactions and rehearsal for the finale’s curtain call. The world would need her to translate what she had just done into something it could eat. Something it could name.

But in the dark, there was only the sound of water pretending to go somewhere and a gull with a grating voice and the inside of her throat, quiet now, full of the echo of a hilltop where the wind kept the memory of a man in a kayak alive, tapping the side with his paddle and saying: Lazy wind. That’s what it is. The kind that goes straight through you. Sweet, listen.

Maia listened. She slept. The city kept breathing around her. And somewhere down a corridor in the same hotel, someone else dreamed too, her mouth relaxed in sleep, her hands open at last. A bell before it is rung. A certain golden innocent. A small, bright firefly at the lip of her heartbeat, whispering the old race awake again.In the morning the city had reset itself with a tidy little click, as if it had been placed carefully back into its box overnight. Maia woke to the sound of rain fidgeting on the window and the hotel’s soft machinery sighing to itself. Her throat felt clean and stunned, like something that had been scraped at by waves and then left glistening. She lay still a minute and let London breathe at her, damp and complicated, and then she reached for the phone as if it were a rope and hauled the day toward her. Lila’s name was already blinking. The message was a bouquet of exclamation marks and logistics and a smiley face that looked exhausted.

By the time Lila knocked, Maia had managed a cup of tea and a notion of composure. Lila carried two paper cups and a bundle of laminated papers that made a murmuring sound, like they were practicing their lines. “We’re doing a press carousel,” she said, with the brisk gentleness of someone shepherding a nervous horse over a small, shiny puddle. “Morning telly, radio, some online things that think they’re telly. A quick slot with a newspaper that will be nice to your mother. Nothing scary. Well. A tiny bit scary. We’ll hold your hand if you want us to. Have you still got your green metaphor?”

Maia had hung the dress up like a fern pressed in a book, too precious to be worn twice without proper ceremony. She pulled on jeans and boots and a sweater the color of moss anyway. “I can take the metaphor in my pocket,” she said, and tucked the pounamu under the collar like a secret you keep on purpose.

The first studio had the disorienting cleanliness of a fridge, lights too polite to be real and a couch pretending to be a living room. A host with gleaming teeth put his hand lightly on her elbow and made a face that tried to look like concern and excitement had had a child. “We adored you,” he said, in a warm, confiding hiss. “America—well, Britain—well, the entire internet—adored you. Tell us about the bird. The tui? Too-ee? We watched a video and it sounded like a robot that fell in love with a flute.”

She laughed because it was easier than explaining any real thing. “Tūī,” she said, pronouncing it like a sip of water. “They’re—noisy, mischievous. They’re better at being themselves than I am.” She made the sound, shyly, a quick double-note and a gurgle that tightened her rib cage and let it go. She watched the faces in front of her rearrange themselves into delight. They liked it when you gave them something small and shiny. She had plenty of small shiny things. She wondered how many she could hand out before she was left with a handful of lint.

Between studios they rode in a car that had been taught good manners and Lila turned in her seat to look at her with a particular sideways sympathy. “If anyone asks you to sing into their mouth,” she said, entirely serious, “you are allowed to say no. If anyone suggests you should be barefoot because it’s ‘authentic,’ I will set fire to their clipboard.”

“Is that an option on the table?” Maia asked. “The clipboard thing. Because it’s tempting.”

“Always,” Lila said, and added, softer, “You did good last night. I know everyone will tell you that, but I’m telling you in case you can hear it from me.”

“I could hear it,” Maia said. “For a minute. Then it dissolved and turned into something else. There was a noise in the air. It felt like—like it bent toward me.”

“That’s the best you can hope for,” Lila said. “That the day tilts and lets you walk downhill.”

The radio studio smelled like dust warmed by old sunlight. A woman with a voice like toast asked her about the wind. “You’ve said it’s your family’s language,” she said, with a curious kindness. “Could you tell us how that sounds?”

Maia told the truth because it was smaller than the other versions. “My dad died when I was thirteen,” she said, and the simple sentence had the weight of a coin you’d kept in your pocket for years. “We used to sit in a kayak and name winds. After he died, my mum and I kept doing it. We said, it’s a lazy wind today, the kind that goes straight through you because it can’t be bothered going around. It’s silly. It helped. It helps.” She said it and felt the word help land in the studio and look around as if asking permission to stay.

When they came back out she had fifteen new messages, all lined up like little birds on a wire, from numbers she knew and numbers she didn’t. Emery had sent three identical texts in a row because the first two had not calmed him down. The first said: You were a forest in a dress. The second said: Mum wants to know if the judges eat before or after the performances because she is concerned about blood sugar. The third said nothing but was an unflattering photograph of himself crying. Her mother had sent a photo of the neighbor’s cat looking disgusted at the screen. Underneath she had typed, She is very proud. Cathy had written, briefly: Independent study approved, also you made Florian cry in Lab 3.

There was one from Brooke, crisp with subtext. We’re fielding a lot of interest. Would you be open to a post-show package that leans into the NZ angle? The team is thinking haka meets loop meets lights, very global, very unity. She read it and felt the skin between her thumb and forefinger itch with a complicated patience. Another message arrived before she could reply, this one like a stone skittering across a pond: Are you comfortable talking about your rivalry with Saskia Vale? The press is keen. There’s a clip from Nationals in 2017 doing the rounds. LMK.

“Of course there’s a clip,” she said aloud. Lila glanced up from her phone with a fox’s alertness.

“Don’t read the comments,” Lila said, with the force of someone who had seen actual skin come off. “Tell me the gist and let me worry.”

“They’ve found an old video,” Maia said. “Of us at school. I cried after she won a thing. It’s the least interesting thing that ever happened and now it’s a story.”

“It already had a story,” Lila said. “Now it has scaffolding. We can decide whether to climb it or kick it down. Do you want to see her today? She’s got a run-through at four. There’s a group rehearsal at five for the finale’s curtain call. They want all the acts on stage for the confetti and the anthem. It’s a whole thing.”

“I can do polite,” Maia said. “I can do more than polite.”

“That’s my girl,” Lila said, and patted her knee, which was ridiculous and exactly what Maia had needed in that second.

They had an hour between appearances, which felt like a fortune. Lila pointed Maia at the river and went to make a call to someone with a calendar for a face. The Thames lay there like a long animal that had forgotten it had claws. The rain had given up for now and left a pearl dullness behind. Maia leaned on the railing and breathed in a smell that was water and diesel and some ancient spice she couldn’t name. A blackbird landed on the low stone wall, and its yellow beak blinked at her, and then it opened its throat and made a sound that could have been a ladder or it could have been a necklace, so pretty it was slightly insincere. She laughed, quietly, and tried to sing it back. The bird cocked its head, offended. Somewhere a gull made an argument with itself and lost.

“You’re fraternizing with the locals,” someone said, and the voice was familiar enough that her shoulders did a small, involuntary square dance. Saskia stopped half a meter away, as if she too were leaning her weight against the river’s idea of itself. Her coat was the color of expensive tea. She had a coffee cup in her hand with her name spelled right on the side, which struck Maia as an accomplishment or a warning. “I saw your radio thing,” she said. “You articulated grief in a way that made my aunt message me again. She thinks she knows you personally. She’s very invested.”

“Tell your aunt I’m fine,” Maia said, on a smile that felt almost like a stretch. “Tell her I eat vegetables.”

“I will,” Saskia said, and then made a face, like a schoolgirl suddenly translated into a woman who could afford to laugh at herself. “They’re pushing it, you know. The story. In case you think it’s just appearing fully formed like Athena. My agent got three calls before breakfast asking if we had any pictures together from choir. I said no. Which was a lie, but—”

“Why?” Maia asked, surprised at herself for wanting the answer.

“Because they want cat claws,” Saskia said, her voice light but her mouth not. “And because I don’t want that picture to be on the internet. The one where our hands are both on the piano and you are looking at the keys like they are a map someone forgot to label. I like that picture. I’m not handing it over so a columnist can write a paragraph about female rivalry and then go home to his dog and feel pleased with his work.”

The relief that fell down Maia’s spine was so clear and cold it made her want to sit down. “I don’t want the claws either,” she said. “I mean. I want my own claws. But not at you.”

“That’s a reassuring sentence,” Saskia said, and then something in her face softened, briefly. “You’s nervous hands,” she said, with uncharacteristic grammatical hesitation, a sheepish correction from the past. “Your hands always shook and I used to think, There’s a person in there. More than the singing. There’s a person. It helped me.”

It was hard to know where to put a sentence like that. Maia held on to the railing and looked at the far bank where buildings had collected like a herd at a watering hole. “Your voice always sounded like a bell someone cleaned and polished every night,” she said. “I resented you for it for about a year. And then I realized I sounded like a bell that had been left in a hedge and found by a child, and that was also fine.”

Saskia shot her a glance that was not unamused. “We could do a thing,” she said, too casual not to be rehearsed. “Just for us. Record it quickly on a phone. Thirty seconds. A hymn you know, a lieder I know. Something that refuses to be put in the box they’re wrapping around us. We post it and say, Look: no teeth.”

“Lila will either kiss me or kill me,” Maia said. “So yes. Let’s do it.”

They found a stairwell that had opinions about humidity and echo and a sign that said NO SMOKING that someone had once tried and failed to peel off. Saskia set her phone on the step, and the world shrank to a rectangle that reflected two girls with tired eyes and the sort of determination that looked like defiance if you squinted. They agreed on a key like you agree on a time to meet at a ferry. Maia started with a short phrase from a waiata she had learned in Primary, the simplest one, her voice bare as a hand. Saskia answered with a Schubert line that felt like someone pouring clean water into a glass. It fit and it didn’t; the friction was the point. Their voices found the small bridge between and stood on it like it would hold. They sang for less than a minute. They stopped and looked at each other and both of them laughed in that way you do when a thing has come out alive and you don’t want to startle it.

“We’ll make enemies,” Saskia said, amused and a little proud, as she typed the caption. No rivalry. Just two women who know the words. M x S. She posted it and put the phone face down and then looked up as if listening for the sound of a fuse. “There,” she said. “Later we can both pretend our teams insisted.”

When the rehearsal call came it came as a bell behind the scene. The theatre’s long throat swallowed them. The stage manager had acquired a megaphone and a gentle authority that could have got an army across a river with nobody drowning. They lined up the acts in an order that made sense to somebody on a whiteboard. A choir of children in silver sneakers chattered like cutlery. A dance troupe in matching tracksuits executed the same stretch with the same solemnity, as if they were a field of wheat. An impressionist tried on voices like hats. Saskia was filed three acts ahead of Maia; she gave a small salute that could have been military or mocking or fond.

“Finale in eight counts,” the stage manager said, and clapped hands that were gnawed by years of rope and tape. “Confetti on four. Don’t inhale it, it’s mostly hopes and plastic. If you do inhale it, cough with commitment.”

Backstage, under the dust and the smell of hairspray and cables, Maia set her pedal on the taped X and took her place. The first sweep of sound came at her like weather. She counted her beats and stepped into it and felt the old thing rise in her throat like a word you remember just in time. She laid her two-bar hum under the string of the anthem they had composed for the end, a safe, shiny melody that had been engineered to fit under headlines about triumph. It sounded, very faintly, like a toothpaste ad. She did it anyway and tried to lace a bit of bird into it where it would not be noticed and not be refused.

At the break, Lila found her with two bottles of water and a sentence that was both preface and apology. “The tabloid went live,” she said. “They’ve gone with ‘The Bell and the Bird.’ It’s not the worst headline I’ve seen, but they’ve pulled quotes from your Year 13 speech about wanting to leave the city and make something useful. They’re painting you as the pure girl against the glitter. It’s lazy. We’re pushing back. Your stairwell video is already doing half the work for us. Seventeen thousand shares. Keep not reading the comments. Also Brooke wants to talk to you about a post-show record thing. If I look like I swallowed a lemon, it’s because I did.”

“I won’t read them,” Maia said, keeping her voice steady and her hands too. “I’ll read my mother instead.”

“Your mother has already emailed the show requesting that the confetti be biodegradable and we will be addressing it,” Lila said, with such formal gravity that Maia started laughing so hard she made herself cough. “You’re changing policies, darling. One recyclable glitter bit at a time.”

In the cafeteria she sat across from a plate she had populated with beige hope and made herself chew. Her fingers were buzzing with a frequency that made cutlery sound like a language she didn’t speak. Across the room the dance troupe laughed in unison like wind going down a pipe. A camera wandered through the tables like a cow, gently marauding. She turned her face slightly and felt ridiculous for wanting to hide and for wanting to be found. The room had a wall of windows and the afternoon light had decided to make an impression of itself on the floor. Saskia dropped into the seat next to her, slid half of a bread roll onto Maia’s plate without comment, and texted her agent under the table with the speed of a trained pianist.

“What does your family think of all this?” Maia asked, because it was easier to ask than to keep thinking about the way the stage sounded underfoot. “Do they—are they watching, or do they pretend to not care?”

“They’re watching,” Saskia said, with a neat shrug that lifted and set down something heavy. “They always watch. They put the television on mute and herds of family friends gather in the living room and make remarks. My mother brings out plates of things that look like food and reflect light like jewels. My father makes comments about the sound engineering while not looking at me. It’s very loving in their way. It’s a lot of love that comes at you like a plan.”

“My mother would bring jam in her handbag if she could,” Maia said. “She’s already tried to mail a cake across the equator. Emery—he’s my flatmate—threatened to write a letter to the airline if I got lost because he’s learned that if you write a letter to an airline you either get ignored or you get a $50 voucher and a sense of your own smallness.”

“Is that the DJ?” Saskia asked, with a curl of smile at her mouth. “The one from your video. He kept referring to you as a show pony in the comments in a way that sounded like love.”

“That’s him,” Maia said, lightly proud. “He is a law student and a chaos engine. He thinks Simon Cowell just needs a sandwich.”

“He’s probably right,” Saskia said. “God, we’re all probably just hungry. Isn’t that the whole thing? We’re all starving and we don’t know what to feed ourselves with.”

Later, in her dressing room, when the corridor noise had calmed to a steady secretarial murmur, Maia opened her notebook. It had acquired a layer of sticky glitter in the spine that would never leave. She wrote without agenda for a page and a half, words that were more like handholds than text. She wrote: I don’t want to be a parable. She wrote: I want to draw a bridge that is strong enough to hold someone else’s weight. She wrote: Blackbird is a liar. She wrote: Saskia is not a storm but she is weather. She wrote: Dad, can you please tell me the names of English winds.

A tap at the door made her flinch and then breathe. Brooke stood there with the glossy aura of someone who has been moisturized by capitalism. She was neat and bright and full of the kind of energy that looks great on spreadsheets. “Can I come in?” she asked, rhetorical enough to be an industry. “Lovely to see you. We’re thrilled. The numbers are excellent. You are a dream.”

“Thank you,” Maia said, letting the courtesy be a cushion. She had learned that if you imagined certain people as boats you could gently tie them to the dock for as long as you needed and then let them go.

“We’re getting calls,” Brooke said, sitting carefully, like chairs were a negotiation. “Labels. A documentary team. There’s talk of a single. We’ve had a conversation about rights on the birdsong elements which we can manage. There’s interest in collaboration. There’s the matter of your university, which we’ll frame as a virtuous conflict—Brains and Beauty, if you’ll forgive me for that indignity. There’s also—and please take this as positively as it’s meant—an appetite for the ‘two girls, one stage’ arc. People are invested in you and Saskia. If there’s a way to—harmonize the narratives, as it were, for the curtain call? A moment where you two are seen embracing, perhaps. Or a little counter-harmony. It reads beautifully.”

“We posted a thing,” Maia said, thinking of the stairwell and the honest echo. “Just us, no permission slips. It was our idea. We’re not biting each other. That’s our narrative.”

Brooke’s smile was professionally delighted, which was a different category of joy entirely. “Precisely,” she said, and her pen made a note that probably said use their authenticity like a ladder. “We’ll amplify. Keep doing that. Be yourselves, but slightly louder. Also there’s a request from a morning programme back home to do a live cross after the result tonight. Are you comfortable with crying on television? Entirely up to you.”

“I am comfortable with crying in supermarkets, corridors, and places with good acoustics,” Maia said. “If it happens, it happens.”

“Perfect,” Brooke said, as if Maia had just agreed to a brand placement. She stood and smoothed her skirt and looked at Maia’s boots with a microsecond of confusion that she hid expertly. “You’re very grounded,” she said, and there was a faint edge of curiosity in it, as if the word had surprised her.

“I’m held up by very specific people and things,” Maia said. “It’s not a personal quality. It’s infrastructure. It’s ferns and jars of coffee and a green scarf I wasn’t supposed to be able to afford and people who say breathe at me like it’s a prayer.”

“Put that in your biography,” Brooke said. “It tests very well.”

Once Brooke was gone, Maia lay down on the carpet and stared at the ceiling. The little craters in the paint made a solar system. On the floor, the smell of backstage was stronger, the electrical tang and the sweetness of some perfume that was trying to be friendly. She thought about being seen and how it made you invisible in a new way, as if the outlines of you had been traced so hard the interior went faint. She thought about pouring herself into spaces until they tasted like her and then walking away.

Time got sensible and pushed her to her feet. She put on the dress again. It slid over her like permission. Her hair did the thing it did when it was trying to be well behaved and was not succeeding, and she let it. She put the pounamu where it always went and felt it settle like a stone in a river that had learned the map of a body a long time ago.

The results show was a circus pretending to be a court. The judges sat like patriarchs and matriarchs and professional aunts. The audience’s noise arrived in predictable waves and still managed to startle. They brought them all out under the froth of confetti and anthem, and while the hosts did their job weaving suspense like a cat’s cradle, Maia concentrated on not inhaling the shiny biodegradable polymer hope. Beside her Saskia stood easy and straight, her hand brushing once briefly against the back of Maia’s, a touch that might have been ballast or accident. The dance troupe looked like a flock. The impressionist looked like a man who had forgotten his own voice somewhere between the stage and the bathroom.

The names of the runners-up were listed in a lump and the camera panned lovingly over each face as if to say, We know what you are thinking, yes, you are all real and dramatic. Maia heard her name and then didn’t, because the wave of cheers rolled over and she was busy keeping her own mouth in the shape of exactly the right smile. She clapped for the others; she clapped for all of them. Her heart did a tidy triple-time that did not match the anthem. When the winner was named, it was the dance troupe, and the noise that rose in the room was the kind that hits the roof and slides down like sugar. They were deserving; they were the story the show had wanted this year; they lifted their leader up on their shoulders and then all of them immediately adjusted for equal weight, which was the part Maia liked best.

A camera went hunting for her face and found it prepared. She had her hands together for a second and then apart, the universal sign of graciousness. Saskia leaned forward and kissed the air near her cheek in a way that both acknowledged the lens and ignored it. They were ushered into a funnel of congratulation and exit and she couldn’t tell whether her feet were on the stage or on something hastily built over water. Backstage, everyone was both happier and relieved, which are not the same state. There were hugs that had the right amount of squeeze and the wrong amount of eyes. A runner with a headset attached to their head like an anglerfish light said, “We need you in the press pen,” and Lila materialized and said, “One breath,” and that one breath saved her.

The press pen was a ruin of lights and microphones and little rectangles that wanted to make her into jpgs. Someone asked how it felt, someone else asked what she would do next, a third asked whether she and Saskia planned to collaborate further, and she said things that were true and things that were polished and tried not to confuse them. She said, “This was a joy,” and “I’m going home to finish a degree because water and bridges don’t build themselves,” and “Saskia is extraordinary,” and “I hope I made the wind proud,” and if she heard the producer’s sigh of pleasure at the last one she refused to give it her attention.

Later, on the call with the morning show back home, the host’s voice was like someone had sprinkled her with sugar. “We have your mum here,” she said, triumphantly, and suddenly her mother’s face was there, larger than strict realism would have allowed, the pixels smoothing her into a version of herself that was barely altered. “Hi, sweet,” she said, and her mouth did a wobble she pretended was laughter. “You looked like you needed a sandwich. Did someone get you a sandwich.”

“I got half a bread roll from a person with perfect hair,” Maia said. “I’ll survive.”

“You did a good job,” her mother said. “You were a person up there. You weren’t a message. That’s the thing I wanted for you. Not for them. For you.”

“I was trying,” Maia said. “It smelled like plastic snow and nervous perfume. It sounded like tides in a room.”

“Fancy,” her mother said. “You can come home and smell the real tide. I’ll take you out to Eastbourne and we’ll let the wind have a go at us. It owes us money.”

After the calls and the hugs and the debrief that was really a rebrief for the next phase, after the makeup wipes and the pins that had been persuading her hair for hours were removed and made into a tiny, accusing pile, after the green dress had been put away like a leaf pressed between pages, after Lila had put a hand on her cheek and said, “I’m so proud I could burst into biodegradable confetti,” Maia found herself at the river again. There were fewer lights now. A man on a bicycle went by and his wheels made the sound of two small saws. The water moved with exaggerated patience, like someone demonstrating how to pour for a child. A blackbird somewhere disapproved of it all and said so, eloquently. She leaned on the rail and let the cold work itself into her wrists.

Saskia came to stand with her as if they had planned it and hadn’t. For a minute they didn’t say anything. The quiet was clean because it had been hard won. When Saskia spoke, she did it without the performance of meaning it. “I didn’t want the trophy,” she said. “Well, of course I wanted it, I’m not a monk. But I wanted—I wanted to know I could do something that didn’t feel like a trick. That had the right weight.”

“Did it feel like that?” Maia asked.

“For three bars,” Saskia said, her smile quick and lit. “It was enough to reverse a small curse. When they said the dancers’ name I felt—honestly, I felt like taking off my shoes and going home. That felt like the next true thing. But then I thought, if I walk home barefoot some idiot will make it into a story, so I stood still and kissed the air like a lady.” She looked at Maia’s hands on the rail. “Do they still shake.”

“Less,” Maia said, and found that it was true. “They stop quicker. I can teach them to behave now. I couldn’t then.”

“You taught yourself a language,” Saskia said. “And then you taught the rest of us how to hear it. That’s a kind of sorcery. A respectable one. Not a rabbit.”

“You’ve got room for sorcery too,” Maia said, and they both made faces at how earnest they were being and then accepted it.

They walked back to the hotel because it felt better than being driven, their heels tapping in and out of rhythm. On Waterloo Bridge a gust of wind knifed through their coats and made both of them hiss. “Lazy wind,” Maia said, and the word sat there like a warm, shared stone between them. “Straight through.”

“That’s a real term?” Saskia asked, and when Maia nodded she laughed, not unmusically. “Of course it is. The British invented weather just so they could talk about it at parties. Lazy wind. It’s perfect. That’s what this is. It goes straight through and leaves you clean.”

In her room, with the city laid out like a sleeping animal, Maia washed glitter out of her hair and watched it go down the drain and worried about the fish. She texted Emery, a long, unpunctuated strand that made its way from pride to hunger to disbelief and back to laundry. He responded with a photograph of a fern under a shower of a hundred tiny paper birds that he had cut out of junk mail and dangled above the plant with string. The caption said: We made confetti. It is compostable. Your people approve. The flat’s smoke alarm went off halfway through the video because someone had made toast.

She lay down and discovered that sleep had gone somewhere else, possibly to the room next door. She got up and sat at the little desk with the bad chair and pulled her notebook toward her and started drawing a bridge. It curled across the page like a vertebrae. Underneath she wrote names: nor’wester. Southerly. Zephyr. Gale. Lazy wind. She added: easterly, nicknamed the doctor, the one that clears the air. She didn’t know if that was right, but she liked the idea of a wind doing anybody any good on purpose. She wrote: Tūī and blackbird are cousins who would fight at Christmas and then forget why. She wrote: This city will not be mine, and that is a relief.

There was a knock, so slight she thought at first it was in the wall. She opened the door and found a note on the carpet with handwriting that had been taught discipline and had kept a little of it. It said: Coffee at ten. No agenda. S. Maia turned the paper over and found that Saskia had drawn a bell on the back and, next to it, a smudgy attempt at a bird. The bell looked immediately like what it was. The bird was a more ambitious shape that got away with itself. Maia was not certain which she preferred.

When she fell asleep at last, it was into a dream that had a river in it and a boat in the middle and her father sitting in the boat tapping the hull with his paddle and not looking at her, which was the most accurate dream she had had in years. He said, without turning his head, “There is a wind that carries things sideways and not forward. Don’t let it trick you. The point is not to go faster. The point is to go where you promised yourself you’d go.” In the dream she didn’t answer him; she just put her hand in the water and felt the cold go up her arm like a blessing and thought, okay.

The morning put its trousers on and showed up. The coffee was in a corner café near the river that had decided to be kind to the early. It smelled like toast and wet wool. Saskia was already there, of course she was, with a scarf that had texture like topographic lines. She lifted a hand and looked like a regular person, which meant she had trained herself exquisitely. They sat, a little awkward because the night had been a machine and the day was a room. A man at the counter read a paper with both hands like it might run away.

“I wanted,” Saskia said, and then paused, which might have been uncharacteristic and might have been performance. “I wanted to say something without it being recorded. It won’t be coherent. That will be a relief.”

“Say your incoherence,” Maia said. “I’ll keep it warm.”

“There was a year,” Saskia said, eyes on her spoon, “I did nothing but win. I won exams and little silver cups and scholarships and the head girl election and a stupid ballot for a hamper with a ham in it that we didn’t even want. I thought that meant I was right. I thought it meant I was a person who moved through the world correctly. I didn’t stop to notice that I was walking in a groove that had been worn before I was born. Then I came here, and the first audition I did in London I didn’t get, and the second one I didn’t get, and the third one I got and then something in me felt damaged by the getting of it because I could feel the part of me they had wanted, which was not a part of me that loved anything, it was a part that looked good in photographs. I have been building a series of small exits since then. I don’t know what the point of that story is. Maybe I wanted to confess I am tired of being good at things that aren’t mine.”

Maia listened, and the listening felt like standing still while wind went past and not apologizing for it. “I am not as good as you at winning,” she said, without bitterness. “I got good at losing in a way that you don’t get trophies for. That did something to how I make sound. Sometimes I think the point is we got the energy moving. Between us. If it isn’t a tide, it’s a current. You moved it here, I moved it there. We can both quit any time and the current would still have moved. It’s a comfort, weirdly.”

“It’s not weird,” Saskia said. “It’s adult. I don’t have much practice.” She looked up, sharp and amused. “We’ll make something together that isn’t for anybody but us,” she said, not as a question. “Later. Not now. Now is busy. Later when the noise has gone to find someone more amenable. Something with no caption. Maybe something with a kitchen table that has crumbs on it and someone’s knee bumping someone else’s knee by accident.”

“Okay,” Maia said, and they grinned at each other across the cups like people who had named a thing and in so doing had made it inevitable.

The rest of the day took them both by the elbow and steered them toward the next obligations. Lila collected Maia with a list that was long enough to cross the street by itself. They went to a secondary wardrobe fitting for a talk show that wanted her to wear blue because the set was green and the green would be jealous. They practiced being coy without becoming dishonest. They went to a tiny studio with a carpet that made their feet feel famous and she sang eight bars into a microphone that had absorbed more confessions than a church. The producer wanted her to say I could never have imagined this at least three times. She said it once, because it was true once. She said other things afterward that were truer.

When Lila walked her back toward the hotel, the sky above the river had turned the color of a bruise deciding whether to fade. Lila’s phone buzzed like a guilty conscience. “Oh,” she said, reading, and then her face turned into a curtain being drawn aside. “Your stairwell video. It’s everywhere now. That’s the sentence everybody says and it’s almost never true, but this time it is. A choir teacher from Invercargill has written a thread about harmony and care. A drag queen in Manchester has duetted it wearing a bell on one ear and a sparrow on the other and it is…formally exquisite. The tabloid has grudgingly conceded that you are not at war. They will be sending you baskets. Do not eat the melon. It’s always bad.”

“Victory,” Maia said, dry as a slice of toast, but her chest did a small private expansion. It wasn’t about the numbers. It was about the way some parts of the world had tilted toward gentleness because of thirty seconds in a stairwell. That was more power than she wanted, more responsibility than anyone should be awarded by an app, but it was also, simply, good.

Back upstairs, she ignored the bed, sat on the carpet again because it was becoming a ritual, and took out her loop pedal and her little travel speaker. She balanced the pedal on a room service menu and pretended the ugly lamp was a tree. She laid down a low tone as if she were seeding a cloud. She tried the blackbird again and failed honestly and then tried a robin and did better, and then she sang a line she had written on the plane without test-driving it: I am a hill you stand on when the city forgets your knees. It sounded earnest and absurd and also correct. She looped it and then stacked another line on top: Maybe the wind is a letter we forgot to open. She listened to the two lines argue gently and then kiss.

She stopped. She sat back. The quiet contained shape now, as if the notes had made a nest that the silence was happy to occupy. Her phone lit up and she ignored it for the length of two heartbeats because her father would have laughed at that lack of discipline. Then she looked and found a message from Emery, a photo of himself wearing her scarf and a piece of paper taped to the wall that said BREATHE BUT DON'T OVERDO IT in cheerful block letters, and below that, small and uncharacteristically sober, he had typed, You did a brave thing and you did it while being you. Please come home so I can make you terrible coffee and we can talk about birds like old men.

She texted back, I’ll bring you a superior British biscuit. He replied with a gif of someone crying while eating a biscuit, which seemed about right.

Sleep came like a cat that had forgiven her for shutting the door earlier. In the night she woke once to a sound that might have been the river and might have been someone crying in the room next door and then it was neither. In the morning she dreamed she was standing at the top of Makara hill and the wind was in her jacket and her shoes were full of dust and the city was far enough away to be the idea of a city, and her father was not in the dream but her mother was, and she was younger than she had a right to be and she said, You drew a bridge in your book. Someone should walk across it. When Maia woke she remembered that sentence in her bones. She made tea and thought about the promise you make to yourself when you are twenty-one and the one you make when you are thirteen and how sometimes you keep both without ever quite understanding what you kept.

At the airport two days later a woman in a high-vis vest whispered, “I saw you, my sister cried,” in the exact tone people usually used to tell you where the bathroom was. Lila hugged her quickly and properly and did not cry because Lila probably had arrangements with her tear ducts. “Go home,” she said. “Let them carry you around the kitchen. Write to me when you want to come back because you’ve remembered that microphones are just metal flowers and you can talk into them without becoming one.”

On the plane, Maia watched the line of the flight creep across the map and thought about lines, about what they did and didn’t do. She thought about rivers and about noise and about whether you could put a city in a pocket and keep it from breaking. She looked out the window and saw nothing but cloud and the idea of cloud, and then she slept, and the sky carried her like a joke that keeps being funny, and when she woke the sea was a silver skin and the hills were the lamb bones of home laid down where she’d left them, patient and righteous, and the wind was already out there somewhere naming itself.The wind met her on the airport tarmac like a relative who hugged too tight and then pretended it hadn’t. Even inside the glass, you could hear it testing each seam, thinking about mischief. Maia stood by the baggage carousel that was pretending to be a river and watched the same black suitcase go around three times. Her guitar came out last, accompanied by a plastic pram and an elderly man’s fishing rod tube, and she took it like a sleeping animal and kissed it on the case because she was tired and sentimental and because nobody here knew her name unless they did.

Her mother had made a sign because of course she had, except it wasn’t a sign as much as it was a strip of brown paper with BREATHE scrawled across it in green crayon. Emery was holding the other end and making faces like a mime who’d taken a wrong turn. He wore a jacket that should have been retired to the theatre department and a scarf that might have belonged to a clown. Behind them, Wellington hunched in its jacket, the sea smoothed itself to look harmless, and the hills stood up as if taking attendance.

“You look like the international terminal,” her mother said, which could have meant anything and somehow meant exactly the right thing. She smelled of rain and lemon and a faint thread of hair dye.

“I brought you a biscuit,” Maia said, producing a packet from her backpack like a magician too honest to make it impressive. “It has a French name which means we are not allowed to be disappointed.”

“I will be disappointed in private,” her mother said, and tucked the packet under her arm like contraband.

Emery took the guitar without being asked and then hefted it as if to measure its mood. “You’re back,” he said, and there was so much relief in it that it made the fluorescent lighting feel like sunlight. “The fern and the secret are home. We tried to tidy. We argued with the smoke alarm. The smoke alarm won.”

The flat had not changed and also it had, the way a room does when you leave it and come back to find that it has learned one new trick and is proud of it. There was a line of paper birds above the fern, cut from junk mail and suspended with clear tape. There was a sign above the kettle that said BREATHE BUT NOT OVER THE STEAM in Emery’s block capitals. The couch had acquired one new cushion with an opinion. The air smelled like stale coffee and clean laundry and the faint persistence of the curry that had become a legend and a caution.

Her room looked like it had been holding its breath. The bed had made itself reconsiderably. The plant on the windowsill had forgiven her for leaving because the lab had remembered to water it. The green dress hung on the back of the door like a pressed leaf, and seeing it there made her feel as if she had been two people for two weeks and had to reacquaint them.

They ate jam on toast with the television on mute, watching a morning show’s captions crawl earnestly along the bottom of the screen. The phone on the table buzzed like a trapped bee and she turned it face down because power could be that simple for at least ten minutes. Her mother kept looking at her like you look at something that had gone far away and then had the grace to return as if it had only been to the dairy.

“Tell us everything,” Emery said, then immediately corrected himself. “No, tell us one thing that is not a story anyone else has asked for yet.”

“There was a blackbird that sang on the river wall,” Maia said, without thinking, and the sentence settled in the room with the ease of an umbrella leaning against a door. “It sounded like it was applying for a job. It made an argument for its own competence. It was very persuasive.”

Her mother laughed and then covered her mouth because she was being polite to the neighbors’ morning. “He always gets fixed on one note,” she said, in that odd past-present voice she used for her husband. “Then he finds the note two over, like he’s fallen over it and wants you to know it was intentional.”

When she woke in the middle of the first night home, it was because the wind had lifted a corner of itself and peered in at the window. She lay still and listened to it say the names her father had taught them, half in memory and half in wish. Lazy wind, she thought, because her feet were cold. Nor’wester because everybody’s hair would be unfixable tomorrow. Southerly, because the cat two doors down would be under someone’s bed, feral with weather. She went back to sleep with the sound of a gull doing its grating comedy routine over the street and dreamed that the bridge she had drawn had learned to walk on its own legs.

In the morning, the internet had arranged itself into applause and advice and a thread of malice as neat as a ribbon. Lila had sent a message consisting of a sun emoji, a fern, and a sentence about how Brooke had decided to become a better person overnight but would forget by lunch. Brooke had sent a message in which the words opportunity and timing occurred enough times to make a rhythm and then, as an afterthought, a question: Could you be in Auckland for a segment next week? We’ll fly you, we’ll house you, we’ll make it tidy. Maia wrote back, politely, that bridges and water did not pause for television and that she had promised herself a week of being a person in a small city before she turned into anybody’s content. It felt like putting a hand on a door and testing whether it would swing back on its hinges and behave.

Cathy called. There was nothing ceremonious about it; her voice came down the line like the bell on a bicycle, quick and checking you were there. “Back?” she said. “How are your feet? Do you need to sit in a lab and look at water behaving?”

“Yes,” Maia said, with the relief of someone admitting to an ordinary joy. “Yes, please. Do you have a spare pair of gumboots and a small emergency Mars Bar?”

“Always,” Cathy said. “We’re in the flume all afternoon. Florian has been conducting experiments on how many cups of instant noodles can clot an intake, which I have pretended not to sanction. Bring your brain. Bring your tired. We will give both something to do.”

The lab greeted her with the kind of fuss reserved for a stray cat that has decided you are acceptable. There were handshakes and a hug from someone who had sworn never to be sentimental and a chorus of inappropriate bird noises that attempted to be welcoming and mostly were. The flume glided on its rails like a small, uncommitted river. Someone had stuck googly eyes on the motor housing and now the apparatus was a creature with a secret. But the water was what she wanted; the water did its orderly disorder; it ran toward the lowest point like a law. She stood with one hip against the edge, gumboots on, and watched dye spiral where eddies forgot themselves.

“We did your daydream,” Florian said, handing her a clipboard with illegible enthusiasm. “The stepped weir. We built it from the cheap wood your flatmate uses to stop his door closing. Fish like it. The little plastic ones do. The code says a trout will like it too. We need someone who is not me to tell me whether I have cheated by making the river like me more than I deserve.”

Maia bent over the model and the numbers with an attention that felt like a clean shirt. The world narrowed to the useful. What was happening happened at scales she could understand and touch: Reynolds numbers and scour, velocity profiles like small alphabets laid on their sides. She remembered being nine, sitting in a kayak with a row of buoys ahead like a sentence waiting for its verbs, and her father tapping the hull to let her know where the depth changed. The thought made her heart behave in two ways at once and she let it. She pointed to a section of little baffles, to the line where the dye hit and folded back on itself. “You’ve made a stepping stone without giving it a hard edge,” she said. “A fish can rest in that curl. You’ve drawn a lullaby. We need to test it with the flow turned up. See if she sings in a flood.”

The ordinary day gathered around her like a cloak. It was exactly what she had wanted for herself before the theatre had opened its mouth and stolen a week of air. She didn’t mind that the fluorescent lights made everything equal. She didn’t mind the smell of noodles clinging to the corners. She forgot to check her phone. When she did, during a sandwich hour that was more like a negotiation, there were three missed calls from a number she didn’t know and one email from a name she didn’t recognize, with a subject line that slowed her chest the way a good surprise can.

Kia ora, it said. I am writing as a member of our marae committee and because my niece made me watch your London thing on a phone so small I had to squint. Come and have a cup of tea with us if you want. Bring your mum. Bring the song you carry. We can talk about birds and about whose voices belong where. Not to tell you off. To make it straight before someone else tries to make it crooked. Nā, Aroha.

She read it twice and then a third time and then let it sit just above her heart like a new seed that had asked nicely and might be accepted. She had known the conversation was coming because if you put something of the world into your mouth and sing it back, you should expect to be asked who you got it from and whether you said thank you. She had tried to be careful, to not use words that weren’t hers, to keep the birds themselves bigger than any idea of them. Still, the voice in her from a thousand small warnings said: Don’t be arrogant, bird girl. This is not a story about you. It was such a relief to be invited instead of corrected that the inside of her eyes stung.

“Problem?” Cathy asked, glancing up from the flume with that sideways professor look that pretended to be casual.

“An invitation,” Maia said. “A kind one. I’ll take it with both hands.”

The marae sat on a small rise close to the river, as if it had leaned over to listen and then decided to stay where the water could hear it too. The meeting house had a face that watched you arrive without suspicion. The air smelled like kai, slow and sensible, and the paint on the verandah was an old kind of red. Maia’s mother wore her polite shoes and a green dress that made her look like a gardener on her way to an awards ceremony. Maia wore her jeans and a clean sweater and the pounamu at her neck and the feeling of being a good guest draped over her shoulders like a new coat.

They were welcomed in and given chairs that had opinions about spines. Aroha was a woman with her name squarely in her face, mid-fifties maybe, with a kind of competence that meant she could lift anything that needed lifting and would honor you by not making a fuss about it. There were others, a row of aunties who knew the weather better than any forecaster, an uncle whose silence had respect built into it, a young man with ink that told a story under his sleeves. They gave their names and their places like you lay a table. Maia felt the old ritual shape the room like hands make a loaf.

“We watched,” Aroha said, when the tea had warmed everyone and the biscuits had done their small, sweet work. “We were proud. We were wary. We were delighted. It is possible to be all those things and not break in half. We wanted to say it to your face and not have you find it out from a column by a clever person who doesn’t know where they are standing.”

“Thank you,” Maia said, feeling sixteen and forty and exactly her current age. “I’ve been talking to the river this week to get my voice back in a regular size. I wanted to come before the world makes this into something that hurts us. And to say, if I’ve stepped where I shouldn’t—if I have anything to give back—if there is a way to keep singing and not make a mess—tell me. I’ll do it. I’ll listen.”

“The tūī didn’t sign a contract,” one of the aunties said, dry enough to light a fire with. “But they are ours in a way that is bigger than any piece of paper. They belong to themselves. They belong to this place. When you carry the sound of them into a room with cameras, you carry us whether you mean to or not. You did it with respect. You didn’t chew it. That matters. Still, we like to know where we are in your mouth. We like to hear our names before other people hear our names and decide what they mean.”

“I understand,” Maia said, because she almost did. She said, “I don’t sing words that aren’t mine. I never would. But I… I wanted to carry the sound of home so I wouldn’t be a shell when I got there. If there’s a koha I can make, if there’s kaitiakitanga you want me to acknowledge, I—yes.”

“Good,” Aroha said, and smiled with one side of her mouth because the other side was busy listening. “We thought you might say that. Put your money where your talk is. If money comes for you, let some of it go where it will plant trees and hire a bloke with a chainsaw to cut the old willow out of the stream and pay a kid to test the water for a science credit. And before you go and do a big haka with neon lights because a man in a suit tells you it will sell well in Germany, come and ask if we want to be in that room with you and whether we think the lights are ugly. That’s all. Come for a cuppa now and then. We’ll keep an eye on you. Not to catch you out. To keep the wind in the right paddock.”

They ate scones that were stern with butter. They talked about gulls stealing chips straight from hands, and about school choir competitions that took small girls and made them ambitious and then confused, and about the way tūī sometimes imitate the sound of a wire brushing a fence, which is funny until you realize why it’s in their mouth. They showed her the carving on the wall that had a bird beak hidden in the koru, and she put her hand out and did not touch and felt it anyway. Her mother told an old story about a jam competition and an even older story about a storm that had peeled the roof off a shed in the night like an orange. The young man with ink turned out to be an ecologist who had strong opinions about fish passes and a laugh that made everybody else's laugh show up. When Maia left, she felt taller and more held. She also felt the specific weight of having been given instructions by people whose Christmases you wanted to be invited to for the rest of your life.

On the walk back to the car, the wind did a small dance at their knees. “That was a good room,” her mother said, keeping her voice low as if the room could hear them. “We’ve been in some bad rooms. That was a good one.”

“I’m going to write to Brooke,” Maia said. “I’m going to write to her and tell her I won’t do the haka thing she wanted. I’m going to tell her why. If she thinks I’m being difficult, that’s fine. I’ll be as difficult as a hill.”

“I’ll bring scones,” her mother said, solemn as a weather report.

She wrote the email at the kitchen table with her pounamu lying cool against her skin and the jam jar doing its best to act like paperweight. It was a careful letter without being apologetic. She didn’t use big-fight words; she used words that made furniture and asked people to sit down. She explained what Aroha had said. She told Brooke that she would work with people here if there was to be anything that wore Māori names. She wrote that culture was not a playlist. She sent it and felt the small, clear rush that comes when you put a fence back where it had been pulled up.

Brooke replied with a phone call that almost crackled with the effort she was making. “Thank you,” she said, very crisp. “The team was enthusiastic. I am recalibrating enthusiasm into respect. We will park that idea. We will do something that fits in the mouth without making it choke. Your stairwell video has done some of the recalibration for us, by the way, which I am grateful for. You and the other one—Saskia—what you did, it was useful.”

“It wasn’t intended to be useful,” Maia said. “It was intended to be kind. But I don’t mind if it worked.”

“Kindness tests very well,” Brooke said, and then so quickly Maia almost missed it, “I am glad you’re being particular. We need more particular. Too many of us are general.”

After she hung up, she wrote to Saskia because the impulse came warm and didn’t ask permission from any of her better instincts. She wrote: We had scones and a small telling-off that felt like being put on a horse properly, not like being slapped with a newspaper. Also, we are not neon. Saskia wrote back almost immediately, a photo of her face under a towel with the caption: I am doing my penance in a sauna and thinking about bells that live in hedges. Neon is for lies. I’ve booked a flight in three months to your side of the world for something unrelated and now, suddenly, related. Kitchen table. Crumbs. We will make a mess deliberately.

She walked up to the ridge above the suburb that afternoon because it felt like the exact size of adventure she could afford. The track kinked and tucked itself between manuka and the odd gorse that had got overenthusiastic before someone disciplined it. The city laid itself out not like a boast but like a child who has made a diorama of its bones. The wind was not lazy; it was busy, finding all the holes in the story and walking through them. At the top, she chose the same rock she always had, as if to see if it remembered her. A tūī coughed its syrupy cough from a nearby coprosma and then decided to be two different instruments at once and she grinned at the audacity.

She set the loop pedal down on the flattest bit of dirt she could find and the guitar on her knee, and for a moment she did nothing except hold the two and be the person holding them. Then she hummed, low and level, the simplest tone, and let it be long enough that her bones remembered their size. She stacked a third above it, then another, small chords that did not demand attention so much as invite it to sit quietly for a moment. When she was ready, she let the bird join. Not the tūī; she didn’t want to make it a game. A fantail’s flicker, instead, a small bright decoration to a line that had already agreed to be itself. The wind caught the sound and pulled it thin and made it wider and then handed it back with a look that said, See? You are small. It’s good for you. Two strangers coming down the hill stopped and listened as if they couldn’t help it. A dog sat as if someone had said the word. She finished and the strangers clapped their hands into their pockets and then out again, as if they had forgotten how to do it properly, and one of them said, “Mean,” which in Wellington is a benediction as reliable as any.

The next weeks were full of bite-sized fame and errands. In the supermarket, a woman near the apples said, “My niece showed me your thing,” and then in the same breath, “Have you tried the new oat milk? It’s watery,” and Maia said she had and it was. In the street, someone yelled “Bird girl!” not unkindly and then tripped on a dog’s lead and went crimson. Her high school music teacher sent a strongly worded email about breath support and pride, ending with a confession that she had stolen a poster of Simon Cowell from the assembly hall because she didn’t want his face watching her pupils rehearse. Someone in the council wrote asking whether she would consider performing at an event to announce a stream daylighting project, and she wrote back: Yes, if I can also talk about stormwater management and if there’s a budget line for a kid with a clipboard. They said, real, thoughtful yeses are rare in our inbox, thank you, and offered her a slot between a brass band and a woman who could carve your face out of balsa wood in under five minutes.

Emery acquired a booking to play a set in a student bar that had decided it wanted to feel more cultured than it naturally was. He practiced at three in the morning until the smoke alarm cried for mercy and the fern looked judgmental. “It’s your fault,” he said, taking off his headphones and addressing her from the kitchen doorway like a town crier. “They think my proximity to your artistry has rendered me competent. I must disappoint them. Will you come and be my hype man. Will you stand behind me and nod like an apostle.”

“I will stand next to you and drink water and be critical of your snare choices,” she said, and he put a hand to his heart and said she was cruel and just.

The night of the set, the bar smelled like sweet beer and old ambitions. Students with hair full of exams shouted at each other as if their mouths had to run ahead of their feet. Emery wore a shirt he had ironed in theory and played a series of beats that sounded like the city chewing on a piece of tinfoil and enjoying it. He sampled a ruru call and a man in a hoodie cried out WHOA in a tone of reverence usually reserved for miracles and goal kicks. Maia stood behind him and nodded like an apostle and let herself feel young, which is a gift and a choice and sometimes a punishment. Someone asked for a selfie and then was so embarrassed about having asked that they brought her a plate of curly fries as penance. She ate two and ceremoniously handed the rest to Emery like a trophy.

She went back to the lab in the mornings and the flume gave her something to hold that was not a microphone or an idea of herself. She drew cross sections and brought a pencil down on cheap graph paper with a love that surprised her. She walked along real streams with a tape measure, knee-deep in water cold enough to teach manners, and watched how the banks fell in, how an old tire made an eddy where once a stone had been. In meetings with council people who wore suits with small stains near the cuff, she said, “We can do it without hurting the city,” and “We can make a place where a person in a white shirt can eat lunch and a fish can go home,” and “Pay the teenagers for their counting; their brains are not free.” Cathy watched her with an expression that suggested she ought to say I told you so but would not, because it is a joy to see someone find both their tongues.

Sometimes, late, she and her mother sat on the deck wrapped in blankets while the wind did trumpet practice in the dark. The day would have been full of messages and meetings and the precious neutrality of shopping for rice. In the black, their voices came out clearer, as if they had been rinsed. “Your father,” her mother would say, and then pause at the edge of that, not in sadness now but as if the word were a pond you put your toe in to gauge the depth. Sometimes they told a story about him, and sometimes they named the winds and got into an argument over whether the last one was a southerly’s child or a stranger that had come in for tea and stayed too long. Sometimes they simply sat, companionable as dogs.

The morning the courier arrived with a basket from a tabloid, she laughed so hard she had to lean on the sink. It contained a melon that had tried and failed to be ripe, a pineapple with a personality, three kinds of chocolate that would have offended a child, and a handwritten card that said: We concede you are not at war. In biro, someone had added: The melon is terrible, sorry. She took the basket to the marae with a note that said: We have a surplus of bad fruit and absurdity, please take what is useful and compost the rest. Aroha sent back a photo of the pineapple crowning the tea counter like a jester and a message: We’ll make jam of the apology. Bring jars.

On a Tuesday, Saskia appeared on her phone in a clip from the other side of the world in a dress the color of thunderheads, singing a thing so clean it made Maia want to smack a wall in appreciation. The comments were a small choir of delight and pettiness; she didn’t read them. She sent a row of bells and a sparrow and a sentence that said, You made the air decide it should try harder. Saskia replied with a selfie in a supermarket next to a pyramid of inferior tomatoes and a caption: Fame is buying vegetables that lie. Soon.

The council event took place in a patch of grass that wanted to be a park but was still a field that remembered sheep. There was a temporary stage that had opinions about heels and a brass band that was delighted by its own existence because their trombone player had returned from a mysterious absence. Kids ran in unpredictable parabolas. An old man asked a question about rates with the intensity of a final exam and was offered a brochure with sincerity. Maia stood up and said, into a mike that squealed once and then apologized, that rivers could be convinced to be themselves again, that it took money and time and neighbors being nagged into showing up, that it involved pulling pipes out of the ground and making space where space had been stolen, that it was not romantic so much as it was relentless. She sang a two-minute thing because the programme said she ought to. She used a bird in it because the kids would be bored without an animal. A girl near the front wore a high-vis vest that had been cut down to her size and held a clipboard like a sceptre. That girl shook her ponytail in time and it was, of all the applause that day, the one Maia felt in her actual bones.

That night she and Emery built a model of a bridge out of ice block sticks and glue at the kitchen table because her brain needed to feel wood in her fingers. They argued about where the loads wanted to go and whether the glue counted as a material that could be calculated. He got bored and turned the sticks into a small triangle that he insisted was a motif that would make the critics weep. She listened to the glue cure and thought about strength in places that didn’t look like strength anymore. “What if,” she said, tracing the curve of a span with a finger, “it looked like a fern’s backbone. Light but stubborn. The kind of thing that says, I have seen wind and I am not impressed.”

“It will make people feel better when they walk over it,” Emery said, unexpectedly grave. “Like being held up by a plant, not by maths. Even though the maths is the thing.”

“The maths is a plant too,” she said, and he rolled his eyes and told her she had been hanging out with people who used metaphor the way some people use salt.

The summer began to tilt toward its late honesty. The wind, in a moment of politeness, let a day lie still on its back, and the sea in the harbor looked like something you could peel. She went down to the water and watched an old man in a bucket hat argue with a gull like they had a schedule for it. She thought about the strange efficient brutality of the past months and about the long, necessary slowness of the work that had claimed her before and had reclaimed her now. She thought about the kitchen table across an ocean with crumbs on it and a bell drawn on a note and the way two voices can lean toward each other and share a beam without losing their own weight.

In the afternoon, an email slid into her inbox as if it had been greased by a marketing team. The subject line said: Documentary proposal: the hill, the river, the girl. She sighed because it was not anyone’s fault that the world had made a category out of her, but also it was a little bit somebody’s fault. She read the pitch, which was full of good intentions and some words that made her teeth itch. She closed the laptop and called Lila and said she would only be filmed if they also filmed a meeting about an intake screen and a working bee where a kid lost a gumboot and laughed so hard he cried. Lila said, “Sensible. I’ll tell them they must get their camera dirty or it doesn’t count.” Brooke texted a single thumbs up emoji and a sentence about aligning values, which, to her credit, she might even have meant.

That evening, her mother found her on the deck with the wind in attendance and handed her a cup of tea that had achieved the correct color. They sat and let the light take its hands off the day. “The easterly’s doctoring,” her mother said, tilting her chin toward the water where it made a small opinionated ripple. “You can feel it pushing the world tidy.”

“I’ll take it,” Maia said. “I’ve been messy. I am due a small order.”

“You can’t stay home forever,” her mother said, without any sting. “The world is rude and full of microphones, but there are rooms you should walk into. Just remember you were capable before they asked you to be.”

“I’ll remember,” Maia said, and meant it. “When I go, come with me as far as the gate and then go back in and put the kettle on and answer the phone with your voice like a lighthouse. I’ll be back before the water forgets my name.”

They named the winds again because it was a way of sweeping the day. They found lazy, because it had come under the eaves without knocking. They found zephyr, because it was daft and sweet. They argued about southerly like always and left it undecided, because it liked to be. When they went inside, the fern paper birds swayed on their invisible lines and the small model bridge held its own delicate span over nothing much, and in the cramped kitchen Emery had left a note on the fridge that said: BREATHE, BUT ALSO EAT THE LAST YOGHURT OR IT WILL BECOME A CULTURE.

Maia laughed, and the laugh settled in her chest like a bird that had chosen a particular tree. The city breathed around them. Somewhere a blackbird combed one note until it shone. Somewhere across the world, a bell sounded itself in an empty room just to hear if the air would agree. And the wind, doing its volunteer work, went straight through them and left them cleaner.Three weeks of ordinary days fit around Maia like a sweater that had been washed enough times to remember her elbows, and then the weather decided to make a point. The forecast was full of diagrams that looked like children’s drawings of monsters and the word southerly kept creeping into the captions with the self-importance of a relative who knew they were going to be the protagonist whether you invited them or not. People at the bus stop did that thing Wellington does where it pretends it isn’t worried while pulling their hats down in a way that suggests a silent pact. In the lab, the air felt like it had been plugged in, and Cathy stood with her hands in her pockets and tilted her head in a way that meant she was measuring something you couldn’t put on a chart. “Flood watch by evening,” she said, not quite happily, not quite anxious, and the flume pretended to be above caring while its motor made a sound like a throat clearing before a speech.

Maia found herself in her flat with a roll of duct tape, a box of candles that had been purchased during a misguided attempt at hygge last winter, and the peculiar maternal urge to make soup for the entire street. Emery had tacked the emergency list back on the fridge under a magnet shaped like a trout and was reciting their plan in a tone of voice meant to be calm and therefore not calm at all. He said they would fill the bathtub, and they would check on Mrs. Ng in the downstairs unit who always said she was fine and meant she required someone to move the heavy plant stand, and they would put the loop pedal on the couch instead of the floor in case the carpet tried to turn into a pond. Maia nodded while taping the windows in a superstitious crosshatch she knew did nothing but occupied her hands. Her mother texted photographs of the old shed in the back garden with captions like: The roof is a gentleman about this. In reply, Maia sent a picture of a pot of soup and wrote that chickpeas were heroic under pressure and that if the power went she would sing into the dark until it changed its mind.

By late afternoon the sky had lowered itself like a ceiling being renovated while you were still living in the house. The first heavy drops arrived with the self-importance of percussionists who had been given their own entrance. In the stream behind their street, which in normal weather behaved like a polite rumour, water began to gather itself into a conversation that was going to get loud. At the marae, people were moving quietly from room to room with that particular choreography of experienced families, checking torches and tea supplies and finding where the buckets had hidden. Aroha sent Maia a message that said, in the same permanent-marker briskness as always, We’re a safe place if you need it. Bring whānau, bring soup, bring your sensible shoes. Maia wrote back that she was on her way to the council store to get sandbags and that if Aroha had spare old-man wisdom she would take that too.

The sandbag handout was a lesson in polite panic. Council workers in high-vis vests used voices like schoolteachers who were pretending they didn’t know this many people had been invited. A man in a suit tried to carry four at once and almost fell into a decorative hedge; a teenager with a buzzcut and an earnest stare took two he hadn’t been assigned and then followed him just in case. Maia signed for a number that felt like a small apology to the river and carried them in pairs with her arms doing that good hurt that felt like summer hockey practice across a small hill. Emery made a joke about gains that no one could hear over the rain. Mrs. Ng opened her door and said in the voice she used when she agreed to nothing, You are good children, and let them stack the bags where the water liked to flirt with her doorstep. She showed them the candles she had saucered properly, and they resisted the urge to laugh because sometimes dignity arrived wrapped in a doily and you didn’t question it.

By night, the storm got personal. The wind worked at the gaps in the world like a child prying up a sticker, and the rain employed itself thoroughly. The power gave an impression of moral character by staying on in the houses with fairy lights and going out in the houses that had remembered to boil eggs. Maia’s phone trilled a civil defence alert with a vibrating authority that made her heart switch to a different history of itself. The message told her to stay home unless she was needed, to check on neighbours, to keep away from floodwaters because they are dirty and convincing. In response, the stream at the end of the street, which was normally a suggestion, climbed onto the road with the baffled confidence of a person who has walked into the wrong party and decided to stay out of bloody-mindedness.

At the lab, a late-night text thread sprang up where people used the language of equations to say they were worried and the language of gifs to say they loved each other. Cathy said she was staying with the flume like a captain with a sentimental ship. Florian announced he was down at the daylighting site with a head torch, because his idea of romance was watching stormwater find its newly uncovered way. Maia looked at the photo he sent of the water swollen and proper and felt her two selves step neatly into the same pair of gumboots. She kissed her mother’s forehead in the damp doorway and promised not to attempt heroics that would make the six o’clock news in a way that would cause anyone to say the word reckless, then pulled on a raincoat that had argued with gorse in a previous season and lost, and went out into air that was trying to turn everyone into an instrument.

The daylighting site was a strip of newly honest earth where a pipe had been persuaded to stop pretending it was a river. In daylight on a kind day, it looked like a scar that had made peace with itself. In the storm it looked like a line of argument. Volunteers were clustered at the edge wearing waterproofs that belonged to various decades and carrying shovels that had been found in garages and pressed back into service after taking early retirement. The council engineers wore expressions that combined maths with fatherhood, and a woman from communications was standing under a giant umbrella saying words like optics and then catching her own ridiculousness and helping move a barricade. The water came in high and chocolate, carrying leaves and small insults, and tested every new curve the designers had drawn as if grading an assignment.

“Glad you could come,” Florian shouted, which in the rain sounded like a man calling a dog with a very complicated name. “We’re within design parameters. It’s doing what we asked. But we’ve got a grin where we drew a straight mouth just above the bend, and we’re going to give it a temporary tooth so it doesn’t chew the bank.”

“Geotextile and stakes?” Maia said, and the relief at talking in a language half the city couldn’t hear was so sharp she had to grin because there were three kinds of love and this was one of them. “And some brush. Pull the flow off the bare patch. The kids planted too shallow there; the roots haven’t had time to do their magic trick.”

Everyone put their hands to it with that eager clumsiness people get when they’ve decided they can be useful and don’t care about getting ugly, and the river tolerated them the way a cat tolerates a toddler that hasn’t learned the proper pressure. The geotextile went down, the stakes went in, the brush angled itself with a kind of grace. A man with a poetry band T-shirt worked next to a woman with a council badge and a hair braid that had earned its right to exist, and the water’s line turned a fraction and then another, obeying the laws that had always been gravity’s favourite jokes. A car came too fast down the road adjacent and did the panicked ballet of a near skid; Emery, who had arrived with a bungee cord and no clear plan, stepped into its path with a hand up and that theatrical bravery he reserved for occasions that might get him yelled at, and the driver swore and obeyed and then apologized.

By two in the morning, the storm had given up being a drama and settled into the long work of insisting. The daylighting site held. The new banks got their education and did not collapse. The little plastic flags someone had left to mark cabbage trees looked like they were clapping. Maia stood with her hands on her knees and water running out of her sleeves like she had been made in a hurry. Beside her, Aroha materialized with a torch that could have found a possum blinking in a polite night three paddocks over and two thermoses that smelled like sensible tea. “You look like you fought a washing machine and it won enough to teach you manners,” she said, and handed over the thermos without comment because commentary was for later and tea was for now. They stood in the rain and drank and watched the river be itself with an honesty that felt like a confession worth hearing.

In the morning, the city lay around in yesterday’s clothes and pretended it had woken up like this on purpose. Leaves had redistributed themselves in new parliamentary coalitions. The stream behind the flat put its shoulders down and pretended not to remember being disobedient. People took photographs of the damage and their dogs in raincoats and posted them with captions that ranged from gallows humor to stalwart gratitude to outrage at drains, and Maia’s phone vibrated itself into a sympathetic itch. There was a message from Lila that said the footage was dramatic and that if anyone tried to make a hero out of her she should direct them to the river and to Aroha. There was a message from Brooke with words like opportunity that made Maia imagine a man in a studio with a jazzy tie suggesting a live-stream, and she laughed into her tea and wrote back that she was busy washing mud out of her socks, which was both unglamorous and true.

At the marae, the kitchen looked like a command center designed by aunties. There were lists in handwriting that had the authority of generation. Big pots made the room smell like onions that had been given time to confess more than one truth. People came in with stories and sat down on chairs that had been allocated social lives, and the stories were given biscuits whether or not they wanted them. A little girl with a high-vis vest and a clipboard checked names off as if the storm was an attendance test. Aroha looked as if she had slept in a drawer and liked it, and when she hugged Maia it felt like bookends. “Good work,” she said, and then, properly blue-eyed and unflinching, “We will have another conversation about what you sing where. Not today. Today we are proud and damp and hungry.”

After a day of sweeping up and being congratulated by people who would normally have crossed the street before making eye contact, the quiet came like a shy animal and curled itself around Maia’s ankles. She sat on the deck with her mother and the wind, which had decided to try being lazy just to show it could do a new trick. They named it anyway, because names were an old habit that made the air sit down. They talked about how the stream had looked like a person being lifted out of a car, and how the teenagers with the cigarettes behind their ears had turned up with shovels, and how a man who was a known complainer had spent an hour lifting sandbags with the cheerfulness of a pirate who had found religion. They laughed with that particular exhausted hiccup that turns into tears if you let it, and they refused to let it, because there was cake still somewhere in the pantry and cake requires a certain dignity.

The days after the storm had a feeling like the quiet that comes over a group when someone has told a joke that lands perfectly and nobody wants to be the one to spoil it by speaking. The damage was catalogued and found to be less bad than it could have been and worse than anyone wanted to pay for. The city put out a statement with bullet points that had mistakes in them because someone had been typing at two in the morning, and the river went on doing its job without clicking “like.” Maia walked the daylighted stretch with a clipboard, because nothing says legitimacy like a rectangle of cardboard with a clip, and listened to the changes the storm had made to the way the water liked to curl at itself. She drew a diagram of a bend that had invented a little resting place for fish, and she wrote in the margin, in the tiny writing she reserved for letters to herself, Don’t forget to buy a new kettle for the marae because the old one coughs.

A message arrived from Saskia in capital letters that were not aggressive but excited, saying that she had booked her flights and had a list of New Zealand foods she had been meaning to try since someone fed her a pavlova at a fundraiser in Shepherd’s Bush and told her about kiwifruit with the authority of a cousin. She included a photo of a pair of walking boots that had never seen mud and asked if they were respectable or a cry for help. Maia wrote back amid the nuts and bolts of her morning that sensible shoes were a form of love, that the wind would eat any New York hat for breakfast, and that she was not going to be responsible for anyone’s opinion of Marmite. Underneath that, without trying to make it profound because they would be in a room soon and then they would have to live up to it, she typed, Looking forward to making a mess at a table that is not mine.

Saskia arrived on a Wednesday that had practiced its blue. The airport did its old routine of making people less themselves and then more, and when she came through the automatic doors with a suitcase the color of arithmetic and the face of someone who had learned to be ordinary on purpose, Maia was surprised to find that she felt no rehearsal of rivalry tighten in her chest. Instead she felt the kind of happiness that flashes up when a song you had forgotten you loved comes on in a supermarket and does not care where it is because it has a job to do. Saskia looked at the sign Emery was holding that said BELL in huge letters and bird in tiny ones and rolled her eyes with relief. She hugged like a person who had come a long way and still had manners, and when she stepped back her coat tried to swish at an unflattering angle and she smacked it into place with a competence that made Maia stupidly fond.

They did the scenic route from the airport because in Wellington the scenic route is a religion and also a necessity if you want to keep liking the place. The water sat there like a person minding their own business. The hills pretended they had not been caught in yesterday’s argument with the wind. Maia kept up a stream of local commentary because it charmed her to be a guide and because it bought her time to adjust to the fact that Saskia was in her passenger seat, where usually there were delivery pizzas and an umbrella with small ambitions. She pointed out the place where the sea licked at the road on a good day, the shop that had changed hands four times and remained indifferent, the stretch of rocks where her father had once taught her to skip stones with a concentration that suggested he believed it would get him into heaven.

At the flat, Emery had attempted hospitality with the kind of zeal that makes people forgive burnt edges. He had bought a cake and then remembered Maia’s mother would have provided a better one and sulked in advance. He had cleaned the kitchen aggressively and then panicked and put everything in the wrong place so that the sugar was under the sink and the dish brush was in the cutlery drawer like a spy. He shook Saskia’s hand because he wanted to be formal but then did a small dance because he had lost his nerve and hugging is easier in this country when you have given up. Saskia looked around at the paper birds and the bridge model and the plant that had refused to die and said, with polite wonder, that she had not lived in a place where things were allowed to be this honest in years, and everyone forgave her for sounding like a person who had been living out of a suitcase full of polished adjectives.

The first afternoon was for walking and letting the wind introduce itself. The first evening was for tea that turned into wine that decided it was allowed because everyone had eaten properly, and there was pasta that tried and succeeded, and everyone became giddier than the circumstances warranted because relief has a way of making people silly. They sat around the table and made plans without making them important, and at one point Saskia took out a notebook that had been stamped with a bookstore logo in a city and tried to write down a thought and then decided against it and closed the book and laughed at herself in a way that made everyone else laugh too.

They went to the marae because that was not optional and never had been. Aroha met them on the verandah with that mixture of mischief and responsibility that had earned her every extra key on her ring. She greeted Saskia with the formal politeness reserved for new people and then with the affection reserved for those who have arrived with the right person, and the room adjusted around the new shape of them without fuss. There was tea, obviously, and a plate of sandwiches that had been cut into triangles by someone with opinions. The aunties looked Saskia over like they were choosing whether to approve of her entire life and then decided they would, because she had taken her shoes off without being told and her coat looked like it could survive rain with grace. Introductions were made in the right order and in the way that turns names into ropes that tie people to each other in the right places.

“We want to hear you together,” one of the aunties said with that cheerful tyranny that comes from being right for a living. “Not the big stage way. The way you sing when nobody is asking you to be edible. If you two are friends like you’re pretending to be on the internet, your voices will know it before you say it out loud.”

They sat near the kitchen because kitchens are where the best acoustics live, and Saskia looked at Maia with a question that wasn’t really a question at all. They chose a key the way you choose to leave a door ajar, and Saskia started on a note that was so clean the wooden table straightened its back. Maia slipped in under it with a line that was deliberately rougher, not as a trick but because that was where she lived. They were careful and then they weren’t, because care is a start and not a destination, and the sound they made together did not try to be one thing. It balanced itself with the ease of an older couple walking down a hill, each adjusting slightly to the other’s stride, each carrying more weight than they looked like they should be able to, each making it look like a choice. When they finished, the aunties did not clap because clapping is for when you want to turn something back into a show. They said, That’ll do, which might have been the highest compliment in the building.

There was the requisite debate about what to eat and where to eat it, and then they were in the flat again with bowls of curry that could stop a fight and the loop pedal on the coffee table like a dog that wanted to be included. The wind did impressions in the gaps between the houses and the rain did that soft knitting it does when it is tired. They talked about small things and then big ones, about contracts and consent and crumbs. Saskia said she had never been asked with respect to say no to anything that sounded like money and that this felt like an addiction she would like to get over. Maia said she had been practicing saying no like a person practicing scales and that she was bad at it and getting better and that the marae had reminded her that the weight of a no is often the weight of a yes to something she would like to stay alive.

When they began to write together, it did not feel like writing. It felt like cleaning a window together and discovering the view was different for both of them, and that the difference was the point. Maia laid a slow tone like estuary water. Saskia laced a line of melody through it like someone threading a needle and not pricking their finger on purpose for once. They played with a line in Māori and then took it out because it tasted like theft and put it back in as a vowel with no consonants and it was cleaner that way. They put in the sound of a teaspoon on a cup in the kitchen because the kitchen wanted to be in the song and getting in the way of that would have been ungenerous. Emery recorded them with the smugness of a man who might get to tell a story about being there first and then went back to slicing limes for a drink he was pretending was for someone else and not him.

In the mornings, while Saskia slept like a person who is collecting sleep for a long migration, Maia went to the lab because flumes do not rest and neither do rivers, and when she came back her mother had already folded the spare blankets into perfect undecided squares and placed them in a stack that implied efficiency and care. They took Saskia to the windy point where the city pretends it is a boat and to the quiet beach where dogs learn to have spiritual experiences, and to the bakery that still thought it was 1997 and made cheese scones with the moral heft of a sermon. They went to a school assembly where a room full of eleven-year-olds regarded them with the hypnotized skepticism of people who have been asked to sit still for too long and who might forgive you if you sing something that includes a sound like a bird and also a joke. They answered questions about whether you get to keep your dresses and whether engineers can have pink hair and whether celebrities pay for their own gas. They left with a paper card covered in felt-pen hearts and a muffin that had ambitions beyond its crumble.

One afternoon, when the wind had given itself a sports day and was showing off, they climbed to the place above Makara where the father who had refused to be a ghost liked to stand in Maia’s dreams. The gorse was doing its usual argument with anyone who dared brush it, and the pylons walked over the hill like weirdly confident animals. The city lay in the distance like it had decided to stay out of it for an afternoon. They stood without filling the air with words because the air had its own agenda. When they did speak, it was with a common understanding that the place was the main character and they were allowed to be extras with lines.

“I used to think all wind was the same,” Saskia said, squinting into the brightness like she was telling it, personally, to behave. “In London it’s a rumour people use to blame their hair on. Here it has a personality disorder and a certificate.”

“It has cousins,” Maia said, enjoying the way the vocabulary arranged itself without effort. “You can hear them sharing traits if you sit still long enough. The lazy wind is still my favourite because it has a sense of humour about itself. It goes straight through you because it can’t be bothered going around. It’s direct. I respect a wind that knows what it is.”

“I’m going to steal that sentence and pretend I invented it in a song,” Saskia said, with the honesty of someone who had learned how to ask for forgiveness on paper and wanted to practice asking beforehand. “And I will pay royalties in biscuits and a bridge named after your mother.”

They recorded a small thing up there without telling anyone, just enough to remind themselves later that they had done it and were not going to let the internet make it into content unless they said so. It was a phrase repeated into the air like a pebble thrown into church water, and the air took it and made it bigger and then put it down again with affection. Emery had come too, ostensibly to carry snacks and actually to be present when something happened, and at one point he lay on his back with his arms out like a person who had decided not to be useful and therefore had become more helpful than anyone. “If you fall over,” he said to the wind, “fall in a direction where we can get a good picture.”

Evenings grew themselves around the table with the satisfying predictability of dough. Maia’s mother kept showing up with jars from her cupboards and a look that suggested she had plotted out everyone’s calcium intake for the week. Aroha came one night with a piece of fish that looked like a small cloud and a story about a man who had tried to teach parakeets to swear. Cathy visited and explained a new grant category as if it were a fairy tale with dragons that could be slain using appropriate documentation. Florian tried to be cool and failed and then laughed at himself and became who he was without interruption. The room warmed around the arrivals and departures, and the loop pedal learned the difference between recording and listening, and it minded its manners.

At some point, the world noticed that two women were making a noise at a kitchen table. People wrote to them to ask if they would capture the kitchen and sell it back to them in small jars, and Maia practiced saying no with the lightness of someone who has found the right tone. She and Saskia agreed to one thing, a fundraiser for the daylighting project that would do nothing dramatic except make a very small amount of money turn into more plantings and a better fence around the outlet where the kids liked to dare each other into foolhardiness. They chose the town hall with the dim lights and the good echo and they papered pillars with photocopies and word of mouth, and on the night people came in jackets that had known rain and sat in rows that looked like a church after a joke.

The fundraiser did not try to be big. It tried to be fine. Maia talked about the river with the brisk love of a person who had counted its stones. Saskia told a story about fierce aunties in different postcodes and how to love them without making them into exhibits. They sang the stairwell piece and the hilltop piece and a thing that had no name and then they talked so the room could swallow and then they sang again. Aroha stood at the back with her arms folded like a general who had decided not to invade. Emery ran the lights from a panel that looked like a toy and spoke softly to himself like someone driving down a road they knew so well they liked to narrate it. At the end, the people stood up not because they were told but because sitting felt insufficient, and the building did that thing buildings do when they are pleased with what has happened inside them and they push their walls out a fraction to contain it.

Afterwards, in a corridor where the lights had been bought on special and the carpet had opinions, Brooke appeared with her phone in her hand like a person gently holding a bird they weren’t sure would accept them, and Lila appeared on the screen because if she couldn’t be in the corridor she was going to be a corridor anyway. They said kind things with real relief and then tried to ask for nothing, which was as much of a gift as either of them knew how to give. A girl from the primary school stood very seriously in front of Maia and handed her a two-dollar coin and said that her dad said you must always pay for art even if you also clap, and Maia considered kneeling and didn’t because it would have made the girl’s solemnity flee like a spooked cat. She took the coin like a bishop and put it in the jar that said RIVER with a felt-tip pen and wrote next to the word RIVER the word THANKS because sometimes throwing gratitude back into the water is as important as anything else you do.

On the way home, the wind had stolen something small from the day because that is what wind likes to take, and Maia found, unexpectedly, that what was left behind was enough. The city blinked at them like someone weary but pleased. The hills continued their ancient habit of not falling over. Saskia leaned her head against the window glass and made a sound that was almost a hum and might have been the next song looking for a place to land. Emery was already thinking about what he would call the next playlist and whether the fern would prefer Bach or basslines, and Maia’s mother was in the front seat rehearsing a speech she would not give about how proud she was and how little the world knows about correctness compared to the rightness that arrives when you say the name of a wind and it turns its head. That night, when they went to sleep in rooms that were busy with their own small climate systems, the city kept breathing, and out in the dark a bird tried a note and then the one next to it, and then it stopped to admire its work, because even birds have egos, and even egos sometimes learn to sit still.The morning after the town hall had swallowed and released a hundred small hopes, the city behaved as if someone had smoothed its hair with a wet hand. Maia woke in the particular quiet of a house that had been full of people the night before and was now politely putting chairs back under tables. She could still feel the old timber under her feet from the stage, the way boards remember the weight of certain words. The kettle did its reliable shouting. On her phone, Lila had sent a message composed mostly of commas and kindness, a tumbler of relief tipped onto the screen: the fundraiser had made enough to buy plants, fence posts, and one new wheelbarrow, and perhaps the wheelbarrow would be named ceremonially after someone who was bad at pushing one. A separate email, trimmed in the earnest blue of a broadcast company, confirmed that the documentary crew would arrive on Monday with a sound recordist, a director who wore headphones like a crown, and a list of intentions that had been softened, miraculously, by Aroha’s conditions. Cameras would be allowed where gumboots went. Scripts were not invited. Karakia would not be shot over. Tea would be respected as a protagonist.

When the crew arrived, the sky had chosen a clean white that made people squint and be polite about it. They unfolded themselves in the carpark like a travelling orchestra that had downsized. The director, a woman with hair held back by a pencil because she had once put it there and forgotten it, shook Maia’s hand with eyes that were already measuring light and then, perhaps unexpectedly, put her palm briefly against the flume’s steel as if greeting a large animal. “We usually cheat,” she confessed, like a person apologizing for having eaten the last biscuit. “We’re here to try not to. You tell us if we start performing the river. We will behave.”

Cathy appeared out of the glare with a scarf that made her look like someone’s favorite aunt and a face that could calm horses, and she laid out the terrain in the tone she used for undergraduates who had found themselves ankle-deep in delight and difficult physics. The flume ran, if you did not look closely, like a shallow, obedient river, its laminar layers bragging until you salted them with a handful of dye and chaos declared itself with elegance. They mic’d the motor because it was a voice too, a low reliable note under everything. The sound recordist crouched like a priest at the altar and did the special listening that audio people do when they are counting the space between the notes rather than the notes. He smiled into his beard at some whisper the flume made that only he could hear and Maia felt, absurdly, protective, as if any equipment less interested than this would have insulted the water.

They lined up a shot of dye making a blue feather where the flow forgot itself for a second and everyone made the involuntary pleased noise that people make when something has done the thing you wanted without being told. A production assistant whose jacket had come from a magazine tried to hand Maia a towel every time her sleeve got kissed by water and gave up when he understood that she was happiest when she looked like she had been in a conversation that had splashed. Florian explained the stepped weir in the earnest way of someone who had recently discovered how joy looks in cross-section, the camera breathing with his hands as they made little ledges in the air. It struck Maia, watching the lens fall in love with foam and plywood and maths, that allowing a camera to look at you while you were not pretending was as intimate as any confession. It made her stand a fraction taller and make fewer jokes.

On the second day, they went where the rules were older. The marae’s lawn shone with the particular green that arrives after a storm has washed everybody’s faces. The crew put their shoes in a line like good children learning a rhythm. Aroha introduced herself to each of them individually with the kind of measured attention that makes people feel approved of and warned without the sting. She looked like this was not her first rodeo and that if a horse misbehaved she would not hold a grudge. The director lowered her headphones from her ears and held them in her hands during the welcome, which was either reverence or a useful accident. There were words that did that lifting thing words can do when they have been kept in good repair, and then there was the small soft chaos of the kitchen where someone stubbed a toe and the aunties told a story about a nephew standing in for a chorus line, and the steam from the kettle was allowed to be a main character. The camera learned very quickly to move slowly and then slower around the tables, and once, when the boom operator reached out a hand to steady a chair that had decided to make a point, one of the aunties gave him a slice of slice with the same brisk affection she would have reserved for a nephew who had remembered his cousins’ names.

They filmed the river that lived at the bottom of the paddock with a patience that impressed the river no more than it would have impressed a cat. The director asked permission to record karakia and was told gently that the words did not need a microphone to keep their shape. So they recorded hands: the way they lifted and fell, the way they belonged to people who had stood here long enough to know what the hill did when nobody looked. Maia was asked questions that to other people might have seemed like television fodder and to her seemed like opportunities to make chairs where everyone could sit down. She talked about what it meant to be held responsible for a sound that was older than you, and about the luxury of being told No by people who loved you enough not to be impressed. She watched the producer’s shoulders drop in that way that indicated relief as much as the light ever did.

At night, the house was quieter than the day had been and not less full. Saskia curled up on the couch with a baggy sweater that had already started smelling like the flat, and Emery kept taking a gratin out of the oven and putting it back in again because he felt like it needed to become itself more. Maia’s mother spread a newspaper on the table and began to peel oranges for everybody with the seriousness of a task that will keep grief’s fingers off your sleeve for five minutes, and the peel came off in long perfect ropes that Emery wore as a crown until someone laughed at him and then forgot to stop. After the filming had tried to make itself small and polite, after the aunties had loaded up the crew with leftovers and instruction, after Aroha had said to Maia, “Good. Remember this shape when other people try to cut you into theirs,” Maia’s mother went to the hall cupboard and came back with a shoe-box that had held a pair of boots once when they mattered. It was scuffed by years and a move and a cat that had thought it was a mountain, and it had a piece of tape on the lid with her father’s writing on it in the neat block letters of a man who had taken graph paper seriously and then eloped with a kayak.

She opened the box as if the air were listening for the hinges. Inside there were two cassette tapes in cases that had lost fights with car floors and a photograph where a river took up most of the frame and two small humans took up the rest, one with a mouth open mid-laugh, one squinting into the idea of sun. There were also a folded piece of paper with a list of words that were obviously wind names and one that simply said remember to bring the thermos. They found the cassette player that had last lived in the back of a cupboard with spare batteries and the ghosts of road trips and plugged it in like you put a plant in weak winter light and ask it to hold on. The tape warbled briefly and then gave them a sound that made Maia’s stomach cold and warm at once; the sound of a man’s voice in a room too small for its tall amusement. Nor’wester, he said in his mouth with a grin that rattled the edges of the words. Zephyr, like the name of a child or a dog. Lazy wind, his voice said, pleased with its own story. There was the clunk of a paddle against plastic, and in the background there was the specific unteachable, a tui imitating a bell someone had dropped down a flight of stairs and only later realized was metal. Her father’s voice said her name in a tone that made the room tilt slightly and made everyone in it want to be kinder.

She looped the word lazy on the tape back three times, not to fix it in the air but to let herself hear the way his mouth had held the z, the way the a had stretched as if it were a dog on a very good day. The producer in her brain, who had begun instinctively to sample anything that could possibly be sampled, asked whether a sound like this one would ever be allowed to sit in a track and earn its keep. Another part of her that had not existed until recently and had arrived like a fence put back where it had always been said no, this is a thing you keep for tea and storms and two in the morning and people who know how to stand quietly in a kitchen without moving anything. She tapped the pounamu at her throat with her finger very gently as if asking it to hold the decision for a night and it obliged, being ancient and used to carrying presumptuous requests without dropping them.

In the morning, while a gull argued itself into a corner on the roof and the cloud cover tried to be modest, the phone performed its new trick of being both an instrument of delight and an intruder. There were emails about the documentary needing permission from someone who had died and thus was not inclined to read emails; there were messages from a label who had decided that if the stairwell had made kindness fashionable then kindness ought to be monetized quickly before the algorithm forgot its manners; there were practicalities about the bridge. The bridge, as if remembering it had been a metaphor long enough and wanted to become a thing with bolts, had asserted its place on the list by means of a call from a council engineer whose voice always sounded like a cross between gravel and velvet. The old footbridge over the daylighted stretch had sulked under feet for a year and taken offense at the storm. It had confessed to rot with the bluntness of old timber, and a safety inspector had frowned and written numbers on a pad until everybody present had agreed that it needed to be replaced before someone’s dog fell through and learned more physics than it had meant to.

At the meeting, the folding chairs were the exact temperature of municipal sincerity. The project manager wore an expression that had been built to survive sudden interventions by ministers. A set of drawings had been laid out on a table that had ambitions left over from being a school desk. Maia stood up and explained the fern spine, and heard the intake of breath that engineers make when they like something that is not theirs because it is elegant and will hold weight without showing off. Aroha looked at the drawings and said nothing for a minute because she did not care for empty applause. Then she put her finger on the line of the curve and said, “The kids can run across it without tripping and the old people won’t curse you. There’s a place here where someone can sit down and not feel like they’re in the way. Make the rail not bite the palm. Put a small plaque with letters big enough to read without humiliating your glasses.” It was lazy-wind directness applied to lumber and steel, and it lifted the design into the part of reality where a hand knows where to go without finding an email to tell it.

They argued about the deck material and the warranty on the fixings until someone brought scones and the argument became about butter and jam. The costings were grumpy but possible. There would be working bees and proper installers where liability required it and teenagers paid in both money and the kind of praise that builds muscle. The documentary crew asked if they might shoot the build, and Maia said yes if they were prepared to be given a broom and to sweep without turning sweeping into a story, and the director saluted like a person admitting to having earned a broom in an earlier life. Brooke, who had developed the impressive talent of appearing where it made her look wise and disappearing where it would make her look like an email, floated the idea of a live stream where people could watch the bridge be born between lunch and dinner. Maia said she was already tired of having her small moments gnawed up by other people’s appetites and suggested that if Brooke wanted to be useful she might find a corporate sponsor to buy one more wheelbarrow and three more pairs of knee pads and perhaps a thermos that would not quit at four. Brooke, to her credit, took the list with a face that tried for neutrality and achieved it for three seconds.

The building days made a sound like sentences being nailed together with a hammer that had been in the same family longer than anyone could remember. The smell of the timber was a note you could stand under. People arrived with tool belts they had inherited and tool belts they had bought last week in a burst of optimism. A boy in a Warriors jersey had the miraculous patience of seventeen and corrected the angle of a joist with the hands of someone who had learned most of his strength carrying aunties’ washing baskets and not complaining. An older woman who had trained as a joiner before someone suggested that girls whose eyelashes were that good should be nurses was given a corner and command of it, and the corner squinted at her once and then obeyed. Saskia sanded railings with a focus that made Maia want to write a song about repetitive motion, and when someone handed her a drill she asked for a second lesson even though she had understood the first, because asking twice is sometimes the most radical way to be sure. Emery had painted a sign that said PLEASE DON’T FALL OFF in cheerful blue and then painted over it when he realized the risk assessor had been supervising from the shadows like a bat.

The documentary crew proved they knew how to hold a ladder. The boom operator became beloved because he fetched screws like a magician. The director helped line up the angle for the first plank with that same instinct for how things meet. They filmed the sweat and the pause and the moment when the first person walked from earth to earth and realized they did not have to think about their feet. They filmed a dog hesitating at the far end until a child turned around and clapped and the dog decided that crossing a bridge was part of its personality now. Aroha stood under the kākābeaks with her illegible ledger of who had turned up and wrote with satisfaction and anticipation, because there would be a list of thanks and it would be comprehensive. She liked names. She liked to get names right.

On the last evening before the opening, the kitchen table had a map of the bridge laid out on it and a scatter of screws that had escaped and a plate with biscuit crumbs that looked like a constellation of accidents. Saskia was leaving in two days because the part of her life that had trained itself to return to airports on command had begun tapping its Google calendar on the table with a finger. They had an hour where the house had agreed to mind itself and the wind had decided to attend to someone else’s washing line, and so they recorded their kitchen song properly, not in the way that asked permission from money but in the way that you put a jar under something that is dripping and then label it and put it on a shelf. The song was unambitious on purpose. It had space to sit down in the middle. It had the teaspoon at the start and the ferocious little sore-throat cough the jug made just before boiling and the sound of someone’s ring against the mug by accident and a very quiet three-note bird that was not named out loud. It had their two voices standing side by side like two people looking out a window, not matching sweaters but matching weather. When they finished, their silence was not reverent so much as grateful that the song had come out alive and not scratched itself on anything.

Saskia gave Maia a bell from a junk shop that had been a bell on a bicycle and then a bell on a gate and then someone’s pocket talisman, and Maia placed it on the windowsill like a punctuation mark promised to a future thought. Maia handed Saskia a feather she had found near the bridge that was almost certainly gull and therefore comically unromantic but the curve of it made sense to the hand, and Saskia laughed and tucked it into the spine of her book and said that bell and bird were going to become a cliché if they weren’t careful and then made herself proud by not apologizing for the sentiment.

The opening day was the kind of day Wellington offers up as proof that it is not cruel on purpose, merely committed. The sky had the color of linen that somebody had bothered to uncrease. The river did a small tidy dance as if to show off to relatives. There were speeches that remembered to be short and a few that did not and got their comeuppance when the microphone sulked. The plaque had letters you could read without humiliating your glasses. A karakia made the air rearrange itself into the right shape and promised that the bridge’s job would be to carry people, not to remind them of their own weight. A child in a high-vis vest cut a ribbon that was actually a piece of flax because someone had not ordered ribbon on time and someone else had remembered that nobody needed ribbon if they had a garden. People walked over. This was the part that mattered—the footfalls, the incidental conversations carried across space because the space had been made. A man with a cane tried the bench at the bend and declared it a good bench with the authority of a veteran of benches. A teenager skateboarded over with a curiosity that was almost humility and then picked up his board because the sign said politely that it was not yet the day for boards.

Maia said words into a microphone with the modesty she had been trained for and then sang a two-minute thing that had been built for exactly this spot and not one centimeter of any other, and it sounded less like a performance than a demonstration of gratitude. The wind kept its manners. A blackbird approved by demonstrating the first two bars of something that might have been Vivaldi as interpreted by a fence. The documentary crew stood far enough back to make themselves small and captured the look on the face of the old woman who had driven the first nail in without giving anyone who didn’t know her the right to name that look. Aroha took the first walk over solemnly and then the second with a grin, and tapped the railing with her knuckles as if she were testing it for truth and felt satisfied enough to tell a story later about how bridges like to be thanked and how if you do not thank them they sulk and let your hat blow off in a month.

That evening, after sausages in bread eaten standing up because nobody had brought enough chairs, after the young ecologist from the marae had delivered a lecture to three kids about eels in a tone that made the kids forget to be embarrassed, after Emery had tried to convince everyone that his name for the new wheelbarrow should stick and had been outvoted in favor of something older and better, the house returned to its human size. There was the sound of a suitcase being coaxed closed. There was the sound of a bell being put deliberately on a sill. There was the sound of two cups being set down at the same time by two different people who were not ready for sleep and were not interested in words that would make it be time before it was time. Maia’s mother took a roll of brown paper from a drawer and wrote BREATHE on it again because the old sign had gotten soup on it and because sometimes you reissue the laws of the house to keep misplaced courage from sneaking out to smoke.

Later, after the light had turned the city into an instrument played slowly, after the gull had given a final insolent remark on the roofline and left, after Saskia’s breathing had smoothed out on the other side of the thin wall like water deciding to let logs float, Maia stood on the deck and named the winds under her breath as if calling roll. The lazy wind was not on duty. The doctor had tidied the afternoon and gone home, leaving a note. The southerly had had a nap and was ready to be cross about something small. She said their names and felt them turn their heads in acknowledgment, which is all she had ever wanted from anything larger than herself. She thought about her father’s tape in the drawer and decided that some things would stay as tea and not become songs, and she thought about the bridge and felt a complicated pride that had to do with screws and with hands and with the way people had remained themselves while carrying timber.

In the morning, the airport would demand a new performance from someone she loved and do it with the ruthless efficiency of an escalator. Offers would land dressed like opportunities and would need to be undressed politely until their bones were showing and they could be told no or yes with precision. The documentary would be cut and would try to keep the shape of the rooms it had been allowed into without sewing them into something sharp. The river would continue to move with indifference to the new camera angles and also with a new bench on its back. The kitchen would remember the song with the teaspoon, and some other kitchen somewhere would make something completely different that would stand quietly next to it.

Maia went inside, the bell on the sill making an almost-sound as if it were testing the air. She wrote a note to herself on the back of an envelope because it was the nearest paper: keep the bridge short. This had nothing to do with spans. She meant the sentence-length between leaving and returning, the distance between a promise and a practice, the run-up between standing on a hill and walking down to the water. She stuck the envelope under a magnet shaped like a trout next to the emergency list and the next week’s rosters and a shopping note that read batteries, basil, biscuits in a handwriting she recognized as an auntie’s from the marae. The house breathed like a tired animal. The city breathed back. Somewhere in the dark a blackbird tried the new bridge and did not tell anyone, because some stories do not need even one camera to keep them alive.
