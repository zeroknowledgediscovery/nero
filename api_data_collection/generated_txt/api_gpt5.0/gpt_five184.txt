The jacarandas along Colorado dropped purple shreds that looked like someone had cut the fringes from a secondhand velvet dress and tossed them along the boulevard. Early summer in Pasadena does that—makes everything look like it’s getting ready for its own parade. People were practicing, anyway. A line of high school trumpets went staccato off-key, a float with papier-mâché peacocks tried to squeeze around a delivery van double-parked near the coffee shop that pretended to be a library, and the city’s particular hum—bus brakes, bike bells, gossip—sang in the heat. It looked ordinary, which was always when the other thing moved.

He kept the lids of his eyes low. A little trick. Eyes that seemed so polite nobody noticed how carefully they measured. He had his jacket off because the day was heavy and sweet with that jacaranda lint smell, and there were small flickers of magic coming off of him like heat from asphalt. If you stood close to Prince Adrian, you could feel it in your teeth, the way you feel thunderstorms in your molars.

“Your Highness,” Ramiro said awkwardly, not low enough (it always made Adrian laugh, that anyone in Pasadena thought someone might overhear and care).

“Stop calling me that on Colorado,” Adrian said. It was a warm admonition, a practiced one; this dance had never been new. “We’re here as a pair of bored customers who ordered iced coffees and are going to people-watch like civilians. Like humans. Like those raccoons that run Old Town.”

“Yes, sir.” Ramiro looked at his watch like he had been ordered to make the sun hurry. His suits never wrinkled. He could sweat through a shirt and emerge crisp, a talent more useful than any number of blades he pretended he didn’t carry. He kept his hand on the edge of the bistro table just so, making a fence with his fingers. He had been with the family since Adrian’s father had smiled too much at the wrong party and paid the cost. People thought being royal in Southern California meant either being a fever dream or being a practical joke. It meant both. Also, the city taxes were real.

A kid ran the wrong way down the sidewalk, turned his ankle and, in that bound-to-happen way, launched his newborn balloon into the hot sky. It hit a streetlamp as if the metal had caught it on purpose, snagged in the scrollwork at the top.

“Sorry,” the mother said—a young woman with a sunhat that wanted to be a parasol. “Sorry. Our bad.”

Adrian smiled. “Do you mind?” he said, and when she blinked at him, he realized he hadn’t said what he meant. “Do you mind if I try to get it?”

She looked up at the balloon, then at the lithe, handsome twenty-something in a shirt he’d rolled up to his elbows without thinking, and whatever calculation she made went in his favor. “Oh,” she said. “If it’s not too much trouble.”

Adrian stood. He had exactly two kinds of magic: the kind that everyone can see and the kind they’ll pretend they didn’t. He liked the first kind for days like this. He closed his hand around air and closed his eyes and looked at the lamp the way you look at a friend who is trying to leave a party too early. It had a name, though it wasn’t in any language Ramiro spoke, and it had an old mood, and he touched both. When he opened his hand, the lamp’s little cage unhooked itself and the balloon dipped like it had decided to remember gravity. He caught it on the way down.

The crowd that wasn’t a crowd—because this was Pasadena, and people had seen stranger things at Trader Joe’s—gave their un-crowd sigh. The mother’s shoulders fell into relief. The kid held the string the way you hold a dog who’ll run if you let it.

“Magic man,” the kid said.

“Not a man yet,” Adrian said, handing him the string. “Promise me you’ll tie it on the stroller.”

“We will,” the mother said.

Adrian sat, as if it was nothing. Of course it was nothing. The second kind would exhaust him; this sort leaves him bright-eyed. Ramiro slid him his iced coffee, and the ice cracked a little like sheets of mica. They were trying to be ordinary in a city that liked to pretend it was, which is similar but not quite the same. Maybe that’s why the old vows took, here, where streets slanted into mountains and houses had so much history stuffed in their walls they kept old weather like a habit.

“You’ll get spotted,” Ramiro said softly, but not like he believed it.

“I’m not exactly hiding.” He looked up again, to the line of hills that held the place up like stairs. “Caltech has three freshmen this year pretending to be princes of the intersection of Fifth and Lake. It’s in the water.”

Ramiro winced. “It’s in the Charter,” he corrected him. “The waters and the stone give you jurisdiction of the Arroyo Crown and—”

“And of the affairs bound to the Crown by the heads of the Figueroa, the Linda, and the Madre Sierra,” Adrian recited. He had been nineteen when they made him say it aloud with a mouth full of rose petals. He had been nine, in his head, the first time he understood that his father walking away from a low door did not mean a safe return. He had been five when he made a mica snowflake appear inside his fist, and his mother had clapped softly and told him that light liked him. These things come in threes in family lore, but in life they trailed like the jacaranda shreds, and sometimes you could not say when a petal had fallen, only that the pavement was stained.

An envelope slid its way into his afternoon in particular and left a small cold behind it where it had passed. It wasn’t delivered by a person. There was just a folded shape lying on the table between the iced coffee and the butter cookie that had tried and failed to be shaped like a leaf. It would have been parlor-quality magic back when people had parlors. Now it was too showy for his aunt’s taste and too pretty for danger. But his skin prickled, and Ramiro had his hand under the table that half-inch that says yes I have the gun I pretend not to have.

The wax was obsidian. It had a seal impression—three concentric bridges—and he swallowed before he’d told his body he should. He popped it and slid out the paper. There are many kinds of danger, but only one kind of handwriting like that. It had the nervous surety of someone trying to be formal, which always made the loops too careful. It was his aunt’s.

Arroyo’s wards thinning near the old channel under the Colorado Street Bridge. Hum not right. Something tastes like heat. Come now.

He read the last words twice. The ink had a shimmer, not visible so much as obvious. Ramiro frowned at the color hitting Adrian’s face.

“We should go,” Adrian said.

“I’ll get the car.”

“No time.” He stood, left cash under the iced coffee. A small voice nagged that he should have finished it; his mother liked to say waste invited bad luck. But you could also invite bad luck by calling it luck; you could call it by name and find it had been sitting at your kitchen table the whole time, eating oranges and making faces at the cat.

“It’s going to be that kind of day,” Ramiro said.

“It’s going to be the other kind,” Adrian said. “The kind that makes this kind feel silly.”

He put his hand to the air and pushed aside an edge that wasn’t supposed to be an edge—an alley that was really a fold if you were looking with the right set of senses; Old Pasadena had a thousand of those, little creases in the city you could iron if you were not careful or press if you were. He took the fold and stepped with certainty. Ramiro swore under his breath and followed.

Everything smelled like eucalyptus and shadow. The Arroyo Seco runs with its back to the city; that’s what his aunt always said, which meant if you were lost you could trust it, and if you were cocky it could drown you. The underside of the Colorado Street Bridge—called suicide in precinct reports in a voice that tried to sound ordinary about it—had a hum of its own. It had been built to carry cars and couples and sorrow, and it had held all three like a dutiful servant, never dropping any except by request.

Adrian’s aunt waited in the corridor under the arches, where the warm air turned colder and the light was filtered through the language of concrete. She had a coat on like she was being dramatic, which meant she had not slept and did not like what she had read in the air. A breath of dust came from the vaults behind her, the smell that Huntington books used to wear when they came home after too long alone.

“Child,” she said, which was always the word she used when the thing she was going to say next was going to be a plate of raw oysters. “Come listen.”

Adrian did. He put his ear to the column and then to the air just to the right of it, where old accidents accumulate; not the ones that remove blood, but the ones that nick luck. He felt the hum. He tasted heat. Not the nice kind. Like the inside of a broken light bulb.

“What did you touch?” he asked.

“Nothing,” she said. She looked offended. “I am not an idiot. There were set wards where the old water goes when it backs up. The kind that talk to gravity and favor. Those are frayed. I can mend them but—this flavor. Something thrashed. Not a storm. Not a child.”

“Not ours,” Ramiro said.

“No,” Aunt Lina said. “Not ours.”

Adrian rubbed his thumb and forefinger together like he could make static. He got gnats of light to flicker between them, then worked his hand until they laced and made a lace that held shape. If he was tired, he could accidentally make it into a net and catch something he hadn’t meant to. It was mild, the way bread is mild. But it made the hum change, and Aunt Lina’s eyes widened, and there was the tiniest pop in the air as something inched closer to audible and then thought better of it.

“Do you feel that?” she said.

He did. Someone else had been here, making their own lace. Not careful. Not careful at all. He could smell the edges they had burned without meaning to; he could see where they had leaned too hard on a seam and left fingerprints like smudges on glass.

“Someone else who can do this,” he said.

“And with the charm of a teenager who thinks he can drive a stick shift just because none of his friends got whiplash last time,” Aunt Lina snapped. It was her affection when she was scared. “Also—this.” She pulled a small shard out of her sleeve. It had caught there like a burr.

It looked like glass but felt like a promise. It was a piece of cut clarity that turned his palm cold. There were letters etched into it; there always are, if you could see them. He squinted and let his eyes go strange, the way you loosen a muscle and see what it was holding back. The letters were the wrong alphabet. They were the right one if you had a grandmother who was born with two shadows.

“You see it?” she said.

“I see that someone wrote a name on the inside of a mirror,” he said.

“What name?” Ramiro asked.

Adrian didn’t say—names like that like to be spoken more than you’d like to speak them—but after a beat Aunt Lina did because she was older and had decided that fear should be taught its place. “Kaedren,” she said, and spat delicately into the dust.

“Prince,” Ramiro said after a moment, like the word had been laid across the floor and he had it by the thin part. “It belongs to—”

“To the South March,” Aunt Lina said, “if you are reading the old maps. Or to a boy with dust in his pockets and jewels where his teeth should have been, if you are reading the gossip.”

“What’s he doing in my city,” Adrian said lightly, except his wrist twitched once, twice, as if he were shaking something off that would not come free.

“I don’t think it’s him,” Aunt Lina said, with a sigh that said it might be, obviously, but that sighs had languages too. “But I think this is his sign. Someone wrote his name so the local rules would know who to blame. Or who to lay down for.”

Adrian closed the lace he had made between his fingers. He pinched it. It sparked (it loved him, the light, it had since he was small and used to put his hands through curtains). He blew into the sparks and sent them skating along the concrete, across the old water’s mouth. Little repairs. Darning. The hum eased. The heat-taste did not.

“Okay,” he said. “There’s a gala at the Gamble House tonight. The House likes me. It likes everyone, actually, which is the trouble with generous things. If someone in a borrowed coat tries to pass off a borrowed crown, the House will laugh if we ask right.”

“You think whoever tried to break the Arroyo’s teeth will go to a party,” Ramiro said.

“They always do,” Aunt Lina and Adrian said together.

On the drive back up Orange Grove, Adrian rolled down the window and touched the wind. Old-money houses do not look at new-royalty boys; they have their own narratives that matter more than people. The Gamble House peeked coyly over green. He felt it seeing him, though. Some places see past their owners. The House was a craftsman dream that looked like someone had built a boat and thought better of it and put it on land. It loved everyone and liked to hear secrets whispered into its beams, which kept the wood oiled more than any treatment could. The event tonight would raise money for baskets and bow ties; it would raise something else if he asked.

Maya texted as they passed the first of the banners someone had forgotten to take down after some fundraising thing that had pretended not to be campaigning. are you playing nice at the big kid party tonight? also do I need to pretend not to know you or will there be a line

He smiled. Might need you to pretend not to know me for thirty seconds. The House likes a good meet cute.

aren’t we already past that? she wrote. also my editor wants me to ask you if you are really a prince or you just play one in pasadena.

He tapped. I am an unpaid intern in a hereditary position. Please tell your editor that I will go to the mat for better interns’ rights.

He put his phone away. Ramiro was frowning with concentration at the road like the asphalt had declared war on their tires. “We can turn around right now,” Ramiro said.

“And what, put signs up?” Adrian said. “Closed until further notice? The Arroyo will pout.”

“Your mother—”

“Will say I should be careful, and then remind me that carefulness is a cowardly word for the thing that makes you sloppy.”

Ramiro made a soft noise that meant he had reached the end of the lecture file in his head. The car glided into the drive that looked like a movie where a detective is about to decide he doesn’t drink anymore. The House breathed around them with its long-shouldered porches; the doors took their time as if they had been carved from patience itself.

“Adrian,” said the House, in a voice you hear where in your ribs where you keep your angry kindergarten. It said his name the way you might say the name of a favorite paperweight. He smiled at the way its tone carried dust and green, wood and air.

“Hello darling,” he said.

“Stop flirting with architecture,” Maya said from behind him. She had a photographer’s lanyard and the expression of someone prepared to apologize to security while also cutting their cord with a pair of metaphorical scissors. She wore black because everyone did; she made it look like a decision.

He spread his hands. “Never. Did you dress the part?”

“I brought a pen that looks like a cigarette.”

“Very noir. Come with me. We’ll greet the donors, simultaneously identify three grips of weird visitors, and avoid incompetently disguised TV people.”

Maya looped her arm through his. “You could just call them influencers and save time.”

“Words have power,” he said, prim. She snorted and pressed her shoulder into his as if they had been doing this for decades instead of having met over a broken espresso machine and a collapsed wisp of magic. She had witchcraft of her own, the reporter kind, the one that finds secrets like a dowser finds water. She liked to pretend it wasn’t magic at all, just practice. What else is magic but practice with a better origin story.

The first hour was fine. The House hummed, and he hummed back. He shook hands; he told half the truth so well it sounded like a joke. He let the donors feel like they were supporting an endangered species: local community, potted with youth and cleaned up nicely in a tie. He watched the room. He is good at this because he was trained to be, and because magic is a kind of attention you can learn to keep steady.

He felt it before he saw it. A shift in pressure near the stairs at the back of the great hall. Someone had leaned too heavy on the banister and the House had stiffened. He turned his head and saw a man with a face like a movie you only remember halfway. Good coat; wrong shoes. Hair that looked like it belonged to a boy who slept in cars. A ring that insisted on being noticed even though he was doing his reluctant best to hide it.

“Ramiro,” he said low. Ramiro, who had been pretending not to be a detail, melted toward the stairs like he was built to be a shadow. Maya followed, because she was a dog with a scent, and because she liked to say, what good is ignoring your instincts when the whole point of instincts is to be inconvenient.

The man’s eyes slid across the room and snagged on a painting of a riverboat that had never been anywhere near this zip code. He reached out the way you reach into a refrigerator. The House snapped at him. It wasn’t visible to anyone who didn’t know Houses; to Adrian it was a hiss, as if the wood had teeth. The man flinched. Then he laughed.

Adrian moved without remembering deciding to. He was across the room in a breath, with Maya’s hand barely brushing his sleeve as she slid into the angle that could make her look like she was looking at anyone else. He stepped between the man and the painting casually, admirer of stern brushstrokes, citizen with dietary restrictions. And he smiled the city’s politest smile.

“Beautiful, isn’t it,” he said. “Not accurate even slightly, but beautiful.”

The man looked at him. He had good bones, that much was true. He had a mark at his throat that looked like the ghost of jewelry. His mouth did not understand the shapes of its own expressions yet; he smiled like it hurt, and so it looked like sincerity.

“You’re Adrian,” he said, making the vowels slightly too round. His tongue had been trained elsewhere.

“I am a person who lives here and has put too much trust in almond croissants, yes. We should stop naming people out loud. Names leave tracks.”

The man’s eyes flicked once. He knew that. You could always see it, the moment someone showed their childhood. He had been told about names. He had been told that his was written other places than in his mother’s careful ledger.

“I’m—”

“Thirsty, I imagine,” Adrian said. “It’s dry tonight.”

“Very,” the man said, with a little laugh. “Dry as a blessing.”

Dry as a curse, Aunt Lina would say, and had. He smelled the glass-shard cold again. He thought of Kaedren and kept his face so easy you could skate on it. The man held out his hand, and Adrian saw the ring properly at last. It was silver that had seen heat. It had a flaw in it, a crack the maker had polished over, and the crack flashed as if it liked room light very much.

“Gabe,” the man said. “My friends call me Gabe.”

“Gabe,” Adrian said, tasting it. It lay down the way a cat who has been fed will lay down on an expensive shirt. “Welcome to Pasadena.”

“I feel very welcomed,” Gabe said. He looked around as if the House was a person he meant to be charming, and it was, and he was. The House hummed. Adrian got between the hum and the man’s ring on purpose.

“Who invited you,” Maya asked, her voice sugar, her face hungrier.

“Friends,” Gabe said. “People with money and chairs.”

“A thrilling demographic,” Maya said.

Ramiro had circled to the man’s left like a persistent idea. If you were a poem, you would think twice before trying to be free verse around Ramiro.

“You came up from the South?” Adrian asked, conversational, running a finger along the banister as if complimenting the wood. He left a smear of bright behind. If you could see it, it would have clung like summer. “We get your kind of dust sometimes in the corners.”

Gabe’s face did something odd and then went beautifully bland. “I think I’m lost, then,” he said. “We are always where we are meant to be.”

“That’s the sort of thing that gets laughed at when the check doesn’t clear,” Maya murmured, but she smiled too. It was a smile she used often, the one that said, yes, tell me more about investment, you mysterious sublet of a man.

The House hummed again, and this time Adrian understood the note. He felt it through the soles of his shoes. There’s a wrongness you can mistake for perfume if you want to be fooled. He did not want to be.

“We should take a walk,” Adrian said.

“Where?” Gabe asked.

“Upstairs,” he said. “To see some wood.”

Gabe gave him a look that landed on flirt and slid into suspicion. “I like wood as much as the next person.”

“Who is the next person,” Maya asked cheerfully. “So I can be jealous properly.”

“This House keeps secrets,” Adrian said. “It is a good confidant. Sometimes it shows them if after so much asking, the asker has earned something.”

“Are you trying to show me a secret,” Gabe asked.

“I am trying to decide if you’ve brought any that will hurt my city,” Adrian said, and smiled, and Gabe blinked, because he had just been told a truth without someone doing a pretty build up first.

They took the back stairs, where the walls keep old heat close and the railing remembered hands. The House did a polite creak. It likes to let you think it is old and feeble when it is neither. In the hallway at the top, the wood darkened and inhaled, and the room that had been a study in someone’s memory opened its mouth like it wanted to tell a story.

Adrian went in first. He stood in the center and held his palms up. Lights came awake and sizzled, not electricity, not exactly; older. People who didn’t know would think he had found a switch with his foot, which was fine. Maya leaned against the door and put her phone away. Ramiro took a position near a window where his shoulder could stop any foolishness that came through glass.

“Gabe,” Adrian said. He uses the name like a tool, this time.

“Yes,” Gabe said. There it was again, the flicker under the voice; the place where anger lives under bluff and laughter, the place where someone told him he was owed.

“Do you want to tell me why the Arroyo’s teeth hurt today,” Adrian asked. “Why there’s glass in the channels.”

Gabe’s throat moved. He tried on a few expressions and didn’t like them. He came to rest on a version of contrition you buy at the farmer’s market.

“I only wanted to see if the stories were real,” he said. “No harm—”

“There is always harm. It’s your job to keep it small,” Adrian said. “Who asked you to see.”

“I ask myself,” he said, but he was not a good liar yet. He had not had to be. People had believed his ring. People had seen a name in his mouth and nodded.

“There’s a prince in the South who puts his name on pieces of glass,” Adrian said. “Like a dog. I found his call sign in the lines of the bridge. You carry a flavor like red dust. Like old wealth. He would suit you.”

Gabe’s hand went to his ring before he could stop it. He laughed, which told on him. When he spoke it was too fast. “Names are complicated.”

“It is my job to untangle them,” Adrian said.

“What are you,” Gabe said, and his voice softened. There might have been awe in it, if he had ever had the kind of childhood that trained you to be awed by the right things. “You aren’t just some boy with a neighborhood association.”

“I am a boy with a neighborhood that has an opinion,” Adrian said. “And with the old work my family keeps doing because someone should. And with magic that isn’t very photogenic but does the long task.” He lifted one hand and the wood sighed like it remembered rain. “I am a prince,” he added. He did not say of what. That part was understood here and nowhere else.

The silence swelled. The House liked a pause. It has learned this from so many dinners where someone needed a breath to change their mind. The House held its breath too. The city outside turned a notch darker.

Gabe’s face cracked into something that looked like himself more and like his ring less. “I didn’t think there was anyone,” he said, and then he stopped, because you should not say you thought you were the only one. That confession is a weakness nine different arrogant men had found before and every one of them had been startled by the end of the second act.

“What did you try,” Maya asked, because sometimes she said serious things exactly the same way she said ‘I brought snacks.’ “Under the bridge. Did you try to take something.”

“I tried to unhook a thing I can’t see because my teacher says sometimes the world only shows you half and you have to pull the rest into the light,” Gabe said. “I tried to tug the part that hummed. It fought back. The air went hot.”

“Names, Gabe,” Adrian said. “Teachers have names. Those of us who spend our nights talking to bridges cannot keep trusting pronouns.”

“He is a friend,” Gabe said carefully. “We… share a taste for mischief.”

The way he said mischief made the hair on Ramiro’s arms rise. There is a way some men say mischief as a word that means ruin with cute shoes. Ramiro didn’t move. He didn’t need to. The window and his shoulder were enough.

“Kaedren,” Maya said. She liked to be the one to say the name; she did not believe in the superstition yet because she believed in her recorder and light. “Is he the friend,” she asked, and there was a curl of laughter around the last word she did not bother to hide.

Gabe flinched like the name had a smell. He did not nod; that is not how children of great names admit things. He did not deny; that is not how children of great names survive. He touched the ring again.

“I’m sorry,” he said, not to Maya, not to Adrian, maybe to the House. “I wanted to see if I could do it. If I could come to a place like this and say, open.”

“Open,” the House said, complete non sequitur, and a door that had not been there was there. Adrian swore under his breath and caught the edge of it with his hand before the hinge could decide it was a metaphor. The House giggled.

“Behave,” Adrian said to one of the few buildings in the county he would call ‘friend’ without irony.

“It’s hot in here,” the House complained. “It tastes like glass.”

“It will be all right,” Adrian said, and this time he said it for more than one set of ears.

Maya had her hand on her bag like she had a knife in there instead of a notebook. “Are we doing this now,” she said quietly. “Because my editor doesn’t pay me enough to get dragged into an extradimensional cabinet without a snack.”

“We are not doing extradimensional cabinets today,” Adrian said, which was true but not particularly comforting. “We are doing introductions. Then we are doing manners.”

He turned back to Gabe. “Don’t go back to the bridge,” he said. “You will hurt the wrong thing. Or the right thing, which is worse. Tell your friend that if he wants a conversation, he needs to ask and not scratch. Tell him he should not test the old structures in a town that remembers two earthquakes like family stories. Tell him I will meet him where the roses turn the water red in the fountain by the elephant statues at six tomorrow morning, because he will not be able to sleep and I will not either.”

“You…” Gabe’s voice had gone strange, a little boy’s for a word. He took a breath and slid it back into his mouth. “You think he will come because you told him to.”

“I think he will come because he woke up this morning and wanted a fight with someone who could hold his attention for longer than three minutes,” Adrian said. “Tell him he is not the only prince with time on his hands.”

Gabe laughed, sudden and rich. “You are vain,” he said.

“I am correct,” Adrian said. “This is usually the problem; they are often the same thing.”

Ramiro’s phone buzzed in his pocket with the insistence that means city business, not family. He looked at the screen, and his mouth thinned. “We have a problem,” he said. “Old Field. There’s a fire at the Rose Bowl.”

The room changed weight. Maya’s face went still in the way she did when she wanted to be fast. The House murmured goodbye without meaning it. Gabe’s expression flickered. Adrian was moving before any of them finished reshaping their thoughts.

“Stay,” he said to Gabe. “If you run I will send the House after you and you will never find a stairway that goes down again in your life. Maya—”

“You don’t have to tell me,” she said. “I’ll take the south road. I know the fence like it owes me money.”

“Ramiro—”

“We’ll use the service exit,” he said. “I already called the engine house. They think it’s a flare that got loose.”

“It isn’t,” Adrian said, and the lace in his fingers was back, and he didn’t remember making it. He pushed it into the air and it made a line that wanted to be a path. He walked it with his teeth clenched. The House stepped aside as much as a house can.

The night was bright in the wrong way at the Bowl. You could see it from the drive; that weird sodium bloom that looks the same in every city but has different recipes. People were gathered like birds; the security guys had their arms out as if they could hug the emergency away. The air tasted like spice rubbed into rot. Someone had put a pattern into the trash bins near the concessions; that’s where it started. Adrian felt it before he saw it—someone had made a loop, a piece of playful craft that was not. Not playful at all when air ran through it and turned dumb into hungry. He put his palm out and the loop shuddered, like a mosquito being trapped between palms.

“Move,” he said, and he said it in the old voice, the one that makes people move if they are not used to telling the world no. Bodies shifted. A woman cried as if she had been waiting all night to do it. He walked to the first bin and lifted his hand. The flames gathered and got ready to be righteous. He told them that they had had their fun and that there would be more later, in controlled situations with adults present. They fought, of course. Fires do. But the loop had made them proud; when you give a small thing a name, it behaves as if you have given it a job. He took the loop out of the air and fed it to his shiver of light. He took a breath and whispered to the metal. It remembered its own cool.

The second bin had a ribbon of glass lying across its lid. If you didn’t know, you’d think it was a trick of light, a heat-mirage. He squatted and looked it in the eye. He had a word ready. He spoke it. It broke, and the break made a resilient little chime.

“Who did this?” someone asked, because that is what people always ask.

“We did,” Maya said, next to him, camera shutter a clatter. “Because we invited the wrong boys to a party and then gave them fireworks.”

Adrian looked around, heart dancing against his ribs. He saw him then. Not Gabe. The outline of someone across the bowl, near the stairs that lead to the cheap seats. It was a long outline. It had a walk that was practiced to be careless. It had a laugh around it like a scent. He could not see the face. The ring on his finger was a moonlit grin. He lifted his hand as if in salute. He went.

Adrian put the fire behind him out of his mind long enough to take four steps to the guard rail, vault, and drop. He went down into the bowl like a line on a map. The air thickened as if embarrassed. He caught up to nothing and everything techs call a hologram and witches call an apology. There was no one. But the old concrete carried a sound, and it was laughter, and it knew the name someone had scratched into it earlier in the day with a piece of unacceptable glass.

“Kaedren,” Adrian said under his breath, and the concrete groaned. His mouth tasted like a penny. He felt a hand at his elbow so strong it didn’t need to be visible.

“Don’t give him the satisfaction,” Ramiro said. “Don’t say the name. Let him come tomorrow. Let him be bored tonight, and hungry.”

Adrian realized he had been shaking. He hadn’t felt cold; he felt now. He had talent for a certain kind of magic. He had a city under his shoes and shoulders. He had an aunt who had taught him to find broken threads and tie them with humor instead of brute force. He had a friend in a black dress with a pen that could be a sword. He had a man with a ring upstairs in his House who was either a messenger or the message.

He stood. He faced the crowd and held up his hand and told them it would be fine, which wasn’t true, which wasn’t a lie. People calmed, because people want to. He put the last loop into his teeth and chewed it into nothing.

On the drive back across the bridge the lights burned steady. The hum had quieted, but inside it another note had taken up residence. Not heat. Not cold. The feeling when you understand a joke that you wish you did not. The city breathed him in and let him out.

“You see?” Aunt Lina said on the phone when he called her and gave her three sentences and one laugh. “It starts with parties and ends with trying to keep someone from unzipping the neighborhood to see how it works. Don’t be polite tomorrow.”

“I will be intolerable,” he said, and that made her sigh happily, which had always been ridiculous and perfect.

“You should sleep,” Maya said, from the back seat, staring at the night like it had a headline buried in it. “You should eat something that isn’t iced coffee. You should not meet a prince at a fountain at sunrise like you are reenacting a bad poem.”

“I will make it a good poem,” he said. “Anyway, he’ll be late.”

“He’ll be early,” she said.

“He’ll send someone instead,” Ramiro said.

“He’ll come himself and he will want to put his hands on the water,” Adrian said. He tasted the ends of the world on his tongue and found that they tasted like jacaranda, which was to say, like the color purple pretending to be a fruit. “And I will let him, and I will see what he leaves behind when he takes them away.”

“And if he is the kind who breaks things for the sound of it?” Maya asked. The city outside the window flicked a moth-wing of light.

“Then,” Adrian said, and the House murmured yes under his skin even though he was nowhere near it now, “we will introduce him to the part of Pasadena that doesn’t like to be messed. We will show him that the old bridge has teeth. We will show him the way to the bars we keep for boys who come to my city and leave it worse.”

Ramiro barked a laugh once, sharp as a knot. “Tomorrow,” he said. He lived in the word like a soldier and a father both.

“Tomorrow,” Adrian agreed. He opened his palm and found he had kept the shard of glass his aunt had given him without knowing he had done it. He held it up to the streetlight. It split the arc into pieces that didn’t add back up. He thought of a boy whose ring had cracked where you could polish but not fix it. He thought of a man whose name made concrete lean to listen. He thought of the water by the elephants, waiting.

Outside, somewhere, coyotes sang like laughter. Inside, he let his breath go soft, like a good liar, like a good prince, like someone who knows sleep isn’t about rest but about letting your edges oil themselves so they don’t rust before the next thing.

He slept with the shard under his pillow, which is childish, and which is to say it was wise. The night did not come for it. The night had an appointment. The night licked at the edges of a fountain where roses bleached the water red and waited, restless, like a prince who considered himself an idea and not a person and was about to find out how wrong he was.Dawn came in with the kind of light that thinks it invented gentleness, and Pasadena let it pretend. The jacaranda confetti from yesterday had welded itself to the curb like a child’s art project left in a hot car, and the sprinklers were doing their best to make everything smell like damp penny and cut grass. Adrian stood by the elephant fountain with his sleeves rolled and a paper bag tucked under his arm like an apology. The elephants were stone and bronze and something older folded underneath; they wore their lichen like old men wear eyebrows. Their trunks poured a steady riff, and the water was the color of tea kissed by roses, a blush that stained the edges of the basin as if someone had been making dye here for a century and forgot to stop.

He had brought a few things because he was his mother’s son and because his aunt had a superstition that offerings make meetings into agreements and not challenges. There was a jar of honey whose label had more sincerity than design, a twist of salt, a roll that had been a roll until he whispered at it and it became a loaf with a better opinion of itself, and two oranges because the city likes circles and the pulp inside made him think of certain kinds of summer. He set them on the bench where the plaque pretended to tell the whole history of the place and leaned both hands on the lip of the fountain. The stone was cool. It hummed back when he touched it, and the hum had the patient bass of old, heavy things that remember not dropping the world when asked to carry it for a bit.

Ramiro stood off by the path that looked like a suggestion; his suit made the early hour look formal even if the lamplight hadn’t given up yet. He did not touch his ear because he never needed to let anyone know he was listening. There were two other shapes in the park who were dog walkers at six in the morning unless they weren’t; Aunt Lina had left him a ribbon in a message that found his coffee and the ribbon now hung in a rag of shadow between two oleanders, which means she was near enough to slap his hand if he made a fool’s grammar mistake. Maya came up the path five minutes after he did, barefoot because she said the grass and her brain liked each other better with fewer rules between them, shoes slung by their laces and swinging like punctuation at her knee.

“If he stands you up,” she said by way of hello, “I get the oranges.”

“If he stands me up,” Adrian said, “you can have my turn at being insufferable when we see him next.”

“You are hoarding insufferable today,” she said, but her eyes were awake in the way they got when she was about to put a story’s throat between two fingers and murmur please tell me how you think this ends. She touched the edge of the fountain and then her mouth, a gesture that was old in her family for hello to any place that remembered seeing your grandfather write checks with a pen that leaked.

He had not slept properly. He had dreamed in shards, edges he could not quite take hold of, light that wanted to sit in his palm and then thought better of it and slid around his fingers. The shard of glass under his pillow had warmed against his ear as if it wanted to hum the song of its name. The city had breathed and not quite settled. His aunt’s voice at midnight had been all scold, none comfort, which was how she did love when there were knives sharpened on dawn.

He didn’t expect early. He had told himself that men like this are never early; they take the leisure of lateness as a privilege and a tool. It was six minutes before six when the air on the other side of the fountain went from being an obedient medium to something with an opinion. Heat rose off the water for no reason the morning would admit, and the reflections got more interested in themselves. It was not a door opening. That would have required mercy or engineering. It was a fold coming flat, a shimmer in the kind of place where a shimmer might be chalked up to dew if you prefer your life tidy. Then there he was, sitting on the stone rim like a boy who had been born in a saddle and got bored, ankles crossed, one hand on the warm back of the nearest elephant like he had been formally introduced.

Kaedren had the sort of pretty that knew about knives. It wasn’t the fine-featured cinematic thing; he had breadth where it mattered and a mouth that was too soft until it wasn’t. He had a shadow at his cheekbones that said he slept when time gave up and not before. His jacket was dust-colored and too expensive for the way he wore it like a borrowed shirt from the laundry line. The ring was there, catching the first solid fat of daylight, a promise of silver with a line of hurt in it like a healed bone. A red thread had tied his right wrist once and left a mark; you could see the ghost of it if you knew to look. He smiled as if someone had dared him not to.

“You brought breakfast,” he said. His voice did the desert thing—flat as a horizon until you drove it, and then there were canyon turns that would take your axle if you got cocky. He looked at the oranges like he had eaten them in rooms with maps on the walls and arguments around the table. “Are we courting. Your city looks like a boy who knows how to take his shirt off at a pool party and still have a book in his back pocket. I respect your audacity.”

“You are in my fountain,” Adrian said, and the politeness was so polished you could check your hair in it. “We do welcomes, not courtships, at sunrise. Also warnings when needed. Would you like bread.”

“Always,” Kaedren said, and then he put both hands in his lap and didn’t take any, which made the respect he had just been pretending at different in flavor. He leaned without haste and touched the water with the heel of his right hand. The blush took his skin gladly. He lifted his hand and turn it so the light could look. “I do like things that stain. Makes truth lazy. It can’t run."

Ramiro’s shoulder did a small shift that most men could not make less than an invitation to violence. Maya didn’t look at him; she looked at Kaedren like light breaking through live oak leaves, fascinated and annoyed. She made a mental note where she would put the comma in the sentence where she first quoted him in print. It was right after stain, she decided, before it could run.

“I put out your little game at the Bowl,” Adrian said. “You should leave your fireworks for the people who pay for permits.”

“I gave my people the morning off,” Kaedren said mildly. “I am nothing if not considerate. Besides, that was only a walk. You overvalue circles of trash-pleasantness; it is charming.” He looked down at his hand and spread his fingers and let the rose-water run down into his palm, then blew the droplets off like a magician at a child’s party. The droplets hung and then became beads of slag that hit the stone and grew a skin of heat visible to anyone who has ever stuck a tongue to a car in August. The nearest elephant drew its trunk in one inch.

“Your manners are confusing,” Aunt Lina said, and when her voice came from the oleanders everyone in the park became very interested in not seeing a woman pull a stick of cinnamon from the air and point it like a decoration that had ideas. “But we can work with confusing. Sit properly and let my nephew do the talking parts. He is trained to be fascinating with his mouth.”

“It is good to meet women who think I should be told to sit,” Kaedren said, and he stood instead and put his hands into his pockets like a schoolboy who had never suffered for curiosity. He was tall enough to make Adrian, who had never been told to be shorter, raise his chin if he wanted their eyes to agree. Adrian did not oblige; he looked at the elephant again, and the elephant’s stone eye caught a bit of morning in it like a tiny coin being slipped for safekeeping.

“There are older rules than yours,” Kaedren said. He did not add “boy.” He did not need to. “The maps tell me this channel belongs to the March when the water slips south under certain moons and certain arrangements of cement. The old promise spoke to my grandfather at a tent-hinge with three kings and a judge sitting under a machine that thought it was a tree. We lend this corridor our breath when it is thirsty. That makes it ours three days out of thirteen.”

“The Charter speaks to the stone and the water both,” Adrian said, and the fountain took a breath behind him like a well-trained accompanist. “No one in this zip code will pretend your paper never got ink. But when you say corridor you mean umbilical, and when you say lend you mean test, and when you say ours you mean mine if I can. The Arroyo is not a pipe you can smoke when you are bored and throw in the river when you are done bragging. You scratch under my bridge again and I will ask the engineers to wake up the old sand and for one morning it will remember it is human and it will go looking for ankles.”

He said it with a smile because fury is more frightening when you can rest your head on it and pretend it is a pillow. Kaedren looked at him and there it was—the flicker where pride considers itself equal to appetite and isn’t wrong yet. He did not step back from the edge of the fountain. He set one foot on a carved ear and leaned into the posture that says I am perfectly in command; forgive me if it is tiring to demonstrate.

“I wanted to see if you were real,” he said, and the confession was almost sweet. “The rumors make princes into cautionary pamphlets. You did not set your hair on fire trying to impress me, which puts you ahead of three dukelings I could name. You have people who love you who are not paid by the hour. Your house has a giggle. These are good signs.”

“You don’t get to diagnose my city,” Adrian said pleasantly. “You get to decide whether you are going to test my patience to the point where my aunt starts reciting saints in a language that makes your molars itch.”

“I don’t have a saint to my name,” Kaedren said. “I have a mother who liked to name rocks, and a father who told me the first three names of any land are Tax, Water, and Road. He was dull on purpose; he is still alive in a way that insults poems. He told me that where the water cracks the earth you find the people who think they can make a path of it without asking. He told me to look.”

“I know that kind of father,” Adrian said. He put both palms on the fountain and felt the skin of the water close to his wrists. It felt like a cheek in the dark. He did not look away from the boy standing across from him because this was not the sort of conversation you gave the sky to witness without permission. “You can look. You don’t get to poke. If you want to use, you knock and you leave something that isn’t trouble.”

“And if I say I already left a token under your bridge,” Kaedren said. “A piece of my name, because the bridge claimed no one because no one claimed it. It opened like a good dog to a whistle.”

“You don’t leave your actual name,” Aunt Lina snapped. “You never leave anything but a friend of a friend of a pseudonym unless you want to wake up full of ants. But you’re the sort of boy who likes to wear the coat without a shirt. Of course you left something that bites.”

“It was a small bite,” he said, as if he could make it a joke, and the park pretended not to taste the way the early morning had just turned the temperature of a hand pressed to a windowpane. He took his hands out of his pockets and held them palm-out like a man surrendering without interest. “I am not here to open the Arroyo like a zipper and look at your underwear drawer. The March has diversions in other places where the neighbors enjoy being unpopular. This place interests me because your wards taste like clever. I like clever. I sometimes… misuse my hunger for it.”

“You just said hunger because you want me to be kind,” Adrian said. “You mistake me for someone who listens to metaphors and forgets they’re knives.”

Maya stepped around to the part of the fountain where the stone was rough enough to snag a nightgown if you were careless. She looked at Kaedren like a story that isn’t done with itself yet. “I have a question,” she said, and her voice made the question sound unserious, tempting him to underestimate it. “The shards. The glass with your name etched on the inside. Who did you tell to carry them. The boy with the ring that mirrors yours but not. He had the look of someone running errands for applause he hasn’t earned yet.”

Kaedren’s face almost did a flinch and then decided not to. He looked across the water at Maya and gave her the sort of smile people give when they are selecting one another like a knife in a drawer. “Ah,” he said softly. “Journalists. The last magicians. I asked a boy to make a sketch. He has hands too quick for his head. He wanted a sugar rush; I gave him a topic. He needed to see a city that had not minted him yet. He is mine for a season because he can leave when it becomes unslick. You want to tell me I should not keep pets. Watch me pretend to want to learn.”

“His name is Gabe,” Adrian said flatly, because he had not been polite the second he had decided not to be. “Don’t make me teach him not to jump for a treat. Don’t make me teach you what happens when a building with teeth decides it can be a cage.”

Kaedren’s hand went to his ring and then away and he did not know he had done it, which was his sharpest tell. “You could keep him,” he said. “If you want. He’d learn to sit for you. He likes you already.”

“Stop talking about him like he is a dog,” Maya said, and the elephants listened to the whip in her voice and one of them made its trunk water run harder as if to drown some small mean thing. “He’s a boy who thinks attention is currency because that is what you handed him. He is also not our topic. You scratched a bridge. Are you done.”

There were three breaths that hopped between them like children who don’t know which lap to sit in. The park beyond the roses did the morning things it was supposed to do—the jogger with headphones running through the edges of this because she had a playlist insisting she was not a person in a chapter, a groundskeeper who paused and pretended to check his watch because the air said, look away. The elephants made the sound old fountains make, that almost-voice of water over clenched stone.

“I’ll pay,” Kaedren said at last, as if it cost him more to say it than the thing itself would cost. “I’ll hang a weight off the wrong side so the right one can feel good again. I’ll mend the tear I made in your hum if you show me where it is too thin already. I felt it. That isn’t my fault, even if mischief made me put my hand on it. Your bridge is tired. Something gnaws at the edges that doesn’t care for names or the stories you put on them.”

Ramiro looked at Adrian and made a face with three lines in it: we expected a fight, we got a bargain, I have more guns than I have patience. Aunt Lina in the oleanders did not come out, which meant she was either doing a complicated handshape to keep the sun from being rude or she was biting her tongue until it bled enough to satisfy caution.

“Show me your hands,” Adrian said. It was not a metaphysical request. He wanted to see the way a boy like this lived with his nails, his calluses, the half-moons that tell you who a person thinks they are. Kaedren held his hands out without protest. They were not soft. He had the climb marks at the crooks of his fingers you get from fences and decisions; he had burned a knuckle recently; the ring’s crack had a shadow that was not quite a shadow, as if the metal had taken a tiny bite out of its wearer when it split and never given it back.

“All right,” Adrian said. “You can pay. You don’t get to choose how. We need memory. We’ll take it from your water.”

“You want me to give you what I remember of why the bridge tastes wrong,” Kaedren said. “You do like your metaphors to have teeth.”

“We’re practical,” Adrian said. He put his thumb into the fountain and drew a clean line on the stone in front of him, then used his other hand to marshal a hunk of light that wanted to be a lace and made it a napkin instead, because the fountain would like a ceremony even if it was just a cartoon. He nodded at the nearest elephant and the elephant’s trunk dipped like an aunt’s head when presented with a baby. “Put your hand under and think about the underside of concrete. Think about old metal. Think about your own name and then forget it and then think about it again.”

“Will it hurt,” Kaedren asked, and his amused drawl took one step to the side into something almost honest.

“It will be humiliating,” Aunt Lina said, sweet as tea and twice as likely to stain. “You’ll be fine.”

Kaedren did it. He slid his hand under the run of water and his face changed shape in the way faces do when their owners are busy somewhere else. The water clung to him like a child too tall to be carried; his lips parted and he whispered words that did not belong to this park. Adrian stood and kept the lace-napkin in the air and watched, and Maya watched him watching and did not reach for her phone because her hands were smarter than her ambition this morning.

The water told on him. It gave up a ripple that wasn’t just a ripple; it was a map of pressure, a contour of places where the city had thinned. Adrian could taste the echoes as they ran into his palms. He saw the bridge, yes, but also a seam near the shadow of a freeway overpass where kids kiss and tag their allegiance and go home with their hands smelling like ink; he saw the low place near a culvert where dogs refuse to pull when their leashes ring; he saw a curve in the dry riverbed where someone had left a cabinet and a promise. It wasn’t just Kaedren scratching. Something else had been crawling along the inside of the city like a child under a table during a party, pulling at the tablecloth to see who would notice when the cake slid.

“That,” Kaedren said, breathless, and he said it in a voice he had not used with them yet, the one he uses when he tells himself the thing he will not tell anyone else. “Do you see that seam. It isn’t of me. It’s of… the absence you pretend not to notice when building because admitting to it gives it a birth certificate. We don’t have a name for it either. You throw your rules across it and it laughs until five in the morning and then it sleeps and spoils everything it sweats on.”

“Rot,” Aunt Lina said, and from the oleanders the ribbon of shadow shifted and made a new knot. “Old rot. The kind that wears a good suit: time, neglect, the bored cruelty of people with spare keys. There is a kind of spirit that likes to live in ‘not my job.’ We try to starve it. It eats teenagers’ stubbornness and weak concrete. Your mischief fed it sugar. Of course it liked you.”

“Everything likes me,” Kaedren said, and he almost made it funny. He took his hand out of the water and shook it with injudicious grace. The rosy tint left his skin grudgingly, as if it had thought perhaps it would keep him as a souvenir. He looked at his palm and watched it forget. “All right. You were correct; humiliation is its own flavor. Take what you need,” he said to Adrian, and the words were almost elegant, almost careless, exactly calculated.

Adrian blew on the lace until it sighed into a more useful shape. He took the map the water had been and turned it into a thread of light that ran along the lip of the fountain and then off across the lawn like a kid trailing a streamer. He snapped his fingers and it dipped at the culvert, lifted at the freeway, danced at the riverbed. He tucked the end of it into the facet on the nearest elephant’s tusk, and the elephant rumbled in the quiet little way that means yes, dear, I see. He did not look at Kaedren while he did this because that would be letting the boy think the performance was for him.

“What do you want,” he asked, once the thread had settled down and started humming like a cat that pretends to be offended by its own purr. “Beyond cleverness. Beyond being seen. I don’t believe you cross cities because you want an unflattering newspaper photo.”

“Honeycomb,” Kaedren said, as if he had surprised himself. He looked at the loaf and reached for it and didn’t, again, like the boy he might have been in another story. “I want the map to make sense when I close my eyes. I want to open something that says it opens for me and not just because the right price was paid by my great-uncle. I want to take my ring off and still have a name worth swallowing. You don’t get kingship from wishes. You get it from debt. I came to see if your debt tasted better than mine.”

“Then borrow my manners and stop calling your tricks by the names of doors,” Adrian said. It wasn’t gentle but it wasn’t cruel. He wanted the boy to hear him and he had learned early that some boys will only hear when you make the words taste like metal. “No more scratches. No more tasks for boys who have more grin than sense. If you want to play at my edge, you do it where I can watch. Come to my House when it does not have donors in it if you need a laugh that will not set anyone’s hair on fire. Leave the Arroyo for those of us with its teeth prints on our ankles.”

Kaedren took a breath and turned it into a shrug. “All right,” he said, and the way he said it told Adrian that the boy had lost nothing when he learned the trick of pretending to surrender. “I’ll bring you a thing. A mend for your hum. A small piece of what my line keeps near our wrists, the thing we press on sick rooms and staking grounds. You will like it and think I am an angel and write me notes. We will be very brave boys together in a world that wants our bravery to be less than it could be.”

“If you bring me a halo I will melt it and make wind chimes,” Adrian said, and at last the corner of his mouth did the wicked thing he kept back for those who have earned both his fondness and his escorted exits. “You may visit my House tonight when the donors have been put to bed and the hallways want breath. Midnight. Bring the boy if you can keep him from trying to steal anyone’s reflection on his way there.”

“Gabe will come if I tell him there is a staircase that cannot be conquered by sprinting,” Kaedren said. He put one palm on the elephant’s stone head as if thanking it for its attention and then hopped lightly down to the path. For a second he was a younger version of himself, the one who had taken a dare and climbed a wall and looked back to see if anyone had noticed. He must have seen that Adrian had, because he straightened and put adulthood back on like a jacket he was almost used to. “Tell your aunt I like her ribbon trick,” he said into the oleanders. “Tell your guard he’s wasted in a suit. Tell your journalist if she prints me I will write her a correction letter that will be a thing of beauty and she will have to decide whether to frame it or burn it.”

Maya smiled with half her mouth and showed a hint of tooth that suggested she did not mind boys who threatened her with prose as long as they spelled everything. “I am not a journalist this morning,” she said. “I am a woman with elbows and a pair of running shoes. Don’t encourage me.”

He made her a little bow he had learned from a woman who had laughed at him while teaching him to tread with grace, and then he looked back at Adrian again. The glance had question in it, and something else, the thing that wants to test someone in a way that might lead to friendship if both survive. “Your bridge,” he said more quietly. “The thing under it. I’ll pull my sign out. It will sulk. It will not make you safer, only less direct. But I… I will not be your mess today. I have other circles to set back upright. I won’t apologize for wanting to pull, but I will admit you were right to be irritated.”

“Go do your chores,” Adrian said. “Come back when you are ready to tell me what you call rot and I’ll show you which of my friends hates it enough to make a sport of it.”

“I don’t have friends,” he said reflexively, and then he cut himself off because his mouth had told on him and he was old enough to hear it. “Fine. I have allies who would condescend to be friends if the poetry was good enough.”

“Bring better poetry,” Aunt Lina said. “If you’re going to bother my nephew, you will use words like an adult.”

Kaedren held up his hand and saluted her shadow, then tapped his ring on the stone rim of the fountain once, twice. The sound had pitch and then it didn’t, like a bell that didn’t know if it wanted to be in a church or a ship. The air by his shoulder trembled and turned into a heat blur the shape of a doorway for someone who would prefer a window. He stepped into it as if the only sensible thing to do with such a door is trust it immediately and not look down. The space healed itself without fuss; the elephant closest to where he had been smoothed its stony forehead like a cat after you set down a child.

“Do we like him,” Maya asked after a beat, tasting the question like a bite into fruit you suspect of having a worm in it. “I can live with annoying. I have a harder time living with men who eat mirrors for breakfast.”

“I dislike that I like him,” Adrian said. He closed his eyes and turned the thread he had loosed into the air into a neat loop, then bit it and swallowed because sometimes you can make the magic think you will finish your vegetables if it gets to watch. “I will dislike it a great deal more if it makes me do something noble. Give me your shoes; talking to princes always makes my arches feel like I wore the wrong opinions.”

Maya handed him one sneaker with the solemnity of a woman who has discovered an excellent ritual. She took an orange and peeled it in one long strip because her grandmother had used to tell her that this is how you keep long luck. The peel sprayed a microscopic mist of oil into the morning, and the fountain approved. Ramiro came close enough to take a piece of bread and eat it without comment. His jaw told them he had his own thoughts about boys who arrive out of reflections and leave without apologizing to the light for putting fingerprints on it.

Aunt Lina slid out of the shade the way a curtain lets the light through slowly on purpose. She had on a sweater the color of early oranges because she always dressed like a bruise made considerate. She kissed the air an inch from Adrian’s cheek because his skin hummed and she had no desire to be conductive. “He was early,” she said, as if that was a sin worthy of the index. “That’s new. That means not all of him is performing.”

“Part of him is looking for something to kneel to,” Adrian said. He wasn’t trying to be kind; he was trying to be accurate. He tore the loaf and handed her the piece with the heel because she liked the crunch that tried her teeth. He stood and let his shoulders feel the morning on them and watched the thread over the lawn settle into the grass like a shaved path. “We have work.”

“We always do,” Aunt Lina said, and she wrapped the ribbon back around two fingers and it vanished the way old tricks do when they are finished being dignified. “I will go talk to gravity at the culvert. You will take the freeway seam. Ramiro, go tell those cops who always pretend you are going to bite them that if they see a shadow that looks like a filing cabinet, they are to shoot at the ground and see if the dirt wants to be helpful. Maya, go pretend to be a jogger and listen to people talk to themselves. I want overheard nonsense by noon.”

Maya grinned and put her shoes on and made a face that told all of them she would never be a jogger, not even under duress, but she would be whatever a story needed in order to be led to its next line. “What about the House,” she asked. “Midnight. If we’re patching rot until then, are we going to have enough breath left to flirt with architecture and interrogate a princelet who keeps promising metaphors he thinks are flattering.”

“The House will do most of the flirting on its own,” Adrian said. “It likes boys who think they are ideas, because it enjoys showing them the precise place where they are just wood and nails. We will rest this afternoon. We will be selfish with our food. We will not be heroes until after ten. That’s a family rule.”

Ramiro snorted, which means he agreed and was making a note to call someone whose existence he pretended he did not acknowledge. His people liked to step into alleys like they lived there; they would be glad of an errand that did not involve donors or fireworks. He touched Adrian’s shoulder once, because he had not touched him while the boy from the South had been putting his mouth on the morning. He said nothing, which is the most eloquent form of permission.

They split like a cell, not like an argument. The fountain watched them go and let its blush deepen in the kind of pride that buildings get when their friends use them properly. Birds that had been debating whether or not to be noisy decided yes, and trilled in the eucalyptus with the vigor of people who are not paid enough to care about politics.

The freeway seam tasted like lost things and heat. Adrian parked under a piece of shade that was being generous and took off his shoes because he wanted to be reminded what concrete felt like when it was being a ceiling for a river. The pillars held up the river of cars with the ancient patience of pack animals. The underside of the overpass had murals that people had painted because they’d been asked to stop painting other places; the colors were trying to drown the gray and doing a decent job until the rot came and licked at their edges. He put his hand to the wall and listened, and there it was, the lazy chew of something that did not want to move until it could ruin what you built on top of it.

He did the work the way his aunt had taught him when he still had to stand on a crate to reach certain edges. He made the lace and did not let it turn into net. He fed it stories about the city—the boy with the balloon, the House that laughed, the last time he had cried because a woman with a garden had shown him a flower that only opens for widows. He told the wall it was beautiful on purpose and not because someone couldn’t afford better. He told the rot that it was seen and that being seen is not the same as being permitted. He used the honey he had not given Kaedren and dabbed it where the concrete had gone chalky and the sweetness drew something pale and waspish out of the pores and made it embarrassed enough to hide.

By the time he finished, he was sweating in a way that made his hair stick to his forehead. He sat with his back against a pillar and let his hands go cold, and the cool went into his bones the way forgiveness goes into people who did not think they deserved it. He ate the orange Maya had not claimed, biting and letting the juice make his fingers sticky, and he licked it clean because you clean up when you ask a place to be good.

His phone buzzed. Maya sent a picture of the culvert: a shadow that looked like a piece of a room trailing its errand into daylight, an angle that made your eyes think you were tired. Aunt Lina had responded with a heart and a fish, which meant the rot liked to swim along any slick it found. Ramiro sent a photo of a police officer pretending to look at a sandwich while standing on a charm he had drawn in chalk that looked like a hopscotch board with opinions. Gabe texted, too, which was a surprise that arrived like a bee deciding your shirt is its business.

they let me leave the House, the message said. i didn’t steal anything except a feeling. the House kept the feeling and made me apologize to a step with a knot in it. is midnight a hard time or a poetic time. should i bring shoes that won’t squeak.

Adrian stared at the words for a moment and watched his own mouth do the thing it did when he wanted to be older than he was and kinder than he felt. He typed without consulting his better self because that one would only have edited for cruelty.

Midnight is when the House stretches. Wear shoes you can run in. Bring your stubbornness; check it with the cloakroom. If you see Kaedren before then, tell him that if he is going to borrow my metaphors, he should at least have the decency to bring them back folded.

He closed his eyes after pressing send and let the freeway sing over him and the city feel like a body he did not have to hold up on his own. The rot would not have expected attention this early, which made this kind of morning the best kind of luck. His aunt would braid something into the culvert that would make water blush itself away from the seam for a week; Ramiro would talk to men who think magic is a word used by people who stand in the way of their day, and he would convince them to chalk charms as if they were being paid by the square. Maya would listen for confessions that got said on the backswing of gossip and write none of them down until she had the paper’s lawyer safe and fed.

He’d go home after, say yes to three emails, say no to five, let the House pat him on the shoulder through the whisper of its eaves and tell him he was trying very hard. He would put the shard of glass back under his pillow like a ridiculous boy and he would sleep for an hour with his face turned to the wall. He would wake with the taste of jacaranda in his mouth again and the certainty that the night would bring a different kind of gentle with teeth.

At midnight, the House would loosen its fingernails and tap at the wood as if asking a drum what tempo it preferred. The stairs would let their signatures out into the air. In the great room, under the rafters that were not pretending to be a boat and not trying to be a barn, two princes would tell each other what they thought words were for. One of them would be wrong three times and learn, and one of them would be right and hate himself for it just a little. The city would listen because it likes to be included, and somewhere just outside the fence, something without a name would taste a seam and consider whether it preferred stubbornness or fatigue.

For now, though, the freeway made its river noise and the elephant fountain kept its memory and the boy who calls himself an idea had water drying on his palm where a rose stain had nearly decided to become personal. Adrian stood, put his shoes back on because some places ask for that, and stepped into the day that had been waiting for him, patient as a good dog and twice as ready to bite on command. He left the smell of orange behind him, like a signature you only see if you turn your head and let the light be sideways.By late afternoon the light had the thin, almost tinny quality of a day that had been asked to perform twice and was saving its bass notes for the evening. Adrian let himself into the bungalow he kept like a promise and not a secret, unlatched the windows, and let the smell of damp grass and warm dust assemble a room from smells alone. The house was small on purpose and full of things that did not ask to be admired: a battered teakettle that understood urgency, a quilt that had been mended with fabrics from shirts that had been loved to death, a metal fan that had learned to be quiet after being bribed with oil and curses. He stood very still and listened to the ordinary. It was almost enough to trick a man into believing his day was ordinary. Then he remembered the way the water had told him where the city had gone thin, and his shoulder ached in a way that made him want to argue with a bridge.

His mother had left him a plate covered with a dish towel that had once been a dress, and when he lifted it the smell of roast chicken and lemon climbed up and put its arms around his head like a relative who refuses to leave without taking a Tupperware back. She had written on a paper napkin and tucked it under the edge: eat a piece with your hands or the food won’t believe you love it. The handwriting was the shape of comfort written by a woman who had refused to let it spoil for anyone. He obeyed, not because he was superstitious but because hunger makes saints of practical men, and because the city runs smoother when its prince has grease on his fingers. He ate standing at the sink and shook out his shoulders to convince his backbone it belonged to the body of a person who would sleep later and not at inopportune moments.

When the sun finally slid down and the city turned its lamp chains on with that satisfying one-by-one thunk of systems behaving, he dressed like someone who might ruin a party and be forgiven for it. He took the crooked tie off at the last second and let his throat be itself, rolled his sleeves like a man halfway to honesty, and checked his pockets for salt and a folded length of ribbon Aunt Lina had given him without commentary at breakfast two weeks ago when he had said, for no reason at all, I think something with bad breath is creeping under the freeway. She had nodded like this was as ordinary as the question of if he wanted more coffee, and slid the ribbon like a piece of answer onto his plate.

The House felt him before he put a foot on the first step and uncoiled a little at the eaves the way cats do when the person they have been pretending to disdain has keys in his hand and a spare hour. The air near the front door had weight and a flavor like cut cedar and stories you are almost ready to tell. Maya beat him to the threshold, of course, her camera bag angled like a question mark, her sneakers disrespectful of any dress code invented by dead furniture. She had changed her earrings; they were small silver planes that made her look like she had been expected to be a child pilot and had refused, which had charmed the planes into flying along anyway.

“You look like you’re about to commit metaphor,” she said, not unkindly. “The House has its lipstick on.”

“It always has its lipstick on,” he said. “It keeps it in the drawer under the stairs with the letters people wish they hadn’t sent.”

Ramiro was already inside because he never made doorways into ceremony unless someone demanded it. He had a small case with him that might have contained polite conversation, or it might have contained three kinds of metal and a charm Aunt Lina had taught him to make out of salt and red thread on the condition he never, ever show it to a policeman unless he wanted to owe her favors until he died. He nodded at Adrian with the easy affection of a man who has watched a boy climb fences and has developed in his body a sense for the angle that means he will fall and the other angle that means he can be trusted not to.

“Midnight guests,” the House said, which was both greeting and judgment, and the way its voice sat in Adrian’s ribs was familiar enough that his heart did not bother to speed up for it. The boards under their feet made a long, pleased noise, and a window somewhere adjusted itself as if preening. In the great room the rafters did their soft creak that meant the House had decided to be indulgent. If you didn’t know better you would think the place just had draft and noises. If you did know better you were careful to say please and thank you when you stepped on the rug that had learned your gait and was bracing itself to trip the wrong person.

Gabe arrived like a boy trying to remember how to enter spaces that pay attention to him without looking like he had practiced. He wore a jacket that had forgiven three laundromats their sins and shoes that had failed theirs; they squeaked once on the polished floor and then became so ashamed they did not do it again. He had something wrapped in canvas and tied with a butcher’s string under his arm, and his mouth had the chapped look of a man who has been lectured by a building. He stopped one pace in and put his free hand on the banister as if saying hello, which told Adrian that he learned fast and that he respected what fed him without admitting it aloud.

“It made me say I was wrong about seven things that had nothing to do with stealing from it,” he said without waiting to be asked. “One of them was about a table. I didn’t argue. I brought this. Kaedren will be later than he wants you to think he is being.”

“There are whole geographies inside that sentence,” Maya murmured, but she smiled at him, too, because his ears had gone pink when the House sighed with affection at his awkward apology, and pink ears disarm even journalists when they are attached to sincerity and not a PR man.

“What is it,” Adrian asked, tipping his chin at the bundle. Gabe’s fingers went gentle in the way people go gentle around things with history.

“A wedge,” he said. “They call it a march-tooth when they want to be romantic. It’s old wood that learned to be stubborn in a place where the wind bullied the town and the town learned to lean. My grandmother’s grandmother had it in a door that wouldn’t admit certain kinds of caller. It was traded for a cow, ceremonially, which is to say everyone cried and someone told a joke so they could stop. It holds hums the way some knots hold grief. If you put it into a seam and ask it to pay attention, it will. If you don’t ask politely, it will mind you anyway and you will owe it a story about how you learned manners.”

Adrian took the parcel and the weight of it told him that Gabe hadn’t stolen it so much as unhooked it from someone else’s lineage. He undid the string and half the canvas, leaving enough to protect the most delicate ambition the wood had. The wedge was just that, at a glance—a tapered length of old-planked something, burnished by hands and a century of forcing things to behave—but when he set his palm on it, the feeling that came up was the feeling of going still while a storm counts. It would be a good wedge. It would not be polite unless we were very deliberately so.

A clock somewhere that had refused to sit in one place its whole life said midnight in a voice like a woman biting into a plum. The House responded by letting one of its staircases open its throat. The steps deepened. The landing leaned forward. They had become taller creatures than they were when donors were being led up to admire moldings. The hallways were longer and less interested in being linear. The House gets bored with itself just as much as anyone else, and at night it practices not being bored by refusing obviousness.

“Shoes off on the back stairs,” the House said sweetly. “Not because I care about mud. Because I like the sound of barefoot people telling one another the truth.”

Kaedren did not take the front door. He arrived sideways, as if he had been walking along a wall and the wall had agreed to be a road for a moment so that someone could be impressed. He stepped out of a shadow that existed only when the roof had opinions about where to put moonlight, and he put his hand against the frame like a lover recognizing the bones of an old friend. He saw Gabe first and then the wedge. He saw Maya and let his expression change to accommodate the fact that some women watch as if their eyes are work, not garnish. He saw Ramiro and did his almost-bow, which suggested he was beginning to understand the kind of respect that keeps you alive. Then he looked at Adrian and his mouth did that small upward event that could be weapon or warmth, and his ring caught the House’s lamp and refracted it in the way of things that used to be whole and had learned to be honest anyway.

“You keep your promises,” he said. “I brought you the word we use for rot when we don’t want to admit we’ve named it. We call it The Lapse. It sounds less like an enemy and more like an accident we intend to correct. It keeps us from having to make war on our own laziness.”

“Men do love to rename their failures something that sounds like a nap,” Aunt Lina said from the balcony, because she had decided to come after all and not tell her nephew because she enjoyed pretending she was a surprise. Her sweater had moth holes that seemed deliberate, as if she had cut them herself to give the garment reasons to complain. “Come down if you want to be useful. Stand there if you intend to be pretty.”

Kaedren came down. He was bare-headed, which on him looked like policy and not oversight, and he slid his thumb over the crack in his ring as if it was a worry stone that licked back. He reached into his jacket and brought out a small folio that had been made of leather before leather started being embarrassed by itself. When he opened it there was a thin sheet of something that wanted to be glass and wanted to be scab and settled for being a saint’s patience written down. It shimmered not with light but with obligation. He held it as if it might leap.

“This mends hum when hum splits along a line you would prefer it didn’t,” he said. “It borrows from futures that will not mind the debt. It doesn’t like being used frivolously because it has the personality of an aunt. If you ask, it will stick and make the whining stop while you do the actual fix that keeps the world from falling on its reference book.”

“Give me that before you decide to demonstrate on someone’s eyelid, you overconfident desert,” Aunt Lina said, and she reached from the balcony and the sheet made the small hiss of a nervous little snake being caught in competent fingers. She smiled with only her top teeth and tucked it away without letting it touch anything but air and her contempt. “We’ll teach you to use it without breaking the corner next to the corner.”

The House was pleased enough with the exchange to let the hallway that had been sulking turn its face toward the kitchen door and permit it to be a passage again. It wanted to play, and it wanted to show off, and it wanted to be admired and to be of use, which are the two halves of hospitality when buildings do it right. Adrian set the wedge in the curve of his arm the way one holds a child who will not admit to wanting to be carried, and he stood in the center of the great room and looked at the four of them—the boy who had brought his hands and not his arrogance, the man who had brought both and was trying to measure where to put them, the woman who could make a room’s secrets wrinkle and smooth with one question, the guard who had made his own body into a wall one thousand times and would do it again. He thought of the seam under the freeway and the giggle the House had given when he called it darling. He felt the thinness that lived at the edge of all things that had been asked to bear more than they were designed for, and he understood that if he was going to be intolerable he should start as he meant to continue.

“First, you pay the toll,” he said. “The House keeps its rules and so do I. You come under my roof at midnight and you want me to show you the part where the walls whisper the map, you give me a truth you would prefer I never learn. It bends the wood in our favor. It does not get written down unless Maya is feeling cruel.”

Maya blinked slowly and did not deny this because she believes in keeping the possibilities that make princes tremble. Gabe looked at the floor and then at the wedge and then at the staircase as if it might prompt him with a cue-card. Kaedren smiled as if the idea of being made to confess excited him the way some men are excited by the moment before a coin disappears.

“I’ll go first,” Gabe blurted, and then blushed at his own eagerness, and then lunged toward the truth because sometimes shame is the doorway to grace. “I knew exactly what I was doing when I scratched at the ward. I told myself I was learning, but I felt the part where the hum bit me and I liked it. It made me feel less like a person who could be replaced and more like something with a headline. I did it again because I wanted that feeling, not because wisdom asked. I hate that, and I’ll want to do it again if I don’t have someone watching me with a hand on the back of my neck.”

The House sighed in a way that made two windows decide to close themselves slowly. The floor under Gabe’s feet warmed an inch. Adrian nodded. It was a hard truth, but it had been said in the shape that keeps it from rotting. He looked at Maya and raised an eyebrow and she rolled her eyes but lifted her chin and leaned in.

“I didn’t run a story that would have made a small man lose his job and made this House sleep a little easier at tax time because his granddaughter held my hand at a parade and told me her new shoes hurt,” she said, and the words did not distort for sentiment. “I told myself another piece I was writing would do more good. Maybe it did. I still think about the shoes and his face. I cannot always tell if the mercy I chose was for the child or for me.”

The banister made a tiny, affectionate noise as if to say of course your elbows and your ethics can both be sharp, and Adrian felt the House do that minor rebalancing it did when people admitted to the ways they were human and not a lecture. He looked at Ramiro, who did not use words carelessly even when asked to pay with them. Ramiro put his hand on the nearest newel post—he knew better than to put it on the lady banister when she was listening this hard—and took a breath.

“I have a second gun,” he said. “It is not on any inventory. It is not supposed to be on any person in this House who is not me. I hid it in a place where this building couldn’t decide whether to be offended. I will not tell you where because that is the point. I have lived long enough to understand that the world cheats when we are polite.”

That was almost a joke, and almost not, and the House accepted it the way it accepts a rug that has been turned wrong-side up to keep a stain from becoming a scandal. The boards leaned a fraction and then let him go. Adrian looked at Aunt Lina, who shrugged like a woman whose truths were not the currency being exchanged tonight, and then he put his palm flat on the table and gave up the one he had promised himself he would never say aloud in this room where his voice felt like it belonged to the House as much as to his lungs.

“I like it when people do what I say,” he said. “Not because it keeps them safe or because the city hums better when the pattern holds. I like it because it feels like I made something invisible into something that obeys. It is my favorite sin and it is the one I make sound like a public service. You will not let me make it into pity. You will tell me when I am being a tyrant instead of a hinge.”

The House moved under his finger with a slow consenting motion and the lamp nearest the far wall gave a small, satisfying click. Maya did not look at him with judgement, which is the trick of friends who want to keep you. Gabe looked at him like a student suddenly being told the answer key exists and will be burnt after the exam. Kaedren tipped his head and then, with admirable grace, let his own mouth be the place where his performance stopped.

“I am afraid,” he said, and the words were simple enough to be a mouthful. “Not of death, which is arrogant, I know. Not of being wrong, because I assume I am and find it charming. I am afraid of going back to the rooms where everyone knows my name and finding I am the only one there who understands what it is for. I am afraid of being the prettiest lie in a line of lies that got so good at being swallowed they forgot they had bones. I make mess to hear something true tell me to stop.”

That truth was not a performative one, not exactly; it had the quality of true things spoken in the wrong rooms by men who meant to say them in their own heads and accidentally opened their mouths. The House liked it. It settled around the boy like a cloak and a leash both, and was polite enough to make each feel like the other depending on how well behaved he intended to be.

“Good,” Aunt Lina said briskly, clapping once in that way that makes the light snap to attention. “Now that we’ve turned the gossip into nutrients, we will do the thing with the seam without tearing the wallpaper. You are bringing me a staircase,” she said to the House, and the House obligingly sent down the back flight like a tongue that had been asked to describe a flavor. “All of you, barefoot, and do not wet the wedge with anything you do not intend to marry.”

They went up. The steps were cool and capable, and if they had creaked during the party it was because they had been asked to perform as quaint; now their sound had the seriousness of an instrument being tuned while the audience put coats on their laps and shut up. At the second landing the House did its trick with lengths and depth, and what had been a hallway with printed wallpaper became the narrow throat of a place that pretends to be small so that large things can remember how to behave. Adrian felt the seam before he saw it; it was that familiar tug, like a loose thread on a sweater your grandmother would swat your hand away from if she loved you. It ran along the join where two kinds of resolve met: the wood that had been set to carry weight and the plaster that had been told to be charming and dry.

“This is where it wants to pull,” he said, and he set the wedge with his palm a hair’s breadth from the seam to let both surfaces decide whether they were ready to be held together by something from a wind-fought pasture. The wedge thrummed. It remembered the hand that had forced it into doors that would not close when taxes were due. It warmed like politeness enjoying itself. It slid in like it was agreeing instead of being forced, which is the best kind of fix because it lasts not because it was threatened so much as because it was told a story it could not bear to interrupt.

Gabe watched him the way a man watches a prayer for the first time uttered by someone who is doing it without theatrics. He lifted his hands when Adrian did by reflex, then put them down because he felt the House make a little mouth to scold him and he had learned enough in one day not to be scolded if he could help it. Ramiro stood with his back to the long corridor that had decided to try being a horizon, and he did that thing where he can be standing still and also everywhere his body is not yet, and the House approved; it likes competence. Maya kept her camera in her bag and made notes with her body instead, shifting her weight when the pitch of the seam changed, closing her eyes when Aunt Lina pressed the march-tooth sheet to a place that did not want to stop complaining.

There was a smell at the crack, faint at first, then distinct—paper that has seen too many summers in a filing cabinet that no one opened because the man who knew the combination had been the sort of person who did not write things down because he thought it made him important. It was sour with heat-days and resignation. It had that little metallic sigh of staples that missed fingers and found skin. The Lapse liked to be a clerk. It liked to make everything about procedure. It had slid fingers in when the House had been asked to be quaint for the donors and had stroked at its joinery the way a person with a grudge pets a dog they do not intend to be kind to.

“Hello, darling,” Adrian said to it, because he had learned that you either charm or you bludgeon things like this and it liked to be told it mattered. “We don’t accept your filing system. You can pout or you can go eat at the culvert where my aunt has set a feast for you out of boredom and teenage breath.”

It did not like being invited so explicitly to dinner somewhere else. It tried to pull, then, hard, as if to see if the wedge would be flattered into letting go. The wedge did not. The march-tooth sheet hissed its tiny snake hiss and stuck. Aunt Lina pressed her palm flat and said the word that makes wood remember its green, and the House leaned the smallest possible amount to allow a movement that must be made to be made without letting it become a habit. The Lapse lifted its face to sniff for rage and found only discipline and light. It sulked like a bureaucrat told to take a personal day.

“That’s one,” Maya said under her breath, because she likes to count her victories even if she saves the ink for later. “We still have the habit near the freeway. The culvert will sulk back. The Bowl will remember and try to make itself a venue for a different sort of heat. We’re teaching the city to say no at midnight. That’s a headline that makes editors ask for synonyms.”

Kaedren had his hand half out like a boy at the side of a dance floor watching people who have known one another long enough to be beautiful without trying. He did not ruin the wedge’s work by wanting to be touching when it was not his place to touch. He did something better. He breathed on the spot, the way he had at the fountain, and whatever name the March used to teach its boys to calm a pony that thought it was a storm, he used it for this. The seam took the breath. It made the soft, unglamorous sound of things deciding not to split. The Lapse sulked in a way that meant it was listening to its own pettiness and was embarrassed enough to be quiet for an hour.

They moved like that through the House, not hunters, not exorcists, but the sort of custodians who understand that flicking a switch is a ritual that performs obedience as well as making light. The House showed them its frays with a mixture of pride and aggravation, pointing with a draft here, pulling an old nail forward like a tooth telling on a fight there. They left in their wake places where the wood felt deliberate again. The march-tooth sheet went down in three more positions that would have been invisible to people who did not consider joinery a political act. The wedge made best friends of rivals. The House’s sighs got gradually more lascivious, as if it were gradually remembering the year it was built and the conversations it had held when they still made long vowels like honey.

At the last seam—a mean little place in a length of baseboard that had learned to be charming in front and hollow in back—something else had nested. It did not smell like paper. It smelled like a damp wool coat hung in the hallway for too long because the man who was supposed to come and get it had found other places to be. It had a give to it that spoke of flesh, then didn’t, then did again, like a trick with a coin you never want to know how to do. Adrian reached out of reflex, not to grab it but to catch the light behind it so it could not want his hand more than it wanted to hide. It twitched. It tried to be a shadow. It tried to be a draft. It tried to be nothing and it failed at all three.

“Ah,” Aunt Lina said, and she stretched the ribbon that had been a shadow in the oleanders two fingers wide and made it into something that could pretend to be rope and then stop pretending and be rope. “This is the part of the Lapse that grows legs and runs. This is the habit that becomes malice when it finds a corner it can keep. Ramiro, darling, don’t shoot the baseboard; the House will forgive you but I won’t. Give me disappointment instead.”

Ramiro made a face that meant he would enjoy shooting whatever was offending his night and make do with writing a letter to the arms that had trained him. He took a step and put his body into the space the thing wanted to claim, and he used his shoulder the way some men use their voice, and the thing did what soft, creeping evils do when they are looked at by something solid: it went thin. Adrian slid the wedge deeper, not because the wedge would like it but because he did, and he told the seam the story of the boy at the bridge and the fire that had pretended to be a friend, and the flame that had agreed to be a well-behaved guest at a child’s party after being told it could come back later and lick the barbecue. The House liked stories. It rewarded him with that little resistance that means it is doing you the courtesy of not making it too easy so you will feel you earned it and will remember how long to let your arms ache next time.

When it was done, the House did something it had not done for him since the night he had first told it an entire lie and it had decided to believe him because it wanted to be amused. It reached, not with wood or draft but with opinion, and it patted his hair like an aunt who has been pretending all day she is not proud of the child who did not spill during the big toast. He endured this with dignity, then laughed because dignity around old buildings is a game you can only win by losing.

Downstairs the night had settled into itself. Outside, the neighborhood kept its secrets as carefully as people keep leftovers when they plan to eat them in the morning cold from the fridge. The House had its hum back in the register that means the floorboards will not make a talkative fuss if someone kisses someone in a doorway. Kaedren stood with his hands in his pockets and looked up at the beams with the covetous respect of a man who has just discovered a friend has a skill he cannot imitate.

“I will not scratch under your bridge,” he said, choosing the sort of performative earnestness that is admirable only when it has been earned by acts in the correct order. “I will take my sign out of its mouth. I will teach Gabe to do it if he insists on being kept instead of keeping. I will bring you three names for The Lapse that will make it blush, and you will tell me which of them makes your aunt happiest to hate.”

“You will bring the boy and you will not let him put his hands where the House tells him not to,” Aunt Lina said, then spoiled her severity by holding out a square of the march-tooth sheet and saying, annoyingly generous, “keep a corner for emergencies. It won’t work as well for your sort but it will be offended into trying.”

Gabe took the corner like a man accepting a ring. He did not pretend not to be honored. He put it into his wallet, which made the wallet flush with pride, and he looked at Adrian with that earnest, unflattering gaze of the young which forces men to become better because they want to keep being looked at that way.

“I can help,” he said. “I bruise easily. I don’t break. I’ll stop before the doors tell me to get out. I’ll bring sandwiches made by someone who thinks mustard is medicine. I’ll stand in the boring part and keep the boring part from looking at the exciting part like a cat in a window.”

“Do that,” Adrian said, feeling his own vanity put its head in his lap and behave for a second. “Tomorrow night we walk the river where it pretends to be asleep. We will not invite anyone who wears a name like a cologne. We will take trash bags and produce the kind of humility that makes gods look away because it embarrasses them.”

Maya stretched her back until it popped and grinned in a way that would have made three poets misquote themselves. “I love when the plan is pick up garbage and tell the river we see it,” she said. “I will write an article that makes it sound like a cult in a way that sells subscriptions to people who think they oppose cults. I will wear sneakers and do penance by asking the moms who run the Arroyo at dawn if they want to be quoted and spelling their names properly when they say no.”

They lingered not because there was anything left to fix tonight but because leaving a House after it has let you in on one of its tricks feels a little like abandoning a friend mid-story. The lamps softened until they were as dim as the inside of a shell. The staircase returned to its properly scaled self with a shrug that said you know I am pretending and I know you know. Kaedren palmed the banister as if to say goodbye with his skin, and the banister made no complaint because it had been amused and offended in the correct balance and now wanted to be flattered. Ramiro gathered his case with the air of a man who knows he will be unpacking the kindness of strangers and the stupidity of enemies in equal measure tomorrow, and went to check the window locks he pretended did not matter in a house that could politely shut a wind if it disliked it.

When they were at the door, the House, which had said plenty, said one more thing and said it to Kaedren because it enjoyed being unfair in ways that built character.

“You are young enough to think grandeur keeps you from kneeling,” it said, and the rafters made the tiny tinnitus of a building choosing words. “Kneel when asked. Refuse when ordered. Learn the difference before your hands become someone else’s. If you hurt my boy because you prefer to make a sound out of breaking instead of out of mending, I will send you down a stair you cannot count.”

Kaedren looked startled and pleased in the exact measure that meant he was either going to behave or he was going to make the exact mistake buildings love to punish. He bowed—not like a prince, but like a boy who had learned an instrument until it had taught him humility—and he reached for the doorknob and let the night lie its soft summer lie on his face. Gabe slid out behind him like an apology that planned to become philosophy if nurtured, and Maya watched them go with the head-tilt of a scientist deciding which specimen boxes do the least harm.

They were alone long enough for the House to kiss their ankles with a draft and tell their bones they had pleased it. Aunt Lina pressed the march-tooth sheet back into its folio with the carefulness of a woman putting away money she is paying herself after years of being told not to. Ramiro took his second gun from wherever it wasn’t and put it wherever it had been, because not telling you where was part of the charm. Adrian stood in the doorway with his palms on the frame, not because he thought the door needed holding up but because he wanted to feel how the wood had decided to be tonight, which is a ridiculous reason that makes perfect sense at midnight in a House that loves you.

“Sleep,” the House told him, not because it thought it would be obeyed but because it wanted to be credited when he passed out for three minutes in a chair at four in the morning. “Dream of something ungenerous and then wake up and correct it.”

He stepped into the night and it stepped into him. The jacaranda held its breath like an old woman withholding gossip until Sunday. There were coyotes making committee-sounds at the edge of a golf course that pretended it was wilderness. Somewhere, someone’s party had crossed the line between fun and brag and was about to pay for it with a broken heel and an Uber driver with a sense of humor. The city had been tugged in the right places so that when something tried to run its nails along a seam there would be the small, satisfying pain of a hangnail being prevented.

At home, he put the wedge under the bed because it could not sleep near the door without trying to get up and do more work. He put the shard back under his pillow because he is the sort of person who doubles down on ridiculousness when it becomes a ritual. He lay on top of the covers like a man pretending the day was not still too hot and listened to the dishwasher across the alley hum a hymn to second chances and the neighbor’s wind chime argue with a raccoon. He slept like a thief with a clear conscience for the space of a story and woke just as the night blinked and checked its watch.

He expected quiet because he had earned it, which is not how nights behave. He heard the small sound of a message hitting his phone and considered ignoring it until the phone repeated itself in the particular insistence of someone who does not need to be humored but must not be left waiting. It was from a number he did not have and would have guessed even if he had. The message was spare and direct and smelt of dust and an amused apology.

your culvert has a temper, it read. your aunt’s ribbon makes it pretend manners. i took my sign out of the bridge and it bit me for leaving. i enjoyed it. there is a place where your arroyo goes under a fence that thinks it is a border, and the Lapse has eaten the word ‘no’ from the paint. bring me a bucket. we will see whether your city likes to be told to mind in the morning as much as it does at midnight.

He stared at the lines and felt that small frisson of admiration and irritation that meant he would answer and regret answering and enjoy the regret. He typed yes and did not add darling, because you should not flirt with boys who call themselves ideas unless you are prepared to argue with them at lunch. He turned onto his back and watched the ceiling remember he had a fan. He thought of the House’s voice telling him to correct ungenerous dreams. He closed his eyes, and when sleep found him again it found him with his hands open and palms up, the way you offer something to a shy animal.

In the morning there would be buckets and rubber gloves and a lecture to the fence that would not be in English because fences do not deserve translation. There would be women in leggings watching them with the skeptical kindness of people who had gotten up earlier and felt entitled to debug other people’s rituals by observation. There would be a boy who had stolen a wedge being good at standing still and keeping the boring part from scanning the exciting part like a cat. There would be a prince who assumed the city belonged to him being asked to kneel and finding out that the pleasure in kneeling is not always about humiliation but sometimes about letting the world rest its weight on someone for a moment without pretending it is being held up by a magic no one has to work for. There would be rot and it would be fed endeavor until it went to sleep like a child after a tantrum. There would be oranges at eleven on a railing that had learned the flavor of morning as well as wine. There would be a House teaching a boy to count the stairs with his eyes and not his mouth.

For now there was a long breath, and then another, and the kind of quiet that belongs to cities that have earned it on nights when no one knew they were earning anything at all. The wedge under the bed hummed a smug, barely audible bar of work well done. The shard under the pillow did nothing at all, which is sometimes the most generous act a piece of magic can perform. The prince slept until what wanted him next put its hand very gently on his shoulder and said, wake.
