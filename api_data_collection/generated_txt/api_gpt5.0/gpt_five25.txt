Rowan Hart had flown over every shape water could take. A river tapering like a silver blade across German fields. The North Sea slabbed in pewter below the wings on a winter evening, grainy and slow like a stubborn thought. Glassy lakes in Norway that looked fake from altitude, like someone had dropped lakes into the earth with a spoon. He knew the way sunlight lays itself across oceans and makes them look solid, as if you could walk on it and not fall. He also knew how they turn on you—black, textured like skin, a living thing with moods.

He hadn’t feared any of it until the day the pool swallowed him in the Fire Service Training Centre at Heathrow. The dunker had a proper name—Mockup 12 or something bureaucratic—but the crew called it the coffin. A metal shell bolted to a cradle, dropped into the pool and rotated while you strapped into a mock fuselage seat and practiced what you do when steel meets cold, chlorinated water. The training officer, a compact man with a neck like a bollard, had winked and said, “You’ll love it, Hart. Most do. Like a fairground ride. If you close your eyes and pretend it’s Saturday.” Everyone laughed. Rowan smiled and his face felt made of tinfoil.

They clamped the harness. He breathed in through his nose, clamped his mouth. The stench of chlorine. The guy next to him—Anil, first officer, bright boy from Birmingham who asked questions and brought the trainers biscuits—made a movie whooping noise. Somewhere far off someone shouted instructions no one ever takes seriously because in a real ditching you never hear anything but the rotors scream and your own brain.

They tipped them.

Water climbed the windows in a skin. No, climbed is too gentle; it leapt. It slapped and pressed and you saw that you were an afterthought to its display. It came in through somewhere it shouldn’t have, a seam that gave up the ghost with a cough, and the shock hit Rowan in cheeks, ears, lungs all at once. The absurd thing was that he knew exactly what to do—undo, open, push, out—and his hands refused to accept that knowledge. Muscle memory went on strike. The seat belt felt unfamiliar, a perverse knot he had tied in another life. When he finally found the tab, water climbed into him too, down his nose, up his ears, thin chalk line of panic under the skin.

He swallowed it and came up coughing into a cord of shouts. A hand grabbed his elbow, not gentle, and then everything turned again—air to water to sky to water—and he thought of nothing except the fact he had always loved showers. Loved them. The way water pelted your neck and made you feel like you were part of weather. That he loved those things would be a small fact that had belonged to yesterday.

When they hauled him out, the trainer’s face was in his. “You alright?”

“Yeah,” he lied. Anil barked a laugh that felt like a cough and a song at the same time. “You looked like a dead otter, mate.”

Rowan coughed again and wiped his face. He was fine. He was fine. Then it was his turn again and he couldn’t climb back in. He put his foot on the lip and his body said no. It wasn’t a loud no. It was a body no, one that jammed in his calf and his hands and even the roof of his mouth, as if the word had lodged there and made a dome against it.

“Take a minute,” the trainer said, and then after twenty seconds, “It’s cold for all of us, Hart.” The implication being that if he didn’t go in, it wasn’t about the water at all. It was about him.

He went home early with a note. There was always a note. “Return Monday,” the handwriting said. “Repeat modules 1-3.”

Westminster was damp that afternoon, not that Westminster ever wasn’t. The Thames crawled past the stone like someone pretending to be something else. Rowan cut across the bridge because it was the fastest way and he didn’t like when his thoughts had time to add themselves up. People pressed their bodies into the railings and took pictures of the clock as if it were about to run away. The smell rising off the river wasn’t anything particular. Not even unpleasant. It was the smell of a city’s belly. He paused halfway over and immediately regretted it.

The water looked on. That was the only way to describe it. It had the patience of something that had seen ten thousand people stand in this exact spot and consider their lives. He had never felt observed by a river. He didn’t want to be ridiculous. He moved on with as casual a gait as he could manage, like a man walking past a dog he wasn’t sure would bite.

His flat on Marsham Street was two rooms and a corner, third floor, a cheerless rectangle with the persistent complaint of ambulances threaded through its silence. He put on the kettle and stood under the kitchen extractor fan watching steam coil into metaphorical nothing. He would do a shower. Easy. Just hot water with a handle on it. He undressed and stood in the cubicle and turned the dial and when the water came it didn’t sound like water. It sounded like a signal. The tiles might as well have been the fuselage of the dunker. He stood there—naked, an airline pilot with zero intimacy with the smallest weather system—and stepped back out. Turned it off. Stood there with a towel around his waist and laughed, one note, at himself.

He wiped himself down with the towel as if he had been bathing in language his whole life and suddenly could not remember the basic verbs.

He didn’t tell anyone about that bit for a while. He didn’t gather up the story of it and hand it to anyone he knew. Stories are only kind when your audience wants to be kind back.

The next morning he brought his sick self to The King’s Bell on Page Street because they did a breakfast that was cheap and better than the thing it claimed to be. Old men ate beans on toast with the seriousness of judges. Someone had left a newspaper folded into an accordion on a stool and there was warm wet dog smell clamped to the carpet. When he walked in, Debbie from the corner shop was there, already on her second coffee. She raised a hand like a flag. “Alright, Rowan. Heard you were in the swimming pool with your work lot.”

He smiled because you had to. “You heard quick.”

“Anil’s friend’s cousin’s girlfriend’s whatnot goes out with one of the lads as works there. Everyone knows everything. You look pale. You okay?”

He was not. “You ever stand and think the river’s looking at you?”

“That’s too much for me before eight,” Debbie said. “Sit. Have eggs.”

He had eggs and then thought of the eggs in water and then decided to eat anyway because hunger had the blunt honesty of a dog and didn’t care if water existed.

His mother called him at nine like she always did and pretended it was an accident like she always did. “Darling,” she said, and now he was twelve, suddenly. “How was training?”

“It was fine.”

“Liar.” Her laughter went up, then softened. “Your stepfather says you look drawn. I told him he’s looking in a mirror. Have you heard from Tamsin? She’s got herself in some awful play about an ancient queen again. She sent pictures. There’s gold paint on her ears. It’s not right.”

Tamsin was his mother’s second husband’s daughter. She had arrived late in his life like a curve in the pavement. First he thought she was a detour. Then he realized she was the way the street had been meant to go all along.

“I’ll call her,” he said.

His mother waited, a weight on the line. “Rowan. Don’t do that man thing where you say nothing and then fall into a black hole and text me when you’re forty. If you’re not right. You say it. You are allowed not to be right.”

I can’t get in the shower, he thought. The Thames has a face. But saying those things out loud would conjure them and make them hang around longer. “I’ve got modules to repeat.”

“For what.”

“Underwater egress.”

She made a noise he only heard when she was eating something too cold. He pictured her kitchen, pale green, a plant valiantly not dying in the window. “I don’t like that word.”

“Underwater?”

“Egress. Such a liar of a word. As if people just gently move towards an egress. Do they want you swimming?”

“It’s training. It’s compulsory.”

“Then you’ll do it,” she said, and her voice turned and dressed itself in a different kind of fabric and reminded him that his mother had been poor enough as a child to know what compulsory meant in the bones. “And if you don’t, we will invent a story about why. You can have a melanoma. On your elbow.”

He laughed. The force of the laugh surprised him. He let it sit in his chest a moment and do its little business of making shapes nicer. “I’ll do it.”

He didn’t.

On Monday he went back with his bag and his grin and failed again. The same thing. Foot on lip. Body no. It was private and public all at once. The trainer tilted his head the way men do when they want to show disappointment and hide it behind faux curiosity. “Is there something you need to tell us?”

He could have said, Yes, I have become a balloon full of helium stamped with the word man, except someone poked a pin into the word and now I make a sound when I move.

He said, “Just cold.”

“Water doesn’t care if you’re cold,” someone behind him said. Laughter like nails in a pot. Anil put a hand on his shoulder, quickly. “We’ll sort it, mate.” The trainer put a note in his file and said he would be suspended until he complied and Rowan nodded at the bureaucratic gravity in the man’s voice as if gravity was his special friend.

He walked out into the raw blue of Heathrow anonymity, the wind like politics, and the smell of jet fuel doing what it always does—thud of nostalgia. As if all the cities he’d visited were marching back to meet him under his skin, each with a small pin-badge labelled Remember. Vienna in October, Barcelona in the wet heat. A layover where he’d slept like a newly invented animal and woken full of words that didn’t need saying. All that. And now: water was a condition he couldn’t sit next to on a bus.

They grounded him. His captain, Karen Weald, called him into an office with the kind of carpet that politely asked you to be someone else. “Take two weeks,” she said. “See the doc. We’ll keep you on the roster as available for training. No flights over water for now.”

“We go over water on every flight,” he said.

“Not the domestic sectors.”

“The Thames.”

She smiled without committing to it. “Don’t be a child. Drink whisky. Do a crossword. Go to a film. I don’t care. Come back without a note.”

When he told Anil, the younger man made a sympathetic circle with his mouth and then looked at his shoes. “Say the word if you need me to tell anyone to shut up,” Anil said. “People talk.”

“They always do.”

“And… you’ll be alright?”

“I always am,” he lied, again, because sometimes lying becomes the only reliable skill you have.

He tried to do as told. He went to a film and the characters drowned so beautifully he felt nothing. He attempted a crossword and the clues were rigged by a god. He walked along the little canal by the Pimlico Library and watched a goose hiss at a labrador with the ferocity of a monarch. He stood in his hallway with a glass of water in his hand and forced himself to sip it, as if he had turned into some ridiculous version of himself, a man who had to concentrate to drink. The water slipped through his throat like guilt.

There is a thing that happens in London when you begin to suffer. It is not that everyone is cruel. It is that kindness is full and busy and has only small hands left for you to hold. On Tuesday, the woman downstairs cornered him on the stairs and explained that the drain was backing up and that she knew for a fact it started with him because she had heard his washing machine do a funny noise. Rowan looked at her and thought, Water again, you tiny narrator. He told her he’d call someone. He did not tell her he was afraid to see water gushing out of a sick pipe. Wednesday, the postman left a parcel propped up against Rowan’s door and someone took it because that is what city ghosts do. Thursday, he woke to rain so absolutely average it felt like an insult, so impersonal he wanted to scream at the sky: have the decency to be dramatic if you’re going to do this to me.

He stopped shaving because the act demanded he splash his face. He grew sullen. His mother left a voice message that was more sighs than words. He avoided calling Tamsin. She was too fluent. She would involve him in something before he had a chance to know if he wanted to be involved. The truth with Tamsin was that everything, always, was theatre. Even breakfast. Especially breakfast. He didn’t think he could be bright enough to stand next to her.

On Friday, she texted him a picture of her ear painted gold. Then she called, because she was incapable of waiting.

“Why are your ears gold,” he said, without hello.

“Because I’m a goddess for the week,” she said. “Hi, by the way. They can’t afford wigs, so the director thinks paint solves everything. I look like a trophy. How are you, brother mine?”

“I’m fine.”

“No you aren’t. I saw Anil outside the Turkish place in Victoria last night and he was eating pita like it was trying to murder him, and when I said your name, he dropped the hummus on his shoe.”

He closed his eyes. “I don’t want to be talked about.”

“You live in a neighbourhood where pigeons gossip. It’s too late for that.”

Silence clanged. People in the flat above dragged a sofa across a life. Tamsin inhaled. “I need someone to help me move a ladder and talk to the stage manager without crying,” she said. “I’m getting you out of the house.”

“No.”

“Saturday at ten, Rowan.”

“It’s not—” He stopped. “I can’t. I’m a mess.”

“Messes are useful. Everyone is always lying about how efficient they are backstage. Come. Carry a thing. Look at people who care about something so small and so huge that calling it a play feels like an insult. And if you don’t like it, you can go back to your notes about water.”

He didn’t want to say yes; the yes broke free of him anyway. He felt it escape his mouth as if someone had peeled a sticker off a window.

“You’ll like Autumn,” she said quickly as if distraction was a bridge. “She’s the stage manager. She’s calm in a way that makes everyone around her feel tall.”

“I don’t want to like anyone called Autumn,” he said.

“You always say you don’t want things. Has it ever stopped you?”

He didn’t sleep well that night because he knew what ten o’clock meant. He dreamt of a pool that was also a mirror, a mirror that was also the sky. He woke with a start at four, then fell into a second sleep that was thick as honey and left him late. He took a sponge bath like a nineteenth-century invalid and hated himself for the drama of it. There are men who go to war. There are women who bear children the size of small dogs and laugh about it. He couldn’t stand under water.

He walked to the theatre because buses felt like a method of drowning too—too many bodies, air turned to soup by breath. The theatre was nothing like he expected. The pictures Tamsin sent always made it look tall and silly, like the idea of theatre had put on heels and tottered around. In person, the building on Greencoat Place looked as if someone had found it in a drawer. Red brick with a face, sagging a little in the middle, a door that refused to be the size of a door.

Tamsin was outside with two other people trying to usher a sheet of plywood through a gap that didn’t want it. “Ah,” she said, “salvation approaches in boots. Boys, this is my brother. He flies planes and refuses to take a bath. Rowan, these are Sukh and Eddie.”

He flushed. “I didn’t refuse.”

“He adores refusal,” Tamsin told them. “It’s his private art. Come, lift this end as if you’re fond of it.”

He didn’t think the theatre would have its own weather, but it did. The smell of paint locked in. Wood dust that made you feel as if you were inside a pencil. A dry heat from an old electric radiator that hummed like something thinking. The stage itself was smaller than his idea of it and larger than he was prepared for. It had the quality of a person you instinctively like for reasons you can’t describe later.

Autumn was, indeed, calm. She wore a navy jumper with threadbare cuffs and had hair that had decided on its own mind. She put a clipboard into his hands and in a voice that meditated its own steadiness said, “We’re flying three flats and a chandelier that looks like a meatball and is twice as heavy. Do you know knots?”

He knew every knot that had ever been invented because his stepfather had put rope in his hands when he was thirteen and told him men who know knots are less likely to fall in love unwisely. He tied a bowline with a flourish he hadn’t used in years. Autumn’s mouth did a small movement at one corner, a microclimate of approval. “Grand.”

“Don’t call it grand,” Tamsin said. “He’ll think you’re at sea, and we’ll never get him back on a boat.”

“I’m not at sea,” he said.

“You’re somewhere,” she said, not looking at him, practical with a bit of glitter, the only way she could be.

He hung a lamp. He moved a ladder. He lifted things and put them down and James, the director, with hair like an idea left out in the rain, told him to be careful of the red mark on the stage that meant mind your head. He was careful. He watched the actors do a read and then the read again with voices. Scene five had a moment where the queen put her hand into a bowl of water and held it there until the man she hated said the truth. Rowan felt it before he saw it; his whole body shivered like a dog throws off water. He turned away too fast and banged his leg on the edge of the platform. There was barely a sting and yet the blood came like a small opera. Autumn was at his side with a tube of something and the knowledge that if she didn’t say anything, he might survive. She cleaned the cut as if he were a small boat and she was sending him off. He looked at the bowl as if it were a snake.

“You okay around…?” she began, not finishing the sentence.

“Yes,” he said, too fast.

She nodded as if he had said more. “We’ll keep it off when we can,” she said, and because she said we, he could bear to stand there and pretend he hadn’t been seen.

He told himself he was only there to help for an hour. He stayed until they ate biscuits that tasted of glue and time. He learned the names of the curtains and forgot them and learned them again. He watched one of the electricians—no one called them electricians, they were technicians, but he had to teach his mouth new words—do a trick with a dimmer and make a corner of the stage look like morning. It was magic so humble it forgot to applaud itself. He breathed and realized he had done so for a minute without having to persuade his body into it.

“You’re in again tomorrow,” Tamsin said, pronouncing it more than asking it.

“I have to see the doctor,” he said.

“You can do both.”

“I don’t know if I can do anything.” It came out with a stupid honest little wobble.

Tamsin put her hand on the back of his neck for a second, exactly like she had done when they were younger and he’d had a fever and she was pretending to be a nurse with a plastic stethoscope. “You’re already doing it,” she said. “Look at you. In a place with a paint smell. Above ground.”

He walked home with a little less dread. Something had been done to his day. He couldn’t name it. It wasn’t exactly joy. It wasn’t relief. It was as if someone had altered the colour values by half a degree; the grey was the exact grey and yet he could look at it.

His doctor was a woman with a tidy fringe and the scheduling sense of a puzzle-maker. She listened properly. He told her, carefully, about the dunker and the shower and the river and the bowl. He did not make jokes because sometimes jokes become clothes that are hard to take off. She said the words you expect after a while when a professional is being sensible. The words swam into his ear and arranged themselves into a thing like a small raft.

“Specific phobia,” she said. “Acute. You had a trigger. Fear responses are shifty. They change the rules and then pretend those were the rules all along.”

“It will go away?”

“It may. It may become part of your life in a way that moves to sit at the end of the table rather than in your lap. Exposure helps. Slowly. Kindly. We don’t throw you into an ocean. We start with a teardrop.”

“Is that a metaphor.”

“It can be literal if you wish.”

He found himself laughing. “I wish to wish. I don’t wish to do.”

She gave him a leaflet, white paper with a blue name on it that looked like something you’d get in a spa rather than a medical centre. He kept not saying he flew planes because he didn’t want to watch the small lightning that runs through a person’s eyes when a job becomes a morality tale. She asked him what he loved and he told her—without choosing them deliberately—the theatre, today, the terrible biscuits, the word flyman, saying it, the way the stage had a smell he wanted to take home in his pockets. She wrote something down and nodded as if he had given her a recipe.

“See your people,” she said. “Go again. Move your body next to things that have nothing to do with water.”

When he left the surgery, the sky had done that thing that only London can do where it decides to glow with the idea of sun rather than the fact of it. He stood and watched two cyclists argue silently with their hands about nothing at all. He felt, for the first time in days, that his body belonged to him and not to the water that had looked at him and declared him a small funny creature.

He went again to the theatre. Because Tamsin had turned the invitation into an inevitability, because Autumn’s quiet made him feel taller, because the set had begun to look like a place in which people might do something true. Tamsin made him drink terrible coffee out of a paper cup with lips painted on it. “We ran out of the normal kind,” she said. “You’ll cope. Drink from mine if you need to feel less ridiculous.”

By Sunday, he knew where every cable lay. He had a bruise in the shape of a crescent moon on his shin. He had had three small collisions with the bowl of water and survived each one by looking at a point six inches above it and remembering that his doctor had said start with a teardrop. He was a man in a place where a chandelier looked like a meatball and where other people were interested, intensely, gorgeously interested in the way things hung.

“Why do you keep looking like you’re about to apologize,” Autumn asked him at one point, adjusting a gel. “You’re here. It’s enough.”

“I’m not good at anything that isn’t rule-bound,” he said.

She propped the gel against her knee, and in the light that chimed through the translucent blue, he could see her thinking. It was a good thing to see. “You flew in here,” she said. “Strapped into a thing that was on fire in your head. You didn’t hit anyone on the way down. I’d call that not nothing.”

He didn’t have a reply. He went home after they ran the curtain call and Tamsin made her body into something like light. He made himself stand under the shower. He put his hand into the water the way you put your hand into a tame animal’s mouth. Then his wrist. Then his forearm. He counted. He breathed. After two minutes, he turned full face into it and when the water ran into his eyes he let it. He felt ridiculous and proud and human and bored and brave in the same haphazard second. He yelled, a short stupid noise that no one heard because the ambulance siren outside decided to harmonize with him.

On Monday he went back to Heathrow and tried again to step into the cage that was not a cage. His foot made the motion of stepping and his torso held back as if the two had litigated and failed to settle. The trainer’s face appeared like a moon. “No one wants to be in there,” he said. “But we die otherwise.”

Rowan’s mouth was dry. His hands were damp. He thought of a paint-smelling room and a woman with a clipboard and Tamsin’s gold ears. He thought of the word egress and what it means to have one. He tried to step. He didn’t.

“I’ve got a temporary assignment for you,” Karen called that afternoon, as if she had planned it. “You live in Westminster, yeah? A community event. PR wants a pilot there to open their dratted raffle. You won’t have to… be very anything. Smile. You’ll look nice on a poster.”

He laughed, and then couldn’t stop laughing, and when he put the phone down, the laugh turned into something else. He texted Tamsin without thinking: Apparently I am opening a raffle. She replied with a string of exclamation marks that turned into letters: You’re made for raffles.

He walked, instead of taking the bus, and let his feet make decisions for his brain. Past the river that he didn’t look at, past the men who sell umbrellas the second a cloud says maybe, past a sandwich place that smelled suspiciously like hot lettuce. He thought of purpose and its silly hats. He thought of the stress-training pool and the way water had become a person in his life, someone you avoid at parties, someone who eats all the crisps and then licks their fingers.

By the time he reached Greencoat Place, his body felt made. Not fixed; fixed is a foolish word. Positioned. Placed. He went inside. The chandelier glowed its meatball glow. The bowl sat silent, its surface never innocent. He nodded at it.

“Day three,” said Autumn. “Your ladder has missed you. Don’t let it down.”

Tamsin shouted from somewhere above his head, her voice landing like confetti. “Rowan! My nonbather! Come wire a dream to a ceiling.”

He did. And in the doing, he forgot, for a while, that water exists. Which was a kind of grace. A small, ridiculous, manged grace, full of chipped paint and splinters and biscuits that tasted like sawdust and two beautiful minutes when he let the shower run onto his head and didn’t step back. Outside, the Thames did not look at him, not for those minutes. It had better things to do. It had a boat to push. It had to keep pretending to be slow while underneath it ran fast.The raffle was in a church hall that had once decided what kind of evening to have and had never changed its mind since. The noticeboard displayed faded photographs of jubilees that looked like dreams in scratchy wool. The plastic chairs were the colour of arguments. There were trestle tables, paper plates that had never co-operated with gravity, and a smell of instant coffee so committed to being instant it was almost admirable. A woman with a sash that declared her the kind of mayor that comes with a chain but not a car shook his hand with the brisk gratitude you give to people who have volunteered their face. The PR man from the airline had hair so well-behaved it made Rowan want to push it in a river. “Just say a few words,” the man said, and his grin was the grin of a person for whom microphones had only ever been friends.

He hadn’t thought through what words would do when given a room like this. They skittered. They turned sideways and pretended to be shy. He took the microphone and it squealed in the old-fashioned, almost nostalgic way, and he found himself apologizing to a room of people who didn’t require apologies. “I fly planes,” he said, and a boy wearing a Spiderman T-shirt whispered, awed, “Like Sully,” which would follow him around for longer than it should. He said something soft about sky and timetables and how London looks like a thing made by many hands when you leave it and come back. He pointed at the prizes and promised the winner of the basket of chutneys would become a better person, which made the mayor snort. He did not look at the far table where someone had put a punch bowl the size of a decision, and the condensation beaded on its sides as if the air were encouraging it to be difficult.

They had put the raffle tickets in a glass drum that turned with a rattle that sounded like cheerfulness and bones. When he turned the handle, a static crackle sparked his knuckle and made him stupidly think of lightning negotiating with water across a horizon. He drew the first number and called it, and the hall did that gentle British burst of delight that arrives trained and polite. The second number belonged to a woman whose lipstick had entirely escaped its borders. She had put a pound on every strip of tickets in the building because she believed in God and odds equally. He drew again and said the name on the top of the ticket because she had written her name on it, bold, as if the universe would need reminding where to send things: Dot.

The punch bowl kept sitting in the corner of his vision like a different conversation starting. It was full of red liquid the colour of cartoons, floating with slices of fruit that looked like they had been persuaded to bathe against their will. A child stood on tiptoe and pressed their face to the glass like a fish reversed, and Rowan had to press his tongue to his teeth to burn the hot little laugh of panic before it made a shape outside. He managed it by not looking. He had become, it seemed, a man who moved through some rooms by walking near the edges and translating.

Afterwards, a retired pilot came at him with a grip that used to be a handshake and had evolved into a coaching method. He was one of those men the uniform never leaves, even when the uniform has been given to a charity shop and become a theme-night costume. “We met in Nairobi once,” the man lied amiably, as they always did. “Or if we didn’t, we should have.” He offered him advice without knowing it, the kind that came in anecdote and oily coffee breath. “It’s not the flying,” he said. “It’s the not-flying when you’re supposed to be flying. That’s the bit no one trains you for. Fill it with something on purpose. Men go wrong when they let emptiness choose its own furniture.” Rowan thanked him because the man had given him a sentence that would do for a day or two. When he turned to leave, the child in the Spiderman shirt saluted him, palm open, and he saluted back because some gestures are as old as ships.

He walked past the river without stopping as if you could politely ignore a cathedral and avoid an argument with God. It browsed along the edge of the city like a cow pretending not to be watching the gate. He told himself, firmly, that he was taking the narrow streets because the narrow streets had better shops, which was an unconvincing lie but a useful one. His phone buzzed. Tamsin had sent him a picture of herself in a dress that appeared to be made out of the wrong decade. Her caption said, We have discovered seven new ways to make a crown look poor. He typed, I opened a raffle without drowning in cordial, and he watched the three dots of her reply appear and vanish twice. Then: You’ll be opening galaxies by Wednesday.

He stood under the shower that afternoon and treated the act as if it were a rehearsal. He turned the water on first as if to demonstrate good faith. The sound it made was less like rain and more like a broadcast he could tune. He let his hand go in to the wrist and held it there while counting in eights because in the theatre they counted everything in eights and he had already learned to like it. He watched the small paleness of his arm under water and thought of teardrops negotiating with oceans. He stepped back out and turned it off before his heart could argue. He did not feel triumphant. He felt like a person who had entered into talks with a wild dog and returned with his fingers intact.

The theatre had rearranged itself into a machine by the time he arrived. The lighting rig purred. There were taped marks on the floor that looked like the beginning of a language he had never bothered to learn. The chandelier that Tamsin called the meatball had been raised and lowered so often it had acquired personality, a diva that pretended to be heavy for sympathy. Autumn handed him a list of tasks that was the exact right length for a day that wanted purpose. He took a ladder for a walk. He carried flight cases that had never been within sight of an airport. He learned that a gel in theatre was not a gel in hair and that everything had a name that could sound silly until it did its job in the dark and made you feel something.

They were blocking the scene with the bowl when the roof decided to be honest about its age. The rain had been doing that London thing for an hour—fine, persistent, the atmospheric equivalent of being pestered by a sparrow. Then something gave up in the old joists and a thread of water ran down the stage-left wall with the embarrassed insistence of a guest who couldn’t find the bathroom. Autumn saw it first and said, calm as a man looking for his socks, “Buckets.” The word created people. Sukh and Eddie were already moving. Tamsin looked up and adjusted the line of her dress as if the roof might respect proper posture.

Rowan was halfway to the props cupboard before he realized what he was doing. He found the buckets by thinking of them as hats. He put one under the thin stream, another to catch the splash that bounced like a second thought, and a third because he had always been good at redundancy. The stage floor became a geography of hazard tape and small arcs of avoidance. The water hit the plastic with a hollow sincerity that did not sound like the pool and did not sound like the shower; it sounded like a task. He stood there with his hands on his hips like a man who had invented buckets and thought about nothing but the fact it would need emptying soon.

He carried the first bucket, half-full, down the corridor that had learned to make way for people carrying urgent liquids. The weight of it tugged at the muscles below his ribs and told him his body was an arrangement that could be trusted for a short journey. He tipped the water into the deep sink and it went obediently away without a speech. His throat clenched because he wanted it to be difficult and it wasn’t. He did a second run. On the third, he made himself listen to the pour like it was applause for a piece of music he’d never liked but that had been played so many times it had become part of him. In the next room, Autumn was telling James they would reblock the entrance to avoid the puddle. “It’ll look intentional,” she said, which was the way she spoke about solutions: make the problem into a choice and then the audience becomes complicit.

He stood in the wings and watched Tamsin put her hand into the bowl as if it were an oath. The prop water had been swapped for dry cards at his request, though he had not quite asked, and Autumn had not quite told him it was happening. The audience will never know, she had said, and added, more softly, You’re the audience too, and we care what you see. He felt forgiven for things he had not yet done wrong. He watched Tamsin hold her hand there for the count of eight, then four more for luck, and pull out the truth as if it had been laid there for her by a magician who knew her trick.

Dr. Ellis—a name he had learned to use in his head because it stopped him reducing her to hair and habit—had told him to invent homework. He invented one involving glasses. He would fill them to different heights and move them around his flat like a street of small lakes, and he would walk through them without touching any, and he would narrate it in his head without poetry. Glass. Water. Move. This was effective in a way he disliked because it made him realize how deeply he relied on ornament to forgive his fear. He put his finger into one glass and kept it there until his mind stopped telling him he was in danger with the sincerity of a schoolboy announcing a fire drill. He dried his hand on a tea towel with ducks that his mother had once declared a joke and then refused to explain.

His mother phoned on a Tuesday evening with the sound of a radio quiz show padding around her kitchen. “Your stepfather,” she said, and there was the clink of a spoon against a mug, “has discovered podcasts. He says he’s learning about Roman aqueducts. I told him you wouldn’t like that word.” He inhaled and she heard it. “Are you standing near water,” she asked, ignoring her earlier advice to refrain from metaphors he couldn’t bear. “No,” he said, and she sighed in relief so audible it became a character in the conversation. She wanted to be brave for him and also wanted, urgently, for the world to stop presenting stairs. “I saw Tamsin’s picture,” she said, “she looks like she’s pretending to be Cleopatra and succeeding. She says you’re useful at the theatre. Imagine that. My boy with a clipboard.” He could hear her smile and the way it quieted the part of him that had been reciting all the ways he was not a pilot when he had nothing to pilot.

Anil texted him at odd hours like a man trying not to be awkward and succeeding in being exactly that. He sent a picture of a sandwich that had insulted him on duty and tagged it, At least this won’t drown you. He sent a link to a video of a dog in a lifejacket being brave on a paddleboard and wrote, This dog is your superior officer now. He did not mention the training pool. He did not mention the suspension. He asked to come to the show. Rowan wrote back that there were no tickets yet, which was true, and that it was bad luck for a friend to watch a technical run, which was not a real superstition but sounded like one.

Karen called once with the rhythm of someone who had trained herself never to call twice. “The programme manager wants a date,” she said. “For your modules.” He could hear the fatigue in her voice and the attempt not to let it colour her words because she was kinder than she liked to let on. “I can do Thursday,” he said, because he had invented a man who could do Thursday and he didn’t want to disappoint him. She was quiet for such a small moment it hardly counted as silence. “I see your name,” she said, “on a list called Good At Emergencies. I’m not removing you from it.” He thanked her for a kindness that would do him harm if it lasted too long, because lists are dangerous magic: once you are on one, you begin to perform for it.

He found Autumn sitting on the edge of the stage at the end of a day when everyone had forgotten how to be quiet because they had earned their noise. She had her boots off, her socks the kind that have rediscovered the concept of darning because money is a timing exercise in a building like this. She was reading a book without a cover and had three pencils tucked behind her ear as if one were a superstition and two were insurance. “Tomorrow they’re sending us a smoke machine with a mind of its own,” she said, looking up. “I’m bracing myself to love it anyway.” He sat, careful, so the boards wouldn’t say anything they shouldn’t, and told her about Thursday. He told her the word dunker because it had a cartoon quality and sometimes cartoons stop your knees from knocking.

“You don’t have to do Thursday because you told me about it,” she said, not looking at him, which made it easier to hear. “We don’t do deals in here. We just aim for opening night.” He was so unused to conditional kindness that his mouth had a minute where it could not find a response. He ended up telling her about the retired pilot with a habit of turning grief into a sport. She smiled with half her face and slid a pencil from behind her ear and began to sketch on the back of an old prop list as if the act of drawing the retired pilot could push him back through the door.

On Thursday morning he woke with his body already in the pool, which was a cruel trick of the brain. He had the taste of chlorine in a mouth that had not earned it. He did everything a person does on days like this to become a person again: he made coffee and drank it too hot; he read the first three paragraphs of five different articles about politics as a way to remind himself that other people were using metaphors for a living; he found a coin in the pocket of a jacket he had thought of as purely ornamental and considered it an omen that meant nothing. He wore his uniform shirt even though he would change when he arrived because it made strangers treat him like a solid line rather than a dotted one. On the way out, he picked up a glass, filled it with water, and put it by the sink. He dipped two fingers into it and watched the skin turn brighter. He left it there like an altar that would accept any offering.

He lasted two runs of the dunker. On the first he did not use his hands so much as imagine them and then find out that imagining muscle movement is not the same as movement in any jurisdiction he recognized. On the second, he got the belt, found the window, pushed, and then stopped in the throat of the exit because there was a human thing in him that still believed leaving meant losing. He came up spitting out a laugh that had bought too much air and Anil was there with his eyes trying not to be a lake. “You did it,” Anil said, too loud for the size of the news. “You did most of it.” The trainer nodded like a man nodding at an apology he had previously filed and now found repetitive. “Again,” he said. Rowan tried and the body-no rose like a building that had been there all along. He climbed out with a note that would be placed in a file, and he pretended he was congratulating someone in another story on managing to be brave.

He did not go home. He went to the theatre because the theatre had begun to be the place you go when you don’t know what kind of person you are yet. He walked in on a conversation about smoke that sounded like a conversation about ghosts. The machine had filled Act Two with a weather the director insisted was idea-heavy and audience-light. “We’re telling them what to feel,” he said, as if that were a crime he could be punished for at law. Autumn had her hand on the machine as if calming a horse. “Lower,” she said to Sukh, who operated it with a reverence that made the machine more obedient than it had been on rehearsals with people who rolled their eyes at it.

They did the scene with the bowl without the bowl, the queen’s hand moving through air towards nothing and somehow making the nothing look like a decision that hurt. That night, when he stood under the shower, he put his head in and stayed. He counted badly. He sang a song he didn’t like because it kept him in time. The water flattened his hair and, for a second, made him look like his stepfather in the mirror; it shocked him into laughing and the laugh sent water into his nose and the small burn of it was the kind of pain that announces: you are still here and this is the rent. He came out clothed in a normal damp he hadn’t visited for weeks and stood there long enough to leave a wet man’s shape on the bathmat. The sirens outside negotiated with each other like a chorus that had been told they had to share the solo.

On Friday, the roof did not leak and the smoke behaved and the meatball agreed to lower on cue like an opera singer who suddenly respects the conductor. The actors forgot their lines in new places and remembered them in old ones and Tamsin’s queen found a stillness halfway through that made James whisper an expletive so delicate it might have been a prayer. Rowan adjusted a lamp by a millimetre and made a shadow look like intention instead of accident. He stood in the aisle as the scene shifted and felt, with the relief of the obvious, that he was good at angles and quiet decisions that nobody would applaud. Autumn touched the back of his hand with the edge of a script by accident or design and did not remove it until he moved, and in that second he was not a man negotiating with water but a person in a world where objects touch and nothing drowns.

He slept like a person who had earned it for the first time in too long. His dream featured a river that had become bored of looking at him and was amused by a boat full of people singing a song about accounting. He woke to a text from Karen that said simply, Monday? and he typed, Yes, and the word lay there like a coin, heavy, easily lost, lucky if you believed in that sort of thing. He made toast and buttered it as if butter were a sacrament. He considered calling his mother and telling her the truth about the exact shape of the courage he had, which was lumpy and local and not suitable for installation in a cathedral. He decided he would tell her in June when they always went to the garden centre together and pretended to care about begonias. He put his feet in his shoes. He opened his door into a day that had not yet decided its weather. He walked towards the building with the bucket and the meatball and the woman named after a season, and as he passed the river, he did not flinch. Not from that angle, not for those steps. It had better things to do. So did he.Monday came in without deciding whether to be a day or a weather report. Rowan woke early and did the small domestic things that, in the right order, make a person; kettle, cup, keys, the search for his wallet that was exactly where it always was, and a brief debate with his mirror about whether his face had any intention of assisting him. He wore the uniform shirt again because it made strangers behave and it made him think, for a few minutes at least, that he had a job that answered to nouns with edges. On the way to the train he passed a man selling umbrellas from a stack that had known other lives as promotional items, and a woman scolding a spaniel who had never understood rain as an idea. He touched the glass he had left on the counter as he went by. He dipped three fingers, then all four, and held them there until the skin forgot to be surprised and he could pull away without a ceremony.

Heathrow’s training centre was the same uncanny geography of corridors that smells like an airport’s afterthoughts. Anil was there with hair that had learned nothing since Thursday and a grin borrowed from somewhere kinder. The trainer greeted him with the nod of a man who used his nods as currency. “We’re not doing poetry today,” he said, as if just to be safe. “We’re doing procedures.” Rowan felt something unclench simply because the man had not tried to be kind. Kindness could turn on you and take your lunch money. Procedures were blunt, heavy, and could be held.

The water in the dunker pool had the exact wrong colour for water; an institutional green like nostalgia in a hospital corridor. Rowan strapped in and did the little mental tricks he had taught himself. He counted in eights because theatre logic was sticking to him; he mapped exits as if they were stage doors and thought of the red tape marks on the rehearsal floor. When the capsule tipped, he let the world expand with a shudder and then shrink to the size of his belt buckle. He found the tab like a man finding his own name in a crowd. He let his left hand float to the window handle and his right to the door frame because Dr. Ellis had said, anchor something and then move the rest. He pushed and didn’t think. The water came into his nose with the mean precise sting it liked to use and his brain announced the headline in too-large type—this is not air—and his body announced the more useful subheading—open, out, up. He came out of the surface with a noise that wasn’t quite a cough and wasn’t quite a laugh. Anil’s cheer made three other men turn as if sport had occurred.

“Again,” the trainer said, and this time there was something almost human around his eyes, like someone remembering he owned a dog. Rowan did it again. The second pass was worse because success likes to dress itself as luck, and he had to convince his hands that he had been responsible. He pushed through, and the thin panic—smart as a wire—ran under his skin and then away. He did not do a third because the body-no arrived with its quiet authority and his vision salted at the edges. The trainer let it be a day. “Module one done,” he said, pen scratching, bureaucratic music. “Two and three Thursday. Bring the same hands.”

Rowan’s whole body kept doing yes and no in small alternating currents while he stood in a corridor smelling of old tape and plasticky lifejackets. He texted Karen a single word—Monday—because leaving out the verb made him feel less ridiculous. He sent Tamsin a message that said: I egressed. She replied with an obscenity and a gif of a woman leaping from a cake. He sent Autumn a photograph of a ceiling light as if that were code and she sent back, We need that cone narrowed by five degrees, which made him laugh in the echoing hall and made a man in a hi-vis turn to see if the laugh belonged to him.

The theatre had acquired an end-of-lesson slackness by the time he got there, that specific looseness rooms achieve when they’ve been worked hard and are beginning to earn their tea. James was arguing with a spreadsheet as if the cells had been rude. Tamsin stood on stage with a crown that had learned to accept criticism and a script that was more tape than paper. Autumn had a coil of cable over one shoulder like a soft metal snake and was consulting a list pinned to the world by a bulldog clip that had given up on dignity. “Congratulations,” she said without exclamation marks, and he felt congratulated in the exact right amount. She pointed up to LX 7 and Rowan fetched the ladder and in this way the day knitted itself.

James wanted rain without water. “It should sound like rain and look like the idea of rain that you believe in after you’ve had a dream,” he said, and the room made a collective face that said, alright then, language. Autumn unpacked a box of small chain and some sheet metal that looked like the thin end of weather and showed Rowan how to shake it just wrong to make the right sound. They trialled dried peas in a sieve and then tiny plastic beads found in a drawer labelled Useful Nonsense. The sound they decided on was not rain exactly. It was the sigh of fabric when an audience takes its breath, a sound that invited water into the story without having to mop afterwards. Rowan felt every bit of his body clench when it began and then let go because his head knew it wasn’t water and his hands were reassured by the weight of a rope.

Dr. Ellis gave him homework he hated and respected in equal measure. “Stand in front of a painting with the sea in it for five minutes,” she said. “A Turner. Or any sea you can afford.” He went to Tate Britain and stood in front of something that had been put together with light and smoke and invented spray. The paint did its little drama and he did his, and a child in a school uniform stood beside him and told the sea to calm down in a voice designed for playgrounds. Rowan counted to eight, twice, then again until he had counted the painter out of their own storm and could turn away without feeling as if he had cheated.

Autumn asked him to walk to the hardware shop to buy screws with a name that sounded like a nursery rhyme. They went out without checking the sky and it reminded them of itself by starting to rain with that absolute London competence, water stating facts. Autumn pulled her hood up and kept the same pace. Rowan had a second where his shoulders rose so high that his ears had to relocate, and then he breathed in time with the way her boots hit the pavement. They ducked into a café that had been making the same cheese toasties since 1989 and sat at a table with a wobble that could be cured with a beer mat and ten minutes of love. She told him about a theatre in Scarborough where the floor had tilted like a decision and a university in Norwich where she had once sewn a costume in a corridor while a campus tour explained creativity to a family from Kent. He told her about his stepfather’s insistence on knots and the way rope remembers you. When the rain knocked at the window like someone asking for rent, he noticed that his body had not kept a running commentary, which felt like discovering you had stopped clenching your jaw without being told to.

Tamsin did the thing she always did the week before a show and began to perform her readiness and her collapse in alternating scenes. She arrived one morning with her voice turned down to a polite murmur and announced herself hoarse, then sang scales at lunch that would have made a window proud. Rowan brewed honey and lemon with a sincerity that made her laugh at him, and she let him be ridiculous about temperature and the virtues of cheap ginger. “I will marry the kettle,” she said solemnly, and he said, “You would only betray it with a coffee machine,” and she told him he was becoming insufferably theatrical and she meant it as a compliment.

The building had decided to be harmless for several days in a row, which should have been a warning. The rain came back with more confidence on a Thursday afternoon and found the bit of the roof that had been making plans. It began with a wet line along the plaster like a thought that had tried to escape, then turned into a drop that was all decision and then into two, then five, because water is a crowd. “Buckets,” Autumn said again, calmly, as if naming something invented it. Sukh moved before she finished the word. Eddie was already halfway up the gallery with a roll of plastic. Rowan went towards the sound and this time his body didn’t have time to put on its old coat. The backstage corridor became a geography of buckets and brooms and hurried physics, and when the water found a path down the stage door and under, it did it with that slyness water keeps for thresholds.

It was less dramatic than his brain had trained for and more immediate. He put towels where towels needed to be and a table on its side to redirect a small river that didn’t deserve the name. He found himself taking charge not because anyone had asked him to but because it was a problem that could be organized, and organizing was the closest thing he possessed to prayer. “Kill that breaker,” he said to Sukh, and the man did it without the sulk small gods sometimes bring. He instructed Eddie to lift the cable coil onto the chair to get it off the floor because he had learned that electricity and water had a feud going back to the beginning of time. He became wet up to the knees and then wet to the waist and then there wasn’t much left to get wet, and his heart did its nonsense and then made peace with the verdict: this is a job.

Autumn’s voice stayed low and accurate and people moved for it. James, flustered and furious in a way he pretended to be better at hiding, looked to Rowan as if the pilot could be coaxed out of him by the sight of a puddle. “We redirect the entrance,” Autumn said to the actors in the same tone she would use to ask someone to pass the sugar, and Tamsin did not look down at her hem. She lifted it with two fingers like a story from a better household and hit her mark.

The flood was not cinematic. It was petty, persistent mess. That, perversely, helped. It could not be dramatic at him if it had no interest in being grand. He lifted and aligned and cursed in the small friendly way men use when a thing has refused to be a thing, and eventually the water did what water does; it sought a different line to make and went away from the one he was guarding because the world is bigger than any single corridor. He emptied buckets that complained in a plastic register. He wrung out a towel like someone learning to hum. He realized he had been shouting without knowing it and dropped his volume back down to human.

Afterwards they did the silly, perfect thing of making tea. They stood in a muddle with their socks wet and the kettle on, everyone suddenly gentle as if they had broken something shared and were pretending they hadn’t. Autumn looked at his jeans, dark and clinging and impressed with the day. “You’re a mess,” she said, which was not unkind. He told her he had discovered a new skill: being an unglamorous dam. She laughed properly then, a small spill of sound that had something in it he hadn’t heard earlier, and handed him a biscuit that had been saved from the vat of glue. It tasted like victory if you were willing to accept victory in a beige.

That night, the shower lost its status as an event. He came home damp and got deliberately wetter. He didn’t count. He didn’t conduct himself through the ritual with words. He stood there and forgot to be brave. Later he would remember and applaud himself, but inside the water there were no speeches, and that, it turned out, was what his body had been asking for.

He told Karen he’d do the next modules. She did not say she’d expected anything else; the slight exhale before her thanks was acknowledgement enough. Anil texted a medal emoji, then another, then wrote, Smashed by a bucket. Rowan replied with a picture of his socks steaming on the radiator and Anil said, That is the most British photograph I have ever seen, why do we live here. He didn’t answer because the question was rhetorical and unkind in a way that felt like affection.

By the weekend the meatball behaved like a professional and the smoke machine had learned the limits of its personality. They did a full run where nothing terrible happened, which made everyone nervous because nothing terrible happening is often how you get to the worst bit. Tamsin found a stillness in Act Three that made James lean forward as if he had dropped a coin into something and was waiting for it to appear under a glass. Rowan reversed a gel, less blue to more, and the dawn looked less like an apology and more like a thing people could stand up under. He stood in the wings and realized he had not thought about the river while the actors had been doing the part where they spoke the hard truth too late. He had, in fact, been counting the steps between cues and the seconds between breath and cue, and the sensation was not pride or relief, but the simple satisfaction of a man given something he could carry across a room without dropping.

His mother rang on Sunday in the middle of a bake that had gone wrong. He could hear her attempt to salvage the edges of a cake with a knife and her resigned marriage to the idea of custard. “Are you over your ducking,” she said, not because she didn’t know the word but because she chose not to. He told her he had stood in the rain and lived. She told him she was buying a plant that looked like a Hawaiian insurance salesman and would inevitably die under her supervision. They made plans for June that involved begonias and sandwiches that had always been too damp. He told her Tamsin would be a god for three nights and his mother said, She always is, and you are too, for the small ones.

He went back to the pool on Thursday and did three runs without the body-no interrupting, though it made itself known in the language of a hamstring and a jaw. It didn’t feel heroic. It felt practised. When he climbed out, his hands shook in that silly post-thing way, and the trainer’s nod acquired a decimal place more warmth. “You’re cleared,” he said, and then, as if worried he had overstepped into praise, added, “Don’t make me see you again until your renewal.” Anil came at him with an embrace he aborted into a cuff on the arm because he could not bear to be sincere on a weekday. Rowan texted Dr. Ellis that the teardrop had negotiated a truce, and Dr. Ellis sent back the kind of sticker grown adults deploy when they wish to pretend they are above stickers.

He didn’t go to the river to test himself. He didn’t need to turn his life into a series of exams he had set and marked. He walked past it the way you walk past a neighbour you do not have to greet, and he noticed with a relief that was not a trumpet that his shoulders did not change shape. He glanced at a boat that had a strip of orange plastic along its side that made it look like a child’s toy, and then he looked away because his bus was ghosting in and he wanted to be the person who caught it.

The theatre produced a smell the night before opening that was part fear, part polish, part electricity, part the fact of human breath shared. The meatball shone as if it had seen the future and found it tolerable. Autumn walked with her list and her calm, and the actors made their little rituals in corners—curses that used to be prayers, stretches that used to be dances. Rowan tightened a thing that did not strictly need tightening because it made the noise a person makes when he wants to feel useful. Tamsin looked like a woman who could decide national boundaries by raising an eyebrow and then tripped on the hem of her dress and swore with a fluency that broke something inside him into laughter.

He slept for three hours and woke to his body insisting on being awake because it had learned that days could contain more than one kind of labour. He made toast because breakfast had started to feel like a pact. He thought about egress and decided he preferred the theatre’s word for leaving; exit. It didn’t lie about ease. It just said what the foot would do on the edge of a room.

Opening night did what opening nights do; it stole and it gave, it bargained, it danced and then pretended it had never been worried. The audience arrived as a tide, and he made himself not think of water as he took their coats and pointed their bodies to their seats because everyone in a small theatre is also an usher. He did his cues. He did not drop anything. He experienced a second in the dark where he felt the entire room as one animal breathing because he was the man with the dimmer and he could make a dawn that was not outside but here, and the rare thing happened where his attention expanded and held everything and he was not in a cockpit or a pool or a corridor with a leak, but in a place where his hands controlled a small amount of beauty. He looked across, in the brief strobe of a slow blackout, and saw Autumn looking at his hand, and that was that.

Afterwards there were plastic cups filled with something that had ambition and the taste of soap. There were words, and some of them were even new. Tamsin took three bows and then one more because the room would not let her stop, and Rowan clapped until his palms felt odd to him. James cried in the quiet Welsh way he had never admitted to and pretended he had got dust in his eye from the smoke machine, and no one corrected him. Autumn leaned against the proscenium and took in the people and the untidiness and the part of the set that had always wanted to fall down and did not. She said, “You’re staying, yes?” and he said, “I fly at six in the morning,” and they both knew that could be true in two different ways.

He walked home an inch above the pavement. The river was there, practising being itself between bridges, and it did not look at him. He did not look back. He did not need the fight. He was thinking about ropes and lists and the click of a seatbelt and the way a stage smells when it has been believed in. He showered on the setting that made the pipes complain, and he did not count. He slept like a living thing and woke to an alarm that played an obnoxious tune he had never had the energy to turn off. He stepped into his trousers with that odd feeling of being a child and an adult at the same second and went out into a morning that had decided to be a morning.

At the crew room, Karen raised an eyebrow the way a woman does when she knows the answer to the question she asks anyway. “How’s your river,” she said, signature on a form without looking down. “I’m walking past it,” he said. She nodded like someone adding an ingredient to a meal she had made often. “You’re rostered on Aberdeen. Out and back. No one will drown you there unless it’s in tea.” He took the printout and felt the paper as if texture could be proof. He messaged Tamsin three words—It goes on—and she replied with a crown and a gold ear and a heart and then said, Come back to the meatball tomorrow, we have a matinee and a loose bolt with your name on it.

He flew. The sky decided to be co-operative and the air agreed to be the kind that doesn’t frighten. He was fine, and fine was a word he would not sneer at any more. The sea lay underneath like a lesson he had learned and did not have to repeat today. He landed and the cabin clapped because a stag party had decided to be sentimental, and he rolled his eyes because he was still himself and did not have to become humbled at every opportunity. On the way back he thought of the stage map in the corner of his mind and the way a rope lies right when you’ve treated it well, and he thought of Autumn’s pencil behind her ear and the way Tamsin’s voice runs to touch the last row, and he smiled without practice.

He went from the airport to the theatre because that was the path he had made and it fit. He tightened the loose bolt and took down a cable and put it back up again because the putting back up was the thing. He stood in the wings and watched a scene he had seen a dozen times and liked it anew because it was never the same and because he was allowed to be here while it wasn’t the same. When the bowl came on, a prop now and only that, he looked at it only as long as it took to confirm it had no surprises to offer. He went to the corridor where the roof had planned its revolution and found it dry and decided not to trust it. He picked up a bucket anyway and put it in the nook where buckets go and he did it with a small smile for his own ridiculousness, which felt like good hygiene.

His phone buzzed with a message from Dr. Ellis that said simply, Maintenance is a therapy too, which made him want to argue and agree and then say thank you. He typed back, Opening night went without water, and she replied, Impossible, and added a smile no one could bill him for. He put his phone away because the lights were going and the meatball was due to descend and the rope in his hand had been waiting. He did not tell anyone he was happy because saying it would make the ceiling look at him. He did the thing in front of him and thought, with an odd reasonable pride, that there are days when what you manage is the measure, and today he had managed buckets, and light, and a bowline, and the act of standing next to water without giving it a name.Rowan learned the theatre’s sounds in the week after opening the way you learn the layout of a friend’s kitchen by being left to make tea. There was the grumble of the dimmer packs when everyone forgot to be gentle, the soft maybe of the smoke machine before it decided to be a personality again, the call-and-response of people calling “Coming through,” and other people stepping aside with the half-dance of bodies trained to share space. He found himself knowing where the wrench would be before he looked and reaching for tape in the place it had no right to be because someone had returned it there out of habit. He liked the way the room gathered itself ten minutes before a run as if it were an animal tensing in a way you wouldn’t notice unless you knew the animal. He liked the way Autumn’s voice cut through a muddle without having to be sharp, the way Tamsin’s laugh could be placed in the building if you drew a circle around the spot where people had just turned their heads. He came in off a flight from Belfast on a Wednesday, changed his shirt in a broom closet that doubled as a shrine to missing extension leads, and climbed a ladder with the kind of proprietary affection that would have worried him a month earlier because he would have thought it meant he was becoming one of those men whose hobbies colonize them. Now it felt less like colonization and more like seeing the shape of his day before it arrived and choosing it anyway.

He had not lost aviation by finding a stage. The cockpit was still the same rectangle of sense where people addressed him as if decisions were edible. He had done Aberdeen and Belfast and the short hop that pilots pretend to hate and secretly like because it allows them to feel useful without changing time zones. The Channel had been under him on a morning clear enough to tempt bravado, and he had looked down at its plate-glass and felt the old fear flare in the shallow way it does when the brain is trying to get attention with a lighter rather than a bonfire. He named things out loud in the cockpit in a voice too quiet for the first officer to register as odd—the waypoint, the wind, the word open—and the flare went out because naming can be a kind of weather-control if you do it without adjectives. He told Dr. Ellis that in their next session, and she wrote it down as if he had given her something she might use on a day when the world refused to be reasonable with someone else. When he left her office she pointed at the raincoat hanging on the back of the door and said, “Borrow it forever,” and he had laughed because she had just rebranded lending as generosity and it made the thing easier to accept.

It was Autumn who suggested the trip to the hire warehouse near the reservoir, because the theatre’s smoke machine had decided to retire early on a Friday night, the way machines do when they have guessed the worst time to become philosophical. “It’s out by the Welsh Harp,” she said, brushing plaster off a script as if it were dandruff. “We can take the Zipcar if you can bring yourself to be a driver. I have a list of screws the size of your thumb and a superstition about the exact make that likes the meatball.” He agreed because he had realized that errands with Autumn were not errands. They were a way to hear her think and to practise being a person in a car who did not have to remember the speed of sound. She navigated with the kind of paper map that made his mouth ache with fondness for an age in which directions could be folded, and they laughed too much at a roundabout that had taken against them and then behaved when bribed with the indicator. The sky was grey in the way London chooses when it can’t be bothered to pick a mood, and the radio offered a programme about a man who had catalogued every postbox in Lincolnshire, which made Autumn happy in that sure, surprising way that told him more about her than any earnest revelation could.

The reservoir appeared to the left like a lesson. Water gathered itself up in a way his body recognized as a paragraph he could read without shaking. It was softer than the river because it did not have to pretend to be on its way anywhere. Autumn watched him out of the corner of her eyes, the picture of someone not watching, and he said, “It looks domestic,” as if he were making peace with a relative he’d argued with at Christmas. She told him about a school trip here when she had been nine, the way the teacher had told them to look for grebes with a zeal that frightened her a little because she had not known about birds that do things with their necks as if they were showing off. “We got told about the dam,” she said. “I remember thinking that any wall against water is a confidence trick that works until it doesn’t, and that grown-ups are always pretending the trick is more than it is.” He laughed and it wasn’t sharp. They parked under a sycamore that had failed to be majestic and walked towards the hire place past a family doing that sharp, trench-banter bicker that happens when someone insists on making leisure into labour.

They made the transaction with a man who had the air of someone who had named all his tools after people who had disappointed him and marched the new smoke machine out to the car like a small fridge. Autumn did the thing she always did and read the manual out loud as if it were poetry and he said rude things about manuals because it would have made his stepfather proud. On the way back, she suggested they stop by the water’s edge because she had a superstition that anything brought from near water would behave better if it had been introduced to the place it would not be allowed to touch. “You’ll tell me it’s nonsense,” she said, and he said, “It’s nonsense, and let’s do it,” because he had learned her balance of mockery and ritual. He stood and watched the small pitched sail of someone’s stupid money moving across the surface and he put his hand into the air above the water and counted to eight because he was not yet the person who could put his hand into the actual lake and laugh about it. Autumn did not press him into piety. She stood beside him and told him about a village in Germany where she had seen a man sweep snow off a roof with a broom and carry his breath like a friend, and he loved her for giving him something else to imagine while his muscles did the work of not turning his day into a test.

They returned the smoke machine to the theatre like a minor caravan, and James swore he could smell better dreams as soon as it had been plugged in, which was the kind of nonsense he relied on to make the rest of his sentences credible. Tamsin had a matinee performance to prepare for which meant she was both a cloud and a drill sergeant depending on which corner she was standing in. She had been seen by a reviewer the night before, a man whose cardigan had made him look as if his opinions would be edible and were not. “He had a knuckle whiteness about him,” she said, slapping her cheeks to wake the muscles. “He wrote down the moment I sneezed and looked delighted by it, as if he had discovered a new species of error.” Rowan told her to stop reading him before he existed on paper and to aim her eyebrows at the row which had paid the least for their tickets. She kissed his forehead as if he had offered her a spell and ran to the wing without looking where she was going, which produced a small spasm in his chest that was not fear and not admiration but an anxious cousin of both with the face of a parent.

The matinee audience was made of people who had made bargains with themselves and won. There were babies that would be fed at exactly the wrong moment, couples who had agreed to argue later, old men who had brought a book in case the theatre disappointed them and then put it away guiltily when the room went dark. The show began well and then performed its act of being alive by doing something small and wrong. The meatball hesitated at a cue that had never troubled it before and decided to descend at a speed designed to inform rather than amaze. For three seconds the stage contained an ambiguous object doing a possibly dangerous thing, and Rowan held the rope in a way that would not appear to be holding the rope and put his foot against the brake housing in a trick he had last used on a school trip to a climbing wall when he was sixteen and determined not to be frightened of girls. The meatball thought better of its mutiny and settled into place with a contrite glow. Afterwards, Autumn said, “What did you do,” not as an accusation, but as if she had decided to add his trick to her list of ways to persuade objects to think with you. He showed her the foot and the angle and she smiled in her half-face way and said, “We’ll call it the boot adjustment and write it in the book as if we always meant it.”

He was truthful with his mother on a bus that smelled of a stranger’s hair and cumin. The line was scratchy and she had decided to cook something that hissed at oil, and he told her he had put his hand above a reservoir and not died. She told him she was proud with the same matter-of-fact tone she used when telling him the price of courgettes and it went into him much more easily that way. She asked if Autumn’s real name was Autumn or if it had been a choice she made as a teenager, because his mother believed names told on you, and he said he didn’t know, and then found out he wanted to. Later, when he asked, Autumn said, “It’s real. My mother had a system. My brothers are Winter and Sol, for the solstice. You can imagine what the parents’ evenings were like.” He laughed and it felt like a thing with a bow on it, and he told her about his own name being chosen because his mother had liked a tree in a book, and they both acknowledged, silently, that strange parents make interesting children and that being interesting is either a defense or a wound depending on the day.

Karen used her eyebrow as a tool again and called him into the office to talk about Lisbon. “You’re cleared,” she said, crisp and not liking the relief in her own voice, “and we need bodies that know which end of a checklist is the beginning. It’s over water, yes. It’s also a handful of people who think holidays are a moral right, and you get to give it to them.” He thought about the map that would be on his knee, the bit of blue that had stopped being an enemy and become a neighbour who dislikes the music you play but will accept biscuits if you bring them. He told her he would do it, and he did not say the word brave because she had told him once that brave is often a word we use when we mean cornered and he was not cornered today. He told Anil by sending him an airplane and a wave and Anil replied with a gif of a cat paddling in a bath and then, after a beat, wrote, You can do hard things and stupidly I believe in you, which made him want to buy Anil a car and also never admit to having feelings in a room with other adults.

The morning of Lisbon dawned with a sky that would have been a cliché if it had belonged to any other city. He had done his rituals in small and without narration. He had stood under the shower and let it make him a person who can get on a train without smelling like last night. He had touched the glass he had left by the sink and found it empty because he had finally learned to drink from it rather than memorialize it. He had walked past the river with the same regard you give to a lion in a zoo when you trust the fence and the lion does too. At the gate, a boy in a dinosaur hoodie insisted on giving him a sticker because he had decided that pilots were on the side of dinosaurs and why shouldn’t they be. In the climb, he watched the Thames turn into a toy and then into a diagram and then into something his eyes would not identify because height had changed the rules. The Channel came up like a reasonable argument and he was not undone by it and he did not triumph over it either; he just flew and he let that be both enough and everything.

Lisbon was the right kind of bright and the wrong kind of wind, and he landed in the middle of it and only thought once about the way the water there looks like soda because of the way the light slaps it into believing in itself. He had an espresso with a view of a hill that had decided to be dramatic and thought of telling a stranger that he had not drowned today, and then didn’t, because the day had enough work to do. On the way back he had a second in which a bank of cloud pretended to be more than it was and the radar pretended to be calm and he did the thing Karen had hired him to do, which was to let his hands perform and his voice be a place where people could put their faith without having to move their belongings. He told the cabin to expect bumps and there were bumps and everyone survived the indignity of being reminded that air is a thing and not just a habit.

He came straight to the theatre because the theatre had become the city’s second airport for him, a place where arrivals and departures were negotiated in the dark. He found Autumn with her sleeves pushed up like a woman addressing flour and a list so long it looked like a poem about scarcity. She passed him a wrench without looking and he caught it without thinking, and on another day that would have been the news. Tamsin was in the dressing room painting a new eyebrow shape that made her look briefly as if she had sworn allegiance to a different country. “We have a man from the council in,” she said, with the dread that British people reserve for phrases like that. “He wants to check the exits and decide whether our taste in carpet is a fire hazard. Smile at him with your pilot face if you love me.” He went and smiled and the man from the council softened, because uniforms make administrators believe that the world might yet behave, and the exits were declared sufficient and the carpet was allowed to live because Autumn had done the paperwork in triplicate and he was learning to love her for her capacity to shepherd details until they became easy.

After the show, they went to a pub with a ceiling that had collected a century of declaration and a floor that gave back not quite enough information about the stickiness of its own history. Sukh told a story about a show he had worked on in a town that had decided it was bigger than it was, and Eddie explained his tattoo of a wrench with more seriousness than he gave to his rent. Autumn drank a half pint as if it were a sermon and he watched her throat work and discovered he was becoming embarrassing in his own head. Tamsin stood on a chair and declared the success of the run in the language of a minor aristocrat thanking the peasants for their due, and they booed her and loved her for it. When they spilled into the street at closing time, the air had been rinsed by a late shower and the pavement had that clean smell you get when city dirt has been reorganized into something less ambitious. Autumn looked up at the strip of sky an alley allows and said, “I used to think if I could catch that bit of blue and put it in my pocket I would never mind living indoors,” and he blurted out, “I like you,” in a way that made his ears decide to perform blushing as an Olympic sport.

She did not flinch or turn their night into an event. She took the sentence, turned it over like a coin, and put it in a jar, and said, “Good,” as if he had told her he had remembered to bring a torch, and then she looked at him as if she might open the jar later and count the coin again. He walked home with a sense of having done something irreversible and not being required to narrate it. He stood under the shower and did not count. He thought about egress and exit and decided that liking someone is a form of entry that no one tells you how to reverse, and that was fine because he had grown tired of reversing.

Dr. Ellis called his progress dull in the best way and prescribed more dullness. “Think of maintenance as a virtue,” she said. “Make your water chores boring. Clean the kettle. Descale. Make a fuss about the washing-up and then stop making a fuss.” He followed orders because being bossed in a sensible tone had become his kink and he did not tell anyone that because everyone deserved one private ridiculousness to be carefully placed in a drawer. He cleaned a kettle and marvelled at the limescale as if it were a map of a small country he had been handed to govern. He descaled it and felt like a god punishing a geological era. He rinsed and filled and did not get dramatic, and he sat down afterwards with the quiet fizz of having done a thing small enough to be ignored and important enough to be everything for an afternoon.

On a Tuesday that had decided to be unambitious, the theatre flooded again, not with drama but with the petty insistence of a pipe deciding to be yesterday. This time he laughed when he saw the thin snake of water negotiating with the stage door and said “Buckets,” and three people said it with him as if it were a hymn. He wore boots that remembered him and jeans that would complain and he placed towels and moved cables and it was nothing and it was something and he did not think about the pool or the river or any named body of water; he thought about this patch of wet floor and the way the mop made a sound like gossip. Afterwards, he and Autumn ate sandwiches too quickly to taste properly and talked about a play they would never be allowed to stage because it would require a budget and a disregard for physics. The conversation was a model of future joke-making and he realized he was storing it the way you store a good photograph in a place you will remember.

Lisbon, Belfast, Glasgow; the roster ran like a string of beads and he kept picking the next one up without breaking the thread. On a flight back from Glasgow the captain who had known him when he was a co-pilot asked him if he had “sorted his water thing out,” as if water came with a customer service line. Rowan said that he was sorting and the man nodded and told him about a cousin who had once been afraid of the colour green and had become a gardener out of spite. He liked the story because it gave fear the shape of something you could plant against. He liked the way, when he told Autumn about it later while kneeling to gaffer-tape down a cable that had offended a health and safety document, she said, “Spite is a profoundly underrated motivator,” and he felt his insides organize themselves around the idea as if it were a prop that made a scene work.

Tamsin was photographed for a newspaper that still used ink in a way that dirtied you back, and her ear was gold again because she had decided to remind the city that gods are local. The review was kind in the way that counts and cruel in the way that doesn’t, and she taped it up on the noticeboard at an angle that made it look modest. She announced a run extension as if she were telling them the government had fallen, and everyone pretended to groan because that is the theatre’s way of clapping when it is tired. James pretended to refuse and then told them his mother had cried during the quiet bit and that was all the patter anyone needed. Autumn changed a battery in a headset with the delicacy of operating on a cat and glanced at Rowan with a tiny yes in the air between them that felt like a hand without the risk of touching in a room full of people.

He went with his mother to the garden centre in June as promised and pushed a trolley that had one wheel dedicated to farce. They discussed begonias with the solemn unseriousness they saved for that day and ate sandwiches that had chosen to be damp and pretended to be furious about it. She pretended not to notice that he hovered near the water feature aisle as if it were an exhibit in a museum of his own failures, and he pretended not to notice that she reached and switched off a trickle on a plastic rock when he wasn’t looking and then switched it back on with ostentatious confidence when he was. He told her about Autumn with the restraint of a man who had known the damage of running at a story and she told him about a woman in her book group who had bought a kayak for reasons that had never been discovered, and they both laughed at the way middle age insists on being dramatic in the garden.

On a Sunday that could not decide to be Sunday without assistance, he and Autumn walked along the canal behind the library with coffees that did the job without style. She told him about the time she had toured with a show in a van that had believed it was a horse box and had been offended every time it had been asked to carry something that was not a horse. He told her about a night flight to Barcelona where the stars had been brighter than the instruments and he had wanted to take off his headset and be a person under them rather than a person between them and a sensible landing. They paused near the footbridge where a child in a tutu was declaring war on a goose with a stick and an adult was trying to make diplomacy perform its duties. The canal was flat as a diagram and the surface was interrupted every few seconds by fish mouths making perfect solemn O’s like commentators. He found his hand fitting into the space near Autumn’s without messaging it to do so, and when their fingers touched there was no lightning, there was a home switch being flicked on in a house he wasn’t sure he could afford. She looked at him and he looked back and he didn’t ask and she didn’t answer and then they walked on.

He still had days. He had a Tuesday when the idea of a bath made him laugh and then made him sit on the edge of the tub and put his feet in and breathe as if he had been told to do so by a scientist. He had a Thursday when a cloud he had once called a friend turned ugly on approach and he did his job and then did not sleep because his body had decided to file the experience under “things to be discussed at length,” and he went to the theatre and was given a ladder and a problem and the problem was solved in time with the music in his head. He had a Saturday where the river looked at him and he looked back and then they both decided to be dignified about it. He had an afternoon sitting on a carpet in a church hall opening another raffle where the punch bowl was too far away to be a sermon and a child asked him if he lived on a cloud and he told the truth and said, “No,” and then added, “Sometimes.”

The building started to trust him with secrets, the way old theatres do if you spend time touching them like something you respect without needing to own. He learned that the second seat from the left in row G had always had a loose arm and would give way at exactly the moment someone said a line about betrayal. He learned that there was a window you could climb out of to get to nowhere, and that nowhere had a view worth lying for. He learned to hear the difference between Autumn’s tread on the stairs and everyone else’s, which made him either ridiculous or attentive in the right amounts. He tightened things that didn’t need tightening because the act was a lullaby, and he left loosened things alone because the world requires a species of slackness to keep turning.

He flew Lisbon again and Glasgow again and began to feel the map like the palm of his hand. He learned to take pleasure in the ridiculous consistency of airport coffee and the idiocy of men on stag weekends who believed pilots were their priests. Anil told him he had met someone and promptly failed to name them for three days, which was the kind of male magic he recognized and tolerated. Karen sent him a schedule with a potential long-haul in it for winter and he looked at it the way you look at coats in July. Dr. Ellis told him she was moving clinics and he felt disloyal to the room, then remembered that rooms are not people, and people are allowed to move.

In late June, a heatwave took London by the throat and convinced it to care about ice. The theatre smelled of old velvet and ambition, and the smoke machine decided to make its own weather outside of requests and had to be sweet-talked into indolence. Tamsin’s gold ear stuck to her neck in a way that made her invent a swear word that would one day be useful to sailors. Autumn wore her hair up with a pencil stabbed through it like authority, and he watched her neck with the concentration of a man who knows there is only one religious experience he wants and it involves a person standing near a fan. The roof did not leak because it was too busy being a griddle for pigeons. The audience came in with fans and old programmes and the determination to be transported, and he did his cues and changed a gel and spoke into a headset to tell someone that someone else had three minutes and it felt like music.

When the lights went to black at the end and the applause came like rain that you have asked for and got, he stood in the wing with his hand on a rope and understood that happiness in his case was a collection of small domestic acts done at the right time in the right place with the right people. It was a bucket placed where a bucket was needed. It was a flight done without theatre. It was a theatre done without panic. It was a hand finding a hand on a canal and not needing a speech after. It was a mother who would always offer custard for a cake that could not be saved. It was a doctor who said maintenance as if the word were a spell. It was a chandelier that looked like a meatball and behaved when asked. It was water that minded its business and a man who, for now, could walk past it without making an enemy of himself.London had become a room that had forgotten to open a window. The heat bent newsprint and tempers; the buses exhaled as if smoking from the effort; the pavements gave back a smell like coins left in a pocket too long. The theatre kept its cool the way old brick does, by remembering winters in its bones, but even it reached a point where a lamp touched with bare hands felt like a dare. James declared an interval between intervals and bought a sack of ice that he distributed in mugs with the piety of a priest. Autumn tied her hair up with a piece of string because all sensible elastic had died this week, and though she was no less steady, her patience had acquired a visible sheen. Rowan moved more slowly because the city had told everyone to, and the meatball glowed in a way that suggested it was recalling a former life as a sun.

A letter arrived with the tone of news that had interrogated itself in committee and now wanted to be loved. The Totally Thames festival had noticed their show and wanted a version of it on a temporary stage down by the river, a short set of scenes lifted and remixed to suit outdoors and the attention span of people who were trying to be on their way somewhere else. James pretended to be devoutly unsure for half an afternoon and then circled the date with an ecstatic pen because a director who can resist a festival by the water for longer than four hours is a myth. The idea of delivering a piece of theatre to the river made everyone taller. It made Rowan feel briefly as if he had been invited to dinner by an old adversary’s kitchen. He nodded and said yes in a voice that had stopped making speeches about bravery and simply asked what needed to be carried.

On a morning that pressed at the edges like dough rising in a bowl, Autumn asked him if he would like to meet the part of her life that had decided to stay complicated: her family. She said it the way you say, there is weather over there, as if acknowledging the existence of systems could change their behaviour. Winter, the eldest, was doing a barbecue in Hampstead Heath “with the air of a man who has invented sausages,” she added, and Sol had promised to bring a friend who played the accordion like a threat. Rowan said yes because she had tilted her head to ask, and because the ponds were in that part of the world, and if he were going to do the kind of honest work Dr. Ellis kept prescribing, he might as well do it within walking distance of a good picnic.

Winter looked like a person who had persuaded a beard into being a personality and was slightly embarrassed about it. He shook Rowan’s hand with earnest decisions and handed him a plate before anyone agreed it was time to be fed, a hospitality that foreclosed half of anxiety’s options. Sol had a laugh that had given itself too many rooms and needed tenants. Their mother did not make an appearance because she lived in a town that had taken to cultivating its eccentricities like roses and refused to come to London in June. The group arranged themselves under a tree that had graduated from shade to vocation and began to talk about the Heath the way people who use a place correctly do: in terms of corners and sudden spaces and the one bench on the path where a person had once said something and now the bench looked like it was holding it. Autumn’s brothers took to Rowan with the immediate affection of men grateful for someone who knew what to do with a rope and a heavy thing, and he tried not to telegraph relief.

The ponds were near enough to be evidence and far enough to be resistible. Rowan watched people do water in public—walk into it with inherited courage, pretend to shiver with gusto, arrange swimsuits into social statements, hoist themselves out with necessary inelegance—and felt the familiar flicker in his calves and jaw like old wiring wanting to spark. Autumn did not point. She followed his gaze without turning her head and then asked if he wanted to walk by the edge with her, and he did because walking by the edge was a skill that belonged to the newly brave and the sensible both. They passed the signs that had decided to be both welcoming and municipal, and Rowan was briefly undone by a child who announced, with operatic certainty, that she was part mermaid and needed to conduct an inspection of the reeds. The water lay there unbothered by the theatre of children. It had a confidence made of small, lapping facts.

It was Autumn who stepped closer and skimmed a stone almost technically, the stone leaving a series of faint exclamation marks in its wake. He admired the motion because it was the kind of competence that comes from childhood and cannot be borrowed later without making your body jealous. He told her something true and small to earn the right to stand here: that he had wanted, at nine, to swim in the millpond near his grandparents’ caravan and had been told no because of weeds, and that disappointment had apparently waited patiently to be replaced by something larger. She told him that Winter had tried to teach her to dive at thirteen and she had ended up doing a repertoire of hilarious mistakes that had made them both earnestly happy. He put his hand toward the surface and stopped, not dramatically, just at the point where you agree to negotiate again tomorrow. Nothing in him roared. He counted. The heat helped; the surface looked like a mirror in a film that had chosen soft lighting. He withdrew his hand without apology and they walked back past a woman in a straw hat who was telling an anecdote about an oak tree as if the tree and the story were married.

Dr. Ellis had given him a gentler variant of homework for hot days: go to the Serpentine and sit by the boat hire kiosk, and when the word later stops shouting, turn it into now. So he asked Autumn if she would do a ridiculous thing with him and hire a pedalo. She looked at him with a kind of careful glee he had learned: she was delighted, and she was ready to call it off without making him deliver a sermon if his mouth changed its mind. They went early, before the city remembered itself, and paid a teenager who had borrowed authority and whose sunburn would go to college. The boats were blue the way cartoon water is blue; they promised safety in the stupid way bright plastic thrives on. Rowan murmured the word buoyancy once, to say it was real, and then got in with the deliberate slowness of a man approaching a sleepwalker. The wobble gathered under his feet and did that mean thing water does, naming every vertiginous part of the body, and then it didn’t. He sat. He breathed. He looked at Autumn’s hands on the metal rim—old rings glinting, knuckles neat, confidence assumed—and he pedalled because pedalling is the category of movement a boy inside him had never stopped trusting.

By the centre of the lake they were part of a morning procession of awkwardness and ducks. He watched the swans and hoped the boat did not speak swan for challenge. Autumn told him about a set she had designed in university that had required furniture to float across a stage on cue and how the hydraulic mechanism had once sighed and said, absolutely not, and the actors had taken off their dignity and pushed the sofa by hand. He found himself laughing because the image completed itself with ease in his mind: her, ten years younger, ordering physics into shape while wearing a jumper with sleeves too long. The water made its long noise around the boat like a rumour passing. He reached down and let his fingers drag for the breath of a second, and the shock was clean, unsurprising, almost commonsensical. It was not an act of overcoming; it was a handshake in public. He told her and she nodded with that permission she carried, and because she did not tell him who he was, he managed, absurdly, to be him.

The theatre accepted the festival booking with the solemn hysteria it reserves for adventures. They pared the show down to a version that could occur in wind and be applauded by people who planned only to look for a second and then found themselves involved. The meatball could not go because the riggers at the riverside stage had seen five hundred dreams and knew the word liability by its first name. James invented a different symbolism that made the lights do something brief and persuasive; he was unbearable about it for a day and then grew tired of his own excitement and became useful again. Rowan learned the load list and the ways ropes behaved in outdoor air, a different discipline that made him consult his hands as if they were colleagues with a dialect. Autumn walked the site with him two days early, clipboard in its natural habitat, and the river lay there doing its old act. He named things instead of describing them: pontoon, risers, cable path, mains. The practice had become a path through the noise.

Rowan’s airline, as if colluding with narrative in a way that would have annoyed him if he had noticed, asked him to attend a corporate thing in Docklands for a water charity. It would be in a glass shoebox by a dock, canapés under the domed cutlery that always looks like astronauts. He half expected to be paired with a PowerPoint about responsibility. He had never liked being beside a body of water that had been told to behave because it rarely did. He put on his uniform and his best silence and went, because employment and stories are both bargains. The speeches did their moral arithmetic. He stood on a wooden walkway pretending it was an aisle between rows of seats and watched two teenagers in high-visibility vests unfurl a banner and coax it into admitting a noun. The dock had attractions: a priest’s sensible calm, moorings holding their own. At the end he shook hands and saw his face in the reflection of a glass door and looked like a man who had been brave for other people’s comfort, which he forgave because everyone had eaten a vol-au-vent too quickly.

A day later the weather gave up pretending to be good. The approach into Bristol wore rain like a bad mood, and the wind tried to pat them down. The cloud did its best impression of architecture. Rowan let his hands take the day away from adjectives. The autopilot surrendered with a beep that made the cockpit one notch emptier, and his shoulder blades found their old place against the seat. The runway landed under them exactly where it should be and the praise came, as it always did, in the form of a silence no one admitted relief into. The first officer, a woman with the exhausted generosity you only see on very competent days, said, “Thanks,” in a tone that moved the word into work rather than ritual, which was his favourite version of gratitude. On the crew bus he texted Autumn, told her about the rain without euphemism, and she replied with a picture of the theatre ceiling with a small speech bubble attached: behave, it said, and the roof, so far, was listening.

He saw her flat for the first time on a weeknight when the air couldn’t be bothered to move. It was a narrow place declared larger by good attention; books given jobs, tools stored with sentences attached to their hooks, a plant with an held-over winter surviving on promise. She made pasta as if boiling were an argument she knew she would win, and the sauce had the honesty of a person who has been broke enough to count onions. They ate at a table that had seen better napkins. He looked at her and she looked back not as a mirror but as a person who had decided to join a conspiracy. He told her about the ding in the fuselage he had once chased down because the night crew had not written it up, and she told him about a theatre in Wakefield where the light board had thrown a tantrum in the middle of a funeral scene and they had lit it with plug-in lamps and a torch and it had been better. When they kissed it was not a reward, and not an accident. It was developmental honesty. He felt, obliquely and with relief, that the person he had been rehearsing not to be for the last months would not be asked to attend.

The festival afternoon arrived a degree cooler, with a wind off the river that once would have felt like someone’s idea of malice and which now felt like an opinion he didn’t have to take. The temporary stage was a puzzle solved and unsolved and solved again five times before anyone stood on it. The man in charge of the platform had a calm earned from being shouted at by seaside weather for twenty years and not forgetting where he put his tools. He showed them the cable runs in a series of gestures that had their own syntax, and Autumn understood at once, as she always did. The audience was the kind you get by the river in late summer: tourists holding texts up to the sky to see if that improved their meaning, boys with loud hair working out how to occupy a step publically, women with prams making maps for nap time, older couples not looking at each other lovingly so much as practicing the art of parallel observation. The water was opportunistic, licking the edges of people’s focus, making itself a blink in their eyes.

They did the first scene to a polite cluster, the second to a crowd that had gathered because someone else had stopped. The wind took one line and made it a joke by placing it near a passing boat’s speaker and no one minded. Tamsin was in her god phase and made a speech that sounded like she had known the river when it was a less ambitious stream. Rowan kept count and kept eyes; he had learned to do both in one breath. A gust came the wrong way and tried to lift a flat. Sukh had three fingers on it and three were not enough. Rowan arrived with a fourth and the bowline he'd tied in his head back then happened again outside. He got a rope round a steel upright like the rope had wanted to be there all along. The flat thought about leaving and decided to stay. A wave slapped the pontoon in a way that splashed nobody and announced itself too late to be relevant. He looked at the water because he could and then looked away because there were cues. The tide, indifferent, changed its mind about height, as it always does.

Afterwards there was that particular kind of triumph small theatre allows itself: a huddle that was wider than usual, furious generosity dispensed via crumbled biscuits, an intoxication that came without a hangover because the high was work-shaped. James declared himself insufferable for the evening in a way that let him get away with it, and Autumn’s smile had a tiredness under it that made it more valuable. Rowan went to coil a cable and found an old man in a cap watching him with the interest people save for competence they would never need. The man said, “I did the boats here after the war,” and then said the price of petrol in units that no longer meant anything and wandered away because a dog had remembered him.

On the way back, carrying the last of the Useful Nonsense to the van, Rowan walked the edge of the Thames on purpose. He let his hand brush the top of the railing because it grounded him to a human height. The river was doing its unending homework, and he had things to do that evening that did not involve it: a list to rewrite, a flight to confirm, a call to his mother about courgettes and, if they were unlucky, politics. The water did not look at him because it was busy is the sentence he would have liked to write in his head and believed by rote. The actual sentence was that he did not require it to look at him at all. He smiled at that, slightly annoyed by himself and slightly proud, and when Autumn slipped her hand into his while telling a story about a man who had complained she had breathed too loud on his notes during a rehearsal for a different show entirely, he squeezed once, lightly, and the squeeze was answered in a language he had acquired slowly enough to trust.

The theatre returned to its size like a person taking off shoes they had been performing tall in. They slotted the borrowed pieces back into their rightful hooks and the building did its long exhale that occupies the night. Rowan did two morning flights in a row and learned again how bodies rearrange their sense of time when asked nicely and consistently. He found himself checking the Met Office summaries with the interest of a man who had learned to treat weather like a friend who could be difficult and not an enemy with plans. The phobia did not send postcards; it did not announce a victory or a surrender. It lived in him like a lodger who had agreed to vacuum the hall once a week and actually did it, for a while. When it sent up a flare on a Thursday because the plumbing downstairs knocked in an echo of something else entirely, he sat on the step and listened to it, then went upstairs, turned on the tap for thirty seconds, and didn’t wait for a certificate. Dr. Ellis called this a practice of dullness and he had begun to respect dullness as a way through.

Tamsin flirted with a bigger venue down south of the river that had actual insulation and the audacity to pay technicians on time, which made James bleat about authenticity until someone offered him a lighting rig and then he was a born-again modernist. The transfer would be small and short and glorious if it happened, and would require people to learn new corners and threads of cable and find a new place for the kettle to live. Rowan said he would be there for the get-in and the get-out if rosters allowed, and Karen looked at his request for a day switch with the benevolence of a woman who is bad at saying no to boys who remind her of people who once gave her good reasons in cockpits. He collected concessions where he could not collect victories.

On a Sunday dyed pale by exhaustion and the kind of sun that refuses to admit it is late, Rowan and Autumn walked east along the canal with the greedy happiness of people who had found a day that would sit still for them if they asked. He had not expected to be allowed this kind of peace without direct payment. He had always imagined it as something you booked and turned up for and got assigned a seat with limited legroom. Instead it arrived like a jay on a fence, uninvited and full of colour. They talked about nothing and then about work and then about the fact that nothing and work are not enemies. Autumn told him she collected phrases like screws, and that her favourite one this week was the retired pilot’s “Men go wrong when they let emptiness choose its own furniture,” and he realized that he had begun to furnish his days with deliberate ugliness if necessary, because useful trumps pretty when it’s your house and you are sick of tripping. He told her he wanted to learn to swim properly one day, not because it would be noble, but because he was tired of being narrow. She didn’t clap or solemnize. She told him she knew a place that did lessons where the instructors had old-fashioned patience and only raised their voices if you were rude to someone else. He nodded and let the idea sit on the fence with the jay, and if it flew away that was alright; there would be more birds.

The following week, when the city chose to rain with competence for an entire day, the roof at the theatre’s weak corner performed its ritual and everyone built the small country they knew how to build: sandbag, towel, bucket, tape, moving the idea of damage somewhere else until it gave up. Eddie had bought new mops that made him weep for the old mops because he was sentimental in ways he refused to explain, and the new mops did their blessed work without a song. Rowan did not make speeches inside his head. He kept count and moved things higher and said, “Breaker,” and someone said, “Done,” and the sodden towels were replaced with less sodden towels and no one drowned and the part of him that had once believed in catastrophe did not have enough fuel to burn. Autumn poured tea, and when he took the mug his hand brushed hers for a second and he felt the hum of something undramatic and crucial, a battery that lived in the kind of domestic power supply people call love when they are being flamboyant and practice when they are being honest.

Lisbon came back into the roster like a second attempt at a joke that had gone well the first time. He flew it again the way you do things you have learned not to be afraid of and have not yet had time to become bored with. The Atlantic sat there under the wing and did its scale trick—look small, persuade, and then once your brain has agreed, reveal endlessness—and he treated it with respect without granting it rights to his nervous system. He thought in the cruise about a phrase his mother had used in the garden centre aisle—“We are not the first people to have to water things”—and laughed in a way that made the first officer glance over and then look away because someone else’s solitary joke is a private room. He landed and took the taxi to the hotel even though his body wanted to walk because the day had a pattern already, and he was experimenting with not adding difficulty when he could help it. He slept badly, because he is not magical, and had a coffee that could have taught kindness to a cactus, and flew home.

The theatre accepted the transfer and became a traveller, which is a fancy way of saying they invented ways to throw their own belongings into a van. The bridge was busy. The river did its large-city thing—pretend to be decor until you need it. Rowan lifted and tied and taped. He put labels on boxes with the classifying zeal of a boy whose toys had once tried to escape. He watched Autumn in a new space and felt the exact same tug behind the breastbone he had felt in the old one, which told him the person mattered more than the room, which he had suspected and now knew. They fitted the show into corners that had never been meant for it and then realized those corners had always waited. He walked home past the Thames on purpose, which felt like showing off to no one, but sometimes you have to allow your own small audience; he allowed it, and then he didn’t do it again because he had errands and being ordinary had started to look like a star role.

He told Dr. Ellis, almost shyly, that the water had become many things and none of them a command. He told her about the pedalo and the pond and the way rain had been a promise and a bother rather than a character in the story, and she drew a graph he would have hated three months ago and looked at it with interest, and they laughed together about the idiocy of turning lives into lines. She suggested the next bit, gentle as always: stand waste-deep in something that can be trusted. He said he would, and she said it could be next week or next year or a winter when he would complain for other reasons. He left and noticed the poster in the surgery lobby about hydration, and laughed because now the world was just being silly.

Walking home he bought a lemon because his mother’s voice had been in his head all week about lemon juice over courgettes. He picked up biscuits no one liked because Autumn would make a face and eat one anyway, and he stepped to the edge of the bridge and looked down for the time it takes a thought to become a habit. The river did not tilt. He did not either. He moved on. It was enough, and he still had a wrench in his bag because he had forgotten to put it back, and the idea of being a man who accidentally stole a wrench and then confessed and returned it was, for reasons he could not explain, the most satisfying fact about him that day. He walked faster for no reason, and then slowed to look at a dog who had decided that rain made no difference to dignity, and this felt like practice for a life.

The matinee at the new venue went better than it deserved, because matinees are gods that sometimes prefer naps. A gentleman in a linen suit laughed at a place no man had laughed before and then tried to cover it with a throat noise that sounded like wind in a cello. The chandelier-less symbolism worked its quiet trick; the light warmed when hearts did and nobody wrote about it because that is not how critics live, and still it happened. The smoke machine negotiated with the house system and did not become a sulk, which was a relief so profound that half the technicians pretended not to notice in case the machine grew jealous. During the interval, while Tamsin took off her goddess and put on an ordinary woman to eat a crisp in company, a woman in the audience approached Autumn at the edge of the stage and told her that the sound of the fake rain had made her think about walking home with a broken umbrella when she was twenty in a city she hadn’t earned yet. Autumn said, thank you, and looked like someone who collects screws and stories and knows which drawer to use for each.

Rowan walked her home with the wrench still in his bag because he was, it turned out, that man. They stood under her door because her flat did not have a hallway that could hold a redundant conversation, and they kissed like people who might get better at it because there would be practice, and he was unsure, for the first time in months, of a thing that did not threaten him. Autumn opened her door and he went inside, behind a person who believed in maintenance as mercy. They laughed at nothing, ate the bad biscuits because not to would be rude to decisions, and he told her he would sign up for the lessons at the lido when the heat went again and the water made a different promise. She said she would come and stand on the edge and hold his towel like a ritual. He told her that sounds like marriage and then wanted to retract it and could not, and she put her chin on his shoulder and said, marriage is just another word for remembering where the wrench goes, and he, stupidly and deeply, loved her. He showered at her place and did not count and returned the wrench in the morning and felt like a citizen.The heat went the way of certain arguments, not decisively so much as with a shy change of subject. Leaves in the little squares of Pimlico forgot their gloss and discovered the satisfaction of dullness. Buses stopped apologizing for their own breath. The theatre smelled less of old velvet and more of the rain that came properly at last. Autumn, the person, put her jumpers back into circulation with the contentment of someone returning to a language she speaks better. Rowan found himself walking more, because the city had lowered its voice and you could hear other people’s shoes again. He signed up for lessons at the Queen Mother Sports Centre on a Thursday evening because the name made him laugh and the pool was a known quantity surrounded by walls that had learned how to be trusted. He told no one at the airline because he did not want his bravery—such as it was—to be eaten as office cake.

The pool smelled of a childhood he hadn’t fully owned. Chlorine so precise about its business you could admire it without wanting more. The tiles were a municipal white with bruises where generations of feet had negotiated honesty. The instructor turned out to be a woman in her fifties with a stroke like punctuation and a whistle she used as grammar rather than threat. She introduced herself as Maris, looked him in the eye in a way that felt oddly like consent, and told him that most adults swim like furniture learning regret. “You will not be furniture,” she said matter-of-factly, and he believed her in the thin, good way you believe a pilot when they tell you about turbulence. Autumn sat on a bench with a towel the size of an intention and an expression that declared the whole thing both ordinary and sacred. He stepped down the ladder, calves styled as uprisings, and the water held him with the indifferent kindness he had been promised. Waist-deep, he felt ridiculous because men in their thirties are not supposed to negotiate with liquids in public, and then felt proud because men in their thirties often waste time pretending they don’t.

Maris’s first lesson was to teach him to put his face in and blow bubbles without apology. He resisted because it felt like a pantomime of courage, and then did it because she had a voice that turned silliness into sacrament. He exhaled and listened to the water change his noise, and found it calmed the part of his head that had been running up and down stairs since Heathrow. He learned the way breath organizes a body without asking for decoration. He kicked with a float under his hands and watched his toes behave as if they had been built for this and had been waiting impatiently to be consulted. He counted in eights because he couldn’t stop, and that was alright because eights are how you fold a day when you don’t know where to put it. A boy in goggles like buntings tried to race him and Rowan lost because he was a man with a job and a body with an argument, and because boys are rivers at that age and deserve to win. Autumn laughed from the bench and it steadied him in a way he would only admit in winter.

The theatre made it to Southwark on the second attempt. The new space was cleaner and larger and had rules written on walls in fonts that meant business. The house manager had a walk that declared she had seen twenty-seven shows die, and would prefer to watch something live for a change. James treated the grid as if it were a new pet with tricks to be learned ethically. The get-in was an extravaganza of labels. Rowan wrote in caps because caps behave better in the dark and because there was a part of him that regarded handwriting as a promise. Tamsin hated the carpets with a passion that made her more beautiful and then apologized to the carpet in case the building had ears. Autumn took measurements with a tape that had known better pockets and frowned only when the meatball had to become an ellipse. It wasn’t that she loved the original shape, it was that she hated telling objects they had to change without time to mourn.

He flew Belfast and the plane turned its day around halfway through because a man three rows from the back decided to become pale and silent. The cabin called and Rowan’s voice put on its large calm jumper because that was the garment that kept people from falling off their own edges. They diverted to Liverpool with the modest drama he preferred, the kind where nobody takes photographs because everyone has something simple and real to do. On the ground, the man breathed, inconveniently and within the acceptable range. The paramedics did their swift ballet with bright plastics and kindness, and afterwards Anil sat beside him in the crew bus and asked a question without any words and Rowan said, “He’s fine,” with a gravity that acknowledged the ways in which fine is a privilege. It rained and the rain made canticles on the window. He did not think of the pool. He thought about the way air will forgive you if you listen to it.

At a Turkish place in Victoria where the staff had decided to treat pilots like men who always had room for one more olive, Anil told him about his father’s new diagnosis with a grace that was mostly bone. He did the British thing of circling it with jokes and then let the jokes go when they tired him. Rowan found his hand on Anil’s sleeve and left it there long enough to be useful and not long enough to turn into theatre. “Say when,” Anil said, meaning all sorts of things, and Rowan said, “I will,” and used up one of his day’s ration of promises on purpose. They did not talk about water because water had stopped being medicine in every conversation he had and was now something that occasionally needed to be carried.

He met Autumn’s mother in a town where the local allotment society had more power than the council and everyone agreed that was for the best. Her house had been painted the colour of a decision and then negotiated back to the colour of tea. She opened the door with both hands as if she had invented the trick. Her name was Hazel and it made him feel simple in a good way to say it. The living room smelled like books that had been read rather than displayed. She assessed him as a carpenter runs a hand over a piece of wood and then softened because her daughter was doing a face at her from behind his shoulder. “He looks like he ties knots as if the rope were a person,” Hazel said, and Rowan, who would never have known how to receive such a sentence a year ago, said, “I try not to make it hurt,” and everyone agreed that would do. They ate a cake that thought very well of itself and drank tea that could have revived electricity. Hazel showed him the weather vane she had collected from a man called Derek who had spent thirty years persuading metal to imitate rooster opinions, and he discovered he could love a woman more for having been made by an earlier woman who had opinions about sensible gods.

Rain annotated their train back to London. The windows put on the old show of making streets into a painting full of vertical energy. Autumn leaned her head against the glass in that way that makes the glass jealous and told him stories about childhoods that had used up more laughter than was decent. He watched their reflection look tired and blurred and better than real, and pressed his fingers to the condensation until shapes admitted themselves. He had a second where the sound of rain took him back to the first day he had admitted out loud that showers were asking too much of him, and then the train thudded across a set of points and the jolt was the present insisting on itself. He did not resist being returned to the day.

Maris taught him how to float the way you teach someone a folk song: not with technique at first but with feeling. “The water has intentions but not against you,” she said, hand under his spine, palm dry because her body refused to admit other states in the presence of students. “Your job is to say yes to its thesis. It will hold if you allow it to.” He thought of the theatre, of props behaving when asked, and of the night the meatball had decided to be meek. He lay back and let his ears go under and understood why people spoke about submersion as if it were betrayal and a favor both. The pool turned to a noisy room heard through a door. The ceiling lights became a constellation no instrument had charted. Panic ran along him like a cat and then, finding no furniture to knock over, went away to sulk. He counted one-eight twice and then stopped counting because boredom had arrived and wanted to be introduced. Autumn, above him, was a smudge with a posture he would have recognized in an airport queue from a mile off, and he loved her for being legible even blurred. He exhaled slowly and felt his own bones accept that he was light enough to inhabit his life.

James’s old nemesis—a reviewer with the cardigan and the incremental cruelty—wrote a kind paragraph about the transfer, which meant it was less a review and more a note handed to a friend who had finally stopped offending. James carried it around limp with sweat and pretended to disapprove while showing it to everyone. Tamsin developed a cough that she swore was made of dust from someone else’s show and let Rowan heat honey to a temperature the kettle would consider blasphemous. Autumn was offered a job by a theatre in Leeds because a designer had tripped over an ego and fallen out of a season; the offer was neat and professional and arrived with a date that knocked politely on their calendar. She told him on a bench with bread inside a bag that looked like it had always been faithful. He watched the air fold around the news and knew with a craftsperson’s intelligence that choices had to be sanded before they were useful. He said, “I want you to say yes if yes is what your hands would have drawn,” and she looked at him with that respect you get when you don’t turn your own wishes into someone else’s homework.

A minor weather, the kind that doesn’t get BBC attention, blew up on the day the council wanted their token promenade. They had been invited to do three scenes on a strand of riverside where a man in a flat cap sold postcards featuring a skyline that had gone off. The crowd was the usual river congregation—dogs pretending to understand modern architecture, teenagers in squad formations filming themselves into being, couples adjudicating each other’s steps with ancient jurisprudence. The wind came from the east and brought with it the smell of a story that had decided to stay short. A child decided belligerently to put his foot through the slats of the railing because the slats were clearly there for feet, and his mother did the parenting equivalent of throwing her entire vocabulary at the situation. There was a second where the boy’s centre of gravity began to negotiate with the river in a language it did not speak. Rowan moved before the sentence finished. He had a hand on the belt of the boy’s trousers and a knee against the bottom bar and a weight that belonged to men who had lifted engines. He did not think about what it would mean to be in the water because he did not intend to be. The boy found the ground resentfully and took a breath as if being rescued had been done to him without proper documentation. The mother thanked him with a look that would kill a lesser god, and Rowan returned to the wing where rope waited and felt his lungs doing their old party trick and told them, politely, to sit down.

On the Monday after the river had gone back to ignoring him, he flew the Lisbon again and thought of corridors rather than coastlines. He had become fond of the way maps lie and are forgiven, the way blue areas perform the same trick of seduction each time and you grow used to saying no without becoming arrogant about it. The ocean was under him, textured like a field that has not made up its mind, and he regarded it with the countenance of a person who shops and says, not today, thank you. He passed a bank of cloud that had organised itself like a committee and the aircraft disagreed with it and then agreed and they both pretended to have been sensible all along. When he texted Autumn on the hotel bed with the remote control fallen down the side because those beds are designed to eat human small items, she wrote back a picture of the theatre’s broom cupboard with a wrench missing and the caption, I assume this is with you because fate is tired of irony.

The lido went with a ceremony of closing just after term. At the Serpentine they pulled the buoys out like Christmas decorations being put away by someone who refuses to believe it’s over. Rowan stood on the grass with a towel round his neck because towels round necks make men look both like prizefighters and like boys, and felt a secular sadness about the water’s timetable. He did one length in water that had decided to be honest about its temperature and discovered that shock is sometimes a cousin of laughter. He did not make a plan to swim the Channel. He let the cold turn him pink under a cloudy arrangement that would have made Turner get up again, and then he got out and let Autumn wrap him in the kind of friction that turns into heat. He thought about the ridiculous future where he might, at fifty, do a slow, satisfied width of a pool in Spain and then lie on a plastic lounger with a book about lighthouses and a respect for his own boring endurance, and the thought did not frighten him.

Karen put his name next to winter night flights with a pencil and a slanted question mark that looked like caution. He, who had spent years wishing for the long routes, looked at them like boots you had wanted once and forgotten how to lace. Dr. Ellis spoke to him about the way human bodies love a story of conquest and how therapists prefer stories about continued gardening. “You have weeds,” she said kindly, which two months ago would have felt like an insult, and now felt like someone handing him gloves. He told her about the boy at the railing and the impulse that did not consult fear first. She folded the story and returned it to him like a letter to be kept with the receipts. On the way out he took her raincoat off the hook and left it on and wondered if this meant he would have to fund an entirely new coat system for himself, which felt achievable in a way all achievements should aspire to.

Autumn said yes to Leeds and then found a way to keep the matinees and the nights until the going. Her calendar began to resemble a magician’s scarf—longer every time she pulled at it and brightly impossible. They made lists in the kitchen that gave the kettle new courage. They became unbearably grown up for three evenings and then gave up and ate breakfast for dinner because eggs repair most structural weaknesses. Winter sent a message that simply said, bring him north and I will show him a pub that judges no one. Sol sent a video of himself attempting to play a sea shanty on an accordion while a cat performed sabotage and wrote, we approve of your boyfriend because he persists. Hazel wrote a postcard she pretended had been lost in the post since 1997 and said, Beware of water features sold under the label of serenity; they are liars, and he put it on the fridge with a magnet shaped like a sausage dog.

They took a day and went to the coast because London had made them narrow and weather, when borrowed from the sea, can widen people if approached correctly. The train was full of families carrying a level of determination that would have won minor wars in the age of horses. The town they picked had a pier that believed in itself and chips with vinegar so confident they were all sermon. The sea looked exactly like an idea until you paid attention and saw that it had a different idea every twelve seconds. They walked the length of the pier, tolerated the shrieks of people who had chosen to be frightened by machines, and bought a postcard of a whale that had never made the mistake of coming this way. Rowan stood at the rail and let the wind do the job it wants to do—untie the knots in people’s faces—and thought of how far he had come and, more importantly, how to continue without congratulating himself so loudly he tripped. Autumn tucked her hand into his pocket for warmth and he leaned till the place between their shoulders agreed about weight. They did not speak about bravery. They spoke about sandwiches.

In the week before Autumn left for Leeds the river flooded the walkway at low tide because tides have a dark sense of humour and the city shrugged and changed its route. Rowan carried the habit of buckets like a superstition and found the old building dry, at least for now. He checked under the stage and encountered the rat that had become a myth and discovered it was a piece of cloth with aspirations. He set the meatball to half power for a rehearsal and it looked like a marble instead and he considered keeping it and then didn’t because tradition is the zookeeper of lies. He flew a late Glasgow that decided to show him all the reasons why pilots imagine they are more important than they are, and he came home humiliated into ordinariness, which is the tonic that mends.

Autumn left on a Tuesday that had chosen drizzle because it understood dramaturgy. They stood on a platform and did their impression of people who are being reasonable about trains and distance and the affordability of Leeds. She kissed him with her hand flat on his chest like a certifying officer. He said he would come up when he could and she did the maths in the air in front of his face because she was kinder when calculating. The train took her away and he did not make a scene for the benefit of strangers. He went to the theatre and made a small scene with a cable because he had to put his hands somewhere. He told Tamsin who made the motion of wiping away a tear and then pinched his forearm and said, “If you do melancholy as badly as you do flirtation, we’re doomed,” and he told her to go away with all the love in the world.

At night he lay in a bed that had acquired the habit of two and did the honest thing of missing a person without worrying that missing meant weakness. The shower was himself again, and he stood under it and created rain on purpose because making your own weather had become his idea of owning a day. He thought of his mother asleep, her phone under her pillow like a talisman against the world’s unfolding. He thought of the boy at the railing and of the instructor with a whistle, and of the way water will hold you if you are boring enough to let it. He thought of the river doing its adult work while the city played, and of the ocean, large as bureaucracy and as impersonal, not caring if he flew above it with competence. He slept, and his dream did not involve drowning or flying or falling; it involved a wrench being where it was supposed to be when he reached for it, which was the best dream he had had in a year.

In Leeds, on a weekend he had earned by resisting the temptation to become indispensable in London, he found Autumn elbow-deep in a box of screws at a theatre so cheerful it made him suspicious. The air smelled of damp ambition and fresh paint, and the people wore their usefulness like jewellery. Winter appeared with a handshake that was terrifyingly sincere and the promised pub delivered the miracle of chairs that did not pretend to be older than they were. They walked along a river that was not his and he discovered the relief of being a stranger beside water that owed him nothing. He put his hand near it and it didn’t try to tell him a story. He did not correct it. Autumn locked the stage door with the practised flick of a wrist and led him up a stair that had been negotiated with loudly by a builder in 1974. They slept, which is the most violent and kind act two people can do in a bed if done at the right time, and in the morning she kissed his shoulder with the intelligence of a person who knows which truths deserve to be told twice.

On a night flight back, the cabin lights at forty percent and tiredness like a dog that would not go to bed, Rowan looked down at the dark that had once been his geography of fear. The sea did not glitter because it had been properly instructed. He felt the old flicker and it passed through him like a nuisance phone vibration you learn to ignore. He thought about maintenance as mercy and the way he had become the person who could say, “Buckets,” and make a small army appear, and he thought, with a gratitude that would embarrass his younger self, about boring days. He landed and went to the theatre and discovered that the meatball had lost a screw that only he carried because he had forgotten to return it to a drawer, and he put it back and felt, proprietary and daft, like a man who could be trusted to open a raffle and float on his back and love a person named for a season without turning any of it into a legend.

He went to see his mother with Autumn on a Sunday designed in the factory of Sundays, grey and dignified with a roast somewhere nearby in someone else’s house making the right noises. Hazel was visiting too, as if the gods had decided to make the meeting inevitable and then pretend they hadn’t planned it. There was too much cake and too much weather. The two women, versions of authority with different handwriting, regarded each other with the wariness cats save for other cats they might end up disliking politely for ten years. They decided to be allies within fifteen minutes because women who have invented themselves recognize the work. They discussed lidos as if Europe were a map of swimming and laughed at the phrase “wild swimming” because water has always been wild and it is humans who write adjectives like fences. His mother made faces at the lemon drizzle until it behaved. Hazel made a small speech about kettle maintenance, and Autumn kissed Rowan’s knuckles under the table as if she had just invented the gesture and wanted to see if it would catch on.

When he left, the rain had decided to be kind about itself. He and Autumn walked down the street with the air on their faces doing exactly what it was supposed to do. He looked at the slick on the road and the quiet civility of people carrying umbrellas that had given up and at a little boy in a dinosaur coat who was refusing to get in a car because cars are for traitors. The river waited where it always waited, and the city lay around it like a person around a backbone, and he did not think of drowning, he thought of the rope cupboard at the theatre and the way things go on if you give them the chance. He squeezed her hand and she squeezed back and there was no lightning, only the steady hum of being alive at the same time as someone else, and in the catalogue of his fears, this remained the one that did not require a bucket.The week after Autumn left, the flat made a noise he hadn’t noticed before, the polite punctuating click of the boiler becoming world and then not. He found a satisfaction in the small repair of bleeding a radiator as if he had been given a minor organ to massage back into use. He made a list of the sort of chores that do not make it into novels and then performed them as if they were single cues on a night when the audience had paid in cash. He bought a new washing-up brush because the old one had grown hair like an elderly philosopher and he refused to debate with it. He stood in front of the cupboard where kettles go when they are off-duty and descale tabs when they are not performing and thought of Dr. Ellis saying maintenance as if it were a lullaby. He wiped a shelf so thoroughly that the air smelled briefly of lemon and arriving, and afterwards he sat down in a chair that encouraged ownership and let the quiet be not a test but a temperature.

At the pool Maris introduced him to the peculiar humility of learning to breathe where breathing had to be a decision. She had him float with a hand under the back of his head like a promise and a phrase that was already becoming domestic: soften the neck, soften the jaw. He discovered how much of his panic lived in muscles he would never have named, softened them, and found the room inside his chest expand as if a lodger had finally moved out and taken their impossible furniture. He learned the first strokes like words a foreign friend teaches you by pointing to things you already own: reach, catch, pull, breathe. He moved badly and then he moved a fraction less badly and in the arithmetic of adult learning that counted as a win. On the bench, Autumn’s towel lived where her body wasn’t, a kind of attendance that didn’t require her face to be present to count. He found that even on nights she was in Leeds, knowing she had left the towel in the bag where towels go made him behave with the sort of hope quiet enough to get work done.

The Southwark run taught him how quickly new spaces insist on being loved correctly or not at all. The sightlines were better, the toilets didn’t apologize, the fire doors knew their dayjobs, and still the room had a sulk he could feel in its lacquered bones. He and Sukh spent an afternoon coaxing a stubborn dimmer pack into accepting its place in the chain like a patriarch who had been politely retired. He wrote a new book for the flies because the previous book had been too kind to chaos, and renamed three cues not because the words mattered but because naming is a way of telling a room you see it. On a Tuesday, James came in with a rehearsal note that took four people and a saint to make sensible and Autumn looked at the note as if it were a dog she was thinking of adopting and said, mildly, “If we must,” and then made it work with a rearrangement of chairs that might, in another building, have counted as choreography. He began to see the way her mind held the picture in three dimensions, how she protected the actors by doing things they would never know had been done. He loved her most when she did something dull enough to be missed.

Karen gave him the Atlantic with the air of a woman handing over a casserole to someone she wasn’t sure had sufficient oven gloves. Night, westbound, a weather system that had grown tired of itself and was threatening to be dramatic. He dressed the flight in his head in the quiet way he had learned to dress all large tasks, inventorying it into pieces, refusing the temptation of the word ocean as if it were a drunk at a bar. The flight plan looked like music he could read. The brief was a sermon with good footnotes. The first officer was a man who did not perform indifference as a personality and that was, in its way, mercy. In the climb, London fell away like a polite phone call, and the Channel had the decency, for once, to behave like geometry rather than myth. In the high dark where people persuade themselves they are elsewhere while still being in tube seats, he did the work of hundreds of hands with two, and the radios gave back the small pips and parentheses of the sky naturally edited. Somewhere over a patch of blackness that maps called water and he refused, for practical reasons, to call anything else, St. Elmo lit the wingtips with that old sailor’s trick and he let himself feel a wonder so quiet it might as well have been administration.

He thought, briefly and without paying to linger, of the boy at the railing and the quickness of a hand when it’s needed, and then he thought of the next waypoint and the way the fuel numbers lined up like someone else’s hymn. They reached the other side. Approach turned lights into a city. The runway held still as a welcome. Taxiing past a line of jets hunched like sleeping animals, he felt that peculiar post-night solidarity with other people making things arrive. In a hotel room that had been designed by an algorithm to make the maximum number of men forget which city they were in, he stood under a shower that believed in water pressure as a righteous cause and he did not count, and if he whispered thank you it was not to God or the pipes, it was to the small, shabby practices that had made this dull miracle possible.

Leeds opened for Autumn to the kind of audience that likes to be pleased and will meet you halfway, then pretend they did more. He took the late train up with a paper coffee that was only tolerable because it let him hold something warm and pretend his fingers were busy. The theatre was a box with opinions that had been carefully listened to for several generations. He found in himself a capacity to be useful in rooms he had never entered before, a sort of transferable competence that might have felt like arrogance earlier and now felt like good manners. There was a small flood in the ladies’ toilets because a cistern had decided to remember a previous life at sea, and he stood in the corridor with the mop as if auditioning for a new version of himself and did not require applause to keep going. Sol appeared with a packet of mince pies in May because he had left them on a shelf since Christmas and had chosen to see that as a positive. Winter carried chairs with the solemnity of a man who had read a treatise on chairs once and never forgotten it. Hazel sent a text that said, How is the water, and he wrote back, Minded, and she sent an emoji that looked like a sailor who had just been told to have a sit down.

Long-distance did not make them poets; it made them administrators of feeling with an eye for schedules. They discovered that desire could be put in a calendar without becoming a spreadsheet. They sent pictures of small unimportant objects as if smuggling their days through customs: a screw that had pretended not to be itself and had been corrected, a biro that had survived three shows before giving up, a cloud seen from a cockpit that looked like useless white furniture, a Leeds puddle performing a Northern version of itself, a cup of tea wrong from an airport machine and therefore exactly right. When they fought, which they did like people who assume each other’s intelligence and only lose it by mistake, they fought about capacity; how much you could carry and still serve tea, how much you could schedule and still invite wonder. He learned to say, I am at my limit, in a tone that did not accuse the nearest human of being the limit, and she learned to say, I want you here, without making here look like a test. They improved at kissing in stations. They improved at silence on trains.

Anil’s father’s diagnosis congealed into treatment and all the small social fabulisms that attend hospital corridors. Anil’s jokes grew savage and necessary. Rowan took a rota swap he didn’t have time to take and did it because he had decided that friendship is, in the end, a manual task you either perform or you don’t. They sat in a cafeteria with cutlery designed to prevent theft and that therefore could not perform its simple job, and used spoons like knives, and spoke about everything except the thing and then spoke about the thing with an economy that would have won a prize in a different art. On the way out, in rain that attempted to rehearse seriousness and succeeded only in getting people damp, Anil said, “You still doing the water,” as if water were a class you could drop out of, and Rowan said, “I am,” and Anil nodded the nod you give men who have learned to do their own paperwork.

He thought sometimes of quitting the theatre in a gesture of adult consolidation, and then he remembered what leaving feels like in his body and placed the thought in the drawer where stupid bravery lives. The old place missed him in little ways; Sukh texted him a photograph of a ladder leaning against nothing in particular with the caption, Sad, and Eddie wrote, We have a new mop and it is a bastard, which was practically poetry. Tamsin collected a role in a short-run television thing where she would be required to wear a cardigan like a person of principle, and she reacted to this with a howl of ambivalent triumph and a quick inventory of her existing cardigans to see which would be offended. James courted a funding body with the fervour of a minor aristocrat seducing a banker and claimed to hate himself for it even as he sharpened his best adjectives. The meatball, retired to a hook in Southwark, developed dust in a pattern that made it look thoughtful, which is all any object hopes for after a career.

Late that summer a thunderstorm made a situation out of itself on a Friday evening and discovered the theatre halfway through a show. The thunder was the old kind with a sense of theatre and the lightning was a busybody and the rain was a bureaucrat. The roof offered up its confession in the usual corner and the buckets gathered like a choir. Rowan was there because his flight had gone mechanical and then been given to another man and he had wandered towards his other job the way men wander towards a familiar pub. He took charge of the left wing as if the left wing had requested him in writing. He used words like isolate and route and safe when safe meant, for now. He and Autumn moved in that way two people move when they have worked beside each other enough to qualify for a licence. In the dressing room Tamsin did an imitation of the thunder and the thunder did an imitation of agreement. A breaker threw itself for reasons that would be discovered later and the room went dark for three breaths and then came back with a small gasp, and afterwards the audience cheered in that way British people cheer when the world behaves as expected, if only briefly.

It was after that night that he realized the shower had moved from category—threat—to category—plumbing. He stood under it with his eyes closed and the water behaving like an appliance and thought of the ten-year-old who would have loved to see him, and the thirty-year-old who would have thought him insufferable, and the man he was, who was simply tired and grateful. He understood at last that bravery is rarely a show; it is a routing problem, a resource issue, a time management task. He knew he would relapse, because that is what people do, and he found himself rehearsing the difference between relapse and failure as if the distinction were a prop he needed to carry in his pocket.

Rowan went to the coast alone one day because he owed the sea not a confrontation but a visit done without supervision. He picked a station at random and bought a paper bag of chips that tried to leave grease in his palm as a souvenir. The tide was out like a statement. The sea was the colour of old coins and the wind had done its sums. He took his shoes off and put his feet in because that is the way these scenes go in other people’s accounts and found that it hurt at first, then swore in the teeth in a good way, then stopped being a test and became something to narrate badly in his head. Two boys were inventing football with the wrong ball and one of them called the other a donkey in a tone that suggested endearment. A woman walked into the water in a coat in that purposeful way that alarms strangers until her friend shouted her name and she turned and it was only a bet. He considered walking in to his knees and decided not to, because saying no to a cheap arc is sometimes a better story than completing it. He dried his feet on a paper napkin that believed in nothing and put his shoes back on like a man reclaiming a role.

Leeds treated Autumn with the respect it reserves for people who make themselves useful before introducing their talent. She managed the show as if it had been built on a table and a borrowed lamp and didn’t let anyone dream bigger until she could guarantee the plug sockets. When he visited, he found her sitting on the stage alone once, counting the distance between two marks with her eyes, and he learned not to interrupt that kind of thinking; it was prayer and measurement at once. They ate chips on the curb with the solemn pleasure of people who have paid rent. They talked about the next year the way engineers talk about bridges: where the stress goes, what the wind does to godly intentions, the difference between a beautiful line on paper and a span you can drive over in rain. He was shocked by his own happiness because happiness had always been a thing for later in his internal lexicon, a word to be cashing in someday when the world had conceded. Now it arrived in cheap clothes, early, asking for tea, and he let it in.

There was a day when the swimming pool went wrong. The blue line under him, faithful as a simple hymn, blurred because of a dropped plaster or somebody’s idea of fun with a handful of shredded paper, and he choked in the unspectacular way beginner swimmers choke, and someone laughed, not unkindly, and his body tried to put on its old coat. Maris put her whistle in her mouth and did not blow it. She placed her hand on his shoulder in that way she had—mammal to mammal, dry to wet—and said, “Look at the clock and count a backwards minute.” He did it and he felt stupid and saved, and the minute did that absurd thing minutes do; it passed, and it hadn’t when he started. Afterwards he sat on the bench with Autumn’s towel and the towel smelled like washing powder and a room in Leeds and he pressed his face into it and didn’t worry about the drama of the gesture. On the way out he thanked Maris and she nodded, then said, “We are furniture until we are rescued into being passengers,” and he loved her for being the kind of person who could say a sentence like that while wearing a waterproof watch with little plastic fish on it.

His mother discovered WhatsApp voice messages and left him little weather reports from her kitchen, the rain against the window recast as accompaniment. She had learned to speak to his fear the way you learn to speak to a friend’s pet: calmly, with treats hidden in your pockets, not making any sudden movements. She told him when the council had finally admitted the pothole outside number 11 was a swallowing thing and not a character trait. She told him that Hazel had posted her a magazine called The Idler because she thought there might be philosophy for women who prefer lemon drizzle to Rousseau. He sent back pictures of airports behaving and theatres misbehaving and a kettle scaled like a dragon and then made ordinary again.

On a Wednesday that smelled of new pencils because September had leaned in early, Karen called him into the office and slid a paper across the desk with deliberate indifference. Long-haul training would go into the winter if he wanted it. The Atlantic at night, the Atlantic in the afternoon, the strange lack of edges when a human decides to fly with the calendar instead of hours. He thought of the way a cockpit can be a chapel if you let it and a factory when you forget to, and he said yes without raising his voice into the register where bravery pretends to be a soprano. He texted Autumn with a picture of the paper and she replied with a single word—Maintenance—and three minutes later another—Proud—and he sat in the corridor and let the pride in by degrees as if it were weather he had invited and did not want to be taken by surprise.

The South Bank flooded the walkway on a spring tide the way it likes to in September when people have put their sandals away and feel personally affronted. He stood with a bucket he didn’t need because the theatre had been built sensibly for once in its long life and watched tourists negotiate shallows with performance and fury. A man in a suit carried a woman in trainers across six yards of water and the crowd gave him the kind of cheer that indicates we are all still children. A boy lay down on his belly to put his hand in and his father said, in the universal tone, Get up, and the boy didn’t, and the father didn’t insist because he remembered something. Rowan looked along the brown slow body of the Thames and realized that it had stopped being an adversary or a metaphor and had become an old complicated neighbour whose habits you learn because you live here and the bins go out on Wednesdays.

Autumn’s last week before the return from Leeds contained a doctor, a boiler, a quiet panic about rent that was solved by numbers behaving, and a small triumph in the form of a review that used the word “assured,” which is what you want a stranger to call you when you’ve barely slept. She sent him a photograph of herself with a box of screws as if she had finally become her own emblem. He sent her back a picture from 37,000 feet of a line where day was arguing with night, fuzzy as logic, and wrote, Proof of concept, and she wrote back, Put it in the drawer, with a heart that looked tired in the way hearts look when they have been busy and content.

When she came back to London, the city arranged their reunion without being obvious about it. Trains arrived when trains had promised to. The rain waited until the walk was over and then did its work on plants that had looked sulky all week. They kissed as if they had found the place where their mouths fit in a cupboard full of similar things. She put her bag down in the place bags go when they have made their point. They cooked with the ease of people who have failed at cooking together and survived the failure. She told him Hazel had sent her home with a bar of soap so honest it made your hands feel like they had been told off, and he told her his mother had taken to quoting Maris and this should worry them all. They showered as if being clean were a social project and not an event. They slept. The morning was a morning. The kettle did its noise. It was not a story, or it was the best kind, which is to say it made sense from the inside and did not require narrating to strangers for proof of its existence.

He took her to the pool on a night when the world had decided to be generous with time and lanes. Maris raised an eyebrow at Autumn as if welcoming an auditor and then ignored her completely, which was the greatest gift. He swam the length of a human problem and back, slowly, unhandsome, without the panic cat stirring, and when he stood up and wiped the water out of his eyebrows and spat out that entirely municipal taste, he laughed the way people laugh when they have persuaded a piece of their childhood to stop sulking. He lay back and floated and let the ceiling be the sky and the tiles be the ground for long enough that boredom came and claimed him and he took it as a blessing. Later, in the changing room that remembers every conversation it has ever held, he dried his feet with the care of a man packing a tent in the rain, and he thought: this is mine now, in the ordinary way, and I do not have to promise anything to keep it.

Autumn had a leaving dinner for Leeds friends that looked a lot like a staying dinner because theatres do not believe in permanence. Winter sang that shanty wrong but with vigour and Sol played the accordion with the sincere violence the instrument demands. Hazel sent a bottle of something that tasted like patience. James came up and attempted to be kind about Leeds and ended up being rude about London, which was as close as he could get to praise. Tamsin made a speech about exits and decided not to use the word egress because she understood it would crack Rowan open for no good reason. They walked home through streets that had chosen their own lighting and he told Autumn that he could now be trusted to put his face in the sea for a full three seconds, and she said, “Four by Christmas,” without making it a contract.

He flew nights that stretched his bones and made the day look like a trick. He sat in the cockpit with another human who did not need his life explained to him and did not offer up his in return, and he loved the professionalism of that mutual courtesy. He watched lightning debate with cloud on the far horizon and made the small corrections that keep everybody alive. He slept in day rooms and learned the smell of a hundred hotel carpets in a new key. He began to be the man other men asked questions of about procedures not because he was special but because he had practised being boring with elegance. He took the Atlantic like a commute and refused the romance until it came to him without asking for makeup, just a face in the galley mirror at three in the morning, and a feeling like solidarity with the dark.

It is difficult, in any story, to admit that the days after this were good. Not perfect; there were broken things and receipts and long lines for buses and a tooth that decided to make a sub-plot of itself briefly. But good in the way you can build a bridge with. He coiled rope. He learned to exhale underwater. He flew. He made buckets appear when needed. He kissed his girlfriend and did not apologize for being obvious about it. He sent his mother pictures of plants that had survived. He accepted Karen’s eyebrow as a form of affection. He inventory-ed screws that would never be needed and then were, and he felt the pleasure of being right at a scale that wouldn’t embarrass him later.

On a Sunday at the end of the month, the river did its river thing and ran, and a boy on a scooter narrowly avoided becoming a man in thirty years who wrote to the council about railings, and no one made a legend of it. Rowan stood on the bridge and put his hand over the edge into the space the air keeps for gravity, and he did not need to put his hand into the water to prove anything. He thought of a sentence that had followed him for months—Men go wrong when they let emptiness choose its own furniture—and he looked at his life and saw that he had filled it with ladders, and screws, and flights, and lists, and a towel on a bench, and a woman holding a pencil in her hair like a small flag. He walked home because that was what the day required. He placed a wrench back in its drawer. He switched off the kettle because he had remembered it was on. The floor was dry, and if, later, it wasn’t, there were buckets, and there was him.
