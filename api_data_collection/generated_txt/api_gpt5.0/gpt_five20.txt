They called the town a chair factory even after the factories were gone. High Wycombe with its slopes and gullies and houses clinging on like barnacles. Crispin Cole stood on the footbridge above the railway and watched the trains untie the afternoon, one silver knot at a time. If the wind came up the valley just so, he could smell the sweet iron of the tracks, the moss on the brick, the faint onion of a chip shop opening its door three roads away. These were the narrow bands of his world. He could strike them with a thumb and get music.

He had been left at the small Catholic charity home above the hospital when he was two years and three months old, the woman had said. His mother’s hands were not even in the memory, just salt from a tear at the edge of a mouth in a photograph. No father to be found in the carbon copies. The nuns not strict, not really, and then they were gone too, replaced by volunteers with badges and files. At seventeen he had one more winter to manage before they would not have to manage him at all. He learned to see his own days like a line along the river in the Rye. They went where they went.

Those hours he could keep were the ones in the garden, or next to instruments. There was a guitar on a rack at the back of the second-hand shop off Desborough Road that blinked when the sun found it. He would stand and look until the owner, with his lattice of white hair and jaundiced hands, said, “You’ll wear a hole in it with your eyes, boy,” and then sell it to somebody else for fifteen pounds. A month later a different one would be there and Crispin would hope again in a small way, the safe way. That was the ordinary rhythm of it. Tick tick tick. He would take his fingers and tap them across his thigh—four, five, six—and then make a different pattern, nearer to the blood. It settled him when the stories hooked into him and wouldn’t let go.

Toby Gorse tended the garden behind Mrs. Greaves’s row of flats. If the estate itself was a mouth blown open by the 70s, Toby’s garden was a tongue folded in a better shape. There were railway sleepers cut into steps and a slope of herbs that remembered rain for days. Toby wore boots that had been mended so many times the leather was a palimpsest. His hair, what remained of it, sat at the back of his head like the last goose of autumn. He had a way of bending at the waist and peering that made him look like he was about to speak to whatever he had unearthed. Sometimes he did. “You’ll be all right,” Crispin heard him say once to a worm that had got more sun than was good for it. The worm did not answer but it turned in the damp and went back home.

Crispin helped when Toby let him. The gardener would kick at the soil to loosen it and Crispin would lift the clag in his hands. The smell of it—my god, the smell of it—like a book in a cellar, like bread wet at the edges. He would smear the lines into the planters and wipe his fingers on his jeans because he didn’t own a cloth and who owned a cloth when you were seventeen and orbiting around the idea that your real life was still in a different room.

“You make a band of it,” Toby had said once after Crispin had stacked the bamboo canes in an array and tied them with blue string. “Look. Percussion section, standing up straight. If you had a drum you’d get the pigeons in the ash to nod their heads.”

“A band,” Crispin said, tasting the word like chewing on a mint he had found. “You know anyone starting one?”

“Me?” Toby smiled with the side of his mouth that still remembered smiling freely. “Only bands I know are of things that hold other things together. But the town’s always got somebody making a racket.”

He found them three Wednesdays later because Leah Torvill told him. Leah was a brown-eyed girl who ran the archive desk at the library on Queen Victoria Road and once, for an afternoon, had tried to teach Crispin calligraphy. She was older by two years and had already broken up with a man who sold cars, as if you could break up with a surface. Her jumpers looked like blankets. There was a way that she would mirror your words back to you with a slight change so that they fit better. “A band,” she said. “At the back of the Scout hut on the Rye, nine on Saturday. They’re called the Chalk Moths. Pretentiously. But they need a second guitar and they’re under twenty and not in prison. That’s the bar.”

“Chalk Moths,” Crispin repeated. He visualised it. White wings powdered thin by touch. Lanterns. Drawn.

“It’s in the noticeboard by the bus stop. You go if you want to go.”

He nodded and then shook his head, because there was too much traffic around his decision. “I don’t have a guitar though.”

“You have fingers,” Leah said. “Borrow the rest.”

It was laughable, and yet. He walked to the Scout hut on Saturday after washing his one good shirt. A contrail of cloud was reading the ridge line aloud as the light went down. He had eaten half a bag of crisps on the way and licked the oil off each finger without meaning to. When he opened the side door the smell of varnish and boyhood and dust caught at his throat. On the stage that was no stage a group were tuning. Two lads with hair like lightbulbs that had blown late and a drummer who looked like a horse at the end of a field—inner, and hard to see. There was a girl too, short, sharp, with a haircut like a square, taut jaw. “You the second?” she said, without looking up from adjusting a strap.

“I’m Crispin,” he said. He offered a hand and then dropped it, and then put it in his pocket and took it out again. His body an unhelpful chorus.

“Zoe,” she said. “That’s Karl on bass, Lance on drums. Tom. The other guitar.” Each of the boys gave a nod with their hands involved in their own devices. “We play indie that thinks it’s more important than it is. You can borrow Karl’s brother’s Hohner. Don’t break it. And don’t get idea-y.”

“Where do you want me?”

Zoe lifted her head then, looked at him properly. She had a top lip that curled like a cat’s when it was thinking about whether to trust you. “Behind me. In the staves. Pretend you are a scaffold. If you get clever out front I’ll cut your fingers off with that yellow bread knife.”

He smiled and something inside him unrolled. “All right.”

They began in a way that was not beginning. Karl plugged him into an amp that hissed as if it contained a cross animal. Lance counted one two three but no four. People who knew each other well can count in halves like that. Tom moved his fingers and the guitar cried out and then it was something like a boat bumping a pier and then it was something like walking into a room and everyone looking and then it was something else entirely, under the floorboards, in the bones. Crispin, scaffold, named the beams as he went. He found the note he could hang off and then the note after that. He tapped his right foot, then his left, then the space between the left and the right. He felt the flourish of it at the back of his neck like small legs.

“Not bad,” Zoe said after three songs had fallen over and stood up again. “You can stay.” She lifted a can of Fanta and drank half of it and checked her phone with the same hand, like her attention had been practice for this her whole life. “We’re in at the Phoenix open mic Friday. Bring your own self. And don’t wear that shirt.”

The bus back up to the flats was full of laughing that wasn’t aimed at him but found him anyway. Crispin took a window seat and watched the big Tesco swing into view and then the Gabardine Estate and then Mrs. Greaves’s block with the one dead window like a missing tooth. He held his hands out in the bus light and waggled his fingers and wanted to save the feeling of being necessary in a jar like a small animal caught under a beaker in the science lab. He could feed it a bit of lettuce and keep it alive. He could.

Mrs. Greaves had three rules written in a notebook by the kettle: no noise after ten, no strangers in the flat, and talk to me. She was a strong woman of practicalities whom time had made more careful. She could look at a child and divine which cupboard it would try to climb into. “Where’d you go?” she said, not unkindly, when he came through, the hall light blown and the living room a soft news glow.

“Practice,” he said, and waited for her to say something he could push against.

“Practice for.”

“A band.”

Her head turned a degree, a crane checking the wind. “A band like the Scouts?” she said. He had not told her to expect, and she often chose not to. “No. All right. Eat the rest of that stew or it will go to waste.”

He did not tell her how the air had opened for a minute in the hut. How a space had been exactly the shape of him. He spooned beef and carrots and potato and found the bone of a bay leaf. It tasted like all the Sundays he hadn’t had. He slept on the sofa with the muted TV holding the room together like a string.

By Monday his own body had remembered that there were people at the sixth form who would repel him by principle. Crispin did not fit into the football group, the vaping group, the loudly laughing and the softly laughing group, the revision group, the tutors’ favourite group, the glum arsonists who never did anything but had the eyes for it. He fit into Leah’s group and his own. He had his own. But the news had a way of touching all surfaces. Tom from the band, it turned out, was Tom Lehey from Maths, two years ahead but still lurking for retakes. He had a mother who owned a property in Beaconsfield and a father who paid for guitar lessons with a man called Bruno. Tom saw Crispin in the corridor and looked away like he didn’t recognise him and then looked back like he did. “Don’t be late Friday,” Tom said, which was the only invitation Crispin needed not to be.

He wasn’t. He arrived at the Phoenix with twelve minutes to spare and, immediately confident he had not understood the address, checked it twice. It was a pub with a mind of its own, the kind that had three chalkboards and seven sets of rules about stools. He walked in and got asked for ID and the barman, slow-drunk and affectionate like a cat that claws your knee, gave him a glass of lemonade with a single slice of lemon so thin it was philosophical. In the back room there was a mic stand that had been wrongly assembled and a light that made a square on the floor like a magic someone else was supposed to perform. The chairs were bent in words. Someone was speaking about poetry in the corner, not to someone else, but near someone else. It made the someone else look like an umbrella.

Zoe arrived late and irritated, which might have had nothing to do with time and everything to do with the erratic path of her heart. Karl and Lance had their gear in two trips. Tom had a guitar in a case that had stickers from cities he had never been to. They played third in a line-up of six. The first act was a man in his forties with a harmonica who had a job in IT because he said the word server three times and had a trouser crease. The second was a duo who had written a song about saving the planet that sounded like a song about tortoises. And then Zoe put her hands on the mic and it stuck to her rings because someone had spilled something on it ten years ago. “We’re the Chalk Moths,” she said, not giving a toss what it meant. “This is Bias Ply.”

Crispin could tell by the way the room changed shape that they got away with something. Tom made the notes cascade like wet nails. Karl found a cunning hum that filled all the hollows. Lance was a farmer threshing. Zoe’s voice put a thin blade into things and cut them in straight lines. Crispin listened for the part of the song that wanted him and then stepped into it with a foot careful and then not careful. He threaded single notes through the edge of a chorus and did not trip. He kept out of the way just enough. He got out of the room inside the song and into the one where the audience is, which was a human miracle, small, but a miracle. One man at a back table looked up from his phone and stayed up. Leah appeared at the doorway like a bookmark you lose and then somehow find again exactly on the right page. She lifted her chin in a way that said yes, this, good. He could breathe to that rhythm.

After, while the Open Mic Compère with the theatrical scarf was thanking them and also asking them would they kindly wrap up their cables quickly so the five-piece country skiffle collective from Princes Risborough could get set up, Tom touched Crispin’s shoulder with the proprietary grace of someone who had decided he liked him because it was like liking the second lane of a road he used. “You’re all right,” Tom said. “I thought you’d try to solo.”

“I’m the scaffold,” Crispin said.

Tom made a face that was part grin, part dismissal. “Whatever. You’re sonic filler. Not meant disrespectfully. It’s what you do.”

Zoe, hearing this, made a clicking noise with her teeth without having to think about the angle. “He’s the second structure, and you can shut up,” she said. “You all right? I need a cigarette. I don’t smoke. I just want the excuse to go outside.”

Crispin went with her into the garden where the smokers prepared to live three minutes longer by lighting up. It was drizzling like someone at the upstairs window was shaking a spray bottle on the room below. Zoe flicked open a lighter and then didn’t light anything with it. She snapped it shut. Her fingers were restless like a cat’s tail. “You’re better than you look,” she said. “That’s a compliment. You look like a church mouse. But you play like you’ve been listening to the fridge for years and hearing everything it says.”

“I have been,” he said. He could feel the condensation on his scalp cooling him even in this conversation. “It’s always there. I like how it says low E.”

“You’re weird,” she said, approvingly. “You’ll do.”

Mrs. Greaves was less approving when he returned late with a smell of beer he hadn’t drunk and smoke he hadn’t smoked. “So this is it,” she said, accounting. “This is now. If you’re going to be in past eleven you let me know.”

“It was an open mic,” he said. “I didn’t realise the order.”

She stared at him over the edge of her mug. The way she watched him, sometimes, like she was trying to work out which species. “All right. Everything in one piece? You eat anything?”

“Yeah. I had a packet of nuts.”

“Not food,” she said. “Food food. Not feed.”

He thought of the stew, of bones, of a leaf in his teeth. He could not explain to her that the scraping he felt at the inside of his ribs was both hunger and not hunger, as if he had only now woken and wanted the damp corners of the room. “I’ll make toast,” he offered, and that was a peace, enough.

Not everybody was supportive. The support a small town gives is a coat it finds in a cupboard; if it fits you, well, good for you, if it doesn’t, don’t go out in the rain. Mr. Hargreaves at the sixth form said, “Music, Crispin? Really? Your attendance is not sufficient for your attendance to be your attendance,” which was a sentence that meant nothing and everything. Mrs. Greaves’s sister Della who lived in Langley and had a voice like a whelk’s shell said, “He’ll be on the dole in a month.” Tom’s guitarist friend Bruno, when he came to one practice to give feedback, said, “You’re a bit… grey.” Crispin nodded. He could be a colour when he was needed. He did not need to be a flag all the time.

There were other small meannesses, the cheap kind. A boy who once stole crisps with him made a buzz noise as he walked past him in the corridor and the two boys with him did as well because people like to be in a choir. The bus driver’s look when he paid in shrapnel was a geography lesson about a place he was not welcome to visit. The webbing of a friendship he thought had held snapped when Luka invited him round on Saturday and then texted him at the door, nah mate, my mum says too many people. Crispin wrote to Leah, It’s all right, and Leah wrote back, No, it’s not, and that was better, because she was the kind of friend who would hold the bad thing to the light and look at it, rather than tell you it was a beetle you could simply put out of a window. Put it out. Watch it lift its middle.

Toby Gorse watched him too, in the way a man who understands the season watches the weather. “You look taller,” Toby said one afternoon, sounding surprised.

“I wore my boots,” Crispin said, and then realised he had not worn boots, he had worn the same trainers he always wore because they were the only shoes.

“Ah,” Toby said. He was teasing, and it felt good. “You’re going to have to choose if you prefer the leaf mould or the limelight.”

“I can have both,” Crispin said. He felt reckless. “I can be a star and still pick slugs off the dahlias.”

“You’d be kind to them slugs,” Toby said. He set a watering can down like it had secrets in it. “You’re good, you know. I heard you. The sound did move. It made the pigeons drop some of their thoughts.”

“You were there?” Crispin hadn’t seen him.

Toby twitched his head. “I live in all the rooms of this town at once,” he said, half-joke. “You need glue though. Somebody keeps the bits together. Somebody who knows about holding things.”

He hadn’t told Toby the half of it, but he told him enough to make a shape. The band wanted to record a demo. Zoe had a cousin with a studio in Slough, or at least a basement with a laptop, which was almost the same if the song was good. But to get there needed train fare and the loan of an amp and a guitarist who would show up on a weekday you couldn’t get out of. There were small fees that become thick. He could feel the weight of it in his pocket in coins that weren’t there. He had no father to ring, no mother to ask, no one to guilt into being the adult. Leah would do what she could but she had her rent, her own hungry.

“You need money in the way we all do,” Toby said. “But also. You need to not trip over getting it.”

“I’ll work,” Crispin said, and then remembered that he already worked. It wasn't formal, so maybe it didn’t count. He moved things in Mrs. Greaves’s flat that were too heavy for her to pretend she’d always put them there. He carried groceries for people who didn’t have the knees for the stairs. He looked after the clothes teenagers left on the lawn after a shared bottle, folding them on the wall so they could find their way home. “I’ll do more.”

“You will,” Toby said, and left it to sit. He had a way of letting a subject fall asleep next to him and then wake up at the right time. He worked in a big, slow circle.

There was a Thursday when the sky did not unpeel all day. Crispin walked up the long hill to the estate and the soles of his shoes went wet at the first left turn and never got dry again. When he reached the row of bins a fox was investigating a pizza box with the careful diligence of a doctor. He and the fox acknowledged each other with a glance that was not unfriendly. Inside, Mrs. Greaves was with a woman who had a folder. The two of them sat like bookends that didn’t match. “Crispin,” Mrs. Greaves said, “this is Sharron.”

“Hi,” Sharron said, in the phone voice people use for bad news. “Just a quick chat, darling.”

Crispin stood because sitting would be an admission. “About?”

“About next year,” Sharron said. “About options. Your educational attainment is—well. You are artistic?” She looked at the file as if the file had more truth in it than his face. “Music. Mrs. Greaves says you’re in a band.”

“Yeah,” he said. The yes contrived to be indefensible in his mouth. He tasted it.

Sharron smiled with her gums. “Had you thought about apprenticeships? Carpentry? Plastering? The trades are very respectable. My brother-in-law is in plaster and he has a holiday in Benidorm every other. And you had good marks in sculpture at Key Stage Four. You have… patience? With repeats?”

“I like repeats,” Crispin said. Playing the same thing over and over until it becomes the thing and then something else. Like tapping, like threading. His fingers moved without orders.

“Music is a nice hobby,” Sharron said, carefully. “But the path is challenging. The industry unforgiving. Income irregular. Do you see what I’m saying?”

He nodded because he could see the landscape, even if he didn’t want to live in it. It was not a suggestion, it was the weather. It would rain, and then it would rain again.

After Sharron left, Mrs. Greaves put the kettle on, which was her way of letting you know she did not agree with all of it, but she wasn’t sure about any of it. “You could be in a band and plaster,” she said. “Do both. It’s not illegal.”

“Zoe would cut my hands off with a bread knife,” he said.

Mrs. Greaves shrugged. “I’d rather have your hands plastering. But I’m not the queen.”

He went out into the slipping day. He couldn’t keep still. He went to the railway bridge and watched two trains do the trick again, the untie. He went to the garden behind the flats and found Toby under the elder bush looking at something in the soil with a concentration so complete it made a weather of its own. “What is it?” Crispin said, as respectfully as he could, as if interrupting prayer.

“Stag beetle,” Toby said, with a reverence that made Crispin smile without meaning to. “Lucanus cervus. Big old bugger, and they’re rare. Look at him. Those jaws are all theatre. It’s the larvae do the work. Years and years under, in the wood. Then up for a season. Then done. Don’t step. Come. Here.”

Crispin knelt on his jeans and leaned. The beetle, black-brown like old coffee, was busy being exactly what it was. Not performing. Just. He felt a lift in his ribs, unexpected and then not. It was something like recognition, and he did not explore it too deeply because he did not want to startle it away.

“He’ll be gone next rain,” Toby said. “They don’t have time. But it’s important, that he came. I needed to see one again.”

“You talk like they send you messages,” Crispin said, lightly, to make the heaviness manageable.

“They do,” Toby said, and did not smile. “Haven’t you heard them.”

Crispin thought he was joking and then he thought he wasn’t and then he thought he was, and all three made a useful sound in his head. “I hear a lot of things.”

The left-hand window in the block opposite lit like a slow mouth and then went dark again.

Zoe messaged him that night: Studio Saturday, 10am, Slough, bring what you have. He wrote back, yes, but his body said, how. Train. Ticket. You can jump the barrier at Slough, someone told him in year nine, his first summer out of the charity home. He had tried once and felt the eyes on him like a net and had turned back. He did not have a heart for it. He needed a small money that wouldn’t be missed and there wasn’t any small money that wasn’t enormous.

He lay awake and listened to the flat. The thin walls gave him other people’s midnight, the cough down the corridor and the sudden laughter from the flat above that had no jokes in it. He heard the radiators do the metallic sigh of waking. He felt an itch inside his chest and only the tap of his fingernails could ease it. He tapped. It made no sound in the world but in himself it was loud as weather. He thought of Leah’s description, that he played like listening to a fridge, and he smiled in the dark, and then did not. He could hear the fridge’s low hum and the marble of something rolling in a drawer and the thin thread of something else, very fine, like whispers under the floor.

Morning put a skin on things but did not change them. He ate toast and did the wrong thing of scraping the burnt bits into the sink without rinsing them down. He got yelled at from the bathroom for it and apologised through the door.

At nine a.m. he was on the steps outside the block with his bag and his breath turning to milk in the cold. Toby came onto the path with his boots doing the whole world of work. “You off somewhere,” Toby said, and it wasn’t a question, it was a naming.

“Slough,” Crispin said. “A basement. A laptop. White with a blue sticker. Used to be an xbox sticker and then someone peeled most of it off. I don’t know the full address. The cousin’s called Kieran and he sometimes goes by K.”

Toby scratched his ear like a dog in thought. “Cost you.”

“Yeah.”

Toby looked at something over Crispin’s shoulder; a thing that wasn’t there but was there. “I could loan you,” he said, slowly. “But I’m in a personal position. I’m—look, this is not a conversation I am good at having. I am not an at-the-table man.” He took a breath. “I have hired a life coach.”

Crispin’s brain did a small hop, like a grasshopper coming out of grass and seeing the road suddenly like the book of what roads are. “What?”

“A life coach. She helps people do the things they say they will do.” Toby’s face did not know how to explain itself. He stepped back and then forward as if his legs had different opinions. “I am… tired of the last ten summers being one summer. I want to move the boulder. I saw a card in the window of a shop that sells two large china dogs and a small china failure, and I rang the number, and I thought, either this will be a scam and I will learn something about scams, or it won’t be, and I will learn something else. Her name is Pam Harkness. She is younger than me but older than the age she says.”

Crispin nodded because he could not do anything else. “And this helps me.”

Toby huffed something like a laugh, or the first letter of one. “She is… practical. She made me write down what I would pay for a feeling of relief. She made me write down the names of all the things that hold me up and realise that none of them were made of metal. She told me that if I worry about ten things and nine don’t happen I have paid for them anyway—the nine, I mean—and the one I pay for twice. It is not fair accounting.” He rubbed his thumb over his forefinger, thinking about nothing and everything. “She also asked me who I would back with thirty pounds if it would make the game more interesting. So. If I have thirty, I should back you.”

Crispin opened his mouth to do the noble thing and say no. He closed it because nobility is a winter coat when spring has arrived and nobody needs to get sweaty to be good. “I’d pay you back,” he said.

“You will pay forward,” Toby said. “That is always the arrangement. Keep it moving. It’s living money. If you hoard it it suffocates.”

Toby reached into the pocket of his jacket and pulled out notes folded down to small mountains. It made Crispin’s blood rush to his face. There is always something humiliating and also freeing about being helped, and we do not always get to choose which feeling lands first. “Thank you,” he said, and everything in the thank you was not theatrical at all.

“You go and make noise. And if Pam asks what I did, I will tell her I did a brave thing this morning and she will drink her coffee and not be impressed because she will say it was only a medium brave thing and I am saving my very brave thing for later.”

“What is the very brave thing,” Crispin asked, undone by gratitude into being nosy.

“Don’t joke,” Toby said, not unkindly. “It is telling a woman I am sorry for taking fifteen years to be a better man. We have a child that is not really a child now. He is as tall as the wall. It is complicated. My apologies are clumsy like cows.” He shook his head. “Off with you.”

Slough’s drab became holy because it was the place where he was going to try. The train did its excellent work of moving strangers in the same direction for a bit and everyone pretended not to feel the current that ran through the carriage in a way that was exactly like electricity. Zoe texted him a location and then a different location and then the first one again. He got out and followed his own feet and found the right basement by hearing it. A thin thread of looped drum and the smell of too much determination. Kieran, younger and pierced and nervously kind, welcomed them like they were already famous in a different country. The laptop was indeed white with the blue sticker half peeled off. He had tea in a mug with a picture of a frog in a top hat that said Toadally Awesome. The carpet had given up. The song arrived in pieces and then fitted itself when no one was looking. Crispin did his scaffold and when the chorus came around he let himself climb out a rung and then climb back in, and Zoe did not take the bread knife out once.

Standing in the small room with his headphones crooked, he felt again the sensation he could not name without embarrassing himself. It was something like being in a hive and understanding for the first time how the different sounds belonged together. He wanted to laugh, and also to weep because the wall he was building inside himself had a window and he had not planned for a window.

They recorded three songs in eight hours. Tom sent a clip to a friend who ran a blog. Zoe posted a clip to a little river of followers who responded with the predictable objects of the internet—a heart, a fire, a skull, a crying face. Crisps and trains and carpet. The smell of damp. His ribs were somehow new air.

When he got back to the flats the garden had changed. It was not that anything had been moved. It was something else. The elder looked like it had been told a story. Toby was not there, but the watering can was tipped as if someone had asked it a question and it hadn’t wanted to answer. On the top of the back wall—just above where the stag beetle had been—was a square card with a tack through its top left corner. Life Coaching with Pam Harkness. Make the next step the step that makes the next step. Beside the font, a drawing of a ladder that was also, if you looked, a set of ribs.

He took the card down and turned it over and saw a phone number and a quote written in blue biros in a hand that took corners seriously. “Put the weight where you can hold it.” In smaller letters beneath: “This is about the economy of being alive.”

He slipped the card into his pocket. He didn’t know yet what it meant for him. He knew that when he climbed the stairs his feet found a beat. Four. Two. One and then two and then three. He could feel in his calves and in the edges of his knees the itch of motion. He slept that night with the window open so that the smell of wet wood could come and he would know where he was in the life he was making with a group of strangers and a woman who told him what to wear and an older man who had given him money that was really a story.

He did not know what was under the floorboards. Nobody does. He did not know that later he would think back to this and try to make the shape of the day with his hands. That he would remember the way he had leaned toward the stag beetle and felt the world lean back. That this was the start of the scale on his skin coming up for air.

Two weeks became three and then four. The demo went around like a small bright rumour. They got a message from a promoter who was also a plumber and collected talented plumbers like other people collected first editions. “Turn up. Don’t be dickheads,” he wrote. The message arrived at midnight and made Zoe laugh so hard she spilled water on her bed and then had to change the sheets and made text noises to the group about it. Leah and Crispin went for a walk up to the Hughenden and stood at the iron rails, looking down at the town making its little noises. “It looks like a box of things,” Leah said.

“What?”

“People,” she said. “A box of people. Like when small toys are put in a box to keep them safe but they knock around and some of them get chipped. There isn’t quite enough tissue paper.”

Crispin wanted to tell her about the feeling in his chest, the tapping, the way his fingers sometimes couldn’t stay at rest. He wanted to tell her that when he walked by old wood he felt a pull like a small tide. That he put his hand on the banister in the library and it felt like his own hand, just older. He didn’t. He said, “We played a C sharp minor in the bridge and it made my teeth feel weird,” and she smiled and said, “Good. That’s good.”

At the allotments he saw a man crouched in his plot like someone saying sorry to an absent god. They passed a dead bird that was not yet properly a dead bird, and it made Crispin’s stomach rise. He had the strange sense of recognition again, and sadness, a useless love, his body wanting to take the thing and put it somewhere leaves would make it proper. He did not tell Leah that either. She would not be afraid of it. He was not afraid of it. He was afraid of making it smaller by finding a sentence too quickly.

Toby met Pam in the café behind the theatre that made milk too frothy for men of his generation. He told Crispin about it after, ashamed and proud. “She made me breathe,” he said, which was not what Crispin thought life coaches did. “She told me to go for a walk around where I live and name out loud the things that are mine. I said, none of this is mine. She said, then you will be walking in a dead place. So I said, my boots. This cup. That I have been sorry for something for a long time. That I can taste green better than anybody I know. That I listen to beetles, that I watch birds. She said, there. Now you are not a ghost.”

Crispin looked at him and did not know what to say, which was good, because there are so few things that should be answered by words. “Did she tell you to hire me,” he said in an attempt to be light.

“She told me to bring you a shovel,” Toby said. “Metaphorically.”

Crispin laughed then, and it was relief. “Metaphorically is cheaper.”

“It isn’t,” Toby said. “It always costs more. But it pays more too.”

At practice on Thursday Zoe was lightning, crackling even before the storm. “We got a small slot at the festival,” she announced. “Two songs, one o’clock, Saturday. The river stage.”

Karl put his bass against the wall and let his head fall back and laughed until his mouth made a square. Lance did a small horse kick with one foot, his version of happiness. Tom asked, “Do I have to do the load in,” which was Tom’s version of sweetness. Crispin felt the air go thin and thick at once. The river stage. The place where the town drank and watched their children pick up pieces of straw from the ground. He thought about the plank pathways over the reeds and the way, if you knelt, you could see small things moving under the water that were not fish. He thought about the audience that would be his and not his. He thought about Mrs. Greaves. He thought about the card in his pocket and the word ladder.

He did not yet see how the world was layered. That was coming. For now he was a boy from a chair town who had found the edge of a song and gripped it. He would hang there for as long as was good. He could feel, under his feet, a thrumming. The town’s heat. Tiny lives that knew more about weight and gear and hunger than he did. He imagined a hand reaching down and touching the top of his head with a fingertip. He imagined a mandible, but did not know that he had imagined it. He imagined nothing at all, which was in its way also an imagination. He went home, and put his palm on the banister, and felt the wood answer. He slept. He dreamt without pictures and woke with damp in his mouth.

Friday at the Phoenix again and Zoe had taken up a particular angle against the mic that made it hers and not the mic’s. They were better. That was the truth. They were cleaner. They had the bones of a thing. They could walk without looking. Leah stood in the doorway again and this time brought her friend who spun her keys in a way that made a rhythm in its own right. In the back of the room Toby sat with a woman in a green coat who had a mouth as sharp and kind as stepping on a tack and not bleeding because the tack thought better of itself at the last minute. When she clapped, she clapped like she meant to join the song, not end it.

After, in the cold air behind the pub, Zoe blew into her hands and held them out for the warmth to come back like a beggar. “Tomorrow,” she said. “Be early. Wear something that doesn’t shout the wrong thing at people. Don’t look like the Scout hut.”

“What does the Scout hut look like,” Lance said, genuinely curious.

Zoe shut her eyes. “Like it smells of oranges and boys. You know.”

Crispin went to the garden after midnight and stood under the elder because his body wanted him to. The square card was gone from the wall. Somewhere, deep, there was a small, fine movement like the sound of a fingernail against tin. He put his hand on the soil and the soil was colder than he thought. Behind him, upstairs, the window of the flat with the dead tooth lit for a moment and then stopped. He thought of Pam Harkness telling Toby to breathe. He breathed. He thought of what he would be asked to hold tomorrow. He put the weight where he could hold it. He went upstairs, shoes in his hand. He lay down. He did not count. He let the hum take him. He did not know it yet, but there were people in this town whose bodies were rehearsing for a change, making their legs ready, its little hinges oiled in the night. He did not know that he himself had more in common with the stag beetle than with Tom Lehey’s Beaconsfield mother. He did not know. He slept, and he would know, later, in a way that would make him bend at the waist and peer at the world and say, you’ll be all right, to a worm. He would mean it. He almost meant it now.Morning came with the kind of light that forgives and the kind that doesn’t. Crispin woke in its middle, his cheek creased by the sofa seam, his neck warm from the throw he had dragged down in the night. The flat’s sounds were a small orchestra again—tap, scrape, kettle-shiver, the soft cough of a neighbor through plaster—and he lay still long enough to name each instrument before he trusted his body on its feet. His shirt from last night, hung over the back of a chair, bore the ghost of the pub’s smoke and the secondhand smell of a beer-sour laugh he hadn’t laughed. He folded it the way Leah had once shown him with library quiet and put on the other shirt, the one Zoe wouldn’t hate yet, and checked the time three times as if the digits might lie out of sheer mischief. On the kitchen counter a plate had been set with two slices of bread laid ready for the grill, a wedge of butter nearby as if someone had made a shrine to simple food. “Eat,” Mrs. Greaves said from the doorway. “You can’t play on nothing.” Her voice was brisk but it kept glancing at him the way a good guard dog glances at a gate—ready to push it shut but also ready to let through what ought to come in.

He took the butter to the bread with concentration, cutting it into the corners so it could do its proper work later, and he watched it melt like a slow decision. Mrs. Greaves sat down stoutly and folded the paper she didn’t read. “What do you need,” she asked, and there was a bone in the question that was new. He thought of strings, of plectrums, of a soft cloth to wipe sweat from borrowed wood. He thought of money and then decided not to make all conversations about money even if most conversations were. “A bag for my bits,” he said instead, and she looked at him and then at her own cupboard and got up and pulled down a tote from a fundraiser in 2004 with a picture of a chair stamped in blue. “This,” she said. “And this,” she added, taking a small square of old tea towel from a drawer and passing it to him like a medal. “So you don’t wipe your hands on your trousers and make yourself look like you fell out of a hedge.”

He took the cloth and did not joke about hedges because he felt the seriousness of it. It was not just a cloth. It was a sentence about his life being more than its improvisations. “Thanks,” he said, and he could feel in his mouth the older habit of refusing, of making a performance of having less, and he put it away. “I’ll be back before tea,” he added, as if currencies could be made of promises and some could. Mrs. Greaves narrowed her eyes a little at the time as if it might try to wriggle, but she nodded, and she lifted her mug to him in a salute that didn’t admit that it was one. “Don’t be stupid,” she said, which was the town’s most complicated blessing.

The festival day had its own pulse and the town had put on its summer face like a dress it had worn enough times to not fuss with it. Bunting didn’t quite make it down every street but where it did it made the lines of terraced houses look briefly pleased with themselves. The Rye was already busy when he got there, men carrying collapsible tables with the careful arms of people who had broken things. He could smell sugar burning into webs in a steel drum and the vinegar from a stall that had not yet sold a single hot chip but was ready to forgive all comers. Strollers like small cars argued for their lanes and dogs introduced each other with the ancient formalities dogs use even when their owners don’t. The river itself didn’t notice any of it; it kept its green ideas and pushed them along beneath the surface with no need of an audience. He walked over the boardwalk and felt how the planks reported every step of a hundred strangers, all the footnotes of a day pressed into wood that had been asked to be a road and had obliged. The water’s smell was the inside of a cupboard left closed too long and then opened properly, and it made something older in him come awake without permission.

Zoe was already at the river stage, not waiting for the sound man because waiting was not a verb she allowed to be near her, and she had arranged the cables in ways that made the sound man, when he arrived, say, “Right, thanks,” in a tone like a man reading his own obituary and finding it mostly right. Lance stowed drum pieces with a gravity that made toddlers stop and stare as if he were building a wall in an invisible house. Tom tuned with his back slightly turned as if he were apologising and also not. Karl tapped the head of his bass with two fingers and spoke to it quietly, which was new and good. Crispin stood a little to one side with the tote bag round his shoulder, feeling like a man on a pier with a single coin he would throw into the sea at exactly the right moment. “You’re early,” Zoe said, approving him without looking like she was approving him, and she took the tea towel out of his tote and sniffed it and put it back. “Good,” she said. “Smell like a cupboard. That’s a respectable smell.”

The promoter who was also a plumber arrived with a roll of gaffer tape and a lanyard he had made at home out of rope from a shed and a stubbornness that refused to be too official. He grinned under his cap like a man who enjoyed pipes honestly and believed music ought to flow through a room the way water does through a system when you put the joins right. “Moths,” he said. “Don’t be dickheads.” He handed them two bottles of water and a warning about electricity and rain that was both delivered with a laugh and meant so hard you could see the imprint of the meaning on his forehead. “Keep your leads off the damp. If it starts spitting tell me before God tells me.” He gave Crispin a look like he was measuring the bit of the band that would keep it standing. “You’re the one who listens,” he said, not as a question, and he moved on before Crispin could answer and ruin it.

Leah floated out of the crowd the way she had a knack for doing, not as an apparition but like a sentence you’d forgotten you were halfway through that finds you and makes your mouth make sense again. She had a bag with a Tupperware box in it and she pressed it into his hands and said, “Protein,” with the seriousness of a matron and the mouth of a friend. He opened it in the gap between the subs and the mic stand and saw boiled eggs cut into halves like small moons; he did not laugh because sometimes, truly, eggs are not a joke. “You’ll need salt,” she said, and she handed him a sachet she had lifted from a café three weeks previous on purpose for this day he had not told her would come. He loved her then a little bit more than he had the day before and no more than he would the day after. Zoe for once did not crowd a third party away. She nodded at Leah, appraised her quickly with a soldier’s glance at a comrade not on her unit but on her side, and said, “He’s a scaffold. We’re going to climb.” Leah looked at Crispin as if the question was whether he was afraid of heights. “He will,” she said, and that was that.

Soundcheck was a noise with no name until it remembered itself. The monitor gave them back pieces of themselves in tin and then in cotton and then, finally, in something like a room you could speak in. Crispin played single notes almost to himself, patient as a man stringing beans. He did not try to practice the exact thing he would do later because he did not know exactly what he would do later and it would be a lie to pretend to know. He checked, instead, the way the wood under his soles reported his weight, and he shifted a little left until the floor gave him an answer he liked. He checked his right hand against his left and put his thumb where it would be honest and not tire too soon. He watched Zoe place her feet, the exactness of her stance a whole conversation with balance. Karl flexed his fingers and then turned them over as if checking for music in his palms. Lance hit the snare and nodded, and Tom did a thing with his pedal that was fifteen percent showing off but the rest was courage.

People made their half-circles in front of the stage with deckchairs and with casual backs and with prams that would roll a little forward and then be tugged back as if attached to invisible leads. Children did their hopping dance that is the same in all counties and not learnt but inherited. There were faces Crispin knew and faces that knew of him and eyes that did not belong to anyone yet because they were not looking properly, they were letting their attention be borrowed by the day. He saw Mr. Hargreaves with a hat that made him look more human, and he saw Sharron in a jacket too thin for the shade leaning on a rail with a righteous expression like she had invented consequences. He saw the woman in the green coat from the Phoenix and realised in a quiet shock that she was beside Toby and that they stood near each other like people not identical to a time before but related to it. The young man with them was taller even than he’d imagined, that being equal parts bone and afterthought; his hair had made a small rebellion; his face was thinking about being like Toby’s but had not decided yet.

The plumber-promoter introduced them in the key of reluctance to be too enthusiastic and the key of wanting to be exactly as enthusiastic as was warranted after all. “This lot are the Chalk Moths,” he said. “Let’s see if they fly in daylight.” It was the kind of line a town forgives as long as the next thing isn’t too earnest. Zoe stepped forward without needing to know the word for what stepping forward was. Her voice set its blade again and made a line between people and the part of themselves they don’t lend out. Tom’s guitar made a mesh that was both fence and net, catching, containing. Karl found a note that had its own square shoulders, and Lance farmed again and laid down his good crop.

Crispin put his fingers where they had to go. He found his straight pieces, the long ones, and he ran them along the build the others made, and he felt the particular pleasure of being necessary but not in the photograph. The river kept up a mutter, and he could hear it within his own sound like when two rooms have doors open to each other and their radios slip in and out of phase. He did not try anything it was not the exact right second to try. When the chorus came around the second time he slipped three notes into a gap that had pretended to be a wall and then Zoe—who heard felonies faster than a judge—flicked him a glance and then the corner of her mouth went up a point. He felt the tiny legs again at the back of his neck, the bustling. He did not look at the crowd because if he did they might stop being a person and start being people and he would lose the sliver of balance he had arranged with the heat and the wood and the bass’s vowel. He looked instead at the edge of the stage where the green duckweed collected and made a sheet that had nothing to do with them and everything to do with them, if you wanted.

On their second song a wind came up and took the bunting and briefed it and put it back. Crispin’s pick slipped once and he changed how he held it and did not have to think about it. There was a kid at the front who did that thing where they close one eye with the seriousness of aim and watch the world too carefully; he liked that kid and offered the kid nothing in case he frightened it. On the bridge—C sharp minor, the teeth-weird one—he felt the little vibrato he had practiced without practicing find its place like a step in a staircase he had known was there but not seen. Someone in the back did a whoop and it wasn’t for him but it was because of him, in tiny part, and that was a fact to put in his pocket later and turn over when the bus didn’t come. They landed without falling, which is as much as can be asked of anything not made of feathers.

After, the noise that is for you but not about you came up, a clapping that was also an exhale. The plumber-promoter came up the steps and said something about levels that was not an insult and something about a slot in October that could be something and could be nothing and to text him before he forgot he had ever liked them. Zoe did her nod with exactly the right dilution of gratitude and arrogance, the town’s cocktail. Tom smoked a cigarette with his hand like it was hiding a small child, and Lance put his sticks in his bag like putting a pet to bed. Karl held his bass too lightly and then corrected himself because his bass did not like to be disrespected even by its carrier. Crispin put down the guitar he had borrowed and wiped it with the tea towel, careful as turning a page, and he stood for three seconds with his hands useless before he remembered they could be in his pockets.

The woman in the green coat came over with the tall boy and Toby came after with his boots coming three times each, heel and then heel and then toes. Up close, the woman’s mouth was still kind and still sharp and her hair did that obedient yet feral thing that only care can make. “You’re Crispin,” she said, as if he were someone other people in rooms he was not in had talked about in a tone that had not been cruel. He nodded, and she put her hand out and he took it and it was the dry handshake of someone who knows how to pick up heavy pans without flinching. “I’m Hazel,” she said. “This is Liam. He’s pleased to meet you even if he thinks that being pleased is uncool.” Liam looked mortified by the concept of himself and then met Crispin’s eyes and said, “Hi,” in that deep new voice that had only just arrived that month. “You were good,” he added, and then he coughed to punish himself for having been specific.

Toby stood like a man whose words had finished muttering to each other and agreed one might go first. He touched Hazel’s elbow the way you might touch a place you once lived and moved out of and now remembered the cupboard in. “I said it,” he told Crispin, with the gravity of a weird ceremony. “I said the thing to the person I should have. I said I’m sorry I made my fear her house.” Hazel had not asked him to repeat himself but she didn’t stop him doing it and that alone made a weather. “He did,” she said, dry and the opposite of petty. “He did not do it like a poem. He did it like a man who had found his tools.” Liam looked at the river like it maybe sometimes looked back and said, “It was a lot,” and then looked at his trainers and kept them steady on the board because if they moved, perhaps something else would.

Pam Harkness was there too, though Crispin did not see her until she wanted him to. She had a way of making her face uninteresting in a way that meant you saw her if you were a person who looked properly. Her coat was not green. It was some other color that didn’t occur in a rainbow and could only be named by touching it. She watched Toby without making the watching a net and then she looked at Crispin like the card in his pocket had a string she could tug. “Put the weight where you can hold it,” she said, conversationally, as if she were talking about a shelf. “Did it help.” He did not ask how she knew it was him. He held up the cloth in his palm as if to show her proof of a practical. “I put it somewhere,” he said, and she bared her teeth in a way that was not a smile and was more useful. “Good,” she said. “People have such romantic wrists. They want to carry everything with the bits of their body that look nice in photos.” Leah, who had come up mid-sentence and figured out the rest, snorted, and Pam turned toward her with interest like a cat who hears the right kind of bag rustle. “You’re the friend,” she said, not assessing, just naming. “You make spaces around him that don’t have furniture he can trip over.” Leah lifted her eyebrows at Crispin as if to ask which tent she had pitched this quality under, and he shrugged because labels were only ever for a moment.

Children ran past with their faces painted into animals that could not survive their lunch, leaving trails of sherbet and shriek. From a stall two men shouted at the same time that their produce was not the other man’s produce and everything about their tone said that if you were a person who shopped with your ears you would buy neither. Mr. Hargreaves came close enough to be counted as having approached and said, “Very noisy,” in a way that he thought was withering and was instead a descriptive. Sharron made a triangle of her mouth like she had bitten a lemon and was chewing on it to make a point. “It’s a hobby,” she said to nobody in particular, and Leah said, mostly to herself, “Teeth are a hobby,” and took a picture not of Crispin but of the way the river had decided to reflect the exact green of the coat Hazel wore.

They were booked for an October thing and a Tuesday in a pub with a floor that had history, and Tom’s friend’s blog had put up a post with three adjectives and a heart that didn’t mean anything and meant everything because it meant anybody was watching. Zoe pushed the day along with her hands like a farmer. She got them to the stall with samosas and insisted on chickpeas for protein and a lemon to squeeze over the lot like citrus would make them braver. She talked without a plan and then with one, and she told Tom that he was not to date anyone from any band within twenty miles because she could not bear mess before the autumn. Tom rolled his eyes and lit another cigarette and did not promise, but he did tuck his lighter deeper into his pocket and that was already an admission. Lance bought a wooden whistle for a pound and stood bemused at its noise like he had conjured it and needed to make diplomatic relations. Karl met a man who had set up an amp repair in his shed and gave him his number and then wrote it down twice because his phone was his enemy.

Crispin peeled away for a minute and stood at the edge of the boardwalk where it kinked round the bulrushes and made a corner that would be nobody’s meeting point and therefore safe. He put his hand on the rail like a marriage, palm flat, and he closed his eyes and let the day pour through him. The hum under everything was not one thing. It was many. It was the drone of insects making their messiah noises, the feet, the flags, the water with its patient punctuation. It was the wood discussing what it could bear. It was the small electric of the stage’s cables translating power from one vocabulary to another. When he let the sounds multiply without choosing he felt something like a ladder laid down inside him. Not up and not down exactly. More like a place to move that was not a circle.

He opened his eyes because staying closed too long makes a person look like someone the day might scold. On the shallow mud shelf a beetle was making its wide-armed walk toward the board, a stag without a stage. It was not the same one. They were probably never the same one. It had that comedic seriousness big insects have, all theater and industry in one skin. He knelt and watched it do the one thing it was perfect at: be itself and go. Its mandibles were not for him and he did not make them be. He lifted a reed slightly so it could pass and the beetle did not thank him which was correct, and then it found the shadow of the board and went into it without fanfare. He felt the muscles of his shoulders let go by a fraction. He did not have a way to tell anyone about this that would not make the thing less than it was. So he didn’t. He got up and he put the tea towel in his pocket and he went back to people. He could be both. He could.

Mrs. Greaves appeared like a weather system the afternoon knew was due. She clapped once, sharply, and then gave him a look that took his measure again and found it taller. “You don’t look ridiculous,” she said, which was an old woman’s way of being thrilled. “I am going to drink something that tastes of elderflower and pretend I like it because life is long. If someone offers you beer say you can’t because of your tablets.” He did not have tablets but he took the lie because it was better than the possible truth of him tripping over a freedom he hadn’t learned how to carry. She reached out and touched his cheek with two fingers because a whole hand would have been sentiment, and then she took those fingers away with a snap as if reprimanding herself for their behavior. “Don’t be stupid,” she said again, and she went to find Della and a shade that would flatter their opinions.

The afternoon stretched its back and made a new light. People got tired and then remembered they had come to enjoy themselves and then tried again. The Chalk Moths were chalk again in the gossip under the noise; someone said the girl could sing; someone said the tall boy on drums had wrists. A lad with hair like a promise asked Crispin what strings he used and he told him the brand and then told him to use whatever he could afford and then, at the last second, pulled a spare set from his tote and said, “Pay it forward,” and the lad’s face did a thing that made Crispin want to have more to give away permanently. He thought about Toby’s folded mountains of notes and the way his ears delivered and collected messages and he felt very briefly like one end of a string. It was not a burden. It was a visible.

Toward five, when the heat had loosened its jaw, Toby came to stand next to him like a tree has come to stand next to a lamppost and they are considering each other’s jobs. He huffed a content that was not complacency, and he put his hands in his pockets where they could not fidget into breaking. “Liam says he wants to come help with Mrs. Greaves’s bins,” he said, astonished as if he had been offered a lift home by a God with a van. “Hazel said it would be good for his spine.” He did not elaborate which part of his spine. “Pam told me to write a list of the things I am responsible for that I can do something about and not write the ones I can’t. It made my pen laugh.” He looked at Crispin minutely in the middle distance, a gardener’s glance. “You were… you were quiet but important.” He cleared his throat. “It made me want to sit down in a chair and have a chair be the most complicated thing.”

Crispin didn’t know where to put the sentence that was forming. He took a corner off it so that it would fit where people were. “I like chairs,” he said. “I can hear them creak. I think I could tell you if one was going to go.” Toby tilted his head to consider whether this was boast or donnish fancy. He settled on something gentler. “That is the kind of talent I wish to back with money and sandwiches,” he said. “Hold onto it. Don’t let Tom make you think you have to be made out of flame to be seen. There are other lights.” He put his hand briefly on the rail, a reflex he might not have known he had learnt from Crispin, and he tapped once with his fingers and then did not feel foolish about it. “Hazel made me laugh today,” he said, slightly startled that she had. “I had forgotten how her laugh arranges a room.” He glanced in her direction, where she was showing Liam how to pick out stones from a paper cup of olives. “I am paying my debt to being a particular kind of idiot, and look, the interest is green.”

As the day cooled toward evening, the town’s edges made themselves neat again as if a mother were coming. Stallholders did the algebra of unsold stock and hope. A group of boys did a kick-about too near the water and a man with a baritone told them to mind the ducks and they pretended to ignore him and moved two feet left and that was the settlement. Zoe came over with water and with fresh-poured plans that had nothing to do with rules, only with moving pieces into pictures. “We need a photograph that makes us look like we know what we’re doing,” she said. “But not a band photograph. Something that isn’t trying.” Leah pointed at the boardwalk and the bulrushes and the green smear, and said, “Sit like you’re listening to a lake,” and Zoe said, “Yes,” immediately in a way that made Tom nervous. They did it. Crispin kept his hands loose and did not hide them and did not present them. He felt the wood in his back and the day in his shirt and the note he had started the morning on still humming like a coin on a table that had been spun and had not yet agreed to lie flat.

They went home in different directions, all of them punctured a little by contentment so that the air could get in and keep the fire honest. On the bus, a kid in a buggy decided he had invented the syllable ba and said it until it was a universe and then fell asleep with an arm thrown up like he had won a sport adults couldn’t play any more. Crispin watched the corner of the Tesco and the rise and the row of flats. He thought of the tea towel folded now in his tote, the first cloth. He thought of the card and the ladder and the ribs. He thought of the mandible moving with no need for applause. He thought of his fingers on a string and how the tiny movements are the ones that change the sound. He thought, without saying it in words, that maybe he had got up onto something. Not high, not visible. Just up. A plank between one place and another. Someone had put it there and he had walked it. It had made a sound under him and he had liked the sound.

Mrs. Greaves had left the hall light on like a small welcome and like an invitation to say thank you for the electricity. He did. He told her the river stage had not drowned any of them and that the samosas had been crisped in a way that would not be achievable at home. He insisted on washing up and he did not put the burnt bits down the sink and not rinse them this time; he did the more boring thing and it rewarded him with the particular dignity of not being told off. On the sofa afterwards, with the window open to let in the cooled breath of the day, he took the card out of his pocket and set it on the table so that its corner hung off into space. He tapped it once and it made a noise, a small one, a paper click that said itself and then was done. He thought of Zoe’s mouth on the side, of Karl’s hum, of Lance’s thresh, of Tom’s wet nails. He thought of Leah’s eggs, lemoned, and of her arm brushing his once as if by accident and of how being allowed to believe in a future in the same room as someone else makes a different amount of air in a room. He thought of Pam and her coat that did not have a name. He thought of Hazel’s laugh arranging a room and how he would like one day to arrange a room like that and not with a guitar.

Sleep came with the clean tiredness of not having been good or bad, just used. He lay on his side and his hands did small plucking motions against the sofa, practice even in dreaming, and in the place where pictures would have gone if he had been a different sort of sleeper there were instead sounds. The day replayed in frequencies, the low of water and the mid of crowd and the high flicker of bunting in crosswind. Somewhere in that audio his own note sounded like a piece of wood that was not going to crack. He did not know it yet, but the people who had watched him that day would talk about him at tables with crumbs and on pavements with chewing gum and in beds with second lamps, and the sentences would be small, and they would stack, and they would be part of something the town built without knowing the plans. He slept so well that when the night made one small movement under the floorboards he didn’t feel it, and that was fine. There would be time. There would be mornings. He could hold this much. Tomorrow was new wood. Tomorrow would report his weight. He would listen.Monday did not perform a morning; it put one on like a mismatched sock and shrugged. Crispin woke early and then late, that peculiar loop where you open your eyes before your alarm and then let yourself fall through the thin ice back into a thick sleep that makes the day start with apology. The sound in the flat had shifted a centimetre to the left; it was not louder, it was nearer. He made tea and burnt one corner of toast on purpose to have the contrition of scraping it into the sink and this time he ran the tap and sent the blackened bits into their next life because he was learning, slowly, where the friction in a house is born. Mrs. Greaves had pinned a wheezing notice from the council to the corkboard by the meter cupboard, the paper already curling at the edges as if resisting being official. Premises: Gabardine Estate Blocks C–H. Pest Control Visit: Wood-boring beetles suspected in communal spaces. Please ensure access. Please ensure pets are secured. Please ensure shoes are worn. There was a clipart of a bug that looked like a criminal. He read it once, twice, and then turned the kettle off mid-bubble and stood very still and listened. Under the floor, three flats over and down, he heard the smallest works, like someone practising consonants under their breath with intention, and he felt an unreasonable fury rise like a rash at the idea that anyone would come and make that silence into poison.

At sixth form Sharron stood in a corridor talking about throughput to a boy who was looking at his own hands as if they had been swapped for someone else’s. Crispin walked past without becoming an appointment, which is sometimes the best you can do. In English they were meant to compare a sonnet to another sonnet and the substitutions of one image for another gave him the same pleasant irritant as sand underfoot in a stream. Mr. Hargreaves asked him about Keats with all the joy of a man counting parking tickets and Crispin answered in a voice that wanted to be lower than it was so that it would count. Leah was not in the library when he snuck in at lunch; there was a woman with a face made of don’ts who told him the new stock was not for touching and he touched none of it but he took from the returns trolley a book on furniture making that had a photograph on the first page lifting up from the glue. The chapter names were sentences like Joinery for Honest Hands and Finishes That Will Age With You. He ran his thumb along a picture of a mortise as if the recess had depth he could fall into and find a room at the bottom. The vowels of beech, the brass of clamps, the way the grain ran like a line of thought visible if you could only slow your own thinking down to the rate of growth.

Back at the flats he went straight to Toby’s garden the way a person might go to chapel. Toby had a row of rotten logs at the far edge, a habitat he’d made deliberately with the quiet pride of a man who knows he is brave in the small warfare others ignore. He lifted the top one carefully as if taking a lid off a stew and showed Crispin the pale comma-curves in the soft wood, the larvae thick and private, their segmented bodies working their long work that began before they were themselves. “Lucanids,” he said, with the authority of someone who had read the same page in a different book once and then learned a different part in the garden by kneeling. “You can hear them, sometimes, if you’re less distracted than most people. Not exactly hear. It’s more like feeling the shape the sound would be if it came out of its mouth and walked around.” The light found the small caves between fibres and made them into odd little altars that would only ever have these congregations. Crispin crouched until his thighs told him what they thought and put his ear not to the log because that would be theatre, but near enough to it to be mannerly, and he caught there—not with his ear so much as his skull—the suggestion of an insistence, a friction like a match thought of and then deferred. He felt the exact same tidy rage he had felt at the council notice arrange itself again, because these were the people he would choose if he had to choose people, and nobody in an orange hi-vis with a tank on their back was going to be allowed to declare them unsuitable.

Toby watched his face with a gardener’s patience for the roots of expressions. “They’ll do what they’re going to do,” he said, and he sounded like a man trying to say something enormous in a small language. “We can make the long deadwood for them or we can take it away, that’s our only lever. The council’s about the joists and the floorboards and not wanting to pay for men to come with new wood. They’ll fume first and repair second because poison is always quicker to pour than resin. That doesn’t mean we can’t be cunning.”

“What’s cunning,” Crispin said, because it was a good word to ask for its contents.

“We make a pile where there wasn’t one,” Toby said, as if building a scheme with the breath of a dandelion clock. “We ask Pam to ask the man who runs the residents’ forum to ask the councillor if the pest company might like to keep their quotas by counting what’s in our pile as dealt with. We say, look, we’re moving the problem. We make the problem a project. We do them a favour and then they owe us a story about how good they are and we get to keep what’s still thinking about becoming a beetle. Hazel says if you can’t beat the machine you feed it the right paper.”

Pam did not object to being deployed for bureaucratic mischief. When he saw her that afternoon she had a sheaf of forms folded unbearably tidily in a plastic folder that squeaked like a mackerel and she looked like a woman who could persuade a door it would be more beautiful if it opened. “Authorities want to measure,” she said, in the tone of a cavalry sergeant. “We give them something measurable that is also true. We move the pile from where they don’t want the life to where they don’t have a rule against the life. Meanwhile someone checks the actual joists that are sighing, because Haz is right: you can’t live on romance. And you,” she added to Crispin, pinning him with an eye that made the most comfortable part of him wake up and stand to attention, “you don’t stand in front of men carrying canisters; you are not a shield. You are a thread. Pull where you pull best. And for the love of chairs, eat a thing with colour.”

Hazel had colour. Hazel was a scarf made into a person. She had a laugh that you never saw arrive and it took the air in your ribs and put a new arrangement in. She met Crispin at the bottom of the communal stairs with a bucket and a brush like jokes and said, “We’re going to make the inspection less attractive,” and then she scrubbed the skirting with the ferocity of someone who had made tea and been dismissed too many times in rooms that smelled of men, and she said to him, “You like wood,” as if this were information that changed where she would store her plates. He told her about the book from the library in more detail than the book had imagined it would deserve and she nodded in places that meant she already understood a number of the nouns from holding them and not just reading them. “There’s a man who used to work over at Ercol who runs a tiny class in a church hall where they keep the good chairs locked up,” she said afterwards, wringing the brush with both hands as if decision were water. “He is a bore for angles in a way you will love if you’re careful. He is called Mr. Blamey. He teaches ten fingers and three joints and a thing I never learned that I want you to learn, which is to stop before you ruin the piece. Go. I’ll pay for the first one because I want to see your face when a spoke shaves right and you put it to your cheek and feel the truth of it.”

The band’s messages behaved like squirrels, darting in and out of his attention, making caches where he would find them later when he was not looking for anything. Zoe sent what looked like a list and was in fact a weather report, and she had underlined Thursday twice in her own head because the October slot mattered more than the July one had done and she would die out loud if Tom attempted a lick he had not first tried in front of her ears. Tom sent a picture of a pedal he did not have the money for and the phrase “we need this” as if the we was an umbrella he held and everyone else had to get under or be soaked. Karl sent a voice note of a bassline that circled itself cunningly and then opened like a mouth; Lance sent a photo of a drum key on a BHS napkin with the message “do not let me forget this” which meant he would forget it unless someone made a wall in front of him with their body. Crispin sent back a short video of his hand doing a picking pattern on his thigh so that the others could hear the way his blood had counted it; Zoe replied “yes, that” faster than the video had finished uploading because she had maybe heard it before he’d sent it, which was a thing Crispin was only noticing she did more and more.

Leah walked with him up to the museum on Priory Avenue on Tuesday because she wanted to look at an exhibition about chairs that had been painted into art by people who could afford to waste a thing in order to make a further thing. The museum had its slight smell of polish and well-behaved history, and the chairs were held behind ropes in a way that made you want to either bow or steal. An elderly man with a face like a confident plank was at the far end speaking to a group of boys who had no intention of listening and would later remember more than they thought. “A chair isn’t for sitting in,” he was saying, in the tone of a courtroom revelation. “It is for holding. It holds you, it holds the weight of your day, it holds the argument you had and if it’s good it absorbs it instead of lobbing it back at you when you sit down again for tea.” Leah put her hand to her mouth to restrain a grin that would be rude and Crispin let his eyes go to the joinery like a moth to a bulb. There were tenons and pegs and a hidden stairstep of support under a seat that was nothing but woven plant made strong by coming over and under a sufficient number of times.

Mr. Blamey was indeed a man who loved angles in a way that was monogamous, and he was boring in precisely the way that made Crispin want to bring a notebook to bed. He ran the class in a side room where the carpet had been pulled up for honesty and he had the turn of mind that made him ask people their names and then use them correctly for the remainder of their acquaintance. He taught spokeshaves first because he said of all the tools this one makes the truest music if you hold it with the exactness it deserves. Crispin put the blade to the beech and felt the very faint resistance of the wood’s own plan push back, and then the curl came up with its little grace, a ribbon that did not want to leave home. He took it slow because speed is for later and for people not making legs. The curl caught on his sleeve and sat there like a medal. The room smelled of polite sawdust and the square breath of men trying to make a line in a world that won't keep still.

On the walk back his fingers itched the way they did after he had got a part right in practice; the same itch, different vocabulary. Leah told him about a woman she had had to speak to in the morning who had wanted to know whether the library could be quietened because the day outside was upsetting her. “I wanted to tell her we organise the chaos and not the weather,” Leah said. “But I offered her the local history room and she took it and ten minutes later she was at peace with the thudding of printer drums for a bit.” He told her about the larvae in the logs and about Pam’s plan that was not a plan but a way of getting through the room. He told her about Mr. Blamey’s spokeshave and her eyes did that small gleam they did when his sentences fed a part of her she didn’t have to name. She nudged his arm once and it made him aware of where his arm ended and where the air began and he did not mind being that aware, which was both dangerous and ordinary.

The Thursday practice for the October slot was not an argument but it was the argument’s cousin. Tom had an idea about a new intro that asked for a small worship at the altar of him and Zoe let him have seven bars of it and then put her hand out with all the patience of a person who has taught a small dog to sit. “No,” she said, and he said, “But it’s interesting,” in the tone of a man defending an air fryer. “No,” she said again, without any seasoning. “Interesting is the bag that goes in the bin when we need to find the pan. Use that lick to get into the bridge. Crispin, take the spine. Keep the first shape, don’t let him jack it.” Crispin nodded and took the shape of the first bar and held it up and made the others hang from it, and the band made that single churning noise it makes when it has momentarily agreed to be the thing it thinks it is. Lance got the kick all polite at the start and then mean in the middle and Karl did his wry humming that made the floorboards consider becoming dance floors for a second. Tom rolled his eyes in a way that would have been unkind if he had been less tired and Zoe counted them in again because the way out of sulking is always through work.

After, when the room smelled human, Zoe and Crispin sat on the back step with their legs like tuning forks and Zoe did not smoke and did not light any lighter, and she said, mostly to the dark, “I hate the way he is already standing somewhere and talking about where he will be two years from now. It is like living with a person who has set up a tent in the next field and keeps waving at you from it like the present is a joke.” Crispin thought about how many tents the future contained and how the present was a perfectly good field if you only agreed to eat sandwiches in it with the people who had brought plates. “He’s not about now,” Crispin said, knowing the petulance of it and allowing it anyway because he did not serve only as a place to put other people’s words. “I’m about now because I don’t have a later spare.” Zoe turned her head and looked at him as if he had told her a true thing she recognised from another route. “Keep that,” she said, and she reached up and touched the hem of his sleeve like she was ringing a bell nobody else could hear. “Don’t let anyone rush you into being a showpiece. Our foundations will look after us if we keep them oiled.”

The inspection day came with men in trousers that rustled and clipboards that thought they were meaningful. They wore boots that were new to filth and they laughed with each other in the way men do when they are shielding a net they don’t know how to carry alone. The first one put a nose into the meter cupboard and took it out again and made a noise that had been perfected in training to indicate that he had just smelt evidence. The second one tapped where he could and the third read numbers out loud as if reading them would change them. Pam appeared at exactly the moment the first man looked likely to declare something unpleasant in a voice that would carry; she brought a friendliness like honey and a file of papers with the right staples. She showed them the new habitat pile in the part of the garden that was the furthest from the buildings in a way that made its distance feel official, and she spoke three phrases in the voice of the council to the council in human mouths and they stood still because they recognised their own sound. Hazel mentioned liability without once raising her eyebrows and the man who was about to be difficult took the word into his chest and let it walk around looking at the wallpaper. Toby stood where the shade met the sun and looked as if he had nothing to do with any of it; he let his hands stay in his pockets because he was not to bring his feelings out like contraband and show them to men with tanks.

They sprayed nothing that day because it turned out not to be their brief after all, and one of them took off his cap when he saw the larvae in the log pile that had not been there last month and said “blimey” in a child’s voice before his training came back and put the cap on. Evidence was taken in photographs that would be uploaded to an internal thing which would suffer a glitch and then be fixed by a man in a room with a plant, and Pam got a promise she could take home and tell to someone else in a tone that would let them trust it. Crispin went back into the flat and lay on the kitchen floor because the industrial clean smell in the hall made his teeth remember a hospital, and he closed his eyes and put his ear to the lino and heard the under-carpeting go on in its old language, undeterred by forms. He knocked two knuckles lightly against the floor like you would to say goodbye or please, and he told the larvae nothing with words because words would only knock them off their sentences.

Mr. Blamey showed him how to notch a shoulder into a rail the following week and Crispin made a mess once and then did not make that mess again. It was startling, the way his hands knew how to learn this kind of learning, the way the tools asked exactly the amount of attention he wanted to pay to something and rewarded him when he brought it. He took a curl of beech and brought it home and put it in a book he wasn’t finished with yet, as if preserving scent in a sentence would work. In the chair hall he listened to the creak of the same old chairs that had been sat in by the same kinds of people for a hundred years and he guessed at which ones disliked which backs and which had resigned themselves to all of it with a monk’s expression. He learned which glue smelled like funerals and which newly planed edge wanted to drink the oil down like a throat you’d been talking with all day.

Leah came with him sometimes and leaned her chin on her hands and watched him take a line from stubborn to listening. She told him she had written her name in calligraphy again the way you rewrite your name to see if it still belongs to you, and he asked her to do his and she said no because she didn’t want to be the person in that story and he accepted that no the way you accept a seam in old wood: you run your fingers over it and you don’t pretend it isn’t there because pretending would only make you bruise. On a Thursday she told him her landlord had put the rent up by thirty pounds and she had made a list of the things she could stop doing and none of them were the things that made being alive actually alive and it made her both furious and funny. He told her Toby had done his apology in the shape of a cup of tea and a taking out of rubbish that had not been asked for and that Hazel had said, “That’s a first instalment,” and you could see the thought of interest was bright to him.

The October slot came like the worst friend to dinner—late and with a lot of noise—and they played under a sky that had remembered it could be cruel. The air was the temperature of absence and the stage smelled like wet. Zoe tied her hair in a practical knot that did not admit romance and she polished the mic with the tea towel like the mic was a blade and she wanted it sharp. Tom did his lick and then did the other lick and then did them both at once by mistake and for once did not swear at himself out loud but looked at his shoes with a look of love as if they had betrayed him less than the rest of the world. Karl’s hands were blue at the knuckles and Lance put on gloves between songs and then took them off because you can’t hold sticks in mittens and pretend it’s fine. Crispin put his fingers to strings that hurt and he found that pain made a different sound—thinner, but honest—and he used that sound and did not apologise for it. The small audience had that determination people get when they have made a choice with their clothes and are going to honour it with their bodies; they stood in damp and stamped in time to keep heat where heat belongs.

After the set, when the blood had come back to his fingertips in stings like a chastising aunt, a man with wire glasses introduced himself as running a small joinery in Loudwater where the old boys came to make the things that weren’t wanted any more famous and the young lads came to see if they might be interested in being the sort of men who owned a plane. “We take apprentices,” he said, as if he were offering a kind of food. “We pay badly but we pay. You look like a lad with thumbs.” Crispin smiled without permitting hope to throw a party, and he told the man about Mr. Blamey, and the man said, “Ah, Blamey, moody as stain but he’s right about shoulders,” and there was love in it. He took a card that meant something and brought it home and put it next to the one with the ladder that was ribs and the two of them looked like a pair of shoes not yet worn enough to know if they pinch.

Mrs. Greaves had a day mid-month when she moved slower and put her hand on the wall before she stood up. She shooed him away with a spoon and then asked him to bring her small things from high places, sugar, pan, the cunning jar of cloves kept for scratchy throats, and then she folded herself into her chair with a sigh that included the names of people she had not met yet but would one day tell to get out of her kitchen. He watched her not with fear but with a ledger’s care, and he made a stew without thinking too stupidly about it and he salted it and then salted it again and then took the potato out and mashed it and put it back to thicken the broth in a way he’d seen done by a man who didn’t like to call it a trick. When it was good she did not praise him so much as eat it like an animal that had been waited on properly and he knew then what gratitude looks like when it is not dressed for a photograph.

Pam came by with a list for him and the list was not of chores but of questions. How much would your bus fares be if you took a day a week at the joinery? What can you stop doing that won’t make you poorer in the real way? How do you tell Tom you’re not coming to a rehearsal because money? He answered her honestly which is the only way to get any value out of that kind of conversation and she wrote down his answers in her tidy way that looked like every letter had practised at being itself. “You can be two things,” she said, when he faltered and called himself a coward for not jumping. “You can be three. You can be beetle and boy and scaffold and there are more to come; you don’t have to take up arms against any of them. But you do need to put time in boxes you can lift. Do not pour yourself into a bath you can’t carry. Use smaller jugs and make more trips.”

He went to the joinery on a Tuesday and learned how the machines were loud only until you learned the rhythm of their beneficial danger. He swept and was given the important job of sweeping properly; he made tea and listened to the way men talk when they are trying to lighten the beam on their shoulders and when they fail and when they succeed and you can tell by the way they look at their hands after. He planed an edge under supervision and the curl he made smelled like something green that wasn’t a plant, and he took splinters with the affable amazement of someone who is not yet in the fraternity of complaint. He also, for money, sanded an awkward angle on a cheap piece of pine until the varnish smelt like a memory of chemistry class and he thought about Sharron’s phrase incomes irregular and decided he would like to irregular his way into something that kept his back speaking quietly to him and not shouting.

In the band there were days when things were delicate and days when things were knives. They practised in rooms that smelled of varnish and oranges and boys and Crispin knew now that Zoe was right: all those rooms smell of oranges, no one knows why. He took the second guitar places where it was not expected to go and then brought it back before anyone had the chance to talk about it with him. He became the keeper of the tempo when Lance lost a bit because he had a gift for hearing the bit that wasn’t there yet and making room for it. He said no to Tom once, carefully, and Tom did not hit him with a face or a phrase because Zoe had already put a thumb on the fulcrum of that argument and moved it somewhere fair. He bought himself plectrums for the first time with his own money and felt the small ridiculous pride you should allow yourself in unimportant purchases that matter.

Under the floor the lives went on being extraordinarily small and completely large. The council men did not come back with poison because a different council problem had grown a new head somewhere else and they had gone to cut it off with a letter and a blowtorch in a different part of the town. A fox had cubs behind the bins and they squealed at hours when you were not supposed to listen and Crispin lay awake with a smile at the corners of his mouth he could not explain to himself. Liam came to help bring the bins out on a Thursday and was appalled by the realism of everything and then was less appalled and then was competent, which is how you become a person. Toby brought a shovel for him to hold and it was metaphorical only to the degree that it was not metaphorical at all; it was actually a shovel, and it fit Crispin’s hands like it had been measured on a day he had not been present for. Hazel got a plant app on her phone and it told her a weed’s Latin name and she was delighted and then suspicious and then sent the app a photo of her own hand and laughed when it told her she was a horse chestnut.

One night in November when the buses had frost in their breath and the lights in the flats went on like people pressing themselves gently against the edge of a day, Crispin woke to the exact noise he had anticipated and not anticipated for months. It was small but declarative. Not in his room. Below. He sat up on the sofa with the throw around him like the idea of a cloak and he put his bare feet on the cheap carpeting and he climbed the small mountain of himself to standing and he went into the hall and he went into the kitchen and he opened the door to the balcony even though the air made his teeth think rude thoughts. He knelt and put his ear to the cold sill and he heard an emergence, is the only word he would find later, a breaking of a skin that was not made to last forever and a first breath taken by a thing that had been practising inside another word. He lay down on the lino and put his hand flat to the floor and did not cry because it would have made the thing about him and it was not about him. In the morning there would be nothing visible and he would make toast and answer texts and go to the joinery and practise between five and seven and come back to a house that was not quite a house, but in that minute there was a small movement under the floorboards that made the day he had lived rearrange itself around its proper centre, and he understood in the uncomplicated way a body can understand that he was not learning to become anything; he was learning to notice and to stay.Frost arrived like the kind of truth that doesn’t raise its voice. It put its version of order on the estate rails and the car roofs and the lip of the bin lids, and it pressed the grass flat and then let it rise up again slowly as if reconsidering an argument lived through a hundred mornings before. When Crispin opened the balcony door the air had that crisp, bright cruelty that makes your lungs feel honest and slightly betrayed. The lino was colder under his bare feet than he expected even though he had expected it. He bent at the waist without meaning to and put his palm on the threshold as if it were someone’s forehead, and he felt at once the old tingle that was not exactly hearing and the new quiet where something had been and had moved on. The under-floor lives had changed their verbs. It made his own breath line up with itself and behave.

Mrs. Greaves had swapped her summer slippers for a pair of shoes that looked like a horse had invented them. She was in the kitchen with a cardigan buttoned wrong and a disdain for the way her hands were arguing about mugs. “It’s cold enough for proper tea,” she said, which was her winter sermon, and she put the kettle on and glared at the tap until it ran hot as if obedience in this house could be achieved by looks alone. “Don’t go out with wet hair. You’ll get a head cold and your brain’ll go slow.”

“My brain already goes slow,” he said, and she gave him a look that said don’t make me be sweet, I’ve got beans on.

At Loudwater the joinery smelt of something like toast and something like medicine and something that was neither but made you think about both. The old boys came in with hands that had learned more shapes than most mouths. The younger men came in with headphones in like they were paying the room with one ear and the rest to a story they hadn’t invited this day to hear. Crispin swept and he swept properly and found he liked the kind of quiet the broom made, the way it revealed and didn’t perform. The man with the wire glasses who had liked his thumbs taught him about seasoning, about how wood is a patient person and you are rude if you ask it to do things when it’s still wet with its old life. “You put a piece by and it learns a new weather,” he said. “You take a piece too soon and it will sulk in a way you can’t see until a winter reminds you you were a fool. Most things that break don’t do you the courtesy of breaking on the same day as the mistake.”

They set him to work on a stool leg because in this town stools are the cousins of chairs, and the joint between them is a family history you can hold. He shaved and he shaved, and the spokeshave’s song was a small exact violin that only played the piece you had time for. The curl lifted up and he watched it try to stay attached and then accept the independence it had been given and he caught it in his sleeve and kept it there for luck until someone older than him brushed it off without being sentimental about apprenticeship charms. He learned that beech argues with you if you come to it on the wrong day and that ash has a gym-goer’s ego and will flex at you if you don’t stand your ground. He learned that oak can be generous if you arrive with your hat in your hand and even more so if you arrive as if you invented hats.

On Wednesday the room where the band practised had condensation on its breath and the whole building made that little damp cough old schools have in November. Lance warmed up with his sticks tapping logos as if he was trying to persuade brands to be useful. Tom stood by the plug sockets like a man holding flight plans he wasn’t licensed to fly. Karl shook out his hands and made a face like someone about to lift a friendly goat. Zoe came in already mid-sentence, talking about decay not as a sad word but as an accurate one; she had drawn a small picture of a leaf in the corner of her notebook that looked like it was deciding whether to be art or a shopping list. “We need a new one,” she said, abrupt as a nurse. “We need something that doesn’t sound like we’ve been listening to the same record and transcribing our mistakes by hand. Karl, that thing you sent, the worm that finds itself. Lance, keep your thigh and not your ankle. Tom, you’re going to hate me but your guitar is second, not first, if you’ve put that compressor on again I will throw it in the river myself. Crispin, do that pattern. The tick that has a question in it. Keep it simple like someone you trust.”

He did the pattern on his thigh first to put it into muscle so that when his fingers touched strings they already knew where the idea lived. It was nothing and it was the only thing. He used his nail on the off-beat because it made a little bright in the wood, and when they came in around him Zoe did that thing with the corner of her mouth that was halfway to a smile and halfway to a warning not to get pleased with himself because pleased is the first step on the path to sloppy. The song grew like ice grows, slow and exact and if you look away it catches you out. Words came from Zoe that were not about beetles or chairs or the council but were somehow made out of all of those; she had a way of making a line ordinary enough that a person who had never listened to anything but the radio could come in, and then she would add a word that didn’t belong so that the door stuck and you had to pay attention to open it. “Put the weight… put the weight where you can… put the weight where you can hold it,” she sang into the room as if the line had been waiting there all day with its coat on. He felt silly joy hit his kneecaps. He kept his head down so that it would go into the strings.

Leah’s rent went up on a Friday with the bureaucratic grace of an email that knew exactly how much it could be disliked without consequence. She told him over a long walk to the park where the old men made eyebrows at pigeons and the young men made eyebrows at each other. “If I had another tenner a week I would keep my dignity and my bananas,” she said. “I am considering eating soups as a lifestyle until April. I am considering moving in with Hannah which would be fine except for the fact that she likes to hang her tights on the radiator like flags.” He offered sympathy the way a person offers a seat on a bus, hand out, palm up. He didn’t try to offer a solution because she would let him know when help would be help and when it would be the opposite. “I’m applying for a bursary to do a short course in archives,” she said, and then she did her own impression of Sharron in the corridor, which was accurate and forgiving at the same time, which is a hard trick. At the library she gave him a notebook with paper that had the correct friction. “Write down the patterns,” she said. “So you know which ones you’ve already invented. Also, don’t be a hero; let me buy you chips when I’ve got money, not because you can’t buy chips, but because buying chips for people is a pleasure and I want it.”

The second-hand shop had rearranged itself again, as if it did so on the hour to keep the stock from learning where it was. The lattice-haired man had stacked small wooden frames in a manner that challenged the physics of thrift. In the back, on the rack where instruments came to blink and then be bought by other people, there were two guitars. One had a spangly finish that looked like someone had tried to persuade a fish to go to a party. The other looked like a piece of bread toasted on one side and not on the other. It had no brand on the headstock because whatever name it had worn had been peeled off by someone with a thumbnail and a grudge. He could feel the E it would make just by looking at it. He picked it up and the neck met his hand with the compromise of something that had been played by people who did not think it was a church. He tuned it and it listened. The man came over with his jaundiced hands held like a magician pretending he had nothing to hide. “That one’s got honest strings,” he said. “She’s had a life. The shiny one’s a liar.”

“How much,” Crispin said, and his heart did its stupid arithmetic.

“Thirty-five,” the man said, and then he squinted at the part of the ceiling where prices are kept and added, “If you can promise not to sell it to a boy called Liam who comes in here asking for electrics and doesn’t know how to open a case without making me feel things about locks.”

“I know a Liam,” Crispin said, and then flushed because he did and what if the geography of his life was transparent to men who counted change.

He had twenty-two pounds in his pocket because the joinery paid badly and paid and he had not had time to walk past Toby and ask for an advance in luck. He did not do the noble refusing because he was learning not to be an idiot. “I can leave a ten,” he said, and the man rolled his eyes to the exact degree required by the job of being a second-hand shop owner and said, “Go on then. I’ll put a note on it that says reserved for the lad with the ears,” which was better than any receipt. The man took the guitar down and put it under the counter like a rabbit. “You’ve got a week,” he said, and Crispin nodded like a man presented with a creature that might go if you blinked and he left with his pockets lighter and his chest newly heavy and exactly right.

That evening Hazel had Toby and Liam for tea in a way that meant something and a way that also meant nothing because a meal can be both a ritual and an accident. Pam had told Toby to bring a salad and he had brought a lettuce and then looked at it for a minute like he had been asked to identify a relative from a line-up. Hazel had laughed and put the lettuce in a bowl with vinegar and bread and a red onion that made everyone cry respectably. Crispin had been invited because Hazel had decided that he was a person you fed when you had a casserole that would stretch, and because she had found that when he sat in her kitchen and listened the house behaved itself. Liam did the teenage thing where he ate as if he had been disappointed by food before and had chosen optimism again, but quietly. Toby buttered bread like a man repairing masonry. Hazel told a story about being asked to produce change in an office that had forgotten what coins looked like and the way she’d reached into her bag and brought out a handful of the town and emptied it onto a desk that had always thought it was too good for small metal. They talked about nothing and consequentially, like the sort of people who had learned their appetite in the company of weather. After, Hazel made tea in the proper way that involves warming and waiting and not pretending that hot water poured at speed is the same thing, and she looked at Crispin over the steam and said, “You should go to that class again and make a thing with a corner. Don’t get stuck making rounds. Rounds are good but corners teach you what truth tastes like.” He nodded and did not think loose thoughts about families because the thought would have been unhelpful in this room where the work was not pretending anything was anything other than what it was.

The plumber-promoter texted Zoe a message phrased like a threat and a blessing at once. There was a support slot in London on a Wednesday for a band that had learned to be in photographs without looking ridiculous. “Be on time. Bring your own leads. Don’t assume anything. The monitor engineer is a prince when he’s sober and a dragon when he’s not. You get twenty minutes and if you go over I will have to do a thing with my hands I hate.” Zoe, who had a sense for important stupid, got hold of the others in the kind of order you’d arrange a kitchen by: essentials first, then the things that could be thrown into a drawer. Tom strutted in a sentence that pretended to be casual and contained the word London three times as if you needed to say it to earn it. Karl asked not to do the load-in and then did it anyway. Lance asked if his mum’s car would be allowed and was told no, because the car was not brave enough, and he arrived by train with his snare swaddled in a duvet. Crispin mapped the route with his feet in advance, walking to the station and back and counting the beats between barriers and platforms, because on the day his brain would need its hands free.

London expected them to be faithless and competent, which was a combination you don’t experience in a town that still talks to its own bins. The venue had stairs that deserved a wage. The stage had screws in places screws should not have been. The air smelled like the end of an argument in a kitchen. The soundcheck belonged to someone else because there’s always someone else, and they waited quietly in a bit of corridor that had once been painted black and was now the color of black years later. Zoe held the shape of the evening together with the exact tightness of a woman holding a heavy plate with one hand. Tom made friends with two men and then forgot their names and remembered them again as Dave and Dave. Karl found the bar and got given a token that made him nostalgic for the fair. Lance counted his sticks and found he had more than he’d brought and decided not to question it. Crispin stood and watched the engineers do their own ritual with the cables and the lights and he put his ear out for the sound the city makes when it’s moving a thousand people past you and not one of them knows what you think you’re about.

They were good. They weren’t the best. They didn’t have to be. They put twenty minutes into the room like you put a letter into a box and don’t wait for it to be read because that’s not how the thing works. The headline band’s bassist gave Karl a nod that Karl tried to pretend not to keep like a coin with a hole in it on a chain inside his shirt. Tom looked at his reflection in the chrome of someone else’s amp and approved of being himself. Zoe did her bow without bowing. Crispin remembered not to show London his hands like they were a trick; he let the notes be the invitation and he took the tube home with his shoulder pressed against a map of Jubilee, Metropolitan, Bakerloo like those names made a hymn you hummed for safety.

The next morning the joinery noticed he was late and made him exactly as sorry as he should be, which is a gift. The wire-glasses man raised his eyebrows enough to make a fence and then opened a little gate in it. “You can have one London,” he said. “Two if the first one paid. After that I am going to begin to look at you in a way your grandchildren will inherit. Sweep.” He swept, penitent and not melodramatic, and his penance made the curls behave.

Leah got her bursary and said the word aloud like some people say grace. She bought him chips and insisted on the salt being right up to the line, no sentimental shaking. She came to the joinery on her lunch break and smelled the place with interest and put her hand on a piece of beech the way you touch a dog you don’t know but feel equal to and she said, “If you get good at this you’ll be insufferable,” and he said, “I’ll be completely reasonable and do everything the slow way,” and she rolled her eyes and then, unexpectedly, they watered and she wiped them with her sleeve and said, “It’s the sawdust,” which it was and wasn’t.

December tucked itself in round the town. The light did that thing where it leans and says it can’t stay. The band played a Christmas special at the Phoenix where the compère wore antlers for a joke he understood, and Zoe allowed them one cover and it was not a seasonal one because she would not have kitsch unless it served her. Tom gave Leah a cigarette and then took it back off her with a flourish like she had enrolled in a course she didn’t want. Lance draped tinsel over a cymbal and then took it off because it sounded like lies. Karl wore a jumper with a reindeer and looked like he might actually be a reindeer. Crispin borrowed a scarf from Leah that made him into a version of himself he filed away for later, when he might be a person who can carry certain bright. They played and people who hadn’t meant to care about anything that night cared about a bit, and it was enough to warm your hands on.

On the day he had the rest of the money for the guitar, frost had done that thing where it pretends to be sugar on the grass and you get halfway to putting your tongue out before you remember that the world is bigger than your appetite. He went into the shop with his thumb running the edge of the notes like a man checking for counterfeit in his own pocket. The guitar was still under the counter like a dog waiting to be promised a walk. The man made a noise like someone lighting a cigarette on a windswept hill. “Thought you’d forgotten,” he said, pretending not to have looked at the door every hour. Crispin handed over the money and the guitar came out into light with the mild astonishment of a thing that is going to be asked to work again. “It’ll go out of tune if you look at it wrong,” the man warned him with love, the way men warn you about boats, and Crispin said, “I’ll look at it right,” and he took it home with the tea towel in the bag like a sacrament and he wiped it and tuned it and tuned it again and then he put his hand on it, palm flat, and it answered with a readiness that made him feel exactly as old and exactly as young as he was.

He made a seat for Mrs. Greaves’s old chair under Mr. Blamey’s eye in three evenings and one long afternoon. He didn’t tell her, he just took the chair away into the back room and then he brought it back and turned it upside down on the table for her to see the thing that is usually hidden: the neat run of the weave, the way the fibres cross like loyalty, the patience of proper work. She put her thumb into one corner and pressed the way a nurse presses and the chair pressed back with an honesty that made her nod to it and then to him and she said, “You’ve made it so it will have arguments and not lose them,” and he knew that was praise not of him but of the work, which was more useful.

Pam had him sit down and write on a piece of paper the words I am two things and then I am three and then stop before you are eight. He asked why eight and she said because past a point your life becomes a shed and you can’t find the screwdriver you need when a hinge breaks. She made him write under each thing what it cost and what it paid, and the act of making a list pulled the dramatics out of his head like a splinter and put it on the page where it could be looked at and told not to make such a fuss. “You have hours,” she said. “You don’t have days. Be more jealous with the hours. Give them to the hands that have earned them.”

Tom got a sniff of a bigger band and wore the rumor like a cologne. He brought into practice a tune that wasn’t bad and wasn’t them and Zoe let him play it and then said, “That’s a good song for the band you’ll be in next,” and he did his performance of being wounded and then laughed because the wound had been performed too many times to bleed. He pulled back the hours he’d been offering without saying he was doing that, and there was air around him that didn’t used to be there. Crispin didn’t chase the leaving; he tapped his pattern on his thigh and kept the scaffold in good repair. When Tom didn’t come to the second Thursday, Zoe didn’t say he was out, she said, “We’ll be what we are in front of us,” which was the kind of sentence you think is nonsense until the next time you need to do something and you hear it again like a bit of song. They practised as four and there was a spareness he liked, a room for seeing.

Snow flirted with the town and then got embarrassed and left. The commuters did their semaphore with scarves. The fox behind the bins held a grudge against bins and the bins were stoic. Liam came to take the bins down one night with Crispin and he told a story about school that was only funny because he told it in a way that allowed it to be funny. He carried the blue bin down the stairs with the exact seriousness of a new job and he didn’t drop it twice. At the bottom he wiped his hands on his jeans and looked at the stars like they were not impressing him even though they were. “Hazel says a job is a little belt you wear inside yourself,” he said, and Crispin said, “She’s right,” and he didn’t add anything clever to dilute a true thing that was already the right size.

At the joinery just before Christmas a man brought in a broken chair and the broken bit was not a tragedy but an opportunity—the rail had given up not because the man had sat too heavily but because time had been doing press-ups where nobody could see. Crispin sat with it, held it the way you’d hold a tired child who thinks it is still strong, and he listened as if at any point wood might be persuaded to say words in English. It did not. It said the word that wood says, which is not a word but a continuation. He cut the new piece and he made it fit and he did not force it and he learned where persuasion becomes bullying and pulled back. When it was in he took a breath that smelled like nothing and everything and the wire-glasses man clapped his shoulder in a way that was a handshake to a bit of beech and then had to go find something else to look at.

The council sent a letter about the beetles that sounded like victory had paperwork. The habitat pile became a project with laminated posters and small children who had been arranged by teachers into curiosity. Hazel rolled her eyes and smiled because sometimes you take the theatre if it pays for the thing and you clap the people in hi-vis even if they’re late because they came in the end. Toby found a new log in a place he shouldn’t have and moved it with the grace of a man shifting guilt and put it at the back of the garden where it would do the most secret good. Pam took a photograph and it looked like nothing and would later be shown to a room in which three people would change their minds about something without admitting it.

On a long night between Christmas and the new year, the sort of night that has no manners and folds its arms and sits in the middle of your carpet, Crispin took his guitar out and played the patterns he knew and the ones that didn’t exist yet. He put his thumb where it could keep time without injuring pride, and he let the strings speak and did not interrupt. He heard, beneath what he played, the soft noises a house makes when it has agreed to hold a group of people through cold. It felt like a privilege to live in a building that had been asked too much and was doing it anyway. He did not make resolutions because resolutions are a kind of bet against yourself and he did not want to gamble with his hands; he made instead a small list of next jobs on the back of the card with the ribs. He wrote, in the plainest letters he owned, buy strings, learn C shape clean up the neck at the fifth, ask Mr. Blamey about shoulders again, practise the tick, keep the weight where it can be held. He folded the card like permission and put it back in his pocket, and when he slept he heard not a single thing under the floorboards because a rest is also a note and it matters where you put it.

January came like a set of instructions. The library furnace got its annual stipend of bad noises and Leah wore gloves with the fingers cut off and said she would write an ode to the radiator that didn’t do what it should and then she didn’t because she was busy. Sharron printed out pamphlets with the word opportunity and the words term time underlined and Crispin took one and folded it into a paper plane that he did not fly because he was not that sort of boy. The band talked about a name change because Tom wanted something that would look good on a poster six inches bigger than theirs would ever be, and Zoe said, “Names are the last thing,” in the tone of a woman closing a window. Karl learned to sing the harmony on the chorus like a man learning to carry a tray over a patch of ice; he did it and then he did it again and then it became something he didn’t have to think about and that was the victory.

One morning where the sky had the color of aluminum and the ground had the color of aluminum’s cousin, Crispin woke to the tap-tap-tap of something in the wall that was not the radiators and not his neighbor mending a shelf and not any of the small arguments pipes get into. It was the old knock he had learned at the lodges of the under-wood and he smiled into his pillow because it was a winter sound and the house was loud in its life. He tapped back with one finger lightly against the bed frame, three and then two, and then he stopped because he had learned when to stop. He got up, he put his socks on, he put his hand on the banister, and the wood, which did not know his name and did not care for names, steadied him, which in the end is all any of this was about. He went to work. He went to practice. He went to the shop and bought a lemon. He took the bins out with Liam and they both slipped and both did not fall and laughed like men with knees who remembered how to laugh. He returned the book to the library that he had not quite finished and Leah let him keep it a week extra because she knew that finishing isn’t always the point. In the quiet between these small things, he noticed, and he stayed. He didn’t make it bigger than it was and in that there was room for it to be big.The thaw came in fits, like someone trying to remember a name. Pavements were a mosaic of old ice and new wet, and the gutters talked to themselves in a calmer tone. Crispin walked differently when the cold let up; his shoulders came down half an inch as if winter had been perched up there reading and had finally put the book back on the shelf. He could hear the water hidden under the skin of the town, pipes merciful and petty, the slow trickle that meant rooms would have their ordinary noises again and radiators would be forgiven for their habits. In Loudwater the joinery smelt briefly of damp wool coats hung on pegs and then of the honest bread of sawdust again, and the wire-glasses man put a hand flat on a worktop as if greeting an old friend who had been sulking in a car park. “The wood loosens now,” he said, as if speaking of a parish. “It tells you what it won’t do before it tells you what it will.”

Mr. Blamey made him mark out a mortise the slow way because the slow way is always the honest way and then watched his left hand betray him when his attention leant too much toward his right. “Your wrong hand is the one that does the telling,” Blamey said, not unkindly. “Don’t let your clever one show off at the expense of your loyal one.” The beech said yes when the chisel was positioned just so and no when the angle slackened by a degree, and Crispin found he could feel the yes and the no in his wrists like faint weather. He liked being corrected when the correction was the room returning to itself after his ego had moved the chair away from the table without asking.

Zoe’s notebook went from a list to a small life. She had stuck a receipt in at the back for plectrums and lemons and she had written in the margin by Tuesday’s square: new one, bones in, spine: C, E, A minor, let it argue with itself. She sent messages with the force of a kettle that will not be ignored. Tom read them and replied and then, lately, replied late. The rumours around him were like perfume; they arrived before he did, and you didn’t always want them. He started turning up with his hair like a plan. When he played, the lick that had once been a ladder was becoming a logo. Zoe said nothing for longer than Crispin would have guessed she could manage, which turned out to be a way of speaking loudly. Lance got quieter in the best sense and more precise, and Karl’s basslines looped themselves so cunningly that it was as if he had found the seam where beginnings and endings exchange coats.

Leah started her archive course on a night that rained exactly the amount you need for a coat to be worth it and an umbrella to be an argument. She went to a building that had decided to be modern in 1998 and never recovered, and she sent Crispin a picture of a box with acid-free tissue and a label that looked like it had been written by a person who believed in letters. “I am going to handle old things and ask their owners to sign forms about the ways we will love them,” she wrote. “I assumed it would be dusty but it’s very clean, like a hospital for paper. I think I might cry about a card catalogue at some point which is embarrassing and also a reasonable reaction.” He wrote back that he had met a piece of ash that refused to be bullied and they exchanged emojis they both hated on principle and used with care, like ornaments one brings out for exactly one week a year.

The residents’ forum met in the community room with the cheap carpet that had decided to collect the DNA of two decades’ worth of biscuits. Pam chaired it without admitting she chaired it; she sat at the end of the table where the drafts decided to gather and she made the councillor laugh twice and blush once, which is generally the right ratio for extracting a concession. The laminated poster went up about the habitat pile and Liam took a photograph that cut off three people’s feet but caught the part of Toby’s face that had been gone for fifteen years and come back recently, and Hazel put the photo on a site that would make the council look wholesome for a day and provide cover for the fact that the pest company hadn’t been back because they were busy measuring their own phones.

On a Saturday Crispin took the chair he had re-seated back to the church hall where Mr. Blamey kept his spare opinions, and he happened to arrive at the tail end of a demonstration to three men who did not yet know how to stand in their own shoes. The church had a mild smell of old berries and heating oil, and there was the polite chorus of wooden things adjusting to the temperature as the radiators acknowledged their duty. Someone had left the door to the main nave open and the air moved in a way that made noise without making sound. Crispin walked in, chair in his hands, and the church noticed him the way rooms do when you have brought them back a piece of themselves. He set the chair down and ran his hand under the seat to settle a fibre that had raised itself in pride. The pews held their breath and then let it out again. He realised, with the embarrassment that attends tender thoughts, that he could hear the room’s age. Not its date; its age. The little groans of timber, the softened corners of echoes, the way the organ’s pipes whispered to each other about dust. He wanted to play a note in there to see where it would sit and for how long. He didn’t. He put his hands behind his back and pretended to admire Mr. Blamey’s arrangement of planes by size so that his face didn’t tell anybody a secret it wasn’t ready to tell.

The second-hand shop owner went into hospital for three days for something that had a name ending in -itis and he returned with a wristband and the slightly performative fury of a man who has been told to rest. He moved the frames so that gravity had to pay attention again and he put the guitar with the peeled headstock on a stand near the window like a dog learning to lie by itself near the front door. Crispin brought him a packet of bourbons and the man made a show of not caring and then opened them and ate four while recounting, with relish, the misery of hospital custard. “You want the pedal board?” he asked out of nowhere, maybe because admitting generosity hurts less if it’s disguised as retail. “Someone left one here on a Tuesday in 2011 and never came back. It’s bent like a thing that’s been sat on by a drunk but it’ll do if your feet aren’t posh.” Crispin shook his head because he did not yet have a use for a thing he would have to pretend to know how to use. “Later,” he said. “I’m learning to hold. Effects are a next language.” The man gave him a look like a red pencil and then shrugged because refusing to sell is not a sin but it isn’t a virtue either.

Zoe went very quiet on a Monday and you could feel it in the texts because the texts were functional and clean and the jokes were the kind of jokes you make while cleaning a sharp knife. She had taken a call from a man who had said the words development deal and showcase and she had not laughed in his ear simply because it is rude to laugh directly into a phone. She told no one for a day to see if keeping it in her mouth made it less real; it tasted metallic and old. When she told them she did it with her head back like she was looking at a ceiling crack she could not fix. “It’s not us,” she said, before Tom could start unpicking the present and wrapping it round himself. “It’s me with a man and a pianist in a room where the chairs are for the look of the thing. I’m not sending it away. I’m putting it on a shelf and we can look at it and decide when our rent’s paid.” Tom’s relief was so bright it made his face cruel for a second; he had wanted to want it so badly he’d forgotten what wanting looks like. Lance looked at his sticks and then at Zoe and then put his sticks down like a line. Karl hummed in a new key that meant disagreement and was also loyalty. Crispin watched the air and waited to see if it would lift or stick.

In the days after, the band wrote the song that belonged to the phrase Pam had put into the room—put the weight where you can hold it—and it wore the line better than any of them had expected. Zoe arranged her vowels so that the sentence could do the work and not her throat, and there was a moment on the second chorus where she didn’t sing it at all and the audience in the room that didn’t exist yet sang it anyway, which is how you know a song is going to do a job without you. Crispin found the part that was neither a riff nor a ballast; it was a pattern like breath about to become running. He put a tiny pull-off on the fourth bar every second time and nobody noticed with their ears but everyone moved differently at that point with their bodies. He wrote it down in the notebook Leah had given him, not because he would forget, but because he wanted the pattern to grow roots in two mediums.

Toby and Hazel had started doing a thing that looked like planning for many years and was in fact planning for the next three days at a time. Liam joined in on a Thursday with a face like suspicion and came away on Saturday with a sheet of paper with timings and a chore drawn in Pam’s tidy hand, and he kept the paper folded in his back pocket like a love letter from adulthood. Toby did his next brave thing in a café that had plants dying gracefully in the window and told Hazel about a job he’d been offered that would involve leaving the town for two months in summer to go and make someone else’s garden obedient. “It pays like it knows it’s interrupting my life,” he said, ashamed of his joy. Hazel looked at the piece of table where two varnishes met and then looked at him and then said, because she is Hazel, “If you go, you’ll come back with a different sentence in your mouth and I will be unpleasant for five days out of eight and then I will stop. If you don’t go I will be unpleasant for different reasons. Liam should see a person he knows go and come back. If you want my vote, vote cast. But we can’t afford to treat this like a symbol. It is a job. Do it or don’t. Don’t make it carry your myths.” Toby put his fists in his pockets like he had been told to in a different life and he nodded as if to a foreman who was also a friend.

Mrs. Greaves had a week when the world asked her knees to explain themselves and they declined. She stayed in and made decisions about the cupboards. Crispin lifted boxes down and put boxes up and learned that a house has strata like rocks. The top shelf is where we pretend to be people who need picnic baskets, the bottom is where we put the past and tell it not to complain. He found a biscuit tin with photographs that had been taken by a person who always chopped heads off at the eyebrows, and he asked questions and got answers that were not exactly answers but were the shape of the things they could be. She told him about the man she had nearly married who had gone to Portsmouth and found out he couldn’t live by water, and Crispin wanted to ask her about that feeling—the one where the element you thought would mend you instead revealed your particular break—but he didn’t press because there are doors you do not push through until someone else is already reaching for the handle.

At the joinery a man brought in a small table that had been in his grandmother’s house and had lived on a carpet where everyone had put their cups down without coasters and made rings like planets. “It’s not valuable,” the man said with the modesty of grief. “It is only it.” Crispin sanded the rings with a patience that surprised even him, working into the stain like talking to a shy animal. The grain came up very slowly, like a person looking around a corner to see if the person at the table is the same person they left there. When the oil went on the first time it drank it like someone coming in from a long walk. He thought of Mrs. Greaves’s stew and the way the potato starch thickened what had too much water and he smiled to himself because it turned out recipes and repairs are the same kind of love.

London asked again with a different mouth. An email came from a man with a signature block that had more lines than a poem and it offered them six minutes in front of a camera in a room painted white by a company that wanted to make a series of videos called Young Sound. Zoe copied it into the group with the comment: two trains there and back, one song, lights we don’t own, free fruit in a bowl. Tom wrote, “We should do it,” and Lance wrote, “I can’t on Tuesday because my aunt’s birthday,” and Karl wondered about the fruit. Crispin thought about six minutes of being observed by machines and thought of the way some rooms take your sound like a good listener and give it back to you twice, and the way other rooms take your sound and make it perform for a kind of glass. He thought of the joinery clock that had a tick he had been tapping with and the cost of stepping out of hours you can’t spare. He messaged Pam without the pride that would have made him wait a year ago and asked her to help him put the week into boxes. She wrote back, in the tone of a woman opening a drawer and finding exactly what she was looking for, that he could take the morning off if he gave it back on Thursday, and then she wrote, “Do the thing and stand like a person, not like an idea.” He said yes to Zoe and the yes sat in his chest like a coin that wanted to be change.

They went and the room was too white and the fruit was very good. A man with a headset asked them to be natural in a voice that would have killed anything natural within a ten-mile radius and a woman with a gentle face made them tea in mugs that had been chosen to look like someone had chosen them. The camera looked like a forked animal, two eyes with a brain behind a glass skull. They played the song and Zoe did the line about the weight and did not look directly into the camera like she was talking to a person behind it because she refused to flirt with a lens. Tom made his guitar glint in three places and then checked afterward if anyone had noticed. Karl kept it low like a promise. Lance did not swear when he dropped a stick; he had practiced the trick of losing the world and picking it up again quietly. Crispin did not aim for anything that was not in the room. He played the part ordered and specific and did not mess with time. When it was over the sound engineer, who had barbs for eyebrows and a hoodie with a hole in the cuff at the left thumb where a person had been nervous for years, said, “That was tidy,” in a tone that was almost a benediction. They left with a banana and their shoulders up an inch and the satisfying feeling of having done something that will be seen later by people who will think you were having your ordinary day.

Tom told them two weeks after that that he had been asked to stand in for a band that had been on a playlist and he said it like a person announcing they had been asked to house-sit a dog who lived in a more expensive area. He turned the word stand-in over in his mouth so that it meant what he needed it to mean. “It’s a bit,” he said, all breezy, like breezy wasn’t a hurricane if you lived under it. Zoe did not pre-empt him. She said, “Go,” in the exact tone a bus driver says, “All aboard,” and in saying it she made of his leaving a timetable instead of a tragedy. “We’ll be all right,” she added, and it was not bravado, and her mouth did the thing it does when she could bite a finger and instead uses the tooth on a phrase. Tom nodded, relief and terror making the right mix of colour in his cheeks, and in his gratitude he made a virtue of not telling them he had rehearsals that clashed with theirs and he exited like a man who had trained for exiting by imagining a future in which everyone applauded for reasons other than kindness.

They practised as four and felt like five in the best way because the missing space gave the notes room to lie down properly. Crispin took lines he would have been shy of taking and he did not use them to peacock; he used them the way a man uses a torch to show the way across a field without falling in a ditch. Zoe came closer to him in the songs, not physically necessarily, but in the weight she gave him, and he stood it because he had learned how. Lance found he liked the sound his snare made more when there wasn’t a second guitar scraping at its edges and he let the skin talk plain. Karl seemed taller though he was not, which is a thing that happens when a person’s sound is permitted to stand up straight. The new song found a bridge that was a different river than it had been when Tom had been there and nobody missed the old crossing because this one did not sway.

At the library Leah showed him a book of photographs of moths with their wings splayed, pinned and pitiful and gorgeous at the same time, and he hated the pins and loved the patterns and did not resolve the contradiction. “Some people love a thing by stopping it in time,” she said, not defending it, just telling the fact. “Some people love it by letting it do the opposite. I prefer alive, on balance, but if nobody made these pictures we would not know these exact greens exist.” He looked at one called Ghost Moth and thought of Zoe on a stage with her mouth at the exact distance from the mic where the air becomes part of the song. He looked at one called Black Arches and thought of the underside of the railway bridge where he had watched trains untie afternoons months ago like he had been a boy whose bones had not yet decided what to carry.

The council’s press officer asked if he could come and take a picture of the habitat pile with a child next to it and Hazel said, “Yes,” in the tone of a woman offering a guest a biscuit they will eat even if it is the last one. Liam stood there with his hands not in his pockets because he had been told, and the council man said, “That’s it, son, look at the log like it’s your future,” and Liam did a face that Leah would have wanted to put in a book called Expressions That Do The Work For You. Toby stood a little way back so as not to make the moment about him and because he was trying not to cry about a pile of rotting wood on a cold Tuesday. Pam accepted a laminated certificate that meant nothing and would be useful and she stored it where she stores such things: behind a row of mugs in a kitchen where plans were made.

February shook sleet off its coat and then pretended it had never owned a coat. The plumber-promoter put them on a bill with three other bands with names like wildlife and excuses, and they played second, which is the slot that makes the most sense if you are a band learning to stand up in rooms. The floor was sticky and the air made a thin shine on people’s skin and the monitor engineer was a dragon and sober and therefore extremely helpful. Zoe held the middle like it was a pole on a moving bus and she managed to bend without falling and you could see two people at the front lean forwards in the involuntary way audiences do when a song says, here, this bit, this bit is yours. Crispin put a new pattern in the verse that had been crawling round the edges of his head for a week and he felt it land exactly on the seam of the day. He wiped his borrowed guitar with the tea towel at the end because he was not done with respect and he hung around by the fire door with a water he would pretend was a beer if someone told his story wrong later, and he let the night air go into him and rearrange his list of priorities in a way that didn’t hurt.

On the bus home a girl asleep with her head on a boy’s shoulder did that involuntary twitch you do when you are about to fall off a cliff in a dream and the boy did not wake but his hand went up and steadied her head and nobody on the bus pretended not to see because to pretend would have been indecent. Crispin watched the town’s orange lights pretend to be planets and thought about how many small hands held how many small weights in the dark without anyone applauding and how the applause might actually ruin the carrying if you brought it into the room. He got off at Mrs. Greaves’s in time to see a fox’s back end disappear into the bins with an indignation that bespoke a life of disappointments and small, ugly joys. He laughed, and his laugh made fog.

Spring made a threatening gesture and then retreated, like a cat thinking about whether to come into a room. The first daffodil in Toby’s garden was a violent yellow that made him feel like a man who had just been told the truth after three months of politeness. He stood over it with a mug and told it not to get ahead of itself, and the daffodil ignored him because that is what daffodils have always done. Crispin put his palm to the earth and felt it softer in the top layer, like a promise has been made and signed by a day that hasn’t arrived yet. He did not look for larvae because they were not his to look at unless they decided to be viewed. He looked instead at the bamboo canes he had tied months back and found the blue string had held and that the knot he had chosen was not bad.

Hazel bought him a set of cheap chisels because she said a man cannot be expected to keep borrowing forever and because she had found a place online that had a sale and because she liked the idea of giving someone a thing that could both hurt them and make their future more likely. He unrolled them from their stiff canvas like they were tongues and he knew he would cut himself and he knew that did not make the gift wrong. He took one to the joinery to let the wire-glasses man criticise them and the man sniffed and said, “They’ll do until they don’t,” and then showed him how to sharpen properly because a tool that is only ever almost sharp will make a man lazy and then make a man hate himself for being lazy and that is an unkind loop.

Leah invited him to a talk at the museum where a man with a beard like a sensible storm spoke about the town’s chair heritage to an audience that included four teenagers who had been told to be there and were behaving about it, and a woman whose grandmother had woven rush seats until her thumbs refused and who was pretending she wasn’t crying because the talk wasn’t about her. He talked about labour and gender and he said the names of factories like an incantation and he had little slides of hands and tools and people, and Crispin sat and felt the pride in the room and the anger in the room and the affection in the room brushing up against each other like cats. The man said that wood remembers, which is the sort of sentence that can be misused but is sometimes simply true. After, Leah touched Crispin’s sleeve with a fingertip and said, “You’re making part of this that’s not the part anyone can see, and that’s as noble as the bit with a name,” and he did not know where to look so he looked at the display case with the brass sleeve for a chair leg that had saved a piece from splitting and he thought of the word sleeve and how good it is, a bit of cloth or metal that lets two things live.

The day Tom played his first proper gig with the other band, he sent Zoe a picture of his set list and a heart, and Zoe put her phone face down on the table and breathed like a woman who had just sat down after carrying something heavy through a room full of people. “Good,” she said to the air. “Good for him. Good for me. Good for us. Good for everything. If he comes back with a voice I don’t hate I’ll make him tea.” Crispin wanted to ask her if she was all right and then didn’t because you don’t ask a woman like Zoe if she is all right when she has just chosen to be; you make sure there is a lemon in the fridge and that the plectrums are in the place she says they are and that the amp leads are coiled in the way that makes the room proud of itself.

On the Friday after, they played in a room above a pub that had a ceiling so low Lance had to stand an inch lower than he liked and the door to the fire escape had been painted shut for ten years but had the decency not to advertise it. There were twenty people if you counted like an optimist and twelve if you counted like a liar. Leah came and stood at the back with her arms folded like a coat she wasn’t going to wear. Toby arrived late with cold in his hair and Hazel stood with him with her mouth arranged in that way that made rooms mind themselves. Liam leaned on the bar and pretended he didn’t have goosebumps because he was sixteen and his blood was a firework he did not require an audience for. They played the song with the weight in it and the air in the room did that thing a good room does when it respects you: it helped. There was a place in the song where Crispin’s hand should have been tired and it wasn’t, and he hit the pull-off that nobody will ever notice on the fourth bar the second time and he saw Leah notice because she knows the size of an important small thing, and it made him want to go outside and count the bins, which is his version of triumph.

After, a woman with hair the colour of the inside of a walnut came up and told Zoe she had a voice that had been out walking and come back with a truth and she said it with the generosity of someone who has heard a lot of lies. She looked at Crispin and said, “You don’t think we can hear you but we can,” in a way that was not about volume. He nodded because he did not have a better response and he took the compliment into his pocket with the card and the other card and the curl of beech and he let them all live there together like children who will not fight because they are paying attention to a game.

At home that night the under-floor lives were quiet in the particular way that means they are doing a lot and don’t have time to talk about it. He lay on the sofa and listened to the building tell the cold it would be allowed to sit in the corners but not on the chairs and he thought about things he had not put words to and decided not to find words for them yet. He felt the progression of days like a line along the river in the Rye again, but this time the line had bends he recognised and little side channels where you could stand with your ankles in the water and not be taken downstream. He slept with his hand flat on the tea towel, accidentally, because he had been polishing the guitar when he had become too tired to be polite to his body, and he woke with the smell of old cotton and lemon oil and the faintest suggestion of onions because the flat had cooked itself a stew of smells and was feeding everyone who walked in.

When the first proper warm day came—a liar, but persuasive—Toby put his boots on with a feeling like an old man remembering he can still run if someone is watching and Hazel took her coat off like a woman who has just stopped apologising for holding herself together. Liam brought out the bins in a T-shirt and cursed the way the sun had no warmth yet and then refused a jumper on principle. Pam turned up with a pad and wrote nothing and drank tea and told Toby that sometimes the thing you need to do is nothing and that is still a thing and if you need proof, look at soil. Crispin walked with Leah to the bridge where he’d watched the trains and the air smelled of creosote and sugar. A boy on a scooter went past with the exact confidence of someone who has never fallen and will. Leah laughed at a sentence she remembered she’d meant to tell him a month ago and told it anyway, and it was still good, and he made a note in his head about how some jokes age well because they were made of care and not timeliness.

They stood and the trains untied the afternoon one silver knot at a time, and Crispin found himself counting again, four, five, six, and then a different pattern nearer to the blood, and he tapped it on the rail and the rail took it and passed it into the town where it would be reused by people who would never know it was his and that was right. He thought of a beetle under a plank minding its own doctrine. He thought of a chair he hadn’t made yet and the person who would sit on it with a quarrel to relearn. He thought of Zoe with the bread knife she keeps in her mouth to stop the stupid happening in rooms. He thought of Karl’s humming and Lance’s politeness and Tom’s absence that wasn’t a hole any more. He thought of Mrs. Greaves’ hands on a mug and the way she can look at a boy and divine which cupboard he will climb into. He thought of Pam’s ladder that is ribs and ribs that are ladder. He thought of Hazel’s laugh arranging rooms and Toby’s apology taking up a chair it had needed. He thought of Liam’s little belt inside himself.

When they turned to go Leah touched the back of his hand with the front of her fingers and he didn’t make it anything it wasn’t and he didn’t pretend it was smaller than it was. He carried it up the hill like a piece of wood that needed two hands for now, and he put it on the table in his mind and thought, later, I’ll make the right shape around you, not to trap you, but to hold you so you can do your job.

That night a moth, actual, not metaphor, got into Mrs. Greaves’s kitchen and flapped itself senseless against the light before it tired and went to sit on the corner of the window, shaken and foolish. Crispin cupped it without skill and took it to the balcony and it made a soft noise against his palm that startled him, and then it lifted and went somewhere a moth would go, into the busy dark. He stood there a minute longer than necessary because he was listening, and he heard the town starting to become spring. It is quiet, the beginning of a season. It is all small hammers and tiny, organised appetites. He felt it in his own chest and in the bones of the building and in the string marks in his fingers, and he went to sleep with the odd certainty a person has sometimes at the end of a day like that—that he had not wasted anything by being exactly where he was, and that, in a month or two, something under the boards would put on its armour and walk out into the air for a short, necessary life, and he would be there to notice and to stay.The first warm Saturday that wasn’t really warm yet brought a market to the high street that behaved like a rehearsal for summer. You could tell by the way the stalls took liberties with their awnings and the way people carried their jackets over their arms as if to pretend the day had given them permission. Crispin walked through it with the particular lightness of a person who has errands he can afford and errands he can’t and can tell the difference for once. A woman at a table of secondhand books had arranged her stock by colour not subject and the reds made a little sermon on accidents. A man was selling honey with a photograph of himself grimacing in a beekeeper suit because he did not like helmets. He listened to the collective hum of a hundred transactions and heard there, in the undertone, the same thrumming that ran through a good rehearsal when everyone had agreed not to be a hero. Leah was at the end by the Methodist steps with a tote full of old maps and the look she got when people wanted something they couldn’t name. She tilted a black-and-white of the old station so the shine was kinder and said, “This is the only time you’re allowed to buy history,” to a boy who couldn’t believe anything without a bar code.

He had made her a thing in Mr. Blamey’s class that wasn’t quite anything; a little wooden stand that would hold a card upright or a photograph or a thought, a wedge of beech with a dignified slit. He had oiled it once and then again because sometimes someone deserves the second coat. He had sanded it until his fingers knew it without needing eyes. He didn’t give it to her in the market because the publicness would make the gesture a performance and he didn’t want to shrink it that way. After, on the bench outside the museum where they had discovered the chairs pretending to be art, he took the thing out of his tote and put it on the bench between them in the theatrical way and then did not say anything rehearsed. She looked at it and then at him and then ran her finger along the slit like a violinist checking a string, and then she took the old library card from her wallet that had been retired when the new barcodes arrived and she put it in the stand and the card leaned there like a person in a kitchen doorway and she said, “I like that you’ve made me a pause,” and he could have hugged the word pause for being exactly the right size.

At practice the room gave them back a little more of themselves than usual and they repaid it by not wasting time. Being four had given their arrangements bones you could see. Karl had stopped apologising with his shoulders and started apologising by playing lines you didn’t know you needed until they were gone. Lance had developed a way of checking his snare that felt affectionate, the heel of his hand on the skin like a mother to a forehead. Zoe handed out work with the briskness of grace. “We have two new ones and one that thinks it’s old,” she said, and she let herself laugh at her own sentence, which made them all braver. The song that had grown out of Pam’s phrase had found its pace, a walking pace that could turn into a run if you didn’t watch it, and Zoe cut it back exactly where a lesser band would have tried to impress a stranger and it worked because restraint has a smell and people respond to it. Crispin kept the pattern like a thread and put a single hammer-on under her last line, a tiny mechanical kindness, and she noticed without letting her eyes do it, which is to say, completely.

The council’s new letter about the floorboards coupled its warning with an apology that had been written by a person who had once meant an apology and now wrote them like poems. There would be a survey and then there would be a period during which access would be needed and then there might be treatment if necessary, and in the meantime residents were advised to be understanding. The word understanding was printed in bold as if thick ink could make a complicated thing simple. Mrs. Greaves read it out with the stress in the wrong places to make the letter feel sorry, and then she folded it in half crisply and told the wall, “We’ve understood worse,” and the wall offered no objection. Crispin did the thing he had learned: he breathed and then he went to Pam and Hazel and Toby because there are some sentences that should not be eaten alone. Pam took the letter out of his hand and put it on the table like a surgeon lays down a tool he has used before and Hazel rubbed the place between her eyes where either headaches or plans are born. “We’ll get ahead of it,” Hazel said. “We’ll move what they can poison somewhere they can’t be bothered to walk to. We’ll get someone proper to look at your joists because I don’t trust a scheme that brings tanks before ladders. And you,” she added, turning her radiating fairness on him, “will not spend the week listening for people in boots when you should be playing your guitar and earning ten pounds an hour letting a man call you lad.” He nodded because disobedience in Hazel’s kitchen would have been like humming in a church during the Eucharist.

Toby made the decision about the summer like a man testing water with his hand, ready to pull back and then ready not to. He told Crispin sitting on the back step of the Phoenix, his boots making that obliging creak that meant they were in a good mood. “I am going to go where hedges behave for a bit,” he said, and the words lifted like steam off the stones. “Haz says she will manage to miss me three days out of seven and on the other days she will be so relieved I am not under her elbows she will laugh at the kettle when it boils. Liam will help here and he will pretend it’s terrible and secretly feel his belt grow another hole tighter.” He looked at his hands, big, faithful things that have been asked to carry too much and had done it anyway. “I will bring back a feeling I can use,” he added, as if he were planning to smuggle it through customs in a bread roll. Crispin smiled and said, “Bring back a plant with a ridiculous Latin name and teach me to say it right,” and Toby’s answering grin was a boy’s. “I’ll bring you an entire Lapsana communis if you let me get away with it,” he said, and then he sighed like the sort of man who knows what he’s been given and what he’s giving up.

The joinery in spring was a different parish to the joinery in winter. The air stopped hanging by the clamp rack sucking its teeth and started going about its business again, and everybody’s back remembered how it felt to be only itself and not the weather too. The wire-glasses man made a tiny speech about sun and wood movement that was less a speech than a civics lesson for materials. “You love it when it opens,” he said. “Then you want to hate it when it opens too much. Don’t take it personally. You are not being betrayed by fibres. They are simply resuming their private lives.” Crispin liked the way that sentence made his own insides feel excused. He planed down the shoulder of a tenon that was proud and he ran his thumb across it to feel if truth had been achieved, not trusting his eyes because his eyes had the ego of a cat in good light. Mr. Blamey set him a right angle that looked wrong from one side and then right from the other and taught him to measure both, and his left hand stopped sulking and started behaving like an anchor and not an accessory.

Zoe went to London to sit on a low chair in a glass room for an hour and listen to a person talk about development as if it had been his idea. She wore the shirt that made her look like her arguments had a waist and she didn’t tell anyone she was going until after, because to do otherwise would have put the day into too many mouths. She came back on the late train with the face she wears when she has chosen not to tell the whole truth straight away for the good of the truth later. “They gave me water in a bottle like a tiny crisp packet,” she said, standing at the bar with her hands in her coat as if keeping them from hitting anyone. “They talked about songs as if they were dogs that might bite their children and I didn’t like the way their mouths moved when they said authenticity, like it had a garnish. I did not agree to anything I can’t swallow and I did not set fire to any bridges I might need to walk across with dry shoes. If they ask to see us all I will have a bigger mouth. For now we keep moving in the direction that doesn’t make us stupid.” Tom sent a message full of good advice he had learned in larger rooms and Zoe read it and did not argue because the advice had a little truth in it and a little vanity and it was not her job to disentangle his motive for him in front of everyone.

Leah’s course began to colonise her shelves in a way that pleased her. She had acquired a pair of cotton gloves with fingers that made you feel like a careful thief and she told him stories about the way documents breathe when their boxes are opened. “People think it’s all grand letters tied with ribbon,” she said, walking him to the bus with the ridiculous gloves in her bag as if they were contraband. “It’s shopping lists, and marginalia, and notes to plumbers, and the word please written in three hundred different handwritings. It makes me furious and tender at the same time because you can see when a person grows tired of themselves and keeps writing anyway.” He liked the way she made the idea of a life a thing you could file without suffocating it, and he liked even more the way she rolled her eyes at the stupid reverence that sometimes arrives with old paper like a perfume and lingers after the fact. He didn’t tell her that when she said the word marginalia he wanted to put his head down on a desk; he just let the sound sit in his chest and make neat stacks of something there.

The surveyors arrived in boots that had done real work and clipboards that made them look less human and more responsible. They knocked on doors that had been knocked on by all the other officials who had translated their days into measurements and left behind dates on paper. In the kitchen Crispin watched as a man with a pencil behind his ear put his head under the sink and rapped on wood with the kind of tenderness men pretend is not tenderness because the job would be harder if they admitted it. The man listened with his mouth open a little in concentration, and Crispin felt a flicker of fellowship because they were both people who listened to the way materials talk. “You’ve got friends under there,” the man said at last, half amused, half resigned. “And you’ve also got a joist that wants a word with somebody who has the authority to buy timber. We’ll shore it with sense first and prevent the heroics.” Hazel breezed in at that exact sentence with a tray and a plate of something that had the smell that makes meetings civilised and she said, “If we call that heroics again I’ll start charging extra for calling things by their theatrical names,” and everyone did the laugh that men and women do when they are grateful for a woman’s permission to stop performing to each other.

They decanted for two nights to a friend of Hazel’s who had a spare room that had once been an office and still had the earnest marks of extension leads where enthusiasm had run ahead of sockets. The bed was good and the window looked onto a tree that had done winter with good manners. He lay there the first night and missed the underfloor lives like you miss a person you had not realised had a voice that could keep you asleep, and then he paid attention to the way this house sounded and found in its radiators and its fridge and its neighbour’s late television a chord he could use. Mrs. Greaves did not call the temporary place a holiday because she did not like to glamourise a displacement. She tucked her purse under the spare pillow and told the pillow, “Behave,” and the pillow did. In the morning when they went back to fetch the post and a scarf and the appetite of a familiar kettle, the men had already put up a polite crime-scene of tape, and there were boards loose in a pattern that made sense to people who measure their days in inches. Crispin stood in the doorway and felt a small shout go through his bones at the absence of the house’s hum and then he folded the shout into something that could be carried home without frightening Mrs. Greaves. He carried the maternity of the thing, not the drama.

At the joinery that week he planed with a focus that turned into silence, and the wire-glasses man made him tea without comment and let him stay late to finish a line because sometimes what a person needs is the loan of a room in which to do their work until their house can do its job again. He made a stool top for a man who had requested it be “like the old one but better” which is the worst brief in all disciplines, and he did not lecture the man on how nostalgia and improvement don’t often shake hands; he simply made the seat a little softer at the corners and the rails a hair closer so that a person would sit and find their thighs approved of the chair, and he thought, appropriately, of Leah and the card stand and the way a small correction can be a gift that improves how a person holds their day.

Liam started to come on Tuesdays to help carry bins and to stand in a line of men who were pretending not to do a ritual. He grew shoulders you could see thinking about it. He had a face that was beginning to make decisions on its own. He told Crispin ridiculous fragments of school days in the tone of a journalist tired of his beat and then he told Crispin one thing that mattered and then he pretended not to have said it, in the sweet savage way of boys. He pointed out a beetle on the path that he would have trodden on a year ago and he didn’t and he said, “You’ve made me a person who looks down,” and left the admission there and went to fight a blue bin to the kerb. Crispin took that sentence home and put it in the pocket with the beech curl and the cards and he felt full in exactly the right way.

One evening at the Phoenix a man with a voice like kitchen tiles said he ran a tiny radio show for people who liked to hear songs before they knew whether they liked the bands, and he invited them in the laconic way of the sincerely shy. They went and the studio was a cupboard that had grown buttons and the radio smell was dust and warm cables and the engineer’s wool. Zoe sat in front of the microphone with the look of a woman who knows when to push air fast over a reed and when to keep breath in her chest. The red light did not bother her because she refused to let red lights be gods. They did two songs and the second was slow and the room, though it had no audience, behaved like a group of people had decided to be quiet together for as long as it took. The engineer, who had been burned by enthusiasm fifteen years ago and now measured praise in commas, looked up and said, “That’ll sit,” which is an accolade from that profession. Karl spent ten minutes after trying to explain to the engineer his theory about four-note loops and fate and the engineer took the thought politely and put it in a pocket to check later with his cat.

Tom sent a message to say he had played a place in Brighton where the sea did not soften a hangover and the soundman had looked like a priest, and he added above his usual quota of hearts because he was deciding whether to be sorry or grateful that he had left and needed to show up with something. Zoe sent him back a picture of the four of them in the radio cupboard with Lance’s snare leaning against the kettle and a single sentence about what they had done that was both informative and un‑needy, and Tom put his phone down on a crate in a room with mould along the skirting and he felt, for a useful minute, the weight and the lift of his luck.

He helped Leah move three streets over into a narrower room that made the light cut to fit and he carried boxes labelled Books and More Books and Folders and Something That Might Be Rubbish and he methodically ignored the titled box called Sentimentals because it is a cruelty to look into someone else’s sentimentals without invitation. Hannah had the kind of cupboards that remembered their carpenters and she had kept the plain wooden doors their makers had intended, and Crispin ran his hand along one and it hummed the right note. He put up a small shelf without drawing attention to it and when Leah said, “Did you do that without a level,” he said, “I did it with a level,” and showed her the app on his phone and she pretended to be disappointed in him for not eyeballing it like a romantic. They ate chips with vinegar on the floor with their knees up and Hannah told a story about an old woman in her archive who had written more letters than anyone had energy to read and then organised them by anger, joy, boredom, panic in a filing system nobody would replicate and everyone covertly admired. Leah put the wooden stand he had made on the sill with the new rent book propped in it as if to tell the universe a joke about adulthood, and he felt in his ribcage a sensible pride he wished he could keep in a jar and dispense to his friends in doses when they needed it.

The first stag beetle he saw that year was not under anything. It was in air, a male in ludicrous flight like a piece of old cutlery being carried by faith. It clattered against nothing and then found its way and then clattered again, too heavy and too determined to let physics have the last word. He was coming back from the shop with milk and a lemon and a packet of biscuits that would be offered and then eaten whether refused or not and he heard, before he saw, the wingbeat that sounds like someone attempting to unfasten an awkward coat. He stopped under the elder and watched it clear the wall and cross the air above Mrs. Greaves’s bins and head toward Toby’s new log pile with the seriousness of a messenger who has at last been given an address. He felt his mouth do that thing it did when he wanted to laugh and weep at once, and he closed it because the sound wasn’t for him to echo. Later, when Liam came round and pretended he hadn’t run because running is always both awful and necessary, he said, without preface, “They’re back,” and Liam looked relieved in a way he had not practised for.

In the room above the pub where the ceiling still thought it was the nineteenth century they tried out a new song that Lance had started counting in his head while watching the bus timetable and it had the same patience and the same late wickedness. It went the long way round to get somewhere simple and then it stayed there for longer than the instinct to show off would have allowed. Zoe played with her voice like a person learning to use a new tool without bleeding onto the work and she put a scrape in the second verse that made the hairs on Crispin’s arms pay attention. He played a second guitar line up the neck that would have been too much a few months ago and wasn’t now because the absence of Tom meant room and the practice of restraint meant what was left belonged. There was a woman in a red coat at the back who closed her eyes at the middle eight and a man near the front who didn’t and they experienced the same thing anyway, which was proof against a number of discouragements.

In the corner at home Mrs. Greaves had a day when her ankle asked her to sit more than her pride was prepared to accept, and she stood sitting and sat standing and told the kettle she did not have time for nonsense. He made soup that was really vegetables being flattered into believing they were more and he didn’t let himself make the soup a metaphor because some foods ought to be just foods. She ate and didn’t praise him and then, in an unguarded moment when her face forgot to protect itself, she said, “It’s a long time since I’ve been this well looked after,” and he looked away because praise like that is like sun through glass and you can get burnt if you stare.

Hazel began keeping a notebook of wildness like a person tracking a budget. She wrote down every time she saw a fox with an expression, every time a plant she had not planted turned up and made a convincing argument for its presence, every time a child in the estate played with a stick for longer than might be expected. She wrote in the dreadfully tidy hand of someone used to forms and then she doodled along the margin and the doodles were not tidy, and she brought the book round to Pam and they drank tea over it and pretended they were plotting only for pleasure when in fact their plotting had saved more than a few lives lately. Pam told Crispin to write a similar list only for sounds and he said he would and he did and the making of it changed the week. He wrote: the crackle after the amp is turned off and before anyone lifts a lead; the sound a spokeshave makes when the blade is almost but not quite right; the way the council man’s shoes sounded on lino; the call a boy makes when he pretends a bin is heavier than it is because he wants to be told he is strong; the first beetle that did not hit the wall.

A week after the survey they took up more boards, and for a day the flat was indecent and honest in equal measure. The men talked among themselves about timbers like they were talking about uncles they loved and resented, and one of them, younger, who had learned to hide his curiosity because that is what boys who want to be accepted do, asked Crispin about the strange tapping rhythms he’d been hearing on the stairs some nights, and Crispin said, “That’s just the building making notes to itself,” and the boy nodded as if Crispin had confirmed a theory. When the new wood went down it did that bright thing it does at first, reflecting more light and opinion than it will later, and then it learned the room and calmed and the under-sound returned not as it had been, but as itself plus change, which is the best you can ask.

At the joinery he finished the stool and the man with the brief that had made Crispin tired took the stool home and then the next day he came back with a face like a man who has discovered his dog sits when told and he put thirty quid down on the counter and said, “It sits me right,” in a way that meant the money was thanks not payment. The wire-glasses man looked over his specs at Crispin with the kind of approval that is the exact weight you can carry without tripping, and he said, “Next time I’ll let you cut the shoulder on your own,” and Crispin, to his own surprise, did not let his heart perform about it.

Zoe stood in his kitchen with her coat off and the wind in her hair and she read the council letter aloud for the third time as if the act of reading made it more tolerable and then she asked him if he wanted to go to London again to play four songs in a room that had a plant and a person who would watch them and nod like a verdict, and he said yes because saying yes to work is a muscle he was training. She looked around the room the way a woman who likes people looks around a room when she is checking the place someone sleeps, and she said, “I like how your house sounds,” which was something nobody had ever said to him and he wished he had the sort of memory that could record it with an ink that did not fade.

They went back to London and this time the train was late in a way that meant they arrived hungry and pretended not to be. The room had the same white as before but a different kettle and a better person in charge of chords, and they did the thing, and they left and walked across a bit of the city that didn’t know them and they let themselves be ignored. On the way home Zoe asked him what would be enough and he said he didn’t know and she said she didn’t either, but that she was beginning to think enough was a feeling not a number and she would try to notice it the day it turned up instead of filing a complaint after it had gone. He told her about the beech curl in his pocket and she told him about a dream she’d had where she sang into a jar and kept the sound for winter, and they sat with their heads tilted like birds on the train until the picture of their town arrived and put their shoulders back down.

The spring kept trying and then apologising and then trying again. The daffodils in Toby’s patch got tired in a way that was not sad and the tulips, when they came, were embarrassing and everyone forgave them. Liam left his hands out of his pockets more and put his thumbs into belt loops like a person who is beginning to oblige the shape of a man. Hazel kept a little aside in an envelope for when Toby would go because sometimes dealing with feelings requires coins and a train ticket and not a speech. Pam made a list for Crispin that began pay Mr. Blamey what you owe him this month and ended sit down for ten minutes and look at nothing and she put a dot next to each item and when he drew a line through them later it felt like being trusted.

The night the first female beetle surfaced in the garden they didn’t see her. That was right. She pushes up and makes her walk and keeps her head down. The next day there was a small hole in the soil near the log and Liam pointed at it with the reverence of an altar boy and Hazel said, “Leave it,” and Toby, whose hands were already on his knees like a man praying, said nothing for a whole minute and then straightened as if someone had pulled a string in his spine and said, in a voice you only get to use when you’ve been forgiven, “All right. All right,” and he went to get the watering can and filled it to a degree that was exact and watched the water go away from the hole with the restraint of a person who has learned at last where not to put his weight.

When June announced itself un-subtly on a Tuesday at two in the afternoon, the town smelt different and Crispin had to learn a new set of sounds for the windows open and the buses trying. The band had a set at a school fundraiser where the stage was a few pallets and the audience had their hands full of burgers and children and opinions, and it turned out to be one of the best rooms because rooms are about willingness and this one was full of it. They ended their closer with a run of notes that had appeared at soundcheck like a person you had never seen before but immediately loved, and when the clapping came up it felt like an exhale again, and he took his place behind Zoe, not behind in the sense of hiding, behind in the sense of structure, and he looked to his left and saw Leah with a face on that made the nonsense parts of his week go quiet, and he looked to his right and saw Pam standing with a clipboard she didn’t need and a coat she had chosen because it would behave, and he looked at the ground and saw his shoe next to the scuff he had made last year on the first day he had stood on a stage like this and he felt the plank under him approve, and that is not a metaphor, that is just the relationship between weight and material.

That night on the balcony the heat laid its hand on the town like a large aunt, affectionate and oppressive and full of advice. He stood with the tea towel in his hand because he tended to put it in his hand when his brain wanted to feel it had hold of something. Below, in the beautiful indecent privacy of the garden, a stag beetle took a mad lift off the old paving and the sound was absurd and perfect and he felt the bassline he had been looking for slot into place under his fingers and he tapped it on the rail quietly, two-three-one, rest, two-three-one, and the beetle barged into a paragraph of air and then carried on, and he said, not out loud, good luck, as if luck had anything to do with work that long, and he went inside and put his guitar on his knee and he did the pattern until his thumb was a metronome and his hand didn’t belong to him and the room gave him back what he gave it and then he slept, and under the floor the lives went on in their own time, and upstairs someone laughed so sincerely you wanted to forgive them, and across the way a couple argued in the polite way the first hot night brings out, and in his pocket the card with the ribs was becoming soft at the edges from handling and that, too, was a kind of use he trusted.
