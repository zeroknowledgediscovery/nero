The first time he saw the ducks gather in a serried line across Major Mackenzie Drive, King Ivor felt his chest hitch as if the world had slipped a gear. Four, maybe five, then a sixth—ragged brown bodies and black caps and those small wet eyes like unblinking coins—waddled across the crosswalk as if they owned it, as if they had drawn the paint themselves in the night. The motorcade paused, of course; drivers stopped, and children pressed their noses to fogged glass and cooed. His driver, a man with wrists like broomsticks, said, “Look at them, Your Majesty,” in the particular voice of a person talking to a child they expect to be charmed. Ivor watched the tight kink of neck where feather met air. He swallowed. He found the lamplight too thin.

“Please,” he said, though he wasn’t sure to whom he spoke. “Please go along.”

They went along. They always do, he supposed, one after the other on invisible rails. The headlines the next morning were kind for a very short time: a clip of the King’s startled face, a frame captured where one of the ducks paused to inspect its own reflection in the lens of a cyclist’s sunglasses. Richmond Hill’s King in Ducky Delay! The Weekend Sun pasted the word “Quack!” in three languages. Someone turned it into a looping video with a whistle sound that, if you played it, could not be gotten out of your head.

He lay in bed in the Old Pump House, which was not really old and not originally a pump house but what somebody long ago decided a pump house should look like if it were also a palace. A former municipal building with limewashed walls and a cupola that hided a rusted bell. He stared up at the cracked plaster where the shape of a lake had formed over years of damp. Where it should have soothed, the shape was a duck if he looked a tiny bit sideways. The bed creaked as he turned and turned. He had learned not to sleep near the window since a mallard once struck the glass and left a ghost of feathers, and he woke hearing—imagining—a small knock. Like someone seeking entry.

Not everybody was supportive. Why would they be? The myth of kings was built on fearing dragons, and dragons were extinct in Richmond Hill. Or at least reduced to rusty lawn ornaments and long brochures in the local historical society display case: DRAGON OF THE DON? Early Settlers’ Tales. His Comptroller, Ms. Leung, slid spreadsheets under his tea like traps. The mayor—a stout woman with stiff hair and hands that liked to count votes like rosary beads—told him in a committee voice that optics were difficult, Your Majesty, optics were not, ah, friendly.

“We have the Mill Pond Festival next week, you know?” she said. “Families come to see the, well, the waddlers. If there is going to be an unfortunate reaction, perhaps your presence would not be optimal.”

“Unfortunate reaction,” he echoed, tasting the dry paper of the phrase.

“It is a brand,” the Press Secretary, Dahlia Wren, told him on Tuesday. She wore entirely cream-colored clothing and smelled faintly of glue. “Your brand is approachable, civic, and ironically old-fashioned in a city of BMWs. We do not want ‘fear of domestic fowl’ to be a part of the brand. We want… resilience.”

“Resilience,” Ivor said. “I’m terribly good at reading things written on mugs. Resilience, then.”

He did not tell them that he had tried, on nights when he was brave or drunk, to approach the edge of the pond and stand with the men in long coats throwing crusts at the water. He did not tell them that his palms went slick when a duck looked up, that the black bead of its pupil seemed entirely too knowing. He did not tell them about the time during a ribbon-cutting at Gormley that a goose, not even a duck, a goose—the vulgar cousin—flapped across the grass and the sound of its wings filled his head like the inside of a drum. He had gone behind a portable toilet and put his forehead on the plastic wall and breathed until he could hear the vowels in his own name again. He kept these things. He rolled them like marbles in his coat pocket.

“Let’s get you back out on the course,” suggested his brother-in-law, Felix Thatcher, who was neither blood relation nor titled but had an irritating smile and made a lot of decisions, usually on the golf course. “When my father got the shakes, he took up chipping. I swear, smooths you out like planing wood. You can’t think about geese if you want to get up-and-down from the fringe.”

Ivor had always swung a club like a person trying to row to an island. He liked the walking more than the hitting, the knit of the course over the land, the way trees bent to it and how water was included as if the architects could not deny what was already there. The land had been used as a farm, then a road, then a golf course, and beneath all that lay an older path where deer once had crossed to drink. He could feel it if he closed his eyes, the twitchy grace in the dirt. But the water. The water housed certain citizens he did not wish to engage.

Copper Beech Links sat in a shallow bowl north of Seven where the river’s arm hung its wrist in a series of manufactured ponds. The clubhouse was unpretentious, a scab of brick and window and a porch from which you could see the ninth fairway curl like a green tongue. The head pro was a handsome woman named Kristina who wore mirrored shades and said “We’ll get the King sorted” as if sorting were also a golf term. She assigned him, with a flourish, to the care of someone she called the best walker on the property.

The caddy arrived wearing a cap with a cracked brim and shoes that showed the white ghost where the leather flexed over toe and back again. They were not as young as Ivor first thought, nor as old. They had the sort of face that contained several ages at once, a frank brow, a mouth that seemed to be measuring the distance between foolishness and mercy. The name on the slip said Avery.

“Your Majesty,” Avery said, then blinked at the title as if it had arrived without warning. “I’ll carry. You’ll walk. The ducks will not be invited.”

“How can we avoid them?” asked Ivor. “They are everywhere. It is their ridiculous gift.”

“It’s early season. They like the low holes. They like the fat men who feed them pretzels. We’ll go high.”

“High,” said Ivor, who liked the simple geometry of that.

They started on the back nine, where the fairways weaved between young pine, so new that rope still held some trunks to stakes. The sky was a soft metal blue. The air smelled like the inside of a mouth. Ivor’s hands were too clean; he rubbed them on his slacks and watched a hawk make a small circle in the beyond.

“Tell me if you need to stop, Your Majesty,” Avery said. “It’s just yards. One yard, another yard. You move your feet this way and at the end there is a hole and a flag and then the snack bar with the frozen lemonade. Life is a series of snack bars.”

“Is that your philosophy?” Ivor said. “It is mild.”

“I save the spicy stuff for weddings,” Avery said. “Do you play alone often?”

“Not often. Felix says it makes a man. Playing alone. But then he shows up with three investment bankers and calls it a foursome, so perhaps he meant something else.”

“Investment bankers do cluster,” Avery offered, as they crested a hill and saw the pin at eleven tucked behind a bunker like a secret.

They talked enough and not too much. It was the peculiar gift of caddies, he thought, to set the temperature of conversation with an accuracy better than meteorologists. Avery spoke about the school where their sister taught Grade Four, about a raccoon that had recently thrown a party in the garbage corral behind the community centre. When Ivor said, out of the side of his mouth without preface, “They look, you know,” Avery did not pretend not to understand.

“Ducks?” they said. “Sure. They look. Everything looks. I once saw a bichon frise make a moral assessment of a man’s shoes.”

“I try to be brave,” the King said.

“I know.”

He discovered, slowly, that they did. Avery had a way of directing his attention that was not unlike having his chin held lightly by two fingers and turned toward a better window. “See how the grass is darker there—thicker—don’t land in that.” Or: “Your hands are a little wild before you begin. Let them settle. Your clubs are not going anywhere without you.” Or, on the seventh day, when clouds at the horizon were heavy as bread dough and they finally came upon a pond like a blind deity: “Eyes on me, Your Majesty. The pond is none of our business.”

He tried to look only at their face, the notch where jaw met ear, the way their eyes changed color in different pieces of sky. He listened to the wet thock of balls in the rough. He breathed. He did not see, or tried not to, the skitter of shapes on the edge of his sight. When a mallard cut across their path, purposeful as a duchess, Avery made a little show of bowing and then stepping aside as if it were a person walking a small invisible dog.

Dahlia Wren came once, in a cream suit, to take photographs of the King in repose, thoughtful, nonchalant, post-anxiety. The lens softened him as it always did, made the nose a little better than it was, the ears less prominent. In one of the images, a duck was present in distant background, just a smear of movement, inoffensive. The internet found it anyway and circled it with red. Quacktrackers, they called themselves. They posted maps of duck sightings with arrows pointing to where the King had been that day. There were diagrams. There were jokes. People made magnets. People did what people do.

“I could abdicate,” he said to his aunt Mirabel on a heavy afternoon when the rain came down with theatrical sincerity and made the windows of the Pump House into sheets of gray tissue. Aunt Mirabel lifted the kettle with two hands and poured with a level gaze. She had been the conscience of the family since his mother died—a hawk in a sweater with the tranquil ferocity of a person who knew where every mourning suit was stored, who remembered who liked marmalade and who did not.

“You were elected,” she reminded him. “By accident, yes, and probably as a prank by at least three high schoolers, but the fact remains. You cannot leave a crown on a park bench because it gives you a headache.”

“I’m not frightened of crowns.”

“Ah,” she said. She set down the kettle. “You hate being tender in public, Ivor. But that is the job. You must be as ridiculous and ruined as the rest of us and do it with a hat on. Also, the ducks mean you no harm. They are only as significant as you make them. The trouble is we put everything in the wrong frames.”

“Perhaps I should frame them in bread,” he said, which was unkind, and Aunt Mirabel did not laugh.

He had no queen. He had had a person once, a woman from the archives with a laugh like a bicycle bell, but she had wanted to move to Guelph and grow strange cucumbers and be far from the literal and figurative pond, and he had been too slow to go with her. He had not mended, not really, but he had learned to speak to the cranky machines of government. He approved budgets. He kissed babies. He acquired a caddy.

“You are better than you think,” Avery told him, and though they were speaking about golf Ivor let the sentence bind itself to other things.

Avery’s life stayed mostly in his peripheral vision, which is where many true things reside. He knew they rented a room above a bakery where the smell was both comforting and did not allow one to forget hunger. He knew they took the bus and had memorized the pattern of graffiti on the wall as the route turned by the cemetery. He knew they carried a pencil behind the ear and sometimes forgot and three hours later discovered themselves wearing a second ear because the pencil had painted a shadow line on their skin. He knew they had loved someone once who had left for Thunder Bay to be a poet, and that Avery did not in fact resent the poet, only the Bay, as if it were a person.

On a morning stitched together with fog, they turned the corner into the fourteenth and nearly walked into the great floating congregation. The pond was full, busy—heads bobbing with the improbable buoyancy of little boats, webbed feet making subsea scribbles. The air carried that particular gamey sweetness like wet bread stored in a wool coat. Ivor’s heart jumped a half bar. He felt, reflexively, for the lamppost that was not there.

Avery stepped in front of him as if blocking a wind. “Hey. Hey. Eyes on me.”

“I am ridiculous,” Ivor said. He was foundering in some old shallow, a memory of being small and at the zoo and a duck that climbed onto his shoe as if vandalizing a monument.

“Maybe,” Avery said, with kindness. “But not alone.”

He laughed then, a noise skewed out of him sideways, and discovered that if he took one step and then another the path, quite literally, continued. The ducks did not stop, did not issue any proclamations, did not mutter slurs in duck language. They did what they were asked to do by water. They floated. A woman on the opposite bank threw bread against a sign that said DO NOT FEED, PLEASE. A child clapped. On the farthest edge, the reeds bent in the breeze as if whispering. If he let himself, he could think of reeds as throat. He did not let himself. He walked.

“You play,” Avery said gently, handing him a club. “The rest will take care of itself.”

When he struck the ball, poorly, it skipped off the turf and then whumped into the grass in such a way that it made them both laugh. Somehow the laugh pushed the pond for a second out of the frame. The ball could be retrieved. Hands could be corrected. Stories could be told again differently. He took another swing.

On days he was not on the course he was in rooms. The mayor held an impromptu forum in which citizens could tell him how they felt. They brought notes. They brought their children. A man with a shaved head and a shirt that said DEBTS ARE A MYTH shouted about paving stones. A woman with hair like an erupting flower pressed a petition on him about the small fenced-in park where dogs now ran free, terrorizing toddlers and geese alike. “We need a no-goose zone,” she told him, and he thought I am not the man to campaign for this. A teenager named Kian, face appled with acne, spoke too quickly about how he’d been laughed at in the hallway in September because he brought a Star Trek lunch box to Grade 11, and he wanted the King to ban cruelty. “I could sign a decree,” Ivor said, to soothing giggles, and the boy straightened a little like a sapling propped. After, Dahlia hissed, “That was good. You made him a cup of tea with your eyes,” and he told her he would have made him actual tea if the room had a kettle.

Rumors, the currency he both dreaded and relied on, began to arrive in little envelopes. He heard that someone organized a jazzy march: a dozen people in yellow beaks and fins hopping across the intersection by the town clock, singing “We all float down here,” which made no sense and yet meant something. He heard that the Town Council, which had installed him ceremonially when they reconfigured the municipal charter in a fit of charming eccentricity twelve years ago, was taking a straw poll on the question of reducing his duties to ribbon cutting and small speechifying, removing his oversight of the parks. “They think you’ll close the ponds,” Dahlia said. She said this as if it were both an accusation and a riddle.

“As if I would,” he said.

“Would you?”

He could not answer. In the mornings, he found himself staring at the map of the greenspaces on his wall, the small blue kidney-shaped pods that indicated water features, as if he could set a teacup down over them and flatten them into nothing. The map was a language that had no words for fear. He was supposed to be better than fear. He was supposed to be better.

Avery began to bring decoys to practice. Not actual duck decoys, which would have sent him off the edge, but odd substitutes. “This is Brenda,” they said one day, producing from their bag a rubber chicken the size of a child’s arm and setting it near the practice green. “You will concentrate while Brenda eyeballs you with her terrifying emptiness.” He found himself grinning against his will. On another day they gave him a small statue of a penguin with chips along the base and told him to mark his ball with it. It was ridiculous. He marked his ball with the penguin and holed a ten-footer.

“How did you learn this?” he asked.

“Learn what?”

“The art of stepping around what hurts without pretending it isn’t there.”

They shrugged. “I watched my father laugh at an empty chair for six months, until we could say my mother’s name again.”

“I’m sorry,” he said, and Avery nodded, the way people do when they have accepted all the sorries there are and can carry no more of them.

In the bakery below Avery’s room, a girl with hair dyed axolotl pink sometimes gave him free biscotti, and once he saw Avery watch her as they waited for coffee, their mouth propped slightly open in a shape that meant: oh. He filed that away, not as strategy or story, but as a tender fact. He did not know the girl yet. He would, later. He would know her name was Jun Mosseri and that she was saving money to open a pottery studio with a kiln the size of a rental car. He would know that she had been a gymnast and now wore her balance close to her body like a jewel you couldn’t see. Not yet. Now there was only a quick glance and Avery’s hands forgetting themselves and sliding into and out of the pockets of their jacket as if trying to determine whether they were where they belonged.

“Don’t burn your mouth,” Avery told him one afternoon, handing him a coffee along with a napkin without meaning to. They couldn’t help themselves; they were made of small, useful gestures.

“I have trained my mouth to accept all temperatures,” he said. The coffee was, in fact, very hot. He burned his tongue, and Avery put a hand on his wrist and said “Drink water,” and he did, though he didn’t need to.

They were moving toward the day from which there would be no returning, but of course none of them knew that. They moved as we all move. He proposed, guardedly, that they spend the Mill Pond Festival morning at Copper Beech rather than near any actual fowl. Dahlia engineered a schedule in which he was meant to wave from a boat at eleven; he cut the ribbon, he seeped out of the back of a tent and his driver drove him, via side streets and a complicated baked-casserole of traffic, up to the course, and there Avery was, all anchoring.

The morning at the pond went almost perfectly wrong. He arrived, in suit, in crown that always felt a bit like a practical joke that had gotten out of hand, to find the paddlers. Children in life jackets like orange segments. Parents with cameras. Volunteers in T-shirts that said WATER WATER EVERYWHERE. He stood on the little dock. The mayor made a speech, which was in essence a pie crust, all crust and air and everyone smiling because their mouths were busy being used. Then Aunt Mirabel said a few words that were softer and went further, about the first year at the Pump House when the pipes froze and they all learned to boil snow. And then it was his turn, and he said truthfully, “This is beautiful,” which it was. The water was shivering with tiny uncountable thoughts. He aimed himself at an exit.

“Wait,” said a woman with a microphone. “We just want a shot with the swans.”

“Swans?” he repeated, which comes out like a sigh and a cough.

“They are in costume,” the woman said, and Ivor looked and what he saw were two adults dressed in white tulle and foam heads, attempting to be the swans of entertainment, and yet all he could see was the beak. He said, “Of course,” and stepped back, and the swan in costume stepped forward, misjudged the gradation of dock to water, and fell with a small, dignified splash. The crowd made the oh noise. The second swan, either out of loyalty or panic, leaned in to assist and also slipped. The water accepted them.

If the clip of him watching a duck cross the road had been generous, this one was not. It looked as if he had punched a swan. The internet said he had kicked it. Frame by frame analysis appeared on a site with quacking animated at the margins. He could feel the air leave the room where Dahlia pulled at her hair and said words that were not parliamentary. The mayor’s mouth pressed into itself so hard Ivor worried she would no longer be able to open it. Aunt Mirabel looked at him with a mixture of amusement and pity. “You could not have written that,” she said. “You are not that good.”

He got in the car and told Luis, his driver, to take him to Copper Beech. He wanted the specific smell of cut grass, the ease of distances on a card, the permission the course gave to think whilst moving. He also—he could admit it to himself—wanted Avery’s particular arrangement of face and voice that made it possible to be the wrong size in public and not die of it.

It was late afternoon, the sun like a disc of peeled fruit. He put on shoes with soft spikes like tiny teeth. He told Avery nothing about the swans; they had already heard, of course. The course keeps its own rumors.

“Hold the club like you’re holding something you want to break but know you shouldn’t,” Avery said. “Or like an egg, if you were a less honest person.”

“I watched a swan drown two clowns,” he said. He surprised himself by laughing. It was either laugh or step past a line no one would see.

Avery’s mouth quirked. “Then you have innovated in the genre. Breathe. Let the air come out. No one who loves you is sitting on the internet counting frames.”

“Do people who love me exist?”

“Yes.”

“Name three.”

“Aunt Mirabel. The girl in Saskatoon who writes you letters about her hamsters. And, well. Me, a bit. In a platonic, payroll-adjacent sense.”

“Payroll-adjacent love is still love,” he said, and the way the word love hung there made them both look at the grass.

He hit balls into a net that had collected over the season a soft geometry of failure. On the second hole a goose watched, bored, and Avery stood in such a way that if Ivor allowed himself to only watch the line of their shoulder, where the shirt bunched slightly, he could pretend nothing existed beyond the frame. He played as if there were a prize for playing without thinking about footage.

“Do you ever think about—” he began, and then realized he was about to say death, which was not, even in a monarchy built out of whim, the conversation to make on a par four. “Do you ever think about that thing where you feel you’re being observed?”

“Anatidaephobia,” Avery said.

“What?”

“The fear that somewhere, a duck is watching you. I looked it up. It’s not a clinical term. You’re safe from diagnoses.”

“How did you know what I meant?”

“Because you make the same face when you find a duck and when you find yourself.”

They had stopped without meeting eyes. A breeze came. There was the tin clink, from somewhere, of a flagpole chain against metal. He saw, in Avery's cap, a tiny map of the course stitched in green thread, a silliness that made him want to sit down in the fairway and sleep.

“Thank you,” he said, because there wasn’t a gift he could reciprocate with of equal weight, and Avery shrugged it off like a scarf.

More days. He carried his small crown more lightly, as if it were a hat, not a commandment. He went to the fishmonger and asked absurdly serious questions about smoked trout. He visited the art class where a child had molded a tiny vessel from clay and written on the side in lumpen letters: KING CUP. He bought three and drank coffee out of one and kept one on his desk at the Pump House where he put paper clips in it and looked down at it fondly as if it were a pet. He sat in the audience while a choir made of retired librarians sang a madrigal that sounded like bees arranged in order. He began, to his surprise, to sleep. Not long. Enough.

And then, one evening when the world was still soft with the end of summer and the nasty acids had not yet begun to pool in the corners of everything, he walked with Avery off the course toward the parking lot and they passed the fairway where a crew of teenagers were setting up for a moonlight tournament. Someone had strung lights between two pines. Someone had set a table with paper cups and a jar of fireflies. And there, in the middle of the scramble, in a short denim dress and ridiculous boots, hair up in a quick, confident knot, was the bakery girl. Jun.

Avery’s breath changed beside him, a hitch that was not fear. The way people do when their eyes find a thing their eyes have been braced for without knowing. Ivor noticed the way their jaw relaxed, then went still, like the moment before a ball drops into a cup. He thought of a string, invisible and quick, thrown from one person to another with the accuracy of children who have been playing this game forever.

“You know her?” he asked, keeping his voice as unlaced as possible.

“We’ve—she works below my place,” Avery said. “Sometimes there is biscotti. Sometimes there is… nothing and I invent elaborate pastries in my head. That is her.”

Jun looked up and laughed at something the person beside her said, and it was the sound of something bright falling. Avery did not move. Ivor, perhaps because he carried a crown in invisible pockets and could therefore do odd things with less required explanation, lifted a hand.

“Hey,” he called. “Excuse me—”

Jun turned. Her gaze hit him and then moved quickly, more interested in the human being in a cap who was suddenly not breathing beside him. “Your Majesty,” she said with a grin that did not manage to be obsequious even though it contained the correct amount of deference to municipal portraiture, “need a ninth for glow-in-the-dark mini-trounce?”

“Avery does,” he said at once, and saw, in his caddy, a flicker of terror equal to any pond. Avery looked as if he had placed them at the lip of a cliff and spoken casually about paragliding. “I don’t—” Avery began, and Jun tipped her head.

“Come on,” she said. “It’s only walking and hitting things. The rest is sugar on sticks.”

They went. He watched them go as if he were the aunt. He watched the light fold itself against them. He thought of how an ordinary night could turn itself around a new hinge. He felt the oddest sensation, a thread loosening at his throat. Some knot there had been tying his kingship to his loneliness. Watching them laugh, he felt a sabot slip out from behind his heart. He sat on the bench by the bag drop and pretended to check his phone. Dahlia had texted him: SWANS TRENDING. Please stop being yourself. He put the phone face down and looked at the sky where the small early stars had the sincerity of pins.

Avery hit poorly for three holes, which he could tell from here because their body language had a rickrack to it, small zigzags of self-reproach. Jun put a hand on their arm and said something. Avery's shoulders escaped their ears. On the fifth hole, he heard it, the sound of a small success made funnier by thoughtless physics: the chunk of club hitting ball and the brighter tick of ball hitting something else and then the whoops of a gang of teenagers too thrilled by the night to notice who they were. That sound, like the opening of a gate. He knew it because he had heard it when he signed his name under certain decisions and was not killed for it.

“Good?” Jun called across the grass, cupping her hands, and he did the thing he didn’t like doing and cupped back and yelled, “Very,” and had the thought, so handmade and foolish that he was almost ashamed: maybe this will save me.

On the drive back to the Pump House, he put his forehead briefly to the cool glass of the car window and let their voices wash through him, the way he heard them in pieces from the course. He did not know how this would go, not yet. He only knew that when Avery sat with him the next morning on a bench by the practice green and drank coffee in companionable, not quite shared silence, their mouth kept forgetting not to smile, and this made the ground seem less full of holes.

The gossip improved, if only because people love a romance and monarchies love them more. “The King’s caddy is dating the Pink Girl from the bakery,” said a headline in one of the papers that had never been sure if he was a mascot or a threat. A video of Jun balancing a breadboard on one palm and feeding six teenagers in under a minute went small-time viral. Dahlia gave up trying to keep him off the internet, at least for the week. Aunt Mirabel invited them both for dinner and burnt the fish and nobody minded.

He did not notice, then, that the path from this glad error bent, later, toward a cliff. He did not notice danger. He noticed only that no one asked him to stand with a swan. He noticed that the course was filled with migrating light. He noticed that when he stood by the pond and breathed, he could name three colors in the water without flinching. He noticed that Avery walked a half-step closer than before, as if some precise shepherd had been replaced in their spine with a softer version. He noticed that people stopped saying Quack quite so often—only sometimes, the cruel lyric bent, folded into other words under breath.

He made a little speech at a school and did not stumble. He visited the shelter where there was a duck rescued from a storm storm-stupid and acting as if it were in a different story entirely, and he watched a girl put a towel around it and tuck its head under its wing and move with a kindness like a science. He thought: I have been a fool in front of strangers and the world did not stop spinning. He thought: I am being watched at all times. Not just by ducks. Possibly by love.

“Tomorrow,” Avery said, after one of those games where nothing went right and then everything went right and it was impossible to tell what had changed except everything, “tomorrow I might not be able to make it. There is a thing.”

“A thing?” he echoed.

“Jun,” they said, and he saw their face inventing, shyly, the future tense.

He wanted to bless them. He wanted to knight them with his club. He wanted to say: you get to be as stupid and hopeful as the rest of us. He settled for, “Then I will reserve the practice green for you anyway, for when you return. It will wait. It will sulk in your absence. The holes are jealous creatures.”

“Thank you,” they said, and Ivor thought of the strange arc of fortunes: how sometimes they improve not because you solved a problem with your hands but because someone you love found a door and walked through it into better light. He went back to the Pump House and tried to remember the last time he had felt that the sound inside his ribs was a drum and not a warning.

At night he dreamed, not of ducks, but of a field of small people carrying candles and writing new laws on paper that was soft and caught fire easily. He woke to rain. He woke to the bell in the cupola having decided, after years of retirement, to ring once. He woke, thinking, salt in his mouth, that he was not alone in the story. He woke—if such a thing can be said in a place where the sky is like milk poured from a distance—and he put his crown in his pocket and went walking. He went to the course even though it was wet as thought. The path made its own decisions, it always did. Beyond the fence, at the edge of the driving range, a single gull scolded the air for existing.

He stood near the pond and did not move when a duck came close, did not bolt as the humorists expected him to, this time, this once. “All right,” he told the small wet thing that only wanted the bread someone had promised it. “All right.”

He could not know what day the cliff would make itself visible. He only knew that for now the ground held, which was more than he'd had last week, more, even, than he’d had yesterday. He knew that Avery would be late and then not show and would text him a heart that looked like lips and the word sorry and the words later maybe, and that he did not, as he might have once, panic. The world had a knot he could now locate with his tongue. He tied it. He breathed. He waited on the bench in the fine, careful rain and watched the surface of the water stipple, which was, from a certain angle, just another kind of writing. He read what he could. He did not, for this small divine minute, find himself in the frame. He laughed at nothing. The day did not take it back.The memorandum arrived on pale paper made to look as if it had been designed by someone with cheerful expertise in both birds and fonts. The header read Waterfowl Management Strategy and under it, in smaller, friendlier type, Protecting Our Shared Spaces. Ms. Leung placed it on top of his toast with the precision of a dealer laying down a card and stood with her hands folded as if she were wearing invisible gloves. He had learned to study the subtext of her placement. A single sheet slid under a cup meant urgency. A manila folder beside his plate meant inconvenience disguised as choice. A stack, as today, meant a procedural storm.

He lifted the first page and the phrases cut their small grooves at once. Targeted Avian Discouragement Infrastructure. Vegetative Barriers to Shoreline Access. Urban Wildlife Harmony Toolkit. There were sketches of discreet fences like skeleton smiles and a list of plantings with names so gentle as to be indictments: creeping something, whispering something else. As he read he could feel a certain part of his mind begin to rearrange itself in the cupboard of his skull where policy lived, counting forks, planning. The other part, the irresponsible part he hoped to keep, wanted to draw tiny hats on all the ducks in the margin and give them clipboards. He put the papers down and found he had also put down his appetite.

“The phrase ‘personal aversion’ appears three times,” Ms. Leung said, with her reliable gift for dropping needles. “There is a motion to reassign oversight of the parks to the Committee for Infrastructure, which is to say to men with stacks of catalogs for tractor attachments. The vote is in five days.”

“I would like,” he said, after a shallow practice breath, “to live in a city without tractor attachments.”

She did not smile. She was not hired for that. “Dahlia suggests a listening session. I suggest you know how to read what is between the lines as well as on them. The mayor is sympathetic but cannot publicly be so without losing her right arm. Your brother-in-law is in favor of whatever gets him on television with a hat that looks like work.”

“I will plan my hat,” he said, and she allowed the one-degree tilt of her mouth that meant she was glad he was not entirely adrift.

The listening session was scheduled on a Tuesday in the multipurpose room of the Heritage Centre where the chairs were soft with boredom and the carpet smelled faintly of lost umbrellas. Dahlia arrived with a binder and a scarf the color of an apology and said they must be realistic but not defeatist, warm without sweat, available without being licked. He could never tell which parts of her advice belonged to rhetoric and which to dogs. “We plant you at a lectern,” she said, and tapped a page with her pen as if pinning a butterfly. “You invite stories. You restate concerns into palatable shape. You pivot to resilience as if it were the punchline to a joke only nice people find funny.”

“Aunt Mirabel would tell me to bring biscuits,” he said, and Dahlia looked at him in despair.

“She would be right,” Dahlia said, and then she did the unthinkable, which was to place one soft palm on the back of his hand for the length of a breath, as if he were a thermostat that could be adjusted by touch.

He had letters, of course. He always had letters, thick with felt-tip souls, scented with kitchens. One lay by his pillow unopened because he was rationing it, a letter from Saskatoon with a hamster sticker sealing the envelope. The girl wrote to him monthly about her political development and her rodents’ tooth wear and the particular friendliness of prairie skies. He opened this one in the small privacy of the noon while Dahlia took a phone call in the hallway and Ms. Leung lined up columns that would punish him later. Dear King, she wrote, someone in my class said that hamsters have no thoughts, and I told them that thoughts do not require vocabulary. I told them that the king did not think in duck noises just because ducks were in his head. She had drawn a picture of a hamster with a crown too large for its skull and underneath in shaky capitals the sentence YOU CAN BE SCARED AND STILL BE IN CHARGE. He did not put this on the internet. He put it in his pocket as if it were a passport.

Between the memorandum and the session there were days like beadwork. He walked at Copper Beech when the ground held light just above its skin as if undecided whether to soak it in or let it go. Avery did not come two mornings in a row, then arrived with a grin that was more like a confession than a mask. With Jun, their hands did new things with air, drawing parentheses when they spoke, opening and closing like a pair of quotation marks around sentences that did not require permission. He watched them for the minute kindness he always watched people for, and he was ashamed for how much he relaxed when it showed itself. Jun had begun arriving at the course with a small plastic container of pastries decorated in ways that suggested she trusted beauty even when it was wasted on hunger. One day there were small buns washed with egg and sprinkled with sugar in the shape of crowns with dents where jewels would be if he were the sort of person who wore jewels without shame. He ate one and had sugar on the side of his lip for hours and no one told him.

Kristina the head pro watched him practise as if she were a scientist with an affectionate stake in a faulty machine. “Loose hands,” she said, and he attempted a looseness that did not imply collapsing into the nearest shrub. “There is a rumor,” she added, as casually as if they were friendly birds, “that a developer wants the back nine.”

He swung at a ball that might as well have been a thought. “The back nine what?”

“The back nine holes. The company is called Evergreen Works. They propose a cluster of townhouses with artisan rain chains and a community-pocket pond, which is a fake pond inside a fake community, and a boutique daycare with a name like Little Oaks. They say the course doesn’t pay. They say the water birds will be managed by a service that brings a dog to frighten them politely.”

He rested the club against his thigh and forced himself to imagine the phrase boutique daycare printed on a banner where he wanted the sky to be. His hand found the picture of the hamster in his pocket and pressed. “Do they say what they’ll do with Kristina?”

“They haven’t got as far as me,” she said, and adjusted her mirrored shades as if they were her plan.

He tried to imagine Avery not carrying his bag on land stitched to his gain. He tried, quickly and then more slowly, to imagine a Richmond Hill without water in the grass where water had always wanted to be. The vision did not attach. It slid off his eyes like egg off a pan. “We are not a place that punishes our own lungs,” he said, which was not a policy and would not hold in a meeting but was the only truth he had.

The listening session summoned a particular kind of citizen who believes that speech, like soup, must be served while hot. A woman in a jacket knitted from her municipal opinions stood and described in detail how her child had been menaced by a gander with a career in wrestling, and everyone nodded solemnly as if the gander had indeed trained under a coach. A man with a sobbing moustache declared that bread had become the enemy of the people and that anyone at the pond caught with a slice of Wonder should be fined fifty dollars or made to eat their own loaf, and the room hummed with strange laughter. Kian from Grade 11 sat very straight and said with gallantry that he believed the King should be allowed to be a person and that he, Kian, had decided to stop wearing the Star Trek lunchbox after all because sometimes it is not bravery to insist on a thing, it is stubbornness, and his peanut butter sandwiches were now in a normal bag. There was applause for this nonsense because there was love in it.

When it was his turn he knew to say what Dahlia had taught him: this is our home, we manage it together, we will protect our ponds as we protect our sidewalks, no one will be fined for sandwiches. He also said something that was not in the binder, because he could not help it, because his mouth had finally found a tiny path carved by bravery and he must try to follow it. “I am afraid of ducks,” he said, as if this were a confession to a priest he did not entirely recognize. “I am also capable of being more than my fear. Please do not take away my work because of a problem I am trying to carry around like a hot cup. Let me burn my hands a little. Let me learn to hold this without spilling it on you.”

Silence does particular things when it is not fear anymore. It becomes space, and space allows rearrangement. The mayor solemnly made a note of something that was probably not what he said. Ms. Leung gave him the most undramatic nod that had ever mattered. Dahlia smiled in a way that meant her neck would hurt later. There was at least one person in the second row crying because they had arrived in the room on a day when someone told a truth in front of them and that had not happened to them very often. The vote was delayed. It was victory of the species that crawls toward sunlight and calls it policy.

On the way home the sky did a theater drop and turned slate. He could see the rain move in a community dragging itself forward. The first large splats hit the windshield in a rhythm he would recognize in sleep. Luis, who had once driven taxi through three births, two fights, and the procession of a horse wearing flowers, clicked the wipers and said nothing. Water fell in a rush and then in a mood. By the time he reached the Pump House the gutters were finding their old voices, the bell in the cupola thunked once as if it had been poked, and a swirl of gulls made a brief circus with the plastic bags over the bins.

The morning after, the internet said a lot of silly things, as was its manner. It noticed, in a pixelated clip of his listening face, a reflection of a junior staffer’s tie, and argued about whether ties should be considered a political statement. Quacktrackers posted a grainy photograph of a mallard on a traffic circle with the caption: STILL WATCHING, and then, in a rare gesture of good will, posted another of a mallard-shaped hole in a storm grate like a cartoon through a wall with the caption: MAYBE WE COULD FIX THIS, which Dahlia instantly printed and slid under the mayor’s nose as if the internet were a councilor. He wrote a short letter to the girl in Saskatoon and asked after her hamsters by name, and to his own astonishment, because he knew what paper could do to a person, he drew a duck without making it a joke.

Aunt Mirabel made soup for his victory, which meant she cut carrots into coins and celery into bones and told him the story of the time his mother had poured salt into the sugar dish and everyone had eaten cake with their faces lying. “Most of the time,” Aunt Mirabel said, watching the way steam made ghosts of their spoons, “you are not a king. You are an animal who must carry himself nicely. When you are a king, be one. The rest of the time, be only human and use your hands. Hands solve more than crowns do and they are warmer.”

He slept after the soup. He dreamed of watching himself watch a pond, an infinite series of frames like mirrors facing mirrors, until the image became thin and then disappeared. When he woke it was dawn and he chose to go alone down to Mill Pond, as if going alone were a hat he could try on a cloudy morning. The light was the particular kind that happens after a storm, as if the brightness had been wrung out of cloth and now clung to branches. He stood on the footbridge and said the names he had learned from a birder he did not know with a camera as patient as hunger: mallard, gadwall, teal, goldeneye, merganser, words that worked in the mouth like lozenges. The birds did not care for his recital. They did as they had been hired to do by evolution, which is to say they ignored a man in a coat who was more likely to buy a pastry than hunt them.

The birder explained the politics of bread with the fervor of someone who had once run for student council and lost to a jock. Bread was not food, not really. Ducks required something else, the way you require real sorrow instead of spectacle. He nodded gravely and thought about signs, new signs with language that did not punish. He imagined writing PLEASE DON'T BREAD THE DUCKS and knew he would be laughed at and knew, also, that sometimes laughter is the best solvent for the stuck places inside a city. He looked at the water until it became a shape that lived outside the frame in his head reserved for hemmed-in panic. It was not a miracle. It was a ten-percent redemption and then a twelve. He took that and put it in his pocket with the hamster drawing.

Because the city loves a parade and pardons an event in advance if it has wristbands, Felix invented a tournament called the Royal Cup. It was, he explained with the logic of a man selling sun to sunbathers, a way for the King to show his return to the people, playing for charity with a cast of beloved personalities and benevolent businesses, a day of irons and decency. There would be corporate sponsors with names that made him think of timber and cash. There would be glossy photographs of the King in trousers that made time seem shorter. There would be inflatable swans if Dahlia did not kill them with her mind.

“We will not be photographed near any object with a beak,” she told Felix, which he translated as “unicorns optional,” because he was a particular breed of entrepreneur who heard no in the accent of yes.

Evergreen Works insisted on sponsoring a hole, and yes, this was the hole they intended to one day replace with a clubhouse that sold avocados and nostalgia. Kristina got a glint in her mouth that worried him. “Be careful,” she told him. “People play golf with the same parts of themselves they use to start wars.”

“I will bring a saucer to catch the blood” was what he wanted to say, but he settled on “We will be polite and insolent in equal measure,” which was Dahlia’s brand of tea.

The night before the Royal Cup, Jun hosted a bake frenzy in the bakery below Avery’s room. She made buns that looked like moons and crostatas that looked like small lakes, and Avery carried trays like offerings through the narrow hall, bumping their shoulder on the lintel as if the door and their bones were not yet acquainted. He sat on the stairs and thought about the shape of their bodies in that small pace, how they bent around each other without injury. He realized with mild surprise that he was not jealous. He was not the center of all lights. He could be a chandelier that made way for others.

In the morning the course behaved as if it had been built for kindness. The air was approval. The holes all pretended they were smaller than their actual circumference, the way a host offers the better chair. He shook the hands of people who shook the hands of people for a living. There was a man known locally for storing his wealth in elaborate haircuts who spoke to him about unity while wearing a shirt printed with his own name. There was a trio of nurses who embarrassed one and all with their competence. There was, faint in the distance, a dog paid to be brave at geese, a border collie with a portfolio.

He had a partner assigned to him, a dentist who played off five and wanted only to be loved. They did the commerce of small talk about flossing and the dignity of sedation. At the end of the second fairway, on ground he could have drawn from memory in a room without windows, an odd space made itself known, an absence with edges. He has a gardener’s eye for what ground is meant to be and this ground was wrong. The rain had manipulated the clay under the gloss of grass into a mood. The earth had lost interest in holding itself together at a particular point and had made a suggestion about dropping.

Kristina arrived in a little run that did not suit her, her calm flaking off as if a deer had startled in the trees of her composure. “We’re closing the back loop,” she said, and motioned with two fingers as if commanding a parade. “There’s a sink possibility near thirteen. There’s a small slough at the edge of the pond that’s eaten away at the path. The super is looking at it. Nobody goes there. We don’t have a fence to close it off so be—just—tell whoever looks like a hero to be a different person today.”

He nodded as if heroism were an ugly pair of shoes he was glad to be rid of. The course staff planted tiny signs that said NO and the golfers treated them with the tender reverence usually reserved for doilies. The dog went to work making the geese feel unwelcome and the geese responded with political commentary the dog could not read. The sun had the gall to be beautiful.

On hole six, a man from Evergreen Works in a polo shirt with a tree on it asked if he could have a photograph with him, and he said yes because he had learned that refusing a photograph on a day like this was like refusing water at a fire. The man said, cheerfully, into the lens, “We are so proud to support the city as it grows,” and he made his face into a thing Dahlia would not have to rescue later. In the background you could see, if you knew what to watch for, Avery’s cap, moving always slightly ahead of the bag on their back, the way some people lead just by going where they’re needed. Jun manned a table by a tee and handed out cannoli that made the dentists edgy. Every time Avery passed her she made a small noise that was not words and Avery answered without meaning to, the way instruments tuned near each other will hum in the same key.

He was happy in the with-burning way of someone who is doing the hard thing and not being filmed failing at it. He hit the ball and it went where it went. He watched the pond as if it were a painting that would not move if he looked only at its corners. He shook the hand of a kid who wanted to be a paramedic and a paramedic who wanted to be a kid. He ate half a strawberry and tasted all of July. He thought: this is how cities stay cities and do not become highways. He thought: I was elected as a joke and maybe I will be remembered as a person.

The last foursome of the morning strayed near the closed path out of habit, because people love their loops. He called out, in the voice he used to call to ducks and children and the very old, “Not that way, please,” and the men turned and one of them, the one with the habit of insisting on his way, rolled his eyes and took a performative half step onto the grass beyond the sign, because some people are compelled to kick the tape around a wet paint sign to see if it’s serious. The ground, overhearing this, decided to demonstrate seriousness. The green gave under the man's heel with a sigh like bread folding. He teetered, pelvis searching for a new treaty with gravity, and then one leg sank into a narrow mouth and the rest of him followed in the wobbling manner of a man deciding not to admit to panic.

It was small, not dramatic. The earth made a suggestion, the man made a denial, and then the hole insisted. He was swallowed up to his hips in a space shaped like an answer someone had refused to hear. There was shouting of the particular pitch that belongs to competent people who do not want to be accused later of negligence. Kristina arrived with two rakes and created a small geometry of rescue. The super, a person with a head like a hill, lay on his stomach and wedged his arms into the hole as if petitioning. The dentist, who had been so gentle about floss, knelt in grass and spoke calmly about ankles and swelling and the mortal indignity of being removed from earth.

The man came out headfirst, muddied in the way that makes people look more handsome and then less. He laughed with his mouth because he had nearly been embarrassed by peril and the body prefers to relieve itself with nonsense. No one died. The hole showed a brown mouth with a trickle in it from the storm-bloated pond. It would widen; they all knew it. It would, if given the chance, take the path and then part of thirteen and then finally the feeling people had about what was solid where water had been invited as a guest and come to stay.

He stood with his hands open, as if this were a religious rite with no script. He looked at the mouth and felt the particular thrill that comes when the metaphor becomes literal. The cliff, he thought in the small private theater of his mind where the voiceover was honest, is beginning its work. Not all cliffs stand above sea. Some open like shy teeth under your lawn.

After the man had been led away and the path emphatically dressed in rope and warning, he drove a ball into a net and it made the sound of safe failure. He saw Avery see the hole and close their mouth around the word okay as if that could keep danger from multiplying. He saw Jun wrap both hands around a pitcher of iced tea and go still for a second, calculating how many people to disappoint and in what order. He saw Felix on his phone at a distance, having a conversation that likely involved the phrase optics, and he wanted very much to kick his phone into the pond. He didn’t. He was a king, sometimes.

That night the town posted a short bulletin with three photographs and the sentence The City is Monitoring the Situation at Copper Beech Links. Quacktrackers posted one photograph of the hole with the caption: QUACK, and then added a map of the city’s culverts, as if they were making a point about what watches us without eyes. Evergreen Works released a statement about infrastructure fatigue and the inevitability of progress that sounded like a person trying to convince their spouse to replace a tree with a trampoline. Dahlia called and said, “I am in a small crisis with an inflatable bird. Do not ask,” and he laughed like a man who understands only half his world.

He took his shoes off before he went upstairs at the Pump House because the floors had begun to complain to him in a language he did not want to translate. He held the railing as if it were an old lover. Before bed he took the hamster drawing out of his pocket and placed it on his nightstand as if it were a talisman. He stood at the window this once and allowed himself to look toward the pond. A single duck stood on the far bank with one foot tucked up under its own soft argument, and the sight did not set his bones ringing. He could not decide if this meant that he had become better or that the city had decided, for an hour, not to lean on him. He decided he did not need to know which it was to go to sleep.

In the morning he woke from a dream in which he had been biting a rope with his teeth while someone else pulled. He checked his phone because he had become a person who did this, and there was a message from Avery with a photograph of Jun’s hand holding a mug with a chip, the kind of flaw that endears, and underneath it the words: we might be late, with a heart shaped like a pear. He put the phone face down and let his mind examine the idea of being late. He thought of the sink, of water deciding to remember its old address, of developers with pocket ponds, of a dog hired to be frightening, of a child in Saskatoon who took the world seriously enough to write to it. He made tea. He waited for his breath to arrive. He went down to the course because he did not have another better plan.

The path to the practice green was new because a tractor had worried the edges of the old one and because perhaps it had always been new and he was the thing that had become willing to see it as it was instead of as he needed it to be. He stopped for a minute at the sign by the pond which, over night, Kristina had edited with a marker. DO NOT FEED, PLEASE had become DO NOT BREAD, PLEASE, and someone had added a small cartoon loaf with legs. He wished it were Jun’s hand that had made that and decided it probably wasn’t, that this was another citizen, one of the countless tender idiots who loved a place enough to vandalize it toward the good. He stood there longer than made sense. He put one hand out and did not touch the sign. He didn’t need to. It had touched him.

Beyond the hedge, a van with Evergreen Works on the side idled coyly as if a vehicle could have an agenda. Two men in hard hats discussed the bend of a culvert with a gravity usually applied to marriages. He did not go to them yet. There would be time for the part of the story where people with clipboards try to install a moral into a ditch. For now there was a ball on a tee and the business of teaching his fingers that they could be brave. For now there was a city whose water wore the face of a bird, and a man with a crown in his pocket and soup in him, and a small sink in a place where he grew himself better. He took the club in both hands and breathed until his mouth tasted like metal. And then, being as careful as anyone could ask, he swung.He swung, and the ball did not travel far, but it left his club with a sound that felt like a promise put in a pocket. The tee box smelled faintly of damp rope and cut lemon; somewhere a machine coughed and gave up. Kristina appeared with a clipboard that had known better days and said they had closed thirteen all the way to the bend and posted a teenager with a flag at the top of the path because the city had not invented a small, portable fence to keep men from insisting. She ran through liability as if it were a rosary and then, with care, said the words insurance adjuster and conservation authority and soil assessment in a tone that made them sound almost edible.

“Is it only the one?” he asked, and she lifted one shoulder, which was to say that the earth rarely writes letters of introduction for its surprises. There were maps, it turned out, of the old creek bed that had been corseted and persuaded into new shapes by a county engineer with a taste for straight lines in 1957. There were pipes beneath the fifteenth fairway that had been fine until they were not, and a culvert under the maintenance road that had begun to rust around its mouth like a patient refusing antibiotics. She told him this with a sort of exhausted affection, as if the place were a relative who would not take a pill.

Dahlia arrived before lunch wearing a raincoat in a cream so pale it declared war on weather and said the word optics twice in a row as if it were a chant. Ms. Leung stood beside her with a folder marked with a ribbon that meant emergency, and between them they had the information that Evergreen Works had requested a special hearing at Council five days hence to propose that the course be declared nonviable and repurposed into A Walkable Village. The capital letters were implied by the posture of the men in their brochure, who were always walking and never arriving. “They are using the sink as evidence of age,” Dahlia said, pinching the bridge of her nose as if pinching might keep the world together. “They are saying things fall down, therefore build something new where the thing that fell down used to be. We need photographs of community that do not include a hole.”

“What is the name of their village?” he asked, because words had become useful in ways tools were not. “It will be something with wood.”

“Willow Hands,” Dahlia said, and when he laughed a small, relieved laugh he knew she had saved that for him. The brochure showed a woman with a ceramic bowl larger than her head and a man with a beard that had a mortgage. There were children who did not wear mud. There was a pond in the middle with a rope around it to indicate everyone’s good intentions. He wanted very much to tear the paper in half along a line that did not exist and could not.

Avery drifted toward him during this briefing with the quiet of someone who understands that their job sometimes includes absorbing weather. They had mud on one calf and sugar on their collarbone and a patience that had been baked slowly over years of being ready. Jun waved from the far table where she had plates of lemon things and smile slices, and he noticed for the first time the small tattoo on her forearm, a single line that looked like the thread that holds a button. The world kept arranging itself into reasons to remain.

“Are we pretending calm?” Avery asked, not softly so much as kindly, and he thought how those two things were cousins. He explained Willow Hands and the public hearing and the sink that was not a sink yet but a thought, and they nodded, once, the way you nod when you put a piece into a puzzle and it clicks. “We will have to show them the place where their village already is,” they said, and it took him a second to see what they meant. The walking was happening. The children were carrying cups. The bearded men existed. A woman with a bowl was practicing beside the putting green because Jun had organized a charity clay-off at the bake table and a local potter with half-moon fingernails sat silent and attentive and turned wet earth into a cup within the time it took a foursome to tee off.

“Bring your crown,” Avery added as if discussing weather. “Some days you should wear it on your head. This looks like one.”

He let the suggestion settle in his mouth. The crown on his head was not nothing. It made people pause long enough to hear. It made jokes lose their sharp front teeth. It made children hop. When he wore it badly it made him feel as if his skull had been hired for a second, smaller job. “I will,” he said, and he felt the small fixed laugh that comes when you agree with the part of yourself that has been sensible longer than the rest.

The day broke into errands and returns. He found the young flag-holder at the bend and gave him a bottle of water and a sentence: “If anyone argues, point to the hole and say you do not wish to be responsible for their ankle.” He toured the maintenance yard with the superintendent and marveled at the way every machine had an old man’s name. He watched the border collie with the portfolio do her rounds and considered learning from a creature whose job title included People Pleasing and Authority Without Bark. He waved at Kian, who had turned up in a shirt that said STAIRS ARE JUST FLAT HILLS and was carrying a clipboard that gave him an expression he had been working on in the mirror. He sat briefly with Aunt Mirabel on a bench at the tenth and ate the cheese sandwich she pressed on him from the pocket of her cardigan, which appeared to be bottomless.

“Them,” she said, jerking her chin at the Evergreen men with their hard hats and soft minds, “will arrive at God with a plan to monetize heaven. The trick is to keep them busy writing down words while you rescue the furniture.”

“The furniture,” he said, grateful again for her domestic metaphysics.

“Chairs,” she said, as if he had disputed the genus of ducks. “Tables. Benches. The places where we put ourselves down. Keep those safe and a city can survive any number of plans.”

Quacktrackers had positioned themselves on a small rise with binoculars and notebooks, and he braced himself for ridicule. What he found instead was a committee with an appetite for drains. A woman in a hat shaped like a suggestion about sunshine showed him a map of culverts he had not seen before and used the phrase scupper audit with alarming sincerity. “We started out as a joke,” she said, “and then we learned to read tender things. The drainage is a story that only wants to be asked to speak.” They proposed, with the zeal of people who had found a power outlet for their care, a Sunday morning drain walk, a flotilla on foot to find the places where leaves had persuaded water into bad habits. He agreed to come in a cap and a sweater without insignia, and they glanced at the edge of his face where photographs lived and said: “We see you. Come as yourself with pockets.”

The hearing lurked at the edge of the week like a bus idling. In the interim he was asked to attend a breakfast where men in jackets made of a wool that must be called resolute spoke of growth. He knew how to stand in such rooms now and keep his hands friendly and his eyes not too tired. He knew to say the words that made him part of the machinery without allowing the machinery to fit his mouth with a bit. “We must consider water as an employee,” he said into a microphone at a round table, and the men looked confused and then wrote something down anyway because a king had a way of turning a sentence into a policy if you left the room for five minutes. He left, having eaten half a berry and two mouthfuls of economic forecast, and walked twice around the block to find his pulse.

In the cleaving middle of those days, Jun invited him to the pottery class she ran in the back of the bakery on Tuesday nights for municipal staff who needed to do something ignorant with their fingers. He went because she had a look that could pull a man into a river without his noticing he was wet. The room was hot and smelled like dirt learning to be dinnerware. He sat between Ms. Leung, who proved to be a stern and superior coil-builder who made walls that cities could live in, and a teenager from the clerk’s office who was trying to make a whale and had gotten only as far as a meatball with secrets. Clay moved under his thumbs in a way he recognized from soil and governance; it begged to be pressed but only to the point where it knew you intended to keep it whole. Jun moved among them without speaking often, her hands always ahead of her instruction, her hair coming loose in a way that made him understand why Avery had learned to breathe again. When his bowl collapsed under his optimism Jun touched it and said, “Let’s find another shape instead,” and he thought: this is the job.

On the morning of the drain walk he put on a gray cap that could have belonged to anyone and walked among citizens who owned more buckets than he thought possible. There were tongs for leaves and grabbers for plastic and an old man who brought a long-handled rake as if about to discipline the Mississippi. Children held clipboards and wrote things down that would terrify the Council if ever read aloud. Kian took photographs of grates and wet ankles and wrote a manifesto on the back of a receipt. A minor local celebrity, the weatherwoman with hair that had never lost an argument, came and said the words flash flood and mitigation into a camera, and he managed not to ruin the clip by standing respectfully out of frame. They found a drain under the elm that had become a private pigeon spa and cleaned it with an intimacy that felt religious.

He did not bolt when the first duck approached them at a little run, expecting bread. He surprised himself by talking to it in a voice he had used when a child brought him a dying plant at a school last winter. “We have nothing for you,” he said, “and it is, improbably, a kindness.” The duck waddled away, unimpressed. There was a moment in which he felt his childhood self stand briefly beside him, sticky with aquarium gift shop candy, and approve of the adult. He did not stay in that moment because he had learned not to sit too long on any feeling that might be taken for a throne.

The conservation authority arrived at Copper Beech with measuring rods that allowed them to speak authoritatively to mud. The report would take time, which meant the rumor would take no time. Felix called to suggest that, regardless of findings, perhaps the optics could be improved by moving the Royal Cup to Willow Hands the following year with a pop-up temporary course on their still-innocent rectangle of land, and he said a sentence to his brother-in-law that he had been storing for months and had salted for flavor. “I do not wish to play golf on a brochure,” he said, and Felix made a sound like a small folding chair discovering that it had been made to hold weight.

Avery and Jun discovered new chemistry in how they argued about sugar. He watched them one afternoon at the bakery as they debated the placement of jam in a tart as if deciding whether to place a child near the window, and he felt a peculiar peace about the fact that his city bred this sort of seriousness in its kitchens. He let himself be pulled into an argument about the pureed state of vegetable soup at Aunt Mirabel’s table and found that opinions could be fun if their consequences were only soup.

Meanwhile, the hole waited, which is another way of saying it grew. The lip widened not with a catastrophe but with a petulance, a slow insistence that the path be reminded of water’s desire to travel old routes. The superintendent found a fox print at the edge one morning and looked at him as if asked, in a polite whisper, to save the animal kingdom. Kristina ordered caution tape in three colors because it turned out the human mind read variations in yellow better than a single scold. The border collie learned to give the hole a wider arc, which made some of the men trust the hole more than the tape.

The hearing arrived the way an eclipse does, with everyone wearing expensive glasses and the promise of astonishment. The Council chamber had been decorated with potted plants that pretended they were trees. Evergreen Works had a row of people with hair cut to the exact length of ambition and a slideshow that featured a child on a bicycle you wanted to warn about cars. He wore the crown and a tie the color of water when you ask it a question and felt, to his horror, that his mouth had decided to be honest. He watched the microphones give their small hum of power. He saw the mayor’s hands fold like a book.

He stood and did something he did not entirely plan. He asked everyone in the room to stand, and the room buzzed like a picnic interrupted by wind. “If you have walked at Copper Beech,” he said, and people stood. “If you have learned to read wind on a flag there,” and more rose. “If you have cried behind a pine and wiped your nose on your sleeve and told only the trees your story and returned whole enough to pay your taxes,” he said, and Aunt Mirabel stood very slowly, and so did the weatherwoman and the superintendent and Kian and the border collie’s handler and Ms. Leung who did not cry in public but arranged her face into a shape you could mistake for windburn. He kept going as if building a small wooden bridge across a stream with his bare hands. “If you have sent a text from thirteen telling someone you love them again. If you have watched a hawk make a circle and forgiven yourself for needing a circle as a sign. If your mother is buried within a mile of here and you walk this land to find your breath on the days you need it, please stand.” In the end, most of the room was on their feet. He had not mentioned ducks. He did not need to. They were part of the texture of the place, not the story of his insufficiency.

Evergreen Works made a careful face and showed, in response, a projection of taxable revenue that excited two men in hats and caused Aunt Mirabel to examine the ceiling as if calculating the age of the beams. The mayor thanked everyone and said the word consideration until it became a song. The decision, as decisions do, retreated to a smaller, fluorescent room for a quieter war. Dahlia walked him down the corridor with a hand at his elbow that pretended to belong to light. “You did not embarrass me,” she said, which was for her the equivalent of a parade.

It was raining again by the time he reached the Pump House, a thin, confessional rain that smelled like metal. He sat with the hamster letter and then with the blank paper and could not find a voice. He wandered the rooms and encountered the bell inside the cupola in his memory, rung once, and thought about how things sound when they announce themselves without asking permission. He put on a coat and went back to the course because bodies always win against thought in a tie.

There were three men on the path in fluorescent vests conferring with a seriousness that might have belonged in a bank. The tape snapped in wind and made the sound of a kite regretting. He saw, only when he was close enough to be in trouble, that the edge had altered its manners; the ground’s impatience had become that particular thinness that means the air is almost under your feet. The teenager with the flag had been reassigned to another corner. There was a woman with a stroller who had not read signs in any language and had brought herself to the edge of the theater.

“Not that way, please,” he said, gently, because he had learned that the voice you use at the start saves your louder voice later. She pulled the stroller back with a show of competence that did not entirely convince the ground. The front wheel found the soft and sank, and the stroller tilted in such a way as to make time both very long and very small. He was there before he told himself to be, hands on metal where a child slept under a ratty blanket, the weight tinny and urgent. Avery appeared with a speed he would come later to resent as heroic, and together they lifted the device backward, away from the mouth, the woman all mouth herself now, only thank you and oh and sorry as if the edge were listening and would be appeased.

The ground gave a small sigh like someone at the end of a day, and a rectangle the size of a couch tilted in, the way furniture does when it has given up. There was mud and a slow creep of water and a silence you could measure. The child slept through the entire decree. The woman began to cry now that she had permission. He was aware, in the sharp, hot place under his sternum where fear moves with its tiny spoons, that Avery was still at the edge, not dramatic about it, simply there, because they had a habit of standing between danger and people. Jun was far away at the tent with a tray; she had not seen this yet. He wanted to go and put his hand on Avery’s back and suggest the half step his therapist had suggested to him for other cliffs, the head tilt you use to escape the pocket of your own panic.

“Back,” he said quietly, because he had learned to negotiate with the living, and Avery, who knew that his voice meant more now, did the half step, casual, as if they had remembered a thing they had put on the stove. They looked at the new mouth the earth had made and put their hands in their pockets like a person pretending not to recall a dream. “Okay,” they said, and then again, “Okay,” and he thought the word had become a prayer in this place.

Evening came like felt. They posted more tape because tape was cheap and courage was not, and Kristina found three orange cones that made everyone feel better though they would save no one. The conservation authority man came back with a gadget that beeped at dirt, and he frowned with the dignity of a person who will always prefer a graph to a feeling. He recommended filling, shoring, engineering, vocabulary that made the superintendent sigh the way people sigh when someone you love recommends a diet. It was not impossible, he said. It required money and cooperation, which are the same thing in different jackets.

He ate lentils in Aunt Mirabel’s kitchen and watched the rain decide not to be dramatic for an hour. The phone lived face down on the table until a message came from Dahlia with the simple, unhelpful word: waiting. He imagined bureaucrats creeping around a policy like cats around a bath. He imagined Evergreen Works calculating the number of families they could fit into a certain number of cupboards. He imagined the course without its water the way you imagine someone without their front teeth.

He went to bed imagining nothing, which is to say he slept, and when he woke the dream had left a smear of iron behind his eyes, the aftertaste of a bell rung close. He dressed and went to the course earlier than made sense because he wanted to be the first person to look at the hole and not be surprised. Dawn made the grass a religion. A gull walked one-legged on the cart path with a privacy he could not interrupt. He stood at the tape and tried to read the ground.

Avery was there when he turned, which was both relief and omen. They had the loose posture of the blessedly tired, the kind of person who had stayed up later than their age allowed watching someone else sleep just to be sure they hadn’t invented joy. They came to stand beside him without speaking and together they watched the edge pretend to hold.

“I keep thinking of my father,” Avery said after a minute, which was their way of handing you a photo without asking you to look. “He would have thrown a board over it and told us to walk lightly. Then he would have built a poem about it and smoked two cigarettes and asked if we had noticed the way the water made the grass shine when it was wrong. I can’t decide if I loved him for that or blame him.”

“Both is honest,” he said, and they nodded because they were both in the decade where both is what you get.

Jun arrived with three coffees and a cookie that had been cut into the shape of a goose. She put the cookie directly into his hand as if she were a magician who specialized in edible rabbits. “I do not intend violence,” she said, smiling. “It was the only cutter left. We can bite from the back and save your nerves.” He laughed and bit the tail and felt ridiculous, which was to say he felt like a person among people instead of a man alone with his absurdities.

There was a sound then, a sound his body recognized before his mind filed it: the noise of something choosing to be a different shape. It was not the roar disaster movies have taught us to expect but a steady industry, the rustle of good cloth torn slowly. The three of them turned together in a choreography that had been rehearsed a hundred times in other crises they did not yet know they had survived. The edge had advanced, politely, toward the warning cones as if asking to sit closer.

Kristina came at a run, again dishonoring her excellent calm, with a length of rope that had been proud of something once. The superintendent had a shovel he would never use but needed to hold. Two men in hard hats refused to be surprised because their job did not include that. The world did nothing. The hole opened a little and then a little and then, with the exhausting theatrics of adolescence, stopped to see if anyone would clap.

They did not. They did, however, move backward with the skill of people who had learned to read messages before they arrive. The border collie barked once in a manner that offended the geese and made one of the Evergreen men drop his phone. The phone skittered, kissed the tape, and fell into the brown mouth with an elegant plop that caused the entire gathered municipal family to emit the same choked laugh at once. It was, he would think later, a sacrifice made by the gods of optics to prove they were at least watching.

“Meeting at ten,” Dahlia texted, and the mayor added, “Bring boots,” which was either a metaphor or a weather report. He pulled back from the tape and felt the kind of tired that sugar cannot help. There was an inch of chocolate on his lip, because Jun had shoved another cookie at him without waiting for permission, and when Avery reached and wiped it away with their thumb without thinking, he felt, bizarrely, municipal. He had been tended to in public beside a failure of engineering. It was a sacrament of this town.

The meeting was all the things meetings are and none of the things a field wants. The conservation authority explained that the pond and the path were in a long relationship, that the storms were writing letters nightly, that the soil was beginning to answer. The man from Evergreen Works spoke quietly about safety and progress and how children were safer near a rope, and the superintendent made a sound that caused three civil servants to glance at each other and then at the floor the way you glance at a piano that has just dramatically failed to be tuned. Ms. Leung used the phrase capital allocation as if it were an incantation and then smiled, slowly, at the mayor, and he watched an invisible vote shift a chair.

“Here is my suggestion,” the mayor said finally, in the voice she used when the cake was done and the oven could be forgotten. “We close thirteen and the path beyond it pending assessment and repair. We do not cut the course off from its own body. We do not sell a piece of ourselves to a brochure while there is still a way to mend. We ask the province for money, we ask our people for patience, we ask companies with trees for conscience. We also, and I cannot believe I am saying this in a microphone, ask Quacktrackers to organize another one of those drain walks because apparently citizens do not use their weekends properly and it might save us fifty thousand dollars if they keep pulling the leaves out of the mouths of our city.”

It was not victory, not yet, but it was a bench someone had remembered to bring inside before the rain. It would hold. He walked out of the municipal building into a light that had found a softness again, and he found himself hoping for an ordinary accident to cancel the afternoon, the kind where a grocery bag breaks and you must buy an apple from the floor.

Instead he received a message from Felix that said, with confetti emoji, that Willow Hands had purchased a full-page ad in the paper with a letter to the city about their generous partnership and their sincere desire to be the kind of neighbor who borrows sugar and returns a cake. He thought about cakes and debts and the ways language is used to put a ribbon on theft. He thought about rope and the kinds of holes men learn to love because they dig them themselves.

In the evening he went to Jun’s pottery night because clay made sense in a way brochures do not. This time his bowl held. It was humble and crooked and would forever be the sort of vessel that made soup feel braver, and he placed it on the shelf to be fired with a care that suggested he had placed a child’s drawing on a fridge. He washed his hands at the sink while Avery told a story about their father finding a duck under a fence and freeing it with a pair of cutters as if the bird were a stubborn syllable. Jun tied her apron and let herself lean, for the first time in public, against Avery’s shoulder without caution. He felt that odd loosening in his throat again, the feeling that someone had untied a knot he had pretended was part of his neck.

He dreamed that night of a long hallway in the Pump House with doors on either side with labels like Plans and Ducks and Teeth and River, and at the end a door called Under. When he opened it there was only a small room with a chair and his crown on a peg and a window onto thirteen, and through the window he could see his own back, bent slightly as if listening to ground. He woke with his hands already out in front of him as if warding off a fall and laughed at the ceiling because here he was, alive, which always felt like a mistake he was getting away with.

Morning did not ask permission to be beautiful and he failed to punish it for that. At the course he found the cones, steady as saints, and the tape, a cheap hymn. He found Kristina with a mug of coffee and a plan to call an engineer she trusted because he had once told her the truth about losing money. He found the superintendent telling the hole a joke about soil that made no sense and was, infuriatingly, funny. He found, at the far end of the practice green, a group of children putting with a seriousness that would one day ruin them and then save them, and he felt his face soften without bothering to ask his brain.

He also found a man from Evergreen Works kneeling near the tape with a camera, photographing the mouth with a kind of tenderness he would have preferred be reserved for genders and birds. The man stood when he saw the crown and offered his hand and said his name with the weary candor of a person who has already had a long week this morning. “I grew up here,” he said, before making his case. “My mother walked this path every Thursday in shoes that were not good for it. She would be furious with me if you sell this to me. I am supposed to tell you about mitigations and property tax. I am here because I got a break on parking.”

“Maybe do both,” Ivor said, because menace and melancholy often travel arm in arm. The man nodded, and for a minute they were simply two citizens with complicated jobs and parents with more complicated ghosts.

The hole did not widen that day. There is a particular mercy in a pause. He took it as instruction. He tackled his correspondence, he approved two invoices that had been fighting him, he sent a thank-you note to the weatherwoman because gratitude has its own drainage system and must be kept clear. He sat with Aunt Mirabel and listened to her complain about her knee and the price of butter and the way a boy on her street had started to say sorry as punctuation, and he felt in love with boring in a way that might have saved a kingdom once.

When dusk slid along the edge of the course like a careful thief, he and Avery walked the high loop where the ducks do not go because the pond is not there and men do not feed pretzels to the air. They did not speak for long minutes at a time, which was its own speech. On the ridge they could see the flags and the cones and the suggestion of a wound. They could also see, because the world is unkind and generous in equal measure, a V of geese flying without need of signs. The sound reached them like a sentence from a book he would not be able to read until later.

“I want to get married,” Avery said then, into the air, as if just to see if the air could handle it. The sentence was not aimed at him exactly, but he caught it. It sat in his hands like something warm. “Not now,” they added, with the speed of someone who had regretted telling the truth and is trying to make a pillow for it. “Someday. To her. Or—I don’t know. To the part of me that eats breakfast and reads the bus schedule the night before. To a person who will leave a light on without accusing me of dark.”

“I think,” he said, which is how he always began when he had to risk sounding like a person with a heart, “that you will. And if I am still the kind of king who gets to carry a sword in a legal way, I would like to make it official with words near a pond.”

They were both laughing in the quiet way of people making a future sound less impossible when his phone did the serious vibration that he had told it to do only for the kinds of calls that alter weather. It was the superintendent. There was a man on thirteen after dark, he said, a kid by the sound of him, a challenge thrown down by other kids and accepted because that is how abundance becomes danger, and he had run at the tape and he had run at the hole and he had not fallen, which is the cruelest outcome, because he would do it again until he did.

“I’m here,” Ivor said. “I’m close,” and he was, and so were Avery and, two minutes later, Jun, who ran with such elegant panic that he wanted to hold up a number on a scoreboard for style. They reached the bend and found the boy with the shoulders of someone pretending not to be fourteen, his jaw set to show his friends he had invented gravity. He stood exactly at the place where the ground had grown thin and stamped his foot like a man trying to shame a dance floor.

“Stop,” Ivor said, none of the old quaver in it, and the boy stopped because a crown can work even when worn over a cap. The boy blinked at him and made the face boys make when they have been spared and wish to make it look like defiance. The friends dissolved in the trees, trying to salvage their evening from adulthood. The superintendent arrived breathless and invented a new curse that rhymed with brochure. Avery put their hands on their knees and breathed with the complicated relief of the cousin of fathers.

“Come here,” Jun said to the boy, not as an order but as an offer you accept because you cannot think of a reason not to. She took his wrist like a nurse and checked the pulse that had to be there. He was embarrassed enough now to be kind. He asked her if she was famous because of the internet. She told him no, and gave him a cookie from a pocket that seemed to have been designed by God for emotional first aid. He looked at the hole the way animals consider mirrors and then away. He would tell this story tomorrow with his own hero at the center, and they would be generous and let him.

When the boy had been carried away by the bureaucracy of good intentions, they stood together at the tape and allowed the quiet to say what it wanted. There was, he thought, a cliff, but perhaps it was not a cliff made of soil. Perhaps it was the lip that people get when they are about to be the person they had already been under the parts that apologized. He thought, I am tired of apologizing for being tender with what I love. He thought, I would like to go home and eat something that took someone a long time to make.

“Tomorrow,” Avery said, ears still red, “I promised Jun I’d help at the bakery at five and then come walk with you at eight. We have an inspection at eleven. In between I will be a person.”

“That will be difficult,” he said gently, “but I believe in you,” and they snorted like a horse made suddenly glad.

That night the bell in the cupola decided to ring twice for reasons it did not share. He wrote to the girl in Saskatoon about drains and about bravery and about the way sometimes a hole shows you where to stand, and he sealed the envelope with a sticker of a cat wearing a crown because that was the sheet he had left. He put the crown on his bedside table as if it might sleep and lay down beside it like someone keeping a promise. He slept until morning without dreaming of mouths. When he woke he could hear the river having a quiet argument with the pipes under someone else’s lawn, which he understood was none of his business and also entirely his job.

In the early light he watched a duck on the far bank bend to preen and then, because the world is a comedian with attention to timing, turn its head and look directly at him. He waited for the small, mean electricity he had fed for years to bolt his ribs. It came, but it was less, like coffee made with the wrong spoon. He raised a hand without moving from the window and said, without suggestion that anyone translate him, “Good morning,” and in a way that required no miracles, the morning did not argue.

He went to the course. He went to the bench. He went to the tape. He went, finally, to the edge of the thing that scared him and stood so close to it he could read the ground. He listened, because that was the one trick he knew now. He listened to dirt tell its slow, patient truth. He listened to his own breath climb down off its ledge. He listened to Kris­tina, from a distance, on the phone with someone who could move money from one column to the other without making a hole for it to fall into. He listened to Avery’s step arriving, the way people you need make a separate sound in the world. He listened to Jun humming a song that had been popular when he was too young for songs to be anything but colors. He listened and stayed.

By midmorning the province sent a man in a tie the color of a bruise and a helmet that made him appear to have wandered into the wrong war, and he walked the edge with his clipboard and pronounced it remediable if the city could be bothered. The mayor arrived wearing boots that meant she intended to step in something and did, and did not apologize. Ms. Leung asked him in a whisper if he was ready to lose, if it would be better to retreat from parks in a dignified fashion before anyone pushed, and he shook his head and said the words that tasted like plasticine in his mouth: not yet. The word yet is a place you live for a while before it becomes a country or a ruin.

That afternoon, because the world enjoys a symphony, the pump in the decommissioned Old Pump House made a noise. It was a cough, really, a theatrical clearing of an iron throat in a building that had not done such a thing in decades. He stood under the cupola and listened to old purpose knock politely at his ceiling. The plumber arrived wearing a jacket informally embroidered with grease and told him the line that ran from the edge of his lawn under the road toward the river had found an old crack and rain had found that crack and mischief had found both. There would be a repair. There would be a trench in the grass. There would, for a day, be a hole he could not pretend did not exist in his yard, and he laughed because the city never missed a chance to underline.

He sat on the stoop with his tea as men arranged orange cones like a hasty altar around the square where his lawn would become not-lawn. A child on a bike slowed to watch and asked if it was a castle, and he said no, it was worse, it was maintenance, and the child nodded gravely, as children do when they suspect adulthood is not a prize. He thought of all the ordinary, undignified repairs that keep a kingdom from becoming a plot on a developer’s desk, and he loved them with the kind of fierce calm he used to reserve for shame.

When the plumber lifted the first cut of sod like a lid, a toad blinked at them from the damp. It did not panic. It unfurled itself from the shape of a small potato and moved toward the hedge with the undeniable logic of its species. He watched it go and felt safer, which is perhaps the strangest result of an amphibian. He thought: everything is watching us and almost nothing cares, and the relief of that was monumental.

He had just allowed himself this luxury when the call arrived with the sound of a room dropping: a voice from Copper Beech, clear and precise, telling him the edge had done its patient work and then ruined everyone’s lunch. The path had gone, clean as if cut, a long strip of absence like a belt removed from a waist. No one was in it. No one had fallen. A pine had taken the hint and leaned. The tape fluttered, shamed. The superintendent had, with the calm of a man who had seen worse, called the radio station before the rumor could, because someone had taught him that sometimes you must sing your own bad news to keep the chorus from drowning you.

He thanked the voice and found his shoes and told the plumber that he would be back to admire the trench later. He drove with Luis as if the street had become a thread. He arrived to find the crowd arranged like punctuation marks around a sentence they did not yet know the verb for. There was a peace in the precise way the ground had decided not to be ground there anymore, a brutal clarity he almost envied. The water showed its brown shoulder. The soil showed its permission. Kristina said, “It’s not the cliff, you know. It’s a step.” He understood without wanting to that you could break an ankle on both.

He put on the crown without looking for a mirror. He stepped up on the little riser they had dragged from the men’s league cupboard because they used it for barbecue ceremonies and grief. He used both hands when he spoke because he wanted to be seen reaching. He said: we will fix this. He said: this land has held more than any of us asked of it. He said: we will not sell a piece of our walking to the highest bidder while we are still, demonstrably, able to walk. He said: if you have rope, bring it. He said other things, about budgets and authority and the approval process, and the lawyers in the crowd nodded where they were supposed to. What he really said, underneath, and what he had learned to allow people to hear if they wanted, was: please stay with me while I do this.

Afterward, when the camera crews had gone to find other weather and the men from Evergreen Works had retreated to plates of late lunch where they would salt their disappointment satisfactorily, he sat on a bucket at the edge with Avery and Jun and watched the water slick its mouth. The border collie lay down with her head on her paws in the posture of a creature who understands patience. The three of them shared the kind of silence families fake and only friends know how to keep. He’d thought the cliff would arrive as a fall. Perhaps it had arrived as a crowd that did not leave.

“Tomorrow,” Jun said, touching Avery’s knee just once, not enough to ask permission, more like ringing a small bell, “I have a delivery at the hospital and then I’m here all day with the buns. Come hungry at eleven. If you cannot be hungry at eleven, be hungry at one.”

“Eleven,” he said, with gratitude that could have held soup.

They rose like people at the end of a long movie they could not stop talking about, the kind that makes you kind to the strangers who bump your knees with their handbags. He walked home along the street where the men were filling his trench, and he stopped to look, because he had learned that sometimes the thing you have avoided is the only thing that lets you inhale all the way down to the parts that have been charred. The plumber looked up and said, “We found an old coin,” and held up a round thing the size of a thumb that had the hopeful face of the past on one side and nothing he recognized on the other. He bought it from the man for a promise to send a photograph when the hole was filled and the grass forgot. He put it in his pocket with the hamster letter and the drawing and the list for the grocer. It made his walking uneven for a minute, which felt like honesty.

At the Pump House the bell did not ring, which felt like mercy. He made himself a sandwich with too much mustard. He wrote down a list of verbs that he could stand to be: shore, mend, ask, learn, hold, rope, feed, breathe. He added laugh because he had forgotten devotions improve when they are less solemn. He fell asleep in a chair because the chair was better at mercy than the bed. He dreamed of coins and duck feet and a small sign that read DO NOT BREAD, PLEASE, in a handwriting he could not place that looked a lot like the one he might one day have if he kept writing his name in places where other people put theirs.

He woke at four, the hour when mistakes come like salesmen, and nothing came. He went back to sleep. He woke with the certainty, clean as a window just wiped, that morning would contain both maple syrup and mud. He could afford both. He could, perhaps, survive both. He dressed. He pocketed his coin. He went to the place where the ground had made a suggestion and the city would have to compose an answer. He went, because he was that sort of king now, to work.Chapter 7

By eight, the course had already acquired its temporary jewelry: ropes like polite snakes, cones like little orange sermons, hand-lettered signs that wore their grammar like a cardigan. The light came in under the pines in narrow shawls. He felt the day arrange itself around him the way a well-meaning aunt rearranges cushions and pretends she is not touching your life. Work, he told himself, not as a slogan but as a verb with muscle. He stopped at the superintendent’s shed and accepted a pencil behind the ear he would forget until lunch, then walked with Kristina along the safer edge until the land’s sentence broke off again into ellipses.

The engineer who did not like to be called an engineer because he was, properly, a geotechnical consultant, arrived with a roll of paper so long it looked like a tired animal. He unrolled the city’s soil as if it were a scroll confessing. There were colors for clay and sand, symbols for silt, little whorls where the old creek had written its stubborn memoir beneath the fairway. He spoke of bearing capacity in a voice that belonged to a man who had once loved a teacher. He used the phrase factor of safety and then, seeing Dahlia’s face begin to plan a headline in which that phrase could be useful, quickly replaced it with the word patience. It was, he said, not only remediable but instructive. The ground was telling them where the old water wanted to run and if they listened, they could place a pipe where a dream had been.

Luis appeared with a paper bag that smelled like a promise to eat, and for a moment the group became human in the old way with crumbs and coffee and the relief of something sweet. Jun had lettered in icing on the buns a message that made the superintendent snort into his sleeve: DO NOT BREAD THE HOLE. He ate one and laughed with the particular abandon of a man weighing soil and soul on the same scale. When they were done, the paper bag became a trash can and then a hat and then, because this was a place where objects knew more than one life, a map holder while the wind considered theft.

The mayor came early in old rain boots and a new resolve. She stepped to the edge and did not pretend not to be frightened; this endeared her to the hole. She listened to the geotechnical consultation like a woman in church listening to a sermon about a marriage she intended to improve without leaving. She looked at Ivor, then at the engineer, then at the water, and said the plan would include a coffer dam, which sounded to him like something you built to keep money in place and turned out, wonderfully, to be a fence for water. She spoke briskly of permits and the ordinary heroism of forms. She also said she had asked two councillors to stop saying the word liability like a prayer and start saying it like a hammer. When she left she put her hand, briefly, on his sleeve, and the gesture steadied him more than the rope.

Quacktrackers fanned out like benevolent espionage and began to produce from pockets implements that should not have fit there. They had a little chorus of graters for leaves, a rake head wired to a broom handle like a Frankenstein kindness, a laminated chart of culvert mouths to memorize. He walked with them to the culvert under the maintenance road and watched them perform the liturgy of clearing. A woman with a sunhat the shape of an idea taught Kian to kneel without muddying his knees and the boy, who was double-jointed in confidence that day, winked at him with a mischief that felt earned. They found a wad of plastic from a bag that had once said THANK YOU in a font that had not saved it, and they pulled it free with a cheer that was half comedy, half absolution. He clapped because he had not learned not to.

At ten he sat in a small room with beige walls and a printer that made noises like stress, and Ms. Leung told him in a voice that did not judge and therefore gave him courage that the city’s funds were not a pond but a stream. She could, she explained, shift money meant for ornamental lighting to something less ornamental if the council agreed to read the street at night by stars for a season. There were reserves for snow that they could borrow against if the winter was kind and their luck dishonest. Grants were possible from people who loved phrases like climate resilience and green infrastructure, though the latter always made her think of jealous bridges. She proposed—this was the moment the room’s air leaned in—a match-fund appeal. The city would commit to half. The other half would come from citizens who had legs and used them here.

He had wanted, in his grander fantasies, some myth to arrive with a purse. He wanted a dragon to cough up coins from under the ninth tee box and declare, sheepishly, that hoarding had gone out of fashion. Instead, he had an aunt who put five-dollar bills into ice cream tubs in the freezer and a city who stored twenty-dollar bills in coffee jars and a mayor prepared to say the word tax out loud without fainting. He loved, to his surprise, this less dramatic rescue better. He said yes. He said he would ask for rope and money in the same breath, which is the way of kings in places with old creeks.

The appeal wrote itself the way an apology writes itself when you give it enough paper. Dahlia removed every sentence that made him sound as if he had been weeping while writing and inserted three jokes that would travel without needing to stretch. Aunt Mirabel edited with a pencil that had been sharpened by her teeth and restored two of the softest lines because she said that people required permission to be tender on paper as in life. He read it out loud in the council chamber where the microphones only loved him sometimes, and the watching faces did the one thing you need from faces at such moments: they agreed in public to have feelings.

Felix called to say they could film the appeal and attach it to a sponsored segment in which a local sandwich shop would offer a Copper Beech Melt with a portion to the fund, and that he had already negotiated the price of bread to avoid scandal. He smiled into the phone because he had learned that irritation did not mend rivers, and told Felix he could have the segment if he promised not to wear a hat that suggested he poured cement with his own hands. Felix laughed as if he had never pretended to do anything in his life and hung up to text him three photographs of hats he could not approve. He approved the least injurious and placed his phone face down among the maps.

He took the letter home and read it to the bell in the cupola. He read it to the hole in his lawn, which sat there under its cones like a guest who has overstayed and cannot be asked to leave because it is, after all, family. The plumber had propped a little square of plywood over the offending space and promised a plate in the morning, and the toad had vanished to wherever the toad believed in. He sat on the stoop and felt the day’s work in his bones like a good kind of ache. A boy on a scooter complimented his shoes and he said thank you, because this is how cities are fixed.

Avery came by at dusk with Jun and two bowls, one of which was his and still warm from the kiln despite its humility. It had taken the glaze like a person taking a compliment badly and somewhere in the small desert of its surface a bubble had opened and then thought better of it. He adored it with the relief that comes when an object does not ask to be perfect to be useful. They ate soup that had come out of Aunt Mirabel’s kitchen and collected the day in the way people do when they are too tired for stories and settle for evidence. Jun’s hand found Avery’s knee in exactly the same place it had found it yesterday, and he thought that habit had arrived, and habit, properly regarded, was a synagogue.

They talked about the hearing and the man from Evergreen Works whose mother had walked the path on Thursdays and how heartbreak, divided by pie, becomes a civic resource. They talked about the drainage map that Quacktrackers had taped to the clubhouse refrigerator beside a flyer for a lost cat that had been missing for six months and had acquired the status of a local saint. They talked, with the kind of seriousness that allows laughter to serve as mortar, about how much money a city can ask for before it begins to rot the asking. He said that if it came to it he would auction off his ridiculous crown and buy a cheaper ridiculous crown and wear it with more dignity. They agreed, mercilessly, that the cheaper crown would suit him.

Rain came with the boredom of someone whose job it is to keep water in rotation. He dreamed of a long, low hall in which every door opened onto a version of thirteen, some mended, some widened into a lake, some full of children who had no use for caution. He woke because the bell did not ring, which felt like a gift from the bell, as if it, too, had learned restraint. He drank water from the crooked bowl and it tasted faintly of dust and victory.

The appeal took a weekend to move from paper to mouths. The city posted a page called Holdfast and an elderly woman who hated the internet more than flu showed up at the service counter with a jar and the promise that it contained nickels. People who do not regularly afford generosity found pockets where it had fallen and shook it out with satisfaction. A baker gave buns and then money from buns and then time. A man who had once been in a band that had once opened for a band that had once mattered gave a guitar and Christened it Pond. Kian built a graph so tender and wrong that the mayor insisted on using it because the wrongness made it dearer. A landscaper who had snorted at them in public brought, in the dark of morning, two rolls of matting and a quiet apology.

In between the work of asking and answering, there were days that nested like cups. He threaded policy meetings with small errands for his aunt and watched only a little too long when Avery and Jun touched each other’s elbows walking through doors. He went to the school where a boy in third grade had drawn a duck so accurate it made the vice-principal cry. He met with a woman from the conservation authority who spoke of riparian zones as if describing cousins he loved and could not feed. He said no to three things that would not serve them and yes to one thing he would have once believed beneath him, which was the opportunity to stand in the parking lot of Willow Hands with a microphone and call it out, plainly, in front of the fake pond.

He arrived at Willow Hands in a rain that made even the brochure look realistic. The developers had, to their credit, set up tents that did not attempt to resemble trees. People came because they were told to come and came also because they suspected drama might hand out free napkins. He wore his crown because Avery had told him his head needed the extra spine today. He stood at their imported water and spoke to the people whose houses had not been built and told them what they had been invited not to know. He spoke of old creeks and new debt and the indignity of a rope around water called a feature. He spoke of walking. He spoke of chairs. He invited them to give to a place where they had not yet slept. It was, perhaps, indecent, and it was also how cities are born: with requests the future must honor or it does not deserve its air.

A man shouted something about taxes and personal responsibility and ducks as socialism. A woman who had learned to braid her daughter’s hair in a hurry while late for work said she would like a place to walk that was not inside a brochure. A teenager asked if there would be Wi-Fi by the pond at Copper Beech once it was mended and he said no, and the kid smiled in relief that honesty had not been clothed. When he left his shoes carried whatever rain had not already owned them. He felt he had been a rude guest and a necessary one.

He returned to Copper Beech to find the first truck parked at the bend and the first coil of silt fence unfurling like a dark ribbon in the grass. There was movement coupled with thought—a rare pairing in public life. Kristina had acquired a walkie-talkie and used it with the efficiency of a person who had been waiting to have a voice that could turn into infrastructure. The superintendent, whose shoulders carried every Wednesday in town, supervised with the serenity of a reluctant saint. The dog looked satisfied. Quacktrackers took photographs of their own hands and posted them as if hands were celebrities and, for an afternoon, they were.

It had not rained hard enough to be an alibi for weeks, but the air felt like it might decide to. The engineer said something about weather windows and he nodded as if he could open one. Dahlia messaged him with small wins dressed as jokes. Ms. Leung sent him, unironically, a photograph of a ledger with a column circled in green. Aunt Mirabel dropped off a baked thing at the tent with a note that read DO NOT CALL IT A TART; IT IS A PIE. Jun set the pie safely on a folding table that had always wanted to hold a pie and Avery cut it with that concentrated patience they gave to strings and hurt. He worked until his hands remembered they were supposed to ache. He went home through a light that had been generously filtered by the pines.

He dreamt of a meeting where no one spoke but everyone wrote, and when he looked down he was writing water. In the morning, because dreams sometimes tuck in a question mark, he asked the plumber if he could keep the plate that had covered his hole and the man said sure, and he carried it to the course and wrote with thick black marker in letters Jun would have disapproved of for their bluntness: WATCH YOUR STEP. He leaned it against a cone and felt the dawn nod as if he had attempted language and succeeded enough.

The call from the province came like the kind of weather that refuses to be predicted. The man in the tie the color of an old bruise had found in his budget a line that had been mislabeled as education and could, with the stroke of a cathartic pen, be applied to ponds. It would not be everything, but it would be a favor from a stranger, which is to say an event halfway to a miracle in civic life. He thanked him with the tone of a man who knows how politics works and then hung up the phone and allowed himself the indignity of clapping alone, once.

In the afternoon the charity golf resumed on the front nine while the back was tied up like a wound. Nurses beat police officers by four strokes and the weatherwoman acquitted herself beautifully with a seven iron. He played three holes with a small boy who had lost a father and then found three uncles, and if it was a performance then he was finally performing as the person he preferred to be. He did not look too long at the pond. He did not flinch when a duck passed, a brown purse with eyes. He hit a ball into a bunker and got it out and did not feel that the bunker’s sand had been placed there by an enemy.

Evening brought a noise that had nothing to do with dirt. The bakery downstairs from Avery’s room held a music night on the first Thursday of every month where people with instruments and fragile egos performed and then mended themselves with sugared things. Jun asked him to come only if he could remember how to clap on time. He went because he recognized the minute authority of a person who can keep rhythm. Avery played a song that had belonged to their father, a thorough thing about water taking the shape of its home, and their voice carried the grain of an old table. Jun sang harmony and looked at no one while looking at everyone. He sat in the back and ate a square that pretended it was a cake and thought: cities are made of nights like this and the holes between them, and we live by the rope we tie between.

The storm finally came on Saturday as if it had been recruited. It was not violent, not here, but it was serious. The rain filled the pond with young thoughts and tested the fences they had placed in the grass. The coffer dam did its first stern work. The silt fence kept its promise. The new culvert mouth held its breath and then let it out. He stood under a borrowed umbrella and watched water obey, which is to say watched people’s planning persuade water into better habits. He allowed himself, for the length of a song on a phone played too quietly, to feel proud.

Then the power flickered at the Pump House, not dramatically, but with the small, old disapproval of a building that once kept a city from thirst. The bell did not ring. The sump below the kitchen did. He went home, because he had learned he must work the problems within his walls if the city was to believe him about the problems under theirs. Luis drove slowly through water that had acquired the tone of a conversation that could become a fight. He passed a boy in a yellow coat who had learned to love his boots, and a woman with a dog who had not and was reconsidering pets entirely.

The plumber had left the plate in place over his trench and the cone remained, a tiny lighthouse. The water had risen to the lip and then stopped because someone with competence had put a cut in the right place hours ago. He went down to the cellar with a flashlight that had aspirations and he listened to the pump doing what pumps do: hum, then swallow, then ask for more. He thanked it out loud because there was no one to judge him and perhaps because it deserved it. He stood for a moment on the stair with the smell of iron in his mouth and thought of all the hidden machines that served arrogance without quitting.

He slept badly because certain parts of him still believed that rain was a letter addressed to him personally. In the morning the course was a version of itself after. The ropes sagged, the cones had learned humility, the sign he had lettered had fallen and had been set back upright by a stranger. The hole was a little cleaner at the edges, which felt, weirdly, like a kindness. The engineer nodded to himself in public, which is the engineer’s real applause. Kristina allowed herself to joke that perhaps the dog deserved the mayor’s chair. Dahlia confessed that she had not gone online for thirty-six hours and had not died. He stood under a sky that had been rubbed with milk and tasted, for a minute, no fear.

He nearly missed the shift because it did not come with sound. It came with a glance—Avery’s—over his shoulder toward the tent where colleagues and friends arranged napkins as if napkins were a climate. It came with the set to their mouth that meant they were practicing not saying what their body had already told them. He followed their gaze and saw Jun speaking to a woman in a gray sweater, a woman who held herself the way trees do when a wind tells them they are in for a story. Jun touched the woman’s wrist and the woman looked at her hand as if she had been lent a ring. It was nothing, which is to say it was everything and probably nothing. Jun looked back and their eyes did something that no lens would ever catch because it belonged to a language not yet taught.

He put his hand lightly between Avery’s shoulders the way you steady someone at the top of a wet step and said nothing because neither of them had been invited to interpret a glance that did not belong to them. Avery’s breath sat changefully in their chest and then, because their lungs were experienced, went on. They smiled with the polite animal stillness of a person who has decided to love the future across traffic. He learned a new thing: how to keep a face without freezing it.

Work continued because feelings are terrible at stopping trucks. The silt fence acquired a companion. The men from the province came back in raincoats that tried and failed to amuse. The first delivery of stone arrived for the toe of the dam and he watched boulders roll into their places like heavy bishops in a board game designed by weather. Children wrote on the cones with chalk in a script that would wash away but counted. A woman in a damp blazer with a clipboard that had outlived two elections approached him and asked if ducks were still an issue, and he said yes, like breath, and she laughed as if relieved that something in the world would remain itself.

He made a small speech to volunteers, not filmed, that began with the word thank and ended with nothing. He put his back into carrying a plank shorter than he would have liked and longer than his spine preferred. He filled a wheelbarrow with gravel and felt the distinct, mean pleasure of doing a job with a clear end. He bent down and tied a child’s shoe with a finger that remembered without being told. He did the thing with the hammer where the first nail teaches you not to hit your thumb and the second nail confirms the lesson, and someone put a bandage on him like a joke and called him brave.

That night, exhausted, he went to the bakery because sometimes sweetness is the only religion that will have you. Jun set him at the corner table and fed him a plate with names for things he did not require. Avery brought water and their face was fine, which is the most inspiring and most heartbreaking shape a face ever makes. They invented a game where they named every citizen who had, that day, made a small decision in favor of the city and not their own convenience. It took them fifteen minutes to reach twenty names and he fell in love, temporarily and sufficiently, with every single one.

When they stepped outside, the air had become a temperature he could not name because he had only ever learned nouns for weather. Buildings did their small private work. The river argued less. A duck slept on one leg with its head tucked so deeply into its own back that it seemed not to exist and yet exist entirely. He realized he had not checked the internet in hours and did not miss the mild poison it contained. He put his crown inside his coat and felt, for the length of the walk back to the Pump House, that his head belonged only to him.

He woke to a city slightly richer because of jars and coffee cans and an envelope that had arrived from Saskatoon with a drawing of a drain smiling. He woke to a text from the engineer that used an exclamation mark without embarrassment. He woke to a message from Felix with a photograph of a hat he had already rejected and a note that read: fine, but I bought it anyway. He woke, and breathed, and went to the course to watch men lower rock into water and call it love in a language they did not know they spoke.

By midweek, the hole had begun to look less hungry. The lip had been gentled with geotextile that would keep soil from forgetting itself. The path had a plan for its return that involved layers like cake and patience like soup. People had stopped asking if the city would sell the course and begun asking how they could help close the last gap of the appeal. He watched a boy with a jar of coins stand on tiptoe at the clubhouse desk and pour a ledger of his afternoons into a bucket with a plastic sign, and when the coins knocked the bottom the sound put something in him back on its shelf.

He stood with the mayor and the superintendent and Ms. Leung beside the edge that was no longer a cliff but a stitched seam, and they did not say victory because victory had sharp corners. They said almost. They said soon. They said lunch. He felt the word later become, for once, not a threat but a promise with a chair.

He walked the high loop alone and thought of the woman in gray and the way Jun’s hand had made a ring at her wrist, and he thought: we are all disasters waiting to happen and miracles that have already occurred. He thought of Avery’s breath and of his own absurd history with small wet citizens. He thought of the way the city had taught him to ask and to hold and to stop being only an emblem and start being an extra pair of hands. The geese drew a crooked sentence in the sky and he read the only word he could: go.

He returned to work because there was work and because the cliff, at last, had turned into a step he could learn to climb. The ground, which never apologized, held. The water, which never forgave, obeyed. His fear, which was neither ruler nor servant, sat beside him like a dog taught to wait. He picked up the pencil behind his ear and tried not to stab his own head as he wrote, in a hand that would always disappoint Jun, a list of pipes and pies and prayers. He underlined rope twice and bread not at all. He put the pencil down and picked up a shovel and did the next small thing right.Chapter 9

The day the coffer dam went in like a dark ribbon and the first load of stone found the bottom with the solidity of a promise, the course smelled of wet rope and machine breath and cinnamon from the bakery, which had decided the entire enterprise required sugar hourly. Ivor arrived to find his name on a clipboard in a hand that cared, and a list of tasks ranked not by prestige but by usefulness, which was a small revolution in a town that had sometimes confused hats with jobs. He signed himself up to carry boards and answer questions and talk to a boy about ducks who had decided the entire kingdom of birds was a conspiracy and needed convincing otherwise. The boy’s mother stood with her hands wrapped around her phone like a reliquary and looked grateful to hand him her son as if he were a wooden spoon and she needed both hands to stir.

The boy, whose name was Leban and who had the shoulders of someone who would always be cold in September, demanded to know if the ducks could bite. Ivor said they could if you put bread between your fingers and invitations between your pride, and Leban nodded as if this were a parable he would one day tell to someone smaller. They walked together to the little viewing place by the temporary fence where the water made its brown case and watched the backs of men bend into conviction. Leban asked why men put rocks where water wanted to run and Ivor, who had been waiting all his life to be asked a question like this, said it was because people sometimes helped water remember how to be better at itself, and sometimes they only wanted their shoes dry and pretended that was morality. Leban observed that his shoes were wet and he didn’t mind, which did not solve a policy but soothed a king.

By late morning the engineer had pronounced the first phase un-hypocritical and the superintendent allowed himself to lean on a shovel as if it were a brother. The mayor arrived with a basket from an aunt in Ward Four who baked as if rivals existed, and Dahlia ordered people into photographs with the gentleness of a person trying to seat relatives at a wedding where no one is feuding in public. There was laughter with corners, and there were minutes when Ivor felt the ground under his feet agree to be ground. He collected those minutes as if they were stamps and stored them in the mental album he had begun to carry for days when everything would be a verb that failed to resolve.

The council vote, when it finally arrived clothed in pages and the starch of procedure, did not shout. It took its time and, worse, its measured tone. There were presentations that sounded like bedtime stories told by auditors. Evergreen Works sent a lawyer with a spectacle-chain and a voice that could be poured into molds, and she employed phrases like highest and best use and surplus asset with the casual violence of a butter knife that had learned regret. Ms. Leung, who had decided to wear a brooch shaped like a small river because she had a taste for irony, countered with a list of uses that did not fit in boxes: pulmonary, psychological, ancestral, and the hardest to sell in a chamber, joy. The mayor spoke last, which is the trick of people who like to carry the sound of the room away with them, and she called the course an organ. One could not sell a lung to buy a coat; one could only learn to breathe differently and mend the coat. Two councilors made elegant faces and then pressed the green button for Yes. One pressed red and looked at his hands as if they had stolen something. The motion carried with the soft astonishment of citizens who had expected to need to wrestle more.

On the sidewalk outside, when the news had been translated into hugging and then into texting, Felix put an arm around Ivor in a gesture that had always been more branding than affection and said he would spin it as a triumph of common sense and the open market of decency. Ivor allowed the arm because he had learned the ten-second rule for tolerating unhelpful relatives. He thanked the mayor and recruited her boots for a photograph with a caption that would speak to the kitchen-led faction of town, and he slipped his crown into his pocket with that old, mixed motion that felt like hiding and like saving. He could, for a moment, imagine a week with fewer holes, and the indulgence of that imagination almost humbled him.

Avery and Jun had their own vote at a small wooden table with a gash in it that made the sugar pool when you spilled. The woman in the gray sweater was not an ex, as it turned out, but a curator from a residency program in a prairie town that was not Thunder Bay but belonged to the same latitude of leaving. She had seen Jun’s cups arrive through the hands of women who leave fingerprints like signatures and had come to ask if she would come for two months to make a room of her own and teach children to tame clay with kindness. Two months is both short and a lifetime. Jun’s face did not go anywhere while the woman spoke; it stayed, and Avery’s went everywhere and then politely returned, and Ivor, who had been given permission to be included only because he had arrived to carry a sack of flour upstairs and then couldn’t find his way out of the conversation without stepping on something vital, pretended to become a chair.

They talked without shooting at each other. Avery admitted the thought of air that did not know their name alarmed them, and Jun admitted that the thought of breathing the same air in one place forever alarmed her in equal measure. They spoke very slowly, like people carrying a cake across a street. Avery said they did not want to be the kind of person who asked someone to be smaller, and Jun said she did not want to be the kind of person who made someone learn to live without a hand they had only just learned was theirs. Ivor, who had learned at last when his silence was a contribution, placed two cups on the table and put sugar in neither. When the curator left with a promise to send dates and paperwork and three photographs of a winter that had been beautiful against its own will, Jun sat with both elbows on the table and said it might not be now, and Avery said it might not be never, and the two of them went quiet in the brave way lovers do when they find themselves in a room with a window no one asked for.

The first night walk at the pond was not safe and everyone came anyway. Quacktrackers had organized it with the brisk efficiency of people who had once run a garage sale that paid for a roof. They brought paper bags and tea lights, chalk for children and a bamboo pole with a hook to fetch what fell. Dahlia looked as if the entire concept of darkness personally offended her and then, in recognition of the way memory works when you let it, put down her list and took a candle like the rest. The sign DO NOT BREAD, PLEASE had been wiped by rain and rewritten by a child with a serious mouth and excellent e’s, and above it someone had taped a note that read THANK YOU FOR TRYING anyway. The water received all this with the same attention it gave day and mud.

A man with a harmonica who always stood too close to microphones played the one tune he had that sounded like resignation forgiven. People lined the path in a human strand. The teenagers tried very hard at first to be too casual and then, because their bodies contain more truth than their mouths, surrendered to the beauty of holding something that burned and did not punish. Ivor stood without his crown between a nurse and a boy with a cast and thought about the times he had made himself small to pass through a room, and how tonight he was the size he was and it did not rupture anything. The mayor spoke very briefly about people who do not belong to committees and how they were, tonight, her favorite committee. Aunt Mirabel cried once and then pretended she had only sneezed, which made three former librarians hand her tissues as if they were passing a secret among bees.

He had practiced for this moment because the world had taught him that something would ask him to be braver than his story. It came as a foolish thing. A duck, young and too confident, had found a loop of fishing line that did not belong at Mill Pond and had accepted it around its neck like a gift from a careless cousin. It paddled near the edge and snagged the line on a reed, and the reed made a promise to the water that it would hold and did, and in that small geometry the bird found itself attached to this world in a ruinous way. People noticed and then did the city’s favorite thing, which is to talk about solutions as if solutions were pastries on a tray. Someone suggested animal services. Someone else suggested a song. A child put a hand to his mouth so he would not tell the duck it was pretty, because he knew naming things doesn’t help when they are strangled.

Avery did the motion with their body that meant they were about to go into the wrong place for love, and he put a hand on their wrist in a language they had invented together that said wait. He took off his shoes because he had learned that rituals matter, even the foolish ones, and he stepped carefully down the sloped bank to the place where water looks less like a threat and more like a decision. The first cold swallowed the ankle and then the calf in the blunt, kind way of water, and his breath deserted him and then returned and sat down politely. The duck made the little gold coin eye that had once felt like a sentence and tonight felt like a noun only. He spoke without words because the dark and the candlelight and the crowd insisted on quiet, and he took hold of the reed and bent it as if asking a person to come a little closer.

The line was cheap and mean. It resisted like stubbornness. He lifted the reed until his hand shook, and he felt Avery beside him in the water before he registered their step, and together they made a small doorway with their arms and Jun passed between them with the scissors she had carried because she always put tools into pockets. The duck stilled, perhaps because it was pinned by attention, perhaps because even birds know when hands intend not to harm. Jun cut the line with that grim gentleness some people possess around knots. The reed sprang back away with a noise he would remember in sleep, the absence of tension. The duck flapped once and became violently itself, and then not at all itself because it was everywhere, a smear of wet freedom that made the front row of citizens gasp and the harmonica player find his key again.

He stood in the water longer than necessary because pride wanted to make ritual out of it, and he stepped out only when Aunt Mirabel said, in a voice that had raised him, that there was no holiness in getting pneumonia. The candles did their small work of making people’s faces rounder and less angular. The rumor that the King had put his hands in the water would spread in ways he had not consented to, and it would be useful to him and unkind and exact, which is what rumors are designed to be. He squeezed the hem of his trousers like a man who had dared and then remembered laundry, and he laughed at himself, and the laugh hurt less than it had in spring.

The next morning he found an envelope with Saskatoon on it and opened it on the stoop like a child who cannot wait and is not punished for it. The girl had drawn a duck with a cape and an exclamation mark that looked like a melting spoon, and she had written that she wished the King could come to her school and tell the principal that bread was not food for ducks or people, but also that sometimes she ate bread and felt guilty and then remembered guilt is not a food either and felt better. She enclosed, with the gravity of a diplomat, two Canadian Tire money bills and a sticker of a potato with shoes. He put the bills with the coin and the other talismans and considered writing a letter about fishing line and scissors and how bravery sometimes requires three sets of hands and a reed that forgives you. He did write eventually, with a drawing that made Jun bark a laugh and say he had invented a new bird they could sell at the bakery.

Willow Hands did not take their problem, or more precisely, their desire, and go home. They sued with the courtesy of people who had learned that litigation gets you into rooms where sentences are shorter and chairs are more expensive. The suit alleged dereliction and favoritism and a municipal romance with grass. There were paragraphs that read as if written by a person who had never had mud on their knees, and the language had that special glassy finish you get when words have been polished by people who do not intend to touch them. Ivor sat with the city attorney, a woman who measured her coffee like punishment and had a genius for not blinking at men who wished their fathers were present, and he read the lines about ducks with the calm of a man who had recently looked into an eye that had once terrified him and seen only himself unreflected.

The court date would be months in the future, a time that seemed both too near and a story someone else would tell. In the meantime, the residency dates arrived like luggage. Jun had been offered January and February because in that place winter was a fact you could learn to teach, and the children did not mind because their mouths made steam when they said their names and that made a joke out of life. Avery and Jun sat with a calendar and a teapot and discovered that love looks like a train schedule if you stare at it too closely, and they decided as people do, badly and with mercy. Jun would go for four weeks, then come home for the fundraiser that had to be thrown in March because the engineer required a second stage and money has two speeds in a town, and then go back to finish before the sap rose. In April she would return, and in May they would put their names on a lease for a studio Jun had found behind a shop that sold light fixtures with guilt.

Fear did not leave work undone in the meantime. The new pipe found its bed and wore its gravel like a blanket. The coffer dam kept its shoulder against the pond and allowed men with boots to stand where water would eventually drink. The superintendent and the mayor invented a handshake that looked like a map, and Ms. Leung produced from her bag a piece of paper written by someone in the province who had disliked them for years but disliked, more, the idea of a brochure with his name on it. Dahlia strategized love and optics until both words tired and then she gave them cookies because decency exhausts all of us. The border collie learned to carry a glove and return it to the person who had dropped it and the person cried because she had not been given anything by surprise in months.

The bell in the Pump House, ever private, rang once on a Tuesday because no one had asked it to. Ivor stood under it with a mug in his hand and a smear of apricot jam he would later find on his collar and let himself be superstitious. He went to the course in a coat that had learned which way the wind came from and stood at the edge that had become, almost, a line very like a path. He watched a duck sleep in the posture that once would have made him leave a room and now made him decide to wait to see it wake. He saw, in the slope of its back and the small firm trust of the tucked beak, something he had not allowed himself before, which was permission to be looked at and not be harmed. He did not cry because he was sick of crying and sick of apologizing for not crying. He did that more difficult thing, which was to stand still and forgive himself for needing everyone.

By the time the first snow decided to come properly and stay for a while, the rock at the foot of the dam had set its mind, and the engineers wrote winter memos in a handwriting that had met too many winters. The course was quiet and not quiet the way January is a blanket that has been told a joke. They rope-walked the back loop after dustings to make sure no one went for a heroic slide, and the cones wore little hats of snow that made children confer upon them names and crimes. The appeal fund ticked the last small box before the holidays because a man who had lived a long time with a woman who forgot him had remembered, last year, to write a clause about ponds into a will, and the clause arrived with less drama than anyone had thought probate could allow.

The residency had a sendoff at the bakery because sugar insists on being used as fuel for goodbyes. Jun served cookies cut into provinces with the imprecision love allows, and Avery packed a small suitcase with the seriousness of someone trying to fold bravery in layers. Ivor gave Jun a drawing of a pipe with arms that he had made after several drafts because it is hard to draw things that save without needing to make a halo, and Jun kissed his cheek in the way a sister would be allowed to kiss a brother if kings had sisters and countries agreed. They promised all the modern ways of staying, and then they added the old ones: letters with stamps, a stone carried in a pocket and warmed by a palm, a rule that anyone may cry only on buses and then only looking out the window. The train did not wait, which is the train’s secret kindness, and when it left, it pulled a sound from Avery that was not old and was not new, which is to say it was present and not pretending.

When the first week of quiet had rubbed its dullness into the bakery and the course and his bones, the city sent him a gift without knowing it had been ordered. It was a call from a school about a duck. A duck had walked into a foyer because the world is sometimes that sort of comedy, and it had not been afraid of children because it was too busy being wrong, and the custodian had done the thing custodians in this town are trained to do, which is to be kind while summoning the correct paperwork. He drove with Luis through air that had decided to be blue for once, and he arrived to find a duck waiting in a corner near a poster that told children to use words with the same care they used scissors. The duck had a piece of tape on its wing from someone’s art class and the air of a person who has taken a bus to the wrong end of a line. He asked everyone to step back without sounding like a man who asks, and he crouched as if proposing and reached with the deliberate slowness the internet despises and governments should study. He took the tape off as if it were a story he had told wrong and could correct, and the duck, who owed him nothing and gave him everything, allowed it. It turned its head and looked, and he did not flinch, and that was the entire miracle. The children clapped, which is the miracle’s little brother.

He did not tell anyone until later because he had learned the taste of small joys is best unshared at first. He walked out into the parking lot with a smile that had no scaffolding and he let the cold cut it into something he could carry. He stood for a minute by the car and pressed the old coin in his pocket and tried to remember the hamsters’ names and failed and promised to look, and the sky made the sound of a bird you cannot see and he decided it was approval and not warning. He went to work because there was nothing else left a king of this sort could do.

The winter of work became a season and then a language. He learned the names of men who owned trucks because they had terrible breakdowns on exactly the wrong day and came anyway. He learned a woman could wear three sweaters and still be cold if she was the kind who kept a city’s receipts, and he learned how to make a kettle do a little arithmetic. He learned he could miss someone without making a hole of it every hour. He learned to sleep sometimes without counting ducks. He learned to wake on a Monday to a bell that did not ring and not give it meaning. He learned to stand on the coffer dam with the engineer and taste the one degree shift in a plan and to prefer that shift to victory.

On a Sunday that was more glass than sky, the Quacktrackers did a thing no one had asked for and everyone needed. They posted a photograph, taken silently in November by a child who had not told anyone because children are more faithful to future narratives than we are, of Ivor standing in the pond with a reed bent against his fear and a scissors held like a trust by a woman whose hands had recently held dough. There was no caption, which was a lesson they were proud to teach us. The comments were fewer than a person used to the internet would expect, and more kind. Someone circled the hem of his trousers with a heart and wrote in three languages: thank you for having legs. Someone else asked if the duck had a name and was told by six people, patiently, that it had many names and none that mattered because it had been permitted to leave.

Avery, seeing the photo on a lunch break at the bakery where the bread did not rise as well because the kitchen had been laughing too much to knead with seriousness, sent him a message that contained only a picture of a kettle and the word brave. He answered with a picture of his ridiculous crown, shiny and apologetic, and the word water, and this was, between them, sufficient. He went home to the Pump House and stood under the bell that would not ring on command and felt both lucky and invented. He put his hands on the railing as if it were a back he could rub, and the house did nothing, which felt like permission.

Two days later, because the city can hold sweetness and discord in the same palm and claim to prefer neither, a letter arrived with the crest of the court and a date in April that would require him to wear a suit and sit with men who believed a pond is a feature and not a memory. He sighed with the resigned acceptance of a man who has stood in water in November and therefore can now stand most things. He pinned the date on the corkboard between a menu Jun had written in a hurry and a child’s drawing of him holding a duck the size of a car, and he felt prepared in the way that removes the sting from dread. He had work to do before then. He had gravel to move and hands to hold and, if the weather allowed, lungs to walk.

On the last night of February, the residency sent back its first box. It contained cups that looked like choices, and a scarf that had been knitted by a person who claimed never to have knitted before and had plainly been lying their entire life, and a letter so full of fumes from the studio he could smell Jun’s hair. She had written that the children had learned to make small bowls for seeds and they would plant sunflower armies in spring beside a fence that had asked to be changed into a trellis. She wrote that another woman's hands had found hers once in the cold without asking and had let go without owning, and that this had not been a betrayal, it had been proof of the world. She wrote that she had not eaten bread because there was none but that she had dreamed of buns shaped like crowns and then woken up and laughed with her mouth open. She wrote love three times, none of them to him, all of them including him.

He went to sleep with the scarf against his face like an old-fashioned man, which is to say like a person, and in the morning he dressed without checking the internet. He carried the box to the bakery and left it there because it belonged there, and he went to the course and stood at the edge and laid a hand on the top stone and felt, for the first time since the hole had been an unsentence in the earth, that his hand had been asked and not imposed. He broadened his stance because the ground liked it better, and he breathed, and when a duck walked past him with that insistent ridiculousness, he did not name it and he did not flinch. He said good morning because there was no one to correct him. He said it again because there was pleasure in the practice. He turned toward work because a city is a thing you say yes to one small piece at a time, and he had sworn to keep saying it until someone relieved him or the bell rang him out. He laughed at nothing. The day did not take it back.Chapter 10

The thaw did not arrive with trumpets. It crept in with wet cuffs and a smell like old pennies, and every boot in town sighed in resignation. Snow retreated into the corners in a sulk; grass tried on the color green in patches that looked like the beginnings of a quilt no one had agreed to finish. At Copper Beech the coffer dam kept its dark shoulder where it had been told and the rock sat as if it had invented patience. The path, still absent, had become a story people told to themselves when they walked: here a bend, here a pine, here the place where Kian had dropped his clipboard and confessed a secret to the superintendent by accident. Ivor found that his body preferred this weather, plain and poor, to any heroics. He could put his hands into things without asking the air for permission.

Dahlia built a fundraiser the way some women build shelves after a breakup, with competence that bordered on revenge. She named it Holdfast Fair so the posters would rhyme with the donation page, and she insisted on three kinds of bun because science had yet to decide whether lemon or cinnamon or plain sugar fixed a city best. Ms. Leung arranged tables and swore allegiance to folding chairs, and the mayor learned a new speech that contained the sentence “we do not sell lungs” and practiced it in the mirror while adjusting a necklace that had belonged to her grandmother. Quacktrackers signed up to stand by maps and point at culverts as if they were landmarks on a pilgrimage, and Felix promised a silent auction that would not be silent because the auctioneer was his friend and rarely hush. Kian faxed himself in the school office because this made him feel political and then turned up with a laminated chart that had been corrected with kindness by a math teacher who understood mercy was part of curriculum.

There were days in the lead-up when Ivor wondered if his usefulness could be counted in boards moved and hands shaken. The city had become a machine built from people who said yes in small ways. He added his yes where it fit, fetching an extension cord from a closet that had once held humiliation and now held paper hearts, carrying a tub of ice as if transporting a delicate idea. At night he slept with his phone on the table turned face down and told his mind it could whine in the morning. The bell in the cupola did not ring. He took this as consent to proceed.

The first whisper of mischief came in the form of a video with unpleasant cheer. Silly things travel faster than sense. Someone—Felix’s assistant or a volunteer with more enthusiasm than confidentiality—posted a clip from a rehearsal, a throwaway moment when Ivor, half in costume and half in himself, had said to a child that he would sell his crown if it would buy the path back. It was a joke and not a joke, a thing said to a ten-year-old with licorice on his tongue as if licorice could fix budgets. Willow Hands clipped it down to the sentence “I would sell my crown” and posted it with the caption: KING READY TO CASH OUT, and an emoji of a money bag. He watched it on Luis’s phone in the car with the sort of exhaustion that turns outrage into a shrug. Dahlia did not shrug. She went to war with four emails and a phone call and a text sent to a cousin of the assistant, and within forty minutes the caption read: KING READY TO PITCH IN, and the money bag had been replaced with a hand. It was a small victory in a week that required several.

When the Holdfast Fair finally happened, the town dressed itself like a person trying to look casual for a photograph. The heritage hall took bunting the way an old woman takes compliments. The nurses came in a knot and were immediately put to work at the tea table because competence is always conscripted. The weatherwoman entered with hair that defied barometric pressure and her own donations: two signed umbrellas and a promise to stand in the rain where told. Jun had returned on the overnight bus because the residency had an attendance policy but she had an attendance policy of her own, and she arrived with a suitcase that smelled like clay and a bag of croissants that had been flirted with by a porter. Avery picked her up at the station and stood on the platform for a long minute with their face tucked into her neck as if the architecture of that act could hold for a season.

The auction began politely and ended with maudlin delight. A local carpenter offered a bench made of repurposed course boards, and Aunt Mirabel bid it up to an offensive sum and then gave it to the library as if she had been planning this theft for years. The man from Evergreen Works who had told Ivor his mother walked Thursdays sent a note with a donation and the sentence “I’m off duty today,” and Ivor put it in his pocket with the coin and the letter in which the Saskatoon girl had drawn a drain with eyelashes. Children put quarters into a jar and did not count the quarters. Kian’s graph, wrong as ever and therefore beloved, was displayed on an easel and signed by three people who had never signed a graph before and seemed changed by it.

He spoke early because the mayor told him to and because his nerves preferred to be useful. He thanked more people than he had thought possible to thank without becoming a parody. He said the line about lungs and borrowed the mayor’s cadence and then returned it better. He confessed that the path had taught him the difference between a city and a brochure and that he was not, it turned out, a mascot. He said that he would put his hands into anything you handed him that day, including dough, and the bakers made him regret it by handing him a bowl as large as his regrets. He kneaded badly in front of a camera and the camera forgave him because dough does not care for optics.

There was almost a disaster. Because events attract gravity, a speaker placed on a borrowed riser thought about falling and then committed to the thought. The riser tilted; a choir of librarians slid toward the edge like kindly penguins. Ivor stepped without thinking for once in the direction danger travels and put both hands against the wood. Avery, arriving to help, was the second weight the moment required, and together they held long enough for the screws to remember loyalty. The choir steadied and then sang because that is who they were. Later, someone would text him a video of his face during that tilt, all concentration and a little panic and a lot of bread flour, and the internet would, briefly and incomprehensibly, call him steady.

After the fair, which made money and stories in equal portions, the problem transformed in the exact way problems do when laws remember themselves. A letter arrived at the Pump House and then at the mayor’s desk and then, because such things are contagious, on Felix’s phone while he was eating a sandwich, and it contained the words temporary injunction. The conservation group that did not wish to be confused with Quacktrackers and had a name like a tree with a Latin degree filed it with a good intention that got lost on the way to the clerk. The city must, it said, pause all nonessential work on the pond to allow for a full seasonal assessment of migratory habitat. The engineer’s language went gray. Kristina swore gently. The superintendent folded his hat like a letter and put it in his pocket and then, after a breath, took it out again because his head felt wrong without it.

They were not being punished for malice but for the mortal sin of doing anything before someone with a seal said they could. It would be months, the letter suggested, and then, in a paragraph that could be cut into butter, allowed the possibility of a review of the injunction in two weeks if the city brought evidence of imminent harm. Ms. Leung told him, in the firm voice that had once taught a man not to bring his own stapler to a meeting, that the harm would have to be written in a way a judge could kiss. He imagined drafting a sonnet about water deciding to make a habit of eating paths and realized he had slept too little.

He went to the course the afternoon the pause began and found an odd quiet, as if the machines were choosing not to be offended. The dog with the portfolio sat with her head cocked, listening to consonants humans could not. The coffer dam, still permitted because it held rather than intruded, kept its posture. A mallard hen walked along the mud with the preoccupied competence of someone grocery shopping in an unfamiliar store. He stood at the rope and felt his breath fall into the old habit of being small in his chest. He took it by the ear and led it back into his ribs the way he had been taught. He did not kick at anything. He sat on the bench and allowed himself, for a minute, to indulge in the longing to be an unimportant person who did not know what a temporary injunction was.

The bell at the Pump House did not ring that night. The furnace did instead, making a clean noise that reassured him about his pipes and nothing else. He made tea and stood at the window and watched, across the street, a man remove his Christmas lights from an under-eave with the solemnity of a surgeon. The phone lit up on the table with a message from Jun that contained a photograph of a child holding a bowl with uneven walls and a thumbs-up that occupied most of the frame. He felt that small wash of gladness that arrives without an invoice and went to bed before it could be argued with.

There are other kinds of letters besides injunctions. One arrived postmarked Saskatoon with a stamp that looked like a fox having a dignified day. The girl wrote that her hamsters had evolved new preferences and she had learned that preference was not the same as principle but that sometimes they made the same faces. She wrote that her mother had lost a job and then found one and that she had discovered people could be strong and scared at the same time, and that this had made her less angry at grown-ups for lying by omission. She enclosed a drawing of a judge with wings. “I don’t know if judges have wings,” she wrote, “but they should, because they are supposed to be above things and also because wings look good.” He laughed without making noise and wrote back that he had met judges who did not appear to fly but did sometimes float.

The mayor brought whisky to the Pump House in a thermos like a teenager and sat with him at the kitchen table under the polite tyranny of the white ceiling. She told him a story about her first committee, when a man with the kind of eyebrows that make women tired had explained liability to her for forty minutes and then asked her if she understood, and she had smiled and said she would show him how understanding worked and then gone to the clerk’s office and learned the building code by hand. “We will outlast this,” she said, not confident so much as practiced. “We will bring a thousand small truths into that room with the seal. We will not be out-grieved by a brochure.”

“You talk like Aunt Mirabel,” he said, and she looked pleased, as if he had called her a cook.

The pause created a vacuum, and vacuums ask to be filled. The Quacktrackers decided, with the kind of cunning that should be harnessed for bridges, to fill it with work that could not be enjoined. They scheduled a culvert walk under the name of a birthday party because they had learned bureaucracy cannot be everywhere at once if cake is involved. They carried garbage bags with the solemnity of rosaries. Children made a crown for the dog out of bramble and she wore it for six feet and then removed it without hurting anyone’s feelings. Aunt Mirabel sent a thermos of soup with a note that read, in uncompromising capitals, EAT THIS BEFORE YOU SAY SOMETHING YOU’LL REGRET. He took a cup and discovered it was, in fact, a form of civic restraint.

On a thin morning, when ice argued with itself at the edge of the pond and lost rhythmically, Jun confessed something that changed the texture of the day without altering the plot. They sat at the bakery’s small high table and ate toast that did not apologize, and she said, in a voice that had learned to carry risk in a pocket, that she had kissed someone at the residency. It had been after a night when the kiln failed to be interesting and they had drunk a cautious amount of beer and shared a ridiculous story about teachers. It had been not a betrayal so much as a rehearsal for a life. “I wanted you to know from me and not from a city with an internet,” she said, and Avery, whose face could hold a classroom and a storm, put their palms flat on the table as if to keep the toast from deciding anything and said that they were the kind of person who liked to be told rather than tidied. There was no performance of nobility. There was the more difficult work of allowing both pain and continued kindness to occupy the same wooden surface.

Afterward, Ivor and Avery walked the high loop because some conversations require wind. Avery did not ask for advice because they had learned the hard way that advice is lava disguised as cake, and he did not offer it because he had learned the same lesson by different route. He said instead the thing that had once saved his mouth from debate: “You deserve a life as large as your lungs.” Avery laughed once, bitterly and friendly at the same time, and said their lungs had never been the problem; it was everything that tried to fit in them. They talked about loyalty the way people talk about bridges, not as fixed architecture but as something maintained and walked daily. When they got back to the tent, both of them looked tired and alive.

The injunction hearing arrived in its small suit and then postponed itself because the judge had a funeral and then a cold and then a clerk who left for a baby. The pause acquired days like burrs. The engineer became poetical at odd moments and then apologized, which was worse. He and Ms. Leung built a document that could teach a stranger the smell of wet rope. The mayor rehearsed in a mirror until she could say the phrase adaptive management without sounding like a daycare. Dahlia stalked the edges of social media like a border collie without a flock and bit no one. Kristina discovered that teenagers who cannot be trusted with their own curfew can be trusted absolutely with a stack of signs and a charging drill.

A storm arrived late to its own party and tried to remind them of scale. The river swelled like an ankle. The pond pressed its shoulder into the coffer dam and found, to its surprise, that people had finally placed something in the correct place with sufficient thought. Debris came, as debris does, in moods. A long limb wandered down from a tree whose patience had been razored by wind and fetched itself against the dark rib of the dam and refused to move, the way grief anchors to whatever resists. Men with poles prodded it without elegance. Ivor put his shoulder against a landscape rake and pushed until pushing made a sound in his throat like apology. Avery waded without swearing and the dog barked once in encouragement and once in boredom. The limb went at last and the water sighed as if relieved to be given a task.

He had a little episode behind the equipment shed that would not, by any measure except his own, be called a collapse. He leaned his head against the cool of a metal door and let his breath draw a square. He waited until the square warmed and then he drew another. He wanted Aunt Mirabel and also a kingdom without courts. He wanted the bell to ring and God to stop letter-writing. He wanted, also, soup, always soup. He went back to the pond and did not ask the world to be less complex. He asked it to give him two things he could do before lunch, and the world obliged. He picked up rope. He moved cones three feet to the left.

The fundraiser receipts came in a wave, and the wave had, between its foam, an odd shell. A man with a name that had once gotten him places sent a check payable to Copper Beech Golf Estates. It was deliberate and clever and petty and for the wrong amount. Ms. Leung returned it with a note that she asked him to read aloud to his mirror, and he did not reply, which counted as reply. The weatherwoman came by the tent and told him that her show had gotten letters from people asking her to say pond names on air the way some programs play song requests, and she had promised never to say Willow Hands. He loved her suddenly and temporarily in the way one loves someone who protects your nouns.

March arrived with a decision to be bright and cold. The court was rescheduled for a Tuesday, which was democracy’s cruel way of making tyranny inconvenient. The residency sent a photograph of Jun standing in a field of snow holding a cup the size of a story, and Avery hung it by their bed with a piece of painter’s tape and a promise never to take it down in a fit. The Saskatoon girl wrote again with a sketch of a pond wearing mittens and asked if he could come speak at her class, and he wrote back that he was learning to say no to things that made him a hero, but that he would absolutely send the class a piece of rope with a diagram about knots that had saved a city.

The morning of the hearing, he put on the suit he had not worn since the swan had made him a verb and he stood in the mirror and did not practice his face. He had decided his face would do. Ms. Leung handed him a folder that felt like a bouquet composed of graphs, and the mayor gave him a sentence that began with because, which is always a gift. Dahlia put a hand flat against his back and did not move it until he inhaled, which is her secret witchcraft. The courtroom was less grand than people imagine but more formal than felt necessary, a room where chairs had rights. Evergreen Works had brought a lawyer with a stare you could stand on and a suit that did not remember breath. The conservation group had brought a fellow with a beard that had opinions and a binder that looked like compost.

He spoke when asked and did not make a speech, which should be taught to leaders before arithmetic. He described without pride the day the path had become not-path. He described the water’s memory. He described the work, not as heroism but as revision. He said he had put his hands in the pond because a bird wore a thread that was killing it, and he did not say he had been asked by something older than either of them. The judge listened with the peculiar kindness of someone who must look cruel later to maintain the fiction of order. The lawyer for the conservation society, who had disliked him out of habit, decided in that moment that a man frightened of ducks who stands in ponds might be permitted to believe he had done a correct thing once.

They won a thin victory, which arrived like a slice of cake on a plate you do not own. The injunction would be narrowed to allow work confined to the coffer dam and the installation of the pipe that had already been promised a bed. The path would remain forbidden to itself until the late spring when small birds had done the work they do in reeds and the engineers had submitted one more set of numbers that looked like rain in a grid. The room exhaled the way people do when they have had a tooth filled: grateful, resentful, relieved to be allowed to go on.

Outside, in the blunt plain air of midmorning, he and the mayor and Ms. Leung stood like children who had gotten away with something that was only good. Felix arrived wearing the hat Ivor had approved and tried to talk them into a press hit, and the mayor told him to take his hat and wear it where the sun couldn’t negotiate. He left, miraculously, without sulking. Dahlia bought them three coffees that tasted like the beginning of something and forbade them to mention optics until dinner. He returned to the course with the document in his pocket, ready to show it to a dog.

There is a private glory in returning to a place with news it can use. Kristina listened as if the paper had a pulse and then said, with a grin he had not seen since July, “Shovels at two,” and the superintendent smiled the smile of a man who had needed to be told yes by a door. The engineer called the dam a handsome contraption, which is the way engineers say handsome, and the dog carried her glove to everyone as if fairness demanded it. He stood at the edge and put his hand in his pocket and found, among coin and rope and child drawings, the letter from Saskatoon, and he touched it as if paper could change engineering. Perhaps it could. The boy Leban returned with his shoulders and a question about whether geese could sue, and Ivor explained that in this city they were already winning and would we please not arm them further.

Jun left again because duty is a love story as much as return is. The second parting was worse because their bodies now knew the distance in muscle. Avery did not attempt to be noble; they permitted themselves to be low for a day in the way one keeps a pen tied to a desk with string, knowing one will need it again. He sat with them without announcing comfort like a vendor. They played cards badly and allowed the rules to be a reason to sit. They did not prognosticate. It turns out prophecy is unhelpful in kitchens.

Work resumed and took the shape of songs sung under breath. They set rock at the toe where water would bully it later and be rebuffed. They laid cloth that had learned how to be earth. They placed, at last, the pipe with its mouth in the old channel like a trumpet that refused to play. They looked at each other the way people do when a thing that felt like idea becomes object. The conservation officer with a binder came and allowed himself to smile with only his eyes. The mayor announced at a microphone that the hole was now an argument rather than a fact, and the room with the microphones applauded. The coffer dam did not comment. Work—in the oldest sense of the word—had been honored.

As the month changed, a rumor insisted upon entering the building like a cat. Someone at Willow Hands had sent out, in error or brilliance, a preview flyer for a summer series of concerts at the pond that did not yet exist, with a photograph that turned out to be Copper Beech under a different sun. Dahlia acquired the flyer with the efficiency of a vacuum and brought it to the mayor, who brought it to the city attorney, who wrote a letter with so much correct in it it could have taught Venus manners. There was a small exchange of emails that smelled of sweat and perfume, and the flyer was recalled. The internet, baffled by competence, turned to a video of a child putting a spoon on her nose, and the city was spared, for an hour, the necessity of having a single narrative.

The bell in the cupola rang once, almost idly, on a Thursday when nothing had been scheduled to change. He looked up from a list of bolts and forms as if the ceiling had said his name. He went outside because superstition is simply a story that has applied for a job. The sky was a polite blue. The pond wore a dull sheen like a woman in a dress she had been told was correct and did not adore. A duck watched him, bored, and then, in a motion so simple it removed a decade from his body, turned away without ceremony. He laughed and did not apologize to the air. He walked back to the course and picked up the end of a rope and allowed his hands to do the thinking.

Spring was not truly here, not yet, but there were children with chalk and arguments about seeds and a woman by the pump who had decided to forgive her sister because the light made her tired of being correct. The court date sat on a calendar like a small stubborn magnet, not moving, exactly, but insisting. He had learned, by now, to let the insisting object stay. He had soup to carry. He had a city to hold with a hand that would never be as large as the job and would always be warmer than the hat. He had two people he loved inventing a method for not breaking over distance and, perhaps, two dozen more he would admit to if backed into an honest corner. He had a sign that still read DO NOT BREAD, PLEASE in a child’s stern script, and the pleasures of obeying it.

The last day of March was a Saturday and the course held a small practice open in which no one was permitted to win. People came to celebrate the almost, which is a religion in towns like this. He wore the crown for forty minutes and then put it in his pocket because his head needed the air. He shook hands with a man who had promised to hate him and then discovered he did not have the stamina. He watched the superintendent raise a paper cup like a man who had been asked to give a toast at a wedding between two lawful entities and declared, with the gravity of men who mow, that the path would return, and when it did it would be walked ceremoniously and then rudely and then normally, which was the goal.

The sun went down as if it had somewhere particular to be. The dog, job done, slept with her paws in the dream of running. The engineers folded their maps with the tenderness you reserve for letters from people who once sat with you in cars in the rain. The mayor went home and allowed herself to swear, privately, once, for pleasure. Dahlia texted him a single thumbs-up and then a picture of her feet in a bath the color of surrender. He stood at the edge a last minute and looked at the place that had been a mouth and was now a seam. He said, out loud because the ducks had given him back his arrogance, that he would keep going if the ground did, and the ground, in its stingy way, did not bother to answer. He accepted the non-answer as consent. He went home in a coat with small rocks in the hem and did not shake them out, because some days he liked the weight.

April would bring a day in a courtroom with polished wood and pencils and men prepared to be disappointed. It would bring another letter from a prairie town with a smell like kiln and cold promises. It would bring a photograph of a girl in Saskatoon with a hamster lodged in the crook of her arm like a sentence she would not let go. It would bring dull rain and sharp light and a decision about whether a pond is memory or feature. It would bring, he suspected, more of the same, which he had stopped insulting by calling it ordinary. He turned off the kitchen light with the care of a man who saved electricity as a sport and went to sleep hearing the pump doing its faithful hum beneath the floor and a city sleeping on a bed it had made, lumpy, generous, intact.
