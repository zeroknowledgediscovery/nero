At dawn the river wore a scarf of fog, and the stone pillars under the St. Marys Bridge were slick as whale backs. He sat there, the ogre, with his knees pulled up close. In the soaked, brown water he saw his great head reflected and did not like it. He never did. Still, he watched until the fog braided itself thin and the hum of commuters became a constant ribbon. Then he scooted backward, away from the water, into the hutch of shadow, where an old milk crate served as his table.

Micheal's fingers were thick and pale as dough, wrinkled from the damp, and the smartphone made them look thicker. It was a cheap phone, with a plastic shield scratched to an unfixable haze, but it lit his face up anyway, made him into a soft blue moon. He had learned only three apps. He only needed one most mornings, the blue one with the f. He had learned to point the camera, pinch with thumb and finger, tilt the shot, and find the small tools to make it not raw—filters, that was the word. The photos weren’t of faces. He knew better, though he wouldn’t have said why. He photographed thumbs.

Some thumbs were stubby, like carrots. Others were fine and narrow, a little bowed, ends shining with a thin crescent of bitten nail. Some had band-aids. Some had ink on them, careless purple. They were funny, in an odd way. A small parade of small things. Micheal posted them to a page he’d named Thumbs of the City, it was public, and he wrote captions like: lucky little star, and heroes come in pairs, and remember me by this. He tagged no one. He used twenty-six emojis when he wanted to be noisy and none when he wished to be grave. People shared his posts. People commented: weird but kinda cute, and bro what are you doing. Several said it had to be a prank. Several said creep vibes. He did not answer them. He did not answer anyone.

He had a hat that used to be an order-taker's visor from a chicken place, now turned backward; under it, his hair was sparse as unkempt grass along summer railroad tracks. The ogre didn’t think of himself as an ogre, except when he was forced to act like one. He had found the word in a book once in the library that permitted him in the mornings if he promised never to sleep in the chairs. He had promised. He had learned to hold the promise like a smooth river stone in his teeth.

He’d found the word ogre and thought: oh. That. Not monster exactly. Sadness with teeth. He had closed the book with both hands and looked around. Everyone breathed. Everyone coughed. His grief twisted and was, for a few breaths, smaller.

When he taunted children, he did it with nouns, not fists. He liked to step out from the shadow of a light pole and ask them their names in a voice like a cuckoo clock. You—what are you called? And you—what is it you want? He would squat and point at their shoes and say, You tied those yourself, didn’t you? Crooked, but brave. He would ask for a thumb. Show me the thumbs up, kiddo. Good. It made him feel like the rim of a mug clinking a tooth. He did not take anything. He did not even step too close. He would wait until the school bus swallowed them. It was important to be seen and not seen. That was how he remained both story and shadow.

On mornings like this one, a jogger passed and glanced into his shelter and did not stop. The jogger wore headphones with neon tips and a sweatshirt from a 5K in Sandusky. Micheal whispered the word Sandusky, liked the sand and the sky rubbing in it, and then set his phone on his crate and wiped the condensation off the camera lens with his sleeve. There would be more children soon—little scouts with backpacks, lunchboxes that clicked like beetles, parents pulling them with two fingers at the shoulder of their coats. He didn't want to be cruel. He told himself that often. He wanted to remember something correctly. The shape of a hand. The trust that was there once, in a kitchen he could not afford to visit even in thought. He would take pictures of thumbs and stack them like stones where anyone might see. And someone, he hoped, would read his captions in the voice of grief and not the voice of glee. Probably not. People were like the river in spring—fast, churning, full of sticks.

Seranella was not a morning person, but the class schedule had bored into her life like a woodpecker, so she arrived on campus at 8:05 with hair braided and tucked behind one ear, a tote bag full of papers, and the particular chalk she preferred wrapped in tissue. She was a professor of folklore and social media—at least that was what she told undergraduates who wanted something quick, an angle that would land them a headline or two. Her tenure file said cultural rhetorics and digital communities. Fort Wayne fit her like a geode does your palm. Tutored by railroads, rust, rivers, new breweries. At the coffee shop on Calhoun they greeted her by name and handed her a mug before they asked what she wanted. Often, in the morning, she wanted silence. Often, she wanted to find something that was not irony.

In her office, the plant her spouse had called an "impossible snake" undulated through its pot and tapped the glass of the window. She set down the tote, poured herself what remained of yesterday's water, sat and turned on the secondhand monitor. She had an alert system she checked before email. It flagged things. She had found a way to track certain kinds of viral growth within the city’s social media ecosystems—memes about bad weather, posts about potholes, lost dogs, neighborhood watches, missing black gloves, the sudden talk of coyotes near the greenway, rumors of fireworks in October. It was how she studied urban myth in real time. It was how she had once intercepted a campus panic about poisoned Halloween candy and another about a woman in a white van. She clicked. She scrolled.

Thumbs. The alert system had found a curve that was not a usual curve. A page, newish, with a following that was both local and weirdly tender. Thumbs of the City. The handle running it was nothing like a person’s name. LaundrySalt. There were dozens of photos of thumbs. They were strangely artful. In some you could see the Maplecrest bridge in soft focus behind the thumb. In one, a thumb rose up against a mural east of Broadway that said YOU ARE NEEDED HERE in letters the color of toothpaste. In another, a thumb perched on a bench with gum fossils as if it were waiting its turn to rest. Captions wobbled between nursery rhyme and something more—weather reports made for a single heart, sometimes. Be brave in the rain, little soldier. Her mouth twisted. She had a student named Liam who would have devoured this as a case study in small-scale virality and the aesthetics of creep. Her stomach did a small flip. She looked at the comments. Does anyone else think this is super odd, asks a user named Vivie87. Dude these are my kids' thumbs, writes someone else, almost certainly wrong. The pictures were not sharp enough for certainty, not exact enough to nail a child to a fact.

She asked for a coffee refill without getting up. She had trained her own body to make do with thought alone. She laughed when she caught herself doing that and sighed, stood and went to fetch coffee and said hello to Carter in the hallway. Carter was pale and tall and overcommitted and the kindest person in their department. He taught composition and wore bicycles on his socks. "You’re on the hunt," he said, peering at her face. He always could tell when her eyes were trying to thread something they hadn’t yet touched. "What’s the quarry today? The ghost in the student union? The fountain that grants wishes if you throw in a paperclip?"

"Thumbs," she said. "Thumbs on a Facebook page. Thumbs all over the city like badges. Children’s thumbs maybe."

"Ah," he said, hanging back to let a group of business majors clump past. "Cursed like buttons."

"Something like that."

She had grown up twenty-nine miles from where she taught now, in a housing addition with cul-de-sacs named after birds. She had wanted, then, to leave forever. She had gone to Arizona for a while, and then to a city that ate cities, and the desert had taught her about light, and the city had taught her about how people take pictures as if they're the only ones who have ever had hands. Indiana had called her back like a small bell. Standing with her coffee, she pulled her phone and checked the page. There was another post. It was time-stamped eight minutes ago, under the bridge. The caption: Morning shiver morning star. Good luck, little captains.

She could see the line of the river behind that thumb. And graffiti. Two letters, overlapping, painted in extravagant loops. She recognized the hand of the artist, one she’d seen before on the east abutment across from the little donuts shop. The thumb wore a band-aid with tiny ducks. The thumb itself had dirt in its crescent. She did not want it to be a child’s thumb. She wanted it to be a stunt. But the ratio of comments to shares pulled her along: a mother tagging a school friend, an aunt with a string of alarmed faces, a kid writing "bro why are you like this," another kid writing "lol the thumbs up page," and then a long comment by a man named Raymond, about how when he was a kid they told stories about the Thumb Man who lived by the flood wall and if you touched him you'd only ever be able to say yes yes yes.

The campus buzzed as if someone had opened a window onto a snow day. Her class—twenty-four undergraduates, some thick-necked linebackers, some theatre kids with bracelets to their elbows, some so exquisitely tired they could have slept on their laptops—shuffled in and set notebooks down like flat stones. Seranella meant to teach them about the disappearing hitchhiker and the different variants of it, and the interim messages that fall through centuries like coins through a slot. She did, more or less. She wrote on the board, slipped from story to story, let their notes catch on the hooks she cast. She did the voice of the aunt and the voice of the boy who leaned out the window and the voice of the woman who was never there. But the thumbs sat in her head like damp wood, hissing at the fire.

After class, a student she did not yet know approached, a girl with magenta hair and a sweater that had been loved by at least three owners. "You seen the thumb dude?" she said, the last word pitched up. "He's messing with kids by my cousin’s school. She goes to Washington. They had like, a safety patrol? I don't know. My aunt's freaking."

"What does he do?" Seranella asked, partly to create space to think.

"Just... asks for a thumbs up? Like, literally? He wants them to like, pose. Natasha—she said he was nice but weird, and like, tall. And his face looked sick like salt. But. He keeps showing up, and adults get weird about it, and then he gets gone. Like, who even is he? Is this study stuff, is this what you study?"

"Sometimes," Seranella said. "Sometimes it's stories we tell each other in a panic. Sometimes it's the person in the story. Sometimes it's both."

The girl chewed the sleeve of her sweater and then left, already in her own next class in her head. Seranella stood a long moment with the hall emptying around her like air from a paper bag. Her phone buzzed—her spouse, Theo, asking about dinner, a friend dropping a link about river cleanups, a message from a parent she knew through the PTA with a screenshot of the thumb page. The screenshot had a comment circled. It said: he told my son his name is Micheal, he is not a monster, just collecting smiles. The person had spelled Micheal like that, and Seranella’s brain, which loved the small ways words glitch, grabbed the order of letters and held it up to the light: i-a-e. She put it in her pocket the way one keeps a coin, a pressing. Little things could become keys.

By late afternoon, the river had thrown off its fog, and the sky was so blue it almost laughed at red brick. Micheal shambled up from the underworld of the bridge to where a small playground made of tired plastic creaked in the breeze. A woman in a dark hoodie was pushing a baby on a swing. A dad in a safety vest was trying to fix the chain on a child’s bike. Three kids hung upside down from a bar, hair dragging the tanbark, their pockets spilling leaves. Micheal stood at the edge and did not step on. He did what he always did, a theater he had practiced: put his weirdness on as a coat and button it, show the audience how it gleams. He bowed at the waist. He spoke in a tone that made people hear both danger and silly, like a clown with a real knife.

"Little captains," he called, and the woman pushing the baby turned, and the dad in the safety vest put his hand up as if to halt a train. "I am conducting an inventory of brave hands. Who has one? No prize, only the memory of having a strong thumb. It matters. It always has."

The middle of the three kids—the one with socks pulled over their knees—giggled uncomfortably and said, "My thumb is like the rest of me, dude," which made the oldest snort. The dad in the vest said, "Hey, man," the syllables rolled long, as if trying to be cushion and warning at once. The woman pushing the baby widened her stance and glared hard enough to bring heat. Micheal put his hands out, palms visible. He was careful to keep them lower than his own waist. He backed a small step. "No harm," he said. "Just a picture of one, the brave one. The one that says yes to the day."

"Why," said the dad.

"Because it helps," Micheal said. "Because I am more tender than I look, and I need proof that the thumb is still real. That it bends and does not break. Because I am trying to build a wall with them. A wall of the little yesses. Do you know how many yesses it takes to keep out the night? A lot."

"You need to leave," the woman said. "I will call the police if you take pictures of kids, I will, do you want me to? I don't want to. But I can."

"I don’t touch," Micheal said. He held up his own thumb, an enormous thing, callused, a pale slice of nail like an old moon, and he smiled at it as if it were beloved. "I only collect the shape of it. To remember. Do you remember? When you were small and someone lined up raisins on your thumb knuckles and you balanced them and laughed and your mother took one and put it in her own mouth and said yum. Do you remember? I do not. I need to. I am sorry I ask."

He didn’t stay to see whether anyone granted him grace. He did not wait for the man in the vest to call. He backed away the way he had practiced, turned, and left with the careful, rolling gait that did not jar his bad knee. He hated that he had to do this. But he had to. There was a rock in his chest, a cold one, and the only thing that warmed it was the image of thumbs lined up like geese on a winter pond, balanced, firm. He believed that if he could make enough of them, a house would appear. He did not know who would open the door.

That night, Seranella lay flat on her living room rug with the laptop open beside her like a second heart. Theo was practicing the same difficult measure on a saxophone in the bedroom—blown, grieved, repetition a kind of prayer. The neighbor above them clomped herringly; someone in the next building stomped hardwood with joyful, aggressive feet that made her smile. On her screen, the Thumbs page blinked with a new image. A thumb against the side of a bus. You could see the circular bus number reflected in the window. If she could catch the same bus, she might find the same stop. She had a whiteboard she kept for the city, a map that wasn’t a map, and she made a mark on it with a slim blue pen, the kind students steal if you are not careful. The bridge. The mural. The bench. The bus. She’d seen that bus number outside the library. She circled it twice.

Theo put the sax down and came out to sit with her and pressed a warm foot into her ribcage just to make her groan. "What is it that has gotten into your hair," Theo said. "You’re the color of terrible coffee."

"A page. Thumbs. He calls them captains."

"Ah. The captain thumbs. The ones you made a face about at breakfast."

"They’re… I don’t know. It could be performance art. It could be a guy without malice who loves children. It could be someone brittle. It could be somebody on the way to being violent."

"It could," Theo said gently, "be a man with a hole in him so wide he thinks only collections will scaffold him."

"I know. I don’t like that either."

"You have your cape hung somewhere," Theo said. "Don’t pretend you don't. You’re reaching for it in your sleep."

"I don’t wear a cape, I wear soft sweaters specifically to camouflage the cape."

She laughed because Theo made her laugh in the places where she might easily cry. But later, seeing new comments under the bus thumb, she felt the tug change from curiosity to something arrowy and strict. A parent wrote in a private message—someone had given out her email at a PTA meeting, it happened—asking if she knew about the thumb man, if she knew how to keep him away. The message was full of small sparks of fear. It was not a stupid fear. It was the fear of parents who had practiced fire drills and born out news cycles and kept their own thumbs on the pulse of danger so long the finger had gone numb. Seranella typed back. She told the parent she was watching the page, that if they saw him, to take a picture without stepping close, to note what color shoes, if he limped. Do not go alone. Do not look away. Do not escalate. Her throat felt like a path through sumac.

The next morning found Micheal where it usually did, not under the bridge but in the gray that stretched between sleeping and cracking daylight. In that gray he saw the kitchen that he did not let himself see. He saw the woman by the sink whose hair had the color of rust and maple seeds, he saw the light over her shoulder, he saw the small hand at the table that tapped a spoon and the way the small hand tapped: slow-patient, slow-patient, fast-fast-fast. He saw his own stupid hands, good for lifting things, bad for putting them down. He saw a faraway cousin who had driven and driven and said, worry about yourself first, Mickey. He saw the kind of grief that drives you to bargains. He woke with the chewing noise of crows in the trees above the river and remembered that none of it could be fixed. He stood and sorted his things—his phone, his damp jacket, the napkin with the word YET written on it in ballpoint that he had found on a bus seat and kept like a prayer. The word was already softening to fabric. He thought of the parent last night who had told him, in a voice that made him dizzy, to go away, and he wished, sincerely, that he were better at leaving people alone.

At the bus stop outside the library, a small boy sat on his backpack. He wore a shirt with a dinosaur on it and an expression built of skepticism and jelly. His mother was reading her phone, nodding at the page as if the page were a person she could agree with. Micheal took a breath, set his face to a quiet smile, a hopeful one, and bent his body to be smaller. He thought if he could be smaller, it would be less wrong. "Thumbs?" he said, to the air more than to the boy. "Show me a brave one."

The boy held up a finger. Not the thumb.

"That one says no," Micheal said, compassionate as he could be. "Do you have the small yes that lives in your hand?"

"I have two," the boy said absently, without fear. He had the kind of childhood that had not yet included the expensive lessons about what to fear and why. He lifted a thumb.

"Thank you," Micheal said, and the mother, realizing, looked up, saw him, sucked in her breath; he stepped back quick, already raising his camera, already catching the shape of the thumb against the wide eyelid of the bus shelter. He did not step closer. He did not take another. He did what he always did. He found the caption before he found the send button. Little yes under big sky. We rise.

When the post went up, Seranella had already tied her hair back with an elastic she kept around her wrist for when the work had to become a braid. She texted Carter to beg him to cover her office hours. She texted her dean to say she had a community meeting. It was not entirely untrue. She printed the last twenty posts and laid them in a line on her floor until the cat began to make a settlement at the edge of the bus. She shooed the cat with soft apologies.

She drove along the path the pictures drew for her. She parked at the library and walked the block. On the glass of the bus shelter, a child's handprint was smeared like an accident. On the sidewalk, chalk loops of hopscotch had blurred to sugar. She stood in that stop and watched herself in its glass. For a moment, she let her jaw go slack and allowed the word ogre to surface in her, allowed herself to feel how it feels to other the one who asks something you are not willing to give. She did not like it. She softened. She watched an older man with a cane pick his way off the curb. She watched a girl in a red raincoat hop. She waited.

He smelled like wet wool and tightened earth and rivers. She did not see him at first and then she did. He was standing close enough to the shelter to bend its shadow. He was large without being tall; he carried his shoulders in a careful slump, as if they had been borrowed. He wore a visor backward as if the world were a kitchen he did not yet deserve. He lifted a hand as if to adjust a thought and then saw her watching him, and he faltered, and everything in the space between them twisted—an accordian bellows, drawn out. She did not take her eyes away. She kept her hands open at her sides. She had learned, across years of testimony and talk, that the space between fear and harm is sometimes a person willing to look without shouting.

"Hi," she said. "I know you. On the page. You’re the one who collects the small yes."

He blinked, as if the phrase had walked up and kissed him in public. His voice came out like dusty velvet. "I am not a villain," he said. "You say that in your head. I know you do. They all do. I am only building a wall."

"What for," she asked, and she let the question have the tone of a porch asked to a porch. "Will you tell me what for."

He leaned back and shook his head and then forward and nodded and the whole movement made him look like a very old grandfather clock in a house too full of smoke. "The night," he said. "I don't know the right words. The night took something. My... my home was in it. People in it. This is the only brick that answers, when I go to put it down. Is it so wrong to gather what is warm and stack it. People like you—you have the right words for the brick. I do not."

"I study stories," she said. "I can tell you what your story looks like to the people who are inside it without wanting to be. You want to hear?"

He looked left, right. His eyes were pale, pale sap, and full to the ridge. He nodded.

"It looks like a man who asks children for a piece of their body for his collection," she said as gently as the word body allowed. "It looks like you are taking something and that you will come back for more. It looks like the beginning of harm. It might not be. But it looks like that."

"Then tell them I am not," he said. "Go around. Tell them I am leftover and sad. That is the word, leftover. I am a leftover pot roast on a plate after the guests leave. For a dog, maybe. I do not bite unless someone takes away my plate. I only look. I am not taking. I am not even touching. They can wipe their thumbs on their pants after; I do not even leave a mark on the air."

"It is not how it feels," she said. "Feeling is the thing that makes a town a town and not a map."

He crumpled a little, like cardboard put in rain. He looked, for a moment, like he would bolt. "Then I have to stop," he said, but he said it like a person who says I have to stop sweeping rain from the steps. Pointless and kind of doom. He backed away. She did not reach for him. She did not say wait yet. He would not have. She let him go.

On the way back to campus, she texted Theo and then didn’t send it. She wanted to say I met him and I did not hate him but I hate what he makes the air do. She deleted. She left the sensation in her chest like a moth. She stopped at the donuts shop near the mural and bought a coffee, black, and took it outside and stood in front of the YOU ARE NEEDED HERE sign until a teenager with a skateboard asked if she worked there and if she could take a picture of him with his board in front of the words. She did. She did it carefully, so that the board was centered and his grin was allowed to be as big as it wanted to be.

By evening, the city had begun to murmur at a pitch she recognized. The page had doubled its followers. The local news had noticed and made a segment with a possible predator voice and stock footage of playgrounds. The police department, and she knew the sergeant who ran their socials, posted a calm reminder that photographing people in public is legal but photographing children without parents' permission is discouraged, and any threatening behavior should be reported. The comments below that post were a cobbler of fear and sarcasm and the midwestern kindness that says maybe he is just lonely. Someone had found a photo of a big man near a bus shelter and posted it under the caption FOUND THE THUMB DEMON. Someone else had said, seriously, demon, ok. A third wrote: leave him alone he probably lost someone. A fourth wrote: my daughter is crying because of him. A fifth: he asked my kid to say yes to him. It’s in the way people like him talk.

The thing about nights in Fort Wayne is that they can be so quiet you hear trains you will never see. The thing about those trains is that they sound like a memory being moved across a big table by careful hands. On that kind of night, Micheal stood under the bridge again and held his phone like a book of hours. He read his own captions as if the act of reading them might prove the joke of him was worth telling. The comments scraped. The shares chafed. He tried to ignore them all. He tried to bend the world toward what he wanted it to be. He said, on the page, one more, he said, be gentle as a biscuit, he said, thumbs up if you woke. He put the phone down and put both hands on the bridge pillar and leaned his head against it, an old horse greeting an old fence. "Mara," he said then, and the name fell out of his mouth onto the damp sand and lay there, naming nothing.

Seranella slept only in the top half of sleep. In the bottom half she kept waking to the creaky, small sounds of the building and checking the page, and she hated doing that, and she did it anyway. At three, there was another post: a thumb in an alley painted with a looping handstyle. The caption said: you are my ever after, Thumbelina. At five, another: a thumb on a school signboard in the blue-blue of almost day. The caption: if the bell rings, run toward it. She made another mark on her whiteboard. The line was becoming clearer, a meandering that hugged the river where the city had learned to hug. He stayed low and damp, the way fog does. He stayed near the places where children crossed in flocks. He was careful and he was relentless. She rubbed a spot between her eyes and felt like chalk.

By the time light arrived as if it had an appointment it needed to keep, she had a plan. She had to do something both academic and neighborly, something that could wear two coats without itching. She called the sergeant at the police department who ran socials, the one with hair so uniformly gray it looked like it had been painted on, and she told him what she was going to do, and he told her to be careful in that tone men use when they want to say I won’t stop you because I can’t and also because I want a story to tell later where you do not get hurt. She said she would be. She texted the PTA parent who had messaged her and asked if she could come talk to the kids at Washington about online strangers, about consent, about how to say no without having to shout, about the word boundary and its opposite. The parent responded with twelve exclamation marks and a heart.

In the school auditorium, which smelled like stacked chairs and lemon cleaner, she stood at a mic and told two hundred small faces that the internet is a wonderful room and sometimes the ceiling leaks, and if someone asks for a picture of a part of you, you can say no, even if they are nice, even if they call you captain, even if they seem like a story you want to be inside. She asked them to practice a certain kind of look, a look that says I see you and I will be leaving now. She made them giggle and then she let the giggle go out and she made them repeat after her: My yes belongs to me. She thought, briefly, that it was a little much, that she was making a stage out of a faucet. But the little much is sometimes the right amount. She saw teachers nodding. She saw a boy raise his hand and ask if he could still give a thumbs up to his family joke and she said, yes, obviously yes, your jokes are your own.

When she stepped off the stage, a woman with an expression like a note you fold carefully because you want it to survive folding said, "Do you know the man. Can we talk about the man. My daughter's bus stop is the one by the library."

"We can talk," Seranella said. "I saw him. He is not... I don't know. He is not what the newscast will make him into. He is not better, yet. He is not safe. But I think he can hear."

"You sound like you want to save him," the woman said, not unkind.

"I want to save the air we all have to breathe," said Seranella. "Whatever that ends up meaning."

The woman exhaled the way you exhale when you are tired of the words people have and grateful when they at least try to make new ones. She squeezed Seranella’s hand. "Thank you," she said. "I will tell my daughter to use her big no and her small no and both of her yeses. I will tell her you looked at him and did not flinch."

That afternoon, Micheal walked along the greenway where the river pretends to be tamed and was not. He did not pull his phone out. He did not look up. He felt a blistering under the skin where guilt tries to make a warm nest and instead grows teeth. He made himself sit on a bench and do the thing a therapist in a clinic far away had taught him once: count five things he could see. The carapace of a cicada, broken but a coppery jewel. A pair of sunglasses stuck in the mud like a failed periscope. A flyer for a yard sale that had already passed three summers ago. A dog with eyebrows. His own hand, which he had not made good use of.

"Stop," he said out loud. It was easier to give orders when there was no one to disobey them. "Stop for a day."

The river said its nothing and everything and dragged past him the sky and a plastic jug and a leaf that had decided to be a boat. He nodded to the river like a friend you knew from a long time ago who was doing their best and not always succeeding. He did not post a thumb that day. He did not step toward any child and ask for a yes. It made the inside of his mouth itch.

The page did not stop without him. People posted their own thumbs, as an act of reclamation or mockery or both. Someone made a joke account called THUMB WAR. Someone made art. Someone pasted his captions over pictures of storm clouds. Someone used him to sell a t-shirt. The tiny machine of the city turned and turned and the distance between person and spectacle thinned like ice in March. He could not help watching.

That night, Seranella wrote in a notebook in pen that bled if she pushed too hard. She wrote the word ogre and then she wrote it backward, and it looked like a tire track in snow. She wrote names: Micheal, with the vowels misplaced like people often are. She wrote what she had seen in his eyes. She wrote the way he held his hands as if they were not safe to use. She wrote what she would try next. She would make an appointment, of sorts. She would be at the bus shelter tomorrow before dawn. She would bring coffee and two paper cups. She would ask him to tell her the story that made his wall necessary. She would ask him to let her take his picture: not his thumbs, not his collection, but his face, a person, not an appetite. She did not know if she would post it. She did not know if the page would be kind. She knew that naming something can make it smaller and sometimes it makes it climb onto your lap and purr until you cannot breathe, and even so, you do not move.

It rained at three again. The kind of rain that feels like a full stop after a sentence you don't remember writing. She fell asleep in the middle of telling herself not to.

At five, the shelter was a plastic island. She stood under it with a coffee in each hand, the steam rising like gossip. The buses were late. The sky was the color of an old bruise trying to remember the event. He came out of the dark not like a ghost, but like someone who had been working a night shift and didn't want to go home yet. He saw the coffee and frowned, as if it were a trick, smelled the trick anyway, and reached. He took the paper cup like a sacrament. She felt the tremor move through him into the cup itself. She said nothing until he had had two sips and the heat had reached a place where it could do the work of unwinding his jaw.

"Tell me the story," she said. "I'll be the page. Put it down where you can see it. We can always tear it out later. We can always burn it."

"I was a brother," he said. The words fell one by one like apples from a shaken branch. "And a husband. For a while. And then I was none. The night ran too fast. The road ran too fast. They were in a car and I was in my feet, behind, catching up, and I did not, I could not. There was glass where there should have been a lollipop stick. There was a hat in the ditch. There was a light that did not know how to stop blinking. The only thing I could keep was the shape of her hand. The small one. The way it made a yes without saying a word."

"You say Mara," she said, soft. She did not ask who that was. She did not need to write down the grammar.

He nodded, once, twice. He did not lift his eyes from the lip of his cup. "We lived in a kitchen with linoleum that had been peeled up by a dog that was also gone," he said. "There were raisins. They were lined up on her thumb. I did not know I was in the middle of a sacred moment. I never do. I only know after. The world is a thief that only takes things after you forget to lock them."

"The world gives back weirdly," she said. "It gives back community theater and the smell of a neighbor’s bread. It gives back a page about thumbs that makes everyone argue when maybe they should bring you coffee. It gives back professors who do not have capes but do, in fact, have capes."

He smiled then, a bite of light across his face, crooked, reluctant. It did not last. He shook his head so slowly it was almost a vibration. "I don’t want to hurt anyone," he said. "I know I am hurting anyway. I don't want to be a story told in caution. I want to be the man who brings a bag of sweet corn to a door and leaves without making anyone write about it."

"Then," she said, tasting her own carefulness, "stop making the page. Stop asking. Put your wall down. Let other people’s yes stay in their hands. Make a new brick. The wall can be made of something else. There is a place that will listen to you yell at the night. I can take you there. You can still carry the word yet in your pocket. If you have it."

He put his free hand into the pocket of his jacket and took out the napkin she had never known about, the three letters smudged into something that looked like a cloud. He held it like a child holds a dead goldfish. "Yet," he said. "I do. I am not good at it. But I am trying."

"Try with me," she said. "I teach at the college. There’s a counselor who owes me a favor, he wears ties with tiny koi fish. He will not make you feel like you're heavy. I will go with you, if you want. Today. And after, I will walk with you to the police and explain that you will not be in more trouble. Not yet. That you are making a different wall. It is better to go with me than to be pulled there by fear."

He looked at her over the edge of his cup as if it might be a shield. He thought the way you can see a person thinking if you let time stand like a deer in your yard and you don’t blink. He nodded once. "Not now," he said. "Now is when the buses come. But soon. I will. I cannot make my hand stop shaking if I do not put it to something. But I will try. I will try not to touch. I will try not to ask. I will try to stop the page."

"Thank you," she said. She pulled her phone out and, bold as a teenager, took a picture of him, not hidden, and he flinched and then held still, mouth set. "I won't post this," she said. "Yet," and she let the word hang there like a banner.

The day opened its door to let them go through, and he stepped away, coffee in hand, and she did not follow him too closely. She watched him leave like a ship. She put her phone against her mouth and breathed. Then she called the sergeant with the painted hair. And then she called Carter. And then she called a number saved in her phone from a talk she once heard in a church basement—the counselor with the koi fish ties. She said, "I have someone. He has a wall made of thumbs. He says he wants to build something else."

The counselor said, "Bring him. I will put on the tie that laughs the most."

What bloomed then in the city was a little ugly and a little kind. The page went quiet for twenty-four hours, then forty-eight. The local news did a follow-up with an empty bench. Parents held their children’s hands a little too hard crossing streets and then remembered and loosened. New posts appeared, not from Micheal but from others, thumbs up for Ms. Johnson our bus driver, thumbs up for Mr. Ali at the bodega, thumbs up for the crossing guard who dances. The thumb became a coin that people traded with more care. Seranella watched as if she were watching a wound scab without quite believing skin would do this magic again.

When he showed up at her office two days later, wearing a shirt that was only a little damp, he had his visor off and his hair laid down like a meadow that had made a truce with the wind. He stood in the doorway and took up all of it. He looked at the plant that tapped the window and made his mouth move in a way that could have been a laugh. She stood. She held out her hand. He did not touch it. It was all right. They went together to the counseling center in a corridor that smelled like new paint and stale secrets, and she sat with him in the waiting room and did not try to talk over the quiet. On her phone, she opened the Thumbs page and looked at the last caption he had posted four days ago and felt something in herself settle.

The counselor came, tieless, laughing, hands open like a new road. He said the name Micheal, and he said it in the right order, and Micheal kept his eyes on the floor and stood, and they went in. She could have gone with them. He had nodded that she could. She did not. She let the door be the door. She stared at a flier about intramural kickball and almost burst out crying because the people in the picture looked like summer. She sat there until she could stand. She went back to her office and took the napkin with the word yet out of her own pocket where she had put it earlier and put it on her desk and smoothed it with the edge of her hand.

At the end of that first hour, he came out looking like someone who had been handed a glass of water. He looked ten inches shorter. He did not smile; he did not scowl. He nodded, one heavy nod, and then he did the smallest thing that cracked her like a plate: he held up his own thumb, looked at it, and then put it down gently as if returning a delicate object to its shelf. He did not take a picture. He did not even get out his phone.

"Tomorrow," he said. "I will go with you to the police."

"Not to jail," she said, gently teasing the air. "To the desk. To the desk where we sit and make a plan. To the place where warnings are made and bridges are drawn."

"I know," he said. "I would like to be warned. I am tired of warning myself."

Outside, the wind ran along the street and the leaves listened. Over the river, the bridge waited, its pillars no longer necessary for dawn. Somewhere, a bus was late by three minutes because a driver had stopped and tied a child's untied shoe. Somewhere, a teenager posted a picture of his thumb in front of a mural and wrote: needed here, like this. Somewhere, in the asphalted morning, the space between harm and what happens next shifted, a little. It was not the end of the story. It was the part where a person who does not believe in magic finds some anyway, in the dull paper cup, in the murmur of trains, in the way a whole city, sometimes, can say yes without meaning the old, dangerous yes.Chapter 3 began at a desk that had a pen on a chain, the ink tired and stubborn, and a laminated poster about fireworks safety curling at the corners. The lobby of the Public Safety building always smelled both clean and faintly of cold coffee, like a church basement the morning after a fundraiser, and on that morning it was full of uniforms and the low murmur of forms being understood badly and re-explained gently. The sergeant with the painted hair—up close you could see where white gave way to silver like dawn happening in reverse—stood behind the counter and explained a thing that was not quite a law and not quite a hug. It would be a note, he said, an agreement, a record that a conversation had happened, and that the man who signed it would not approach children to take their picture, would not lurk where parents had told him not to lurk, would not make of himself a silhouette that could be mistaken for a shadow with teeth. He kept his voice easy, as if he were telling someone how to set the clock on a microwave. He asked for a name, and the clerk beside him started typing Mi-c-h-a-e-l out of reflex until Seranella said, softly, "With the i and the e switched," and the clerk nodded as if she were correcting a recipe and backspaced and then put it down as it had been spoken to her. Micheal put his palm on the counter to steady the shake, and the counter was as smooth and cool as a pond in January, the kind of surface that gives you back the shape of your hand even when you have been told you take too much.

The pen made a stubborn blot on the paper where his first downstroke hesitated and then held. He read the language with his lips moving, the way a boy reads when he wants to make sure the words become his body, and he nodded once at the line that said photography of minors without guardian permission is discouraged and once at the line that said any further contact after a verbal warning could become legal trouble. "I can be warned," he said, not looking up, and the sergeant said, "You were," and then smiled in a way that didn’t show teeth but did show a small history of doing this without wanting to be cruel. At the end, the sergeant reached beneath the counter and pulled out a business card that had nothing impressive on it, only a name and a phone number and a little shield that had traded shine for fingerprints, and he slid it across as if it were a compass. "If someone gives you trouble because of this," he said, "call me. If you get trouble into your head, call me. If you aren’t sure if something is trouble, call me and I’ll tell you whether it’s weather or a storm." Micheal stared at the card and then put it in the same pocket where the napkin lived, words rubbing velvet against words, and he said thank you like the sound of boots on old wooden steps.

After they stepped out onto the wide porch of the building, the wind pushed at them with the flat palm of a practical aunt who wants you to button your coat, and for a minute they stood side by side and watched a boy on a scooter clack-clack across the cracks where new concrete had learned the seams of old. "I can help you find something else to make with your hands," Seranella said, because she had learned long ago that most people do not stop needing to make, even when what they make has hurt the air. She spoke like a person offering a loom to someone who had always woven with grass. "If you want to take pictures still—and it seems like you do—what if it’s permission forward? Adults only, and not of body parts as such, but work, maybe. Hands kneading bread, hands fixing a bike chain, hands on the steering wheel of the bus with the driver’s grin behind it. The page could become what you wanted it to be without the part that makes everyone’s ribs go tight. Or we could abandon it, and you could take pictures and never post them and show them only to people you want to hold you accountable. We can make a project that has a door with a doorbell on it."

He squinted as if the light had mispronounced his name. The sound of traffic from Calhoun Street made an indifferent river of metal and heat, and for a moment he was only a large man with his fingers flexed against a feeling he could not yet name. "I can try," he said. "I do not think the picture is the whole of it. The asking is part of it, and that is the part that is wrong. If I ask of a grown-up and they say yes yes, then I can hold it like a warm bun and not like a thing I stole. My hands do not know the difference until someone tells them. You tell them now. I will bring the pictures to the fish-tie man if you want. I will bring them to you. I will try the thing where the brick is words and not children."

"You can bring them to me and to him," she said, and she had to stop herself from reaching to touch his elbow the way she would have touched a neighbor’s elbow when crossing a puddle. "And if it helps, we can give the page another name. LaundrySalt is funny, but it is also hiding. What if it becomes People Doing Things in Fort Wayne. What if it becomes Work of the City, or Small Yeses With Permission. I am not good at naming. We can ask my students; they are better at names for things that need to be held on the internet. And we can also just let it die and plant something else in its dirt. The internet is a garden where weeds and lilies live together and sometimes trade roots when you are not looking."

He waited for a bus to hiss up and open its mouth, waited for the handful of people to be swallowed and spat out, and then said, "You will tell me when I make the air bad again. If I do. You will not be gentle if gentle is not the right salt." She nodded, and he nodded back, and it was a small, ordinary pact dressed in metaphor and wind, but it was the right size for the moment.

The ugly kindness of the city continued to do what it does. A neighborhood-watch page that had been invented for lost dogs and found lawn furniture suddenly decided that it kept order in souls; they posted a photo of a man who was not Micheal and said, "Thumb creep near Anthony—beware," and in three hours there were twenty-seven comments that outlawed compassion and married rumor with righteousness. Seranella read them and felt a ache behind her eyes that used to announce a headache and now announced that she had stayed online too long. She opened her computer and wrote an essay that seemed like a letter because it was one, and it mentioned no names but it had the words consent and folklore and grief in it, and she sent it to the local alt-weekly whose editor owed her five favors and answered with a string of fire emojis and a note that said, "Running this tomorrow, bless you." The essay did what essays can do; it did not fix anything, but it hung a bell in a place where no bell had been, and people rung it or threw rocks at it and made a noise that was a little different than the noise they had been making before. Theo read the essay out loud to the cat and changed the sax practice for a night to trumpet, which has a different kind of stubbornness to it, and in bed that night Theo said, "You wrote your own kitchen into that, you know," and she said, "I know," and they both lay awake listening to the person upstairs drag a chair and the rain tell a slow story about a roof.

The counselor with the fish tie—whose name, it turned out, was Sloan, which was a color and a sound and a person all at once—saw Micheal twice more before the week ripened. Sloan had a room with chairs that did not try to swallow you and a small fountain that pretended to be a creek and a basket of fidget toys that would have been a joke in a harsher office but here were simply a bowl of permission. He gave the man homework, but he did not call it that, because homework sounds like school and shame and slips with red ink. He said, "Find five things in the city that are already saying yes without needing your hands to do it," and he wrote the numbers one through five on a square of paper with a pencil that had teeth marks, and the paper went into the pocket with the napkin and the card and became one more soft thing making friends with other soft things. Micheal brought him a photograph the next day of a neon sign in a diner that had the word OPEN on it, and the way it reflected twice in the glass made it look like it agreed with itself. He brought him a picture of a green pedestrian signal in the shape of a man walking that looked like it has been designed by a very optimistic refrigerator magnet. He brought him a grocery crate stamped OK OK OK in red, traveling up its side like the instructions on a particularly formal ladder. He took these pictures with the same care he had taken the thumbs, his big hands coaxing straightness out of the cheap phone, and when he looked at them with Sloan, he felt something like stacking.

He also brought Sloan a story that tasted like a nicked tongue. In the parking lot of a gas station on Lafayette, a girl had paused near him to bend and untie a knot her father had made and tied too hard, and he had moved, an old reflex reaching up, and he had frozen in the shape of a bad decision before it happened. The father had turned, as fathers do, like a weather vane finding true north in a gust, and had said "Hey," with the syllable peeled to its hard insistent core, and Micheal had put his hands up and backed away and said, "Thank you for helping your girl," and the father had frowned and then nodded and then turned back to his own hands and the knot. Micheal had walked to the wide concrete seam beneath the pump and counted the tiny, fossil brown ants carrying a sunflower seed husk. He told Sloan the story as if he had chewed on it first and then put it on the desk like something he regretted chewing. Sloan listened, nodded, and then handed him a small card, the size of a ticket, with words already printed on it in a font that had no swagger. "These help some people," he said, shrugging. "Sometimes just to know you have it will help you remember to stop. Sometimes you will need to hand it to yourself in your head. Sometimes you can give it to someone if words shake too much." The card said: I am practicing not asking. You are safe. I am leaving now. Micheal put the card in his pocket with the others and it became part of a slowly growing tribe.

Meanwhile, in the room with the long chalkboard and the clock that went too fast every time they talked about stories that ride the bus from generation to generation without paying, Seranella asked her students to bring in variants of what the internet had already called Thumb Man, and the students did what they do when you trust them to be particular. One boy had a grandma who said there had always been a man by the river whose hands had been burned off in a factory accident and who asked for the sound of hands instead; you had to clap for him to be safe, and if you didn't clap, your thumb would fall off at night. One girl had an older cousin who insisted the man collected yeses because he had been cursed by a witch at the county fair who only spoke in Facebook comments, and the only way to break the curse was to get a yes from a person who had never had their yes stolen, which was why he kept coming back to schools; children were the only ones who might still have a whole. Another student, quiet as tall grass, said her little brother had heard it on the bus: if you gave the man a thumbs up, you would never be able to say no to anyone ever again because he would take the part of the word that makes the sound that says no. They argued, as kindly as students who like each other argue, about whether you can teach a town not to make monsters out of grief without also teaching it to let grief do what it does, which is ruin and replant in the same season. She kept her own story mostly out of the room, except as nudge and question. She sent them home with an assignment that was not about him: ask for consent three times this week for small things and write down what changes. Ask your roommate if you can borrow a mug even if you always do. Ask your mother if now is a good time to talk. Ask yourself if you can turn your phone off for an hour and write what happens in the room when there is no blue light to make your face a moon.

Without the page filling itself with new pictures every few hours like a feverish bird feeder, the city went looking for something else to pinch and discuss. It found potholes again and a rumor about a zoo expansion that would bring in penguins the size of dogs, and yet the thumb story kept brushing against lunch, kept turning up in PTA hallways and in the aisles of Target where someone had arranged paper towels into a display so careful it looked like a nave. In an attempt to build a different house, Seranella took an old legal pad and wrote in her teacher’s script, I GIVE PERMISSION, and under it a list of places she could ask, and then she walked to the little bakery that did moral math in sugar and caffeine and asked the owner if she could put a sign on the community board that said: Free workshop, consent and folk tales, upstairs above the donuts, Thursday. The owner said yes before Seranella finished the sentence and added, in icing on a signboard cookie, "Say Yes To Your Own Yes," and put it in the window, and everyone who walked by got a lesson they did not expect with their bagels.

Micheal tried not to find his old steps with his feet. He walked other routes. He tugged a wagon of canned peaches for the food bank when they needed a human dolly. He watched the bike doctor in a church basement fix a bent derailleur and asked if he could hand wrenches without having to be asked. He sat at the back of a reading at the library—a book about ogres that had been written by someone who knew that ogres don't really want to be in books—and when the page said ogres are sadness with teeth he felt seen and then felt betrayed and then felt, like a fruit bruising and then being eaten anyway, grateful for the bite. The next day he left a grocery bag of sweet corn on a porch by the sign that said only good chaos here and he did not knock. He tucked the napkin into the slats of the porch railing where it could catch wind and then he took it back out because he could not leave yet where he could see it be rained on. He helped a neighbor he did not know carry a door from the pool of a truck bed to a stoop where it needed to sit and leaned it carefully against the brick as if it were a sleeping relative. He took pictures of none of it, and then later, because habits are stubborn, he took a picture of a sticker on a telephone pole that said YES on one side and NO on the other and when he showed it to Sloan, they both laughed until Sloan had to wipe his eyes with the back of his hand.

The page that had been the wall—Thumbs of the City—did not die; pages almost never die. They become basements. They become attics. They become a coat you hang up and then reach into because you forgot what you put in the pocket. With one of her students whose brain was a bright glass of lemonade—Liam, the one she had thought of when she first saw the curve of shares—Seranella logged into a new admin panel she had asked, with more grace than she felt, to be added to, and made the cover photo the mural that had always done the job of saying what the city was trying to say. She wrote a pinned post and made sure it was careful: This page will be quiet for a while. If you have concerns, talk to people you trust in person. If you have a story of a small yes, you can send it to the email below with the words I give permission, and we will share some of them about grown-up hands doing grown-up things. If you have a child, teach them that yes is theirs. She didn't sign it, because a page does the work of a veil, and sometimes a veil is a mercy. She left the DMs off, because she had learned where her own bones broke. She closed the computer and went to sit in the window in the near-dark and watched Theo do a crossword and not cheat once, and when Theo found a six-letter word for "boundary," they both grinned in the kind of relief that feels like a porch swing moving.

Storm season, which is not a season but an old habit, made the river swell a little and made the people who live near it pull their lawn chairs back up the grass and say good dog to the water with one hand lifted. When the email came from the Parks Department asking for volunteers to lay sandbags near the low part by Spy Run, Micheal went because it involved his back more than his mouth. He lifted bag after bag with the easy rhythm of a man who had always been asked to move what is heavy, and he nodded to the woman who drove the city truck full of sand like a person driving a parade float made of beige, and he did not talk unless someone said hello first. Someone did say hello; Ms. Johnson, who drove the bus with the circular number and the weathered laminate, wore her hair in a collected stormcloud and told him to be careful of the slick ditch. It was not a story anyone else would have written up, but it had within it all the clean cross-stitch of a day done well. A teenager in a hoodie took a picture of the line of bodies passing bags hand to hand and posted it with three hearts and the caption help your neighbors, and two people who only knew Micheal as a blur under a bridge saw it and felt the strange twining of fear falling and respect rising and could not decide which string to tug.

At the edge of that day, when his shoulders were a map of tasks, he found himself on the sidewalk outside the donuts shop where the mural kept reminding people of what they were supposed to remember. A community organizer whose hair was a riot of decisions stood there with a clipboard and a box of white tiles the size of playing cards, and she was talking to a small crowd as if she were talking to cousins at a reunion. "We’re making a shelter prettier," she said, pointing down toward the library stop with its plastic walls, "and we want to put tiles there that say what we needed to hear when we were small. Not fingerprints," she said, making a face at the word as if it were a broccoli someone had overcooked, "not names, not anything that can be taken and used against someone. Just words. Little ones. Words you can carry without a pocket. We’re stamping them into the clay with picnic forks and pencil erasers. Yes. No. Maybe later. Ask. Thanks. Mine. Yours. Help. Stop. Go." She handed him a tile as if she had known he would be there, and a rubber letter kit, the kind kindergarten teachers use for bulletin boards, and he took the letters that spelled out the word yet and pressed them carefully into the soft, bright square as if he were swearing on it. He wiped the extra slip off with the flat of his thumb and hissed a little at the burn and then laughed because he had used his thumb and no one had died.

It could have stopped there, and if the world were more patient it would sometimes stop in places that are not the very edge. But a fat rumor rolled down the street from an elementary school near Washington like a ball that had escaped a playground. A group text among parents turned into a screenshot of a screenshot that turned into a post about a man who had grabbed a child’s hand and squeezed and would not let go. The description was of a tall man with a visor, which was both wrong and almost right, and the comments grew teeth in a hurry. The sergeant with the painted hair texted Seranella a clumsy picture of his own monitor and the message Call me spun in a bubble beneath it, and she called, already knowing the taste of adrenaline under her tongue. "It wasn't him," the sergeant said without ceremony. "We have camera on the corner; this guy had a tattoo on his jaw like a lightning bolt, and your guy does not have a jaw you can tattoo without having to put the ink on muscle. But the moms have pictures of your guy printed out in their heads, and they are shaking them in the air. I would like to not see him hurt by someone who thinks they are stopping a story before it gets the right ending."

She put on her coat as she listened, because you put on your coat for bad news even in July, and she walked while she was still talking. "I'll find him," she said, which was brave and foolish and a lot like how she did her work. She texted Sloan, who texted back a thumb—not the emoji, an actual picture of his own thumb with a bandaid shaped like a koi fish—and the words I will call him, I will tell him to go to the shelter at the church, or to you. When she turned the corner onto the block with the bus stop, she saw him sitting on the plastic bench beneath the shelter, not hiding, not visible, but in that third place where you become a piece of furniture and no one sees you until they need to sit. He was holding an old magazine upside down and pretending to read, which made something in her chest both break and mend because she recognized the stratagem from a childhood spent in misfit places.

"There's another man," she said without hello, and sat two seats away the way you do when you are not trying to look like anything. "They think it's you. The police are saying it isn't. The comments will take longer to learn. You need to choose careful spaces for a minute." He looked up and then down and then up again, his eyes doing the math of retreat and advance, the magazine still upside down as if it had an important headline beneath his fingers. He nodded, which in him was a landscape. "I will go to the church kitchen," he said. "They like me when I chop onions. They do not like me when I chop them too small. Spike says he wants texture in his chili, not tears." The joke was a small, brave thing, and it made the woman on the other end of the bench who was pretending not to listen shift her purse from lap to floor in a gesture that meant the air was a little safer between them.

They went together, although not shoulder to shoulder; they were careful with the line between escort and parade. In the church kitchen, which always smelled like cumin and lemon produce cleaner and seemed to have been built entirely out of mismatched pots, Micheal washed his hands like a surgeon and took an onion and a cutting board and made the knife into something that spoke only under supervision. He chopped slow, and he cried the way you cry over onions when you are grateful for a reason. Spike, a man with a voice like a pair of boots left out in the rain, slapped his shoulder once and said, "You keep that up and we’ll sell soup to the mayor," and in that minute Micheal felt like a spatula—a tool that is useful to people regardless of whether it has a name.

In the quiet after, they sat on milk crates in the alley and watched a cat consider a puddle. She told him the thing that had been sitting beside her like a neighbor for a while now: the city had paid an artist to design a series of signs for bus shelters that said YOUR YES BELONGS TO YOU in three languages, with smaller letters in the corner that said ASK FIRST and THANKS FOR ASKING, and she had told the artist a story without names and the artist had said, "You always bring me soup and then ask me to make a soup sign," and they had laughed and then gone home and drawn it. "I want to put one at the library shelter first," she said, picking at a splinter in the crate with a thumbnail. "I want it to be the place where a new story gets told."

He did not say yes, because yes was a thing he had promised to learn to keep his mouth off of. He said, "I will help you hold the ladder if you need a ladder," and she felt the small glow of a plan that might actually use up her energy rather than breeding more of it, which is what the bad plans do. They made a list on the back of a receipt for fifty pounds of onions: ladder, zip ties, permission, an artist who is not on tour.

That night, when darkness arrived with its little bag of grapes and its duffel of everything else, the ogre who had once collected thumbs the way a storm collects lawn chairs went to the place where the road bent in a way that had once mattered a great deal to him. He didn’t go because he thought visiting the wound was good medicine; he went because the day had been layered with onions and new words and he needed to lay down what he had been carrying in front of the stranger who had made him a stranger to himself. The ditch had grown over; the maintenance crew had repaired the rail; the skid marks were gone in the way all the most important marks eventually are taken up by weather. He stood there until his knees ached and he said the names of the people he had loved in a voice like someone reading ingredients off a sack, all accuracy and no drama, because that is how he could bear it. He took the napkin with the word he had been carrying like a sparrow and put it under a stone at the base of the new rail and then changed his mind and took it back because he knew he would need it, and he was not ready to be the kind of person who leaves the word yet outside.

By morning, the sign was in her office in a tube, bright and honest and a little funny, because consent has a sense of humor if you hand it a cookie. The day they put it up was the day the bus was late and the pigeons were unusually confident, and it was the day three teenagers watched from their scooters with faces that did not want to admit they were moved. Micheal held the ladder on his side and a student in a theatre department sweatshirt held it on the other, and Seranella stood on the third rung like a person doing something she had done before and only now realized how much her hands had missed it. The zip ties made their dry whisper as they closed, and the sign hung there, simple as a truth you can teach to first graders. Two mothers read it and made a face at each other that said relief without the part where relief becomes smug. A boy in a dinosaur shirt said to his mother, "It’s like Mrs. Pritchard says about the glue sticks," and his mother said, "It is exactly like that," and the boy looked proud of himself for having pulled a string between two things.

Later, because the day had to get on with itself, the buses came and swallowed and spit. Later, because nothing is ever entirely itself, a man online made a joke about thumbs that was not funny and also, somehow, did not matter. Later, in a session that was the length of a sitcom with no laugh track, Sloan said, "What else is in your pocket," and Micheal took out the card and the napkin and the business card with the shield and a receipt for onions and a tile with the word yet pressed into it and laid them on the table and together they looked like a wallet had gotten religion. "That is a wall," Sloan said, and because the word wall had been the start of something that had been a end of so many other things, the man with the dough-thick fingers felt both the old ice and the new thaw and he let the two temperatures argue in his bones while his face did the quiet work of being a face.

It was not going to be a movie, and none of them expected it to become one. The city would keep making its small, domestic myths: the woman who ran faster than the rain to bring back a laundry basket, the man who always put the lid back on the newspaper vending machine when wind went to grab it, the teacher who learned one hundred and forty-six small names and used them like an instrument tuned toward light. Micheal went, one morning when the river was wearing a very fashionable scarf of mist, to a small store that repaired shoes and asked, instead of asking for thumbs, if he could take a picture of the cobbler’s hands as they stitched, and the cobbler made a joke about their nails and said yes with the shouty warmth of a person whose work is usually invisible. He made a new page and called it Work of the City, because sometimes the simplest name is the one that lets you go to sleep at night, and he put the cobbler there with a caption that didn’t rhyme, with only five emojis, because he was trying to make language do less of its sticky work and more of its clean. Beneath it, a dozen people wrote some version of thank you for seeing this, and some version of I did not know that was a job done by a person and not by a machine until I saw the thread in the light.

On a Sunday when Theo had an afternoon gig at a brewery and played standards that had long ago been reinvented by rivers, and when Carter texted a picture of his socks because they had little pencils on them and he thought she’d like that, and when the cat chose finally to forgive the new plant for being new and slept beneath it like a punctuation mark, Seranella took the photograph she had taken the day in the shelter—the one of Micheal looking as if someone had told him he did not have to be a shape anymore—and she printed it in black and white and slipped it into a frame that she did not make a ceremony of. She put it on a shelf in her office behind the plant’s reach, not to hide it, but because not everything that saves the day asks to be the bulletin board. When students came in and asked what it was, she said, "A person," and then she said, "A neighbor," and sometimes she said, "A story," and they nodded and took a pen they would forget to return and left their cups sweating circles on her desk.

The ogre, who was not one except when he needed the armor of a myth to keep his body from being only a body, walked through a city that had made with him, and not despite him, a new rule for the way we ask for each other. He stopped sometimes at the bus shelter and read the sign even though he already knew every letter and the way the zip ties were turned and the way the corner of the lower right had a bubble because the plastic had air trapped under it. He stopped sometimes at the bridge because he was allowed to, because the bridge had forgiven him for making it into a church. He stopped sometimes at the mural and stood off to one side so he wouldn’t be in any family’s photo and so he could watch their faces tilt toward the words as if toward a ladle pouring soup. He put his thumb up sometimes in his pocket, and sometimes he put it down, and sometimes he let it rest in the shape that is neither, and he tried to love that middle as its own decision.Chapter 5

The tiles came out of the kiln with the sheen of small, determined creatures. In the ceramics co-op off Broadway, where the floor always had a whisper of powdered clay and the windows gathered river light as if it were gossip, a half-dozen volunteers lifted squares from cooling racks and set them on folding tables that had seen both birthday parties and messy miracles. The stamped words had held their shapes through the burn. YES in a green you could chew. NO in an adamant cobalt. ASK in a yellow that remembered sun even in the rain. YET in a red that made even stubborn hearts consider being softer. A piece with MINE pressed by a child’s careful hand had bowed a little as if taking a curtsy. A teenager glazed PLEASE in a black so glossy it reflected her own eyelashes, and she made a face and giggled at herself and then straightened the tile as if to apologize for nothing.

Seranella stood with a box cutter like a wand and slit the tape on a shipment of zip ties as if opening a present she’d bought herself. Liam, who had signed up to help because he had that student radar for things happening that might become stories with credit attached, balanced a stack of tiles like the plates in a busboy’s hands and murmured his own spells—one for the glaze not to crack, one for the wind not to cut the sign loose, one for the city to adopt words as a second language. When a volunteer held up a tile that said YOURS and squinted, worried it might be read the wrong way without context, Seranella nodded and flipped over her legal pad and sketched a map of the bus shelters she wanted to touch first, adding notes in the margins so fast her handwriting leaned into tilt. “YOURS goes next to MINE,” she said, “with ASK between them like a chaperone.”

The church kitchen had two speeds—simmer and thunder—and on the days Micheal worked the onions, a third sound entered, a steady mutter that was not complaint so much as rehearsal. Spike used a spoon large enough to paddle a canoe and declared the stock moral or immoral depending on what spice he reached for; Nan, who chopped garlic with a knife that had been her mother’s, swore gently in two languages and held her fingers like a claw. “Texture,” Spike said as he glanced at Micheal’s cutting board, and Micheal nodded and adjusted his dice to the size of corn kernels rather than confetti. He found a kind of joy in the finicky kindness of that choice. He wore a cheap bandana at his neck because the chili had a way of announcing itself on a shirt and he had learned that a small decision, like the tilt of a collar, can make a person feel stewarded by himself.

After the first hour of chopping the air pliable, Micheal asked Spike if he could take a picture. He said the sentence he had learned to say, letting it travel the long hallway of his chest before he let it out into the room. “I am practicing permission. May I take a photograph of your hands lifting the spoon? Not your face. I will put it on a page that says what it is. You can say no. You can say later. You can say not today.” Spike made a face like he was reading a menu in a dim light and then nodded with the solemnity of men who like to be told their hands matter. He lifted the spoon, and the stew came up thick, and Micheal took two pictures only and showed Spike the best one instantly, like a person bringing back a borrowed tool. “Work of the City,” Spike said, tasting the phrase the way he tasted cumin, and he grinned in a way that made the creases on his face look like topographical lines on a beloved map.

Work of the City learned how to grow without gulping. It did not have the quick, bright sickness of a scandal; it had the slow, satisfying metabolism of soup. The posts took their time. A cobbler’s hand threading a needle, the waxed thread shining like a river in miniature. A crossing guard’s gloved fist closed around a whistle, the glove patched with stubborn care. The sleeve of a muralist spattered with cockatiel colors, the hand holding a brush like a baton. Each picture had a caption that began, by agreement with himself and with Sloan, with the words With permission, and then an unhurried sentence about the act. The comments were not clean—nothing human ever is—but there were fewer knives and more bread. People tagged the people in the pictures not to shame them but to applaud. In a thread beneath the hands that fixed a bicycle chain, two teenagers argued about whether WD-40 is an acceptable hack or a sin, and a man who had been fixing bikes since before they were born waded in and gave them both advice without grabbing their throats.

Consent became a word in the air with less aftertaste. At the workshop above the donut shop, twelve people came and then fifteen and then thirty, and they sat on mismatched chairs and wrote phrases on index cards they could carry like charms. One man, who had the frankly collapsed face of someone who was ten minutes late into learning how to stop apologizing for his own breath, wrote MAYBE LATER and looked at it as if it were a hand he had not known was his. A woman wrote I DON’T OWE YOU ANYTHING FOR BEING NICE and underlined it and then came up to share it with a trembling she pretended was anger and admitted was relief. Theo sat in the back with the musicians and occasionally blew a note that made everyone laugh and then think. Seranella used stories like splints. She told the room about a queen who refused three gifts and kept the fourth and saved her village with the sting of that yes. She told them about a boy who learned to say no to a river and then learned to swim and laughed at himself. When a woman asked what to say to her mother-in-law who knocks and then opens without waiting, Seranella wrote the words WAIT ONE MINUTE on a tile and sent it home in the woman’s purse with two donuts and the smell of coffee like a benediction.

It took three weeks for the dean to call her in and sit with his hands arranged on his desk like a little museum of his own fingers. He sounded not like a man who wanted to stop her but like one who needed to arrange the polish on the university’s image. “Community engagement is wonderful,” he said, “as long as it remains, well, community and does not become, you know, crisis management.” She watched his mouth form caveats and cherished how tired the plant in the corner looked, its leaves smudged by the same dust as her compassion. “I am not doing crisis management,” she said, and then because she had promised herself to stop calling courage by its cheapest names, she told him what she was doing. “I am building curriculum with neighbors. It seems like crisis because the country is what it is. It is scholarship because this is how stories are made now and how they could be made differently. I will file the forms you want. I will not ask the city to wait until the forms are approved.” He looked at her the way men look when they want to be generous and are terrified they are not getting credit for it, and then he waved her out with something like relief. In the hallway, Carter handed her a banana and said, “You fight better with potassium in you,” and she took a bite so she wouldn’t say something that tasted like pine.

Anniversary dates crouch in calendars like cats. Sloan drew a small circle on a paper calendar with a fountain pen that once belonged to his mother and told Micheal that the first time a date came around after a loss, it would seem like a door had been propped open to a room he didn’t wish to visit. “Plan the day for the person you are,” Sloan said in his way that didn’t make advice sound like an invoice, and they made a schedule—sandbags if the river called, tile hanging if the Parks Department had found the right wrench, soup if Spike could stand one more volunteer. They wrote WALK near the evening, and beside it, in a much smaller script, the words take the napkin if you want. Micheal folded that day in half like a letter he was going to read in the shade and then tucked it into his pocket with the other reliquaries. He stood at the ditch as the light slipped from yellow to bruise and said names like spices added one small pinch at a time, and when he was done he did not reach for a picture because the seeing didn’t need to be proofed. He let the wind lift the edge of the napkin and put it down again.

The rumor that wasn’t him had a brother rumor that was nobody. In a private group with a name like Mamas On Patrol they shared a photograph of a man with the kind of disreputable beard that happens when grief raises your face and you forget to bring a razor. The caption, written in honking capital letters, said WATCH THIS MAN, and three hundred eyes joined in without curiosity, and in an hour someone had tagged the school board. Carter walked into her office with his mouth made into an apology and his hands empty and said, “We can’t put the Internet back in the bottle,” and she said, “We never could, we just got better at wiping the counter when the bottle spills,” and she wrote a lesson plan that was part user guide and part sacrament and put it in the hands of anyone who wanted it. A seventeen-year-old she had never met sent her a message that said, I told my mom to blur faces before she posts, and it felt like picking up a coin from a sidewalk that had been waiting for exactly his foot.

The tiles went up one by one as if they knew where they belonged. At the shelter by the library—where the plastic walls kept the wind off your shins and the sign they’d hung the week before already wore fingerprints like a tiny, rebellious patina—Micheal held the ladder and counted zip ties under his breath as if each click were exactly one narrower between him and his least wise habit. A boy in a dinosaur shirt, older now by a handful of inches and a whole new multiplicity of questions, read the tiles aloud: YES, NO, MINE, YOURS, ASK, THANKS, STOP, GO, YET. He tapped the YET with a finger and then turned to his mother and said, “It means not now but maybe later,” and his mother said, “It means your yes grows the way your shoes do,” and the boy nodded like a person who has agreed with a friend rather than cut a deal with a teacher. A woman who had come for the bus but stayed for the theater stood to the side with her arms crossed and the corners of her mouth turned down in that careful way that says I am not ready to admit this is making me feel safer, and then she said, loud enough for the air to record it, “That’s good,” and walked on, the words wearing new boots behind her.

The relapse, when it came, did not look like a cliff so much as a curb he missed seeing. He was at the grocery store on a Wednesday morning that had already borrowed trouble from the afternoon, and a little girl sitting in the cart seat was eating free cheese from the sample tray with a reverence that made him smile behind his teeth. She held up a thumb to her mother, cheese-wet, and said, “I like this one,” and Micheal felt every tendon in his forearm yank toward the old ask the way an old horse turns toward the stable. He put his hand in his pocket and touched the small card with the sentence that saved his mouth. I am practicing not asking. You are safe. I am leaving now. He did not take it out. He did not hold it up like a flag. He said only, quietly, to his own thumb: down. And then he turned and looked at the display of beans as if beans had never been invented and he needed their history. On his way out of the aisle, the girl saw him and waved, not because she knew him, but because waves come cheap at that age and are very valuable anyway, and he lifted his hand and waggled it once and made his face a soft, easy thing and he did not die.

Liam asked to interview him for a final project, and Micheal said yes and then stopped himself and said, “Ask me the questions in writing first,” and Liam’s whole face clapped without his hands. They sat on the steps outside the co-op on a day when the sky was so obviously a sky it felt like an appropriation of itself, and Liam asked things like what does it feel like for the page not to be yours anymore and what did you learn about hands that you didn’t want to know and do you have a favorite tile. Micheal answered the way a field answers in spring—with patience and a willingness to be wrong because there will be more rain. He said his favorite tile changed depending on whether he had slept. He said sometimes he woke up loving THANKS more than YES and sometimes ASK felt like a small clean bandage and sometimes YET sat in his chest like a stove. When Liam asked if he missed the rush of the old page—the fast drip, the prickling attention—Micheal looked at his own hands and said, “I miss the rhythm, not the song. I am learning different drums.”

At the brewery where Theo wore a hat with a feather that made people who had never met a saxophone before fall in love with one, a man approached after the second set and introduced himself with a name that meant river in a language neither of them spoke. He had the burned, bright look of the newly sober and carried his elbows carefully as if they had only recently signed a peace treaty with his ribs. “Your essay,” he said to Seranella, “made my mother’s book club mad enough to bake bars and talk to their kids,” and they both laughed and then stopped because the southern part of themselves knew when to go quiet. He told her that his sister had cried with relief reading the part where she wrote about how permission is as small as borrowing a mug and as big as letting someone see your grief without calling it a hurricane. He told her he’d been a person who asked badly for a long time and that he had started saying “Is this a good time?” to cashiers when he wanted to tell them a joke about strawberries, and that it was changing the way strawberries tasted. They clinked glasses like cousins. Theo played a standard so slow it made the air thicken into syrup, and the front door opened and closed and let the river in and out like a breath.

What began to spread—a rumor’s older, steadier cousin—was a practice. Parents began to say the word boundary in the kitchen without rolling their eyes. Children began to ask their teachers, “Can I talk to you about what happened at recess?” without having to first swallow the fact that some adults view children talking as a weather pattern to be avoided. Carter built a small assignment into his composition class: write a permission slip to yourself and staple it to your draft. The slips were funny and earnest and occasionally unhinged in a way that made him want to carry them like a wallet. Students wrote, I give myself permission to take out the sentence that only exists because I think my high school teacher is still in the room. They wrote, I give myself permission to hate semicolons this week. They wrote, I give myself permission to end the essay with a story that is not metaphorical for once and just is. He read them on his bike at red lights and had to wipe at his eyes with the cuff of his jacket, and then the light turned and he pedaled and looked like a man being chased kindly.

The city stubbornly kept being a city—which is to say, loud, and and ridiculous, and tender, and unwilling to be coerced into being one thing. The Three Rivers Festival rolled around with floats that looked like old men’s jokes and smelled like sugar and gasoline, and the Work of the City page asked for permission to take only a few pictures because the camera didn’t need to be everywhere and also because joy is shy if you shove. Micheal held a paper tray of elephant ear the size of an atlas and let powdered sugar seam his knuckles in a memory he didn’t expect. A child bumped his hip and said sorry to the air and a father behind her said, “Tell the man,” and she did, looking him in the face without flinching, and he shrugged like a dock and said, “We’re all gnats in this caramel,” and the father laughed and then put his hand on his daughter’s shoulder and squeezed, permission implicit in the way her shoulder leaned back into his palm and did not try to squirm.

On a Tuesday that had nothing to recommend it except its own Tuesday-ness, a man with the lightning-bolt jaw showed up on camera at a corner two blocks away from the library shelter, and a mother gripped a stroller too hard and broke the little plastic latch that had been cracked since March. The sergeant with the painted hair called three different people in a row without leaving a message for any of them, because sometimes the act of calling is the rope you need to get across the creek, and then he went outside and ate a sandwich on the building’s steps the way he did when he needed to remind himself that his mouth is not only for announcements. He watched a boy on a scooter count his own pushes, watched two girls walk with their foreheads almost touching as if sharing a thought that had a tricky shape, watched a woman tap a tile at the shelter with her fingernail and then nod and then cross the street without making a face, and he took another bite and thought about how law is a blunt instrument and signs are a pencil and people are water that remembers both instruments and ignores them when it has to.

Sloan ordered more koi ties online and laughed about it with the receptionist, who confessed she had a soft spot for ugly ties because they told the truth about how Americans treat their necks. He and Micheal kept making lists, small ones, with words that were so plain you could skate on them. Coffee with Spike on Friday. Avoid the corner by the donut shop between two and four until the tile dries. Take a picture of the man who repairs trombones only after asking. Text Seranella if a rumor bites your ankle. Call the sergeant if the bite draws blood. Sit by the river on purpose and do not call it church. It seemed ridiculous to write these things down, and it seemed like the only way any of them ever learned anything. Sloan suspected that most of therapy was a series of tiny printouts a person made for themselves and tucked into pockets they kept forgetting they possessed. When he said as much out loud, Micheal laughed, a sound like a porch cough, and said, “I am a library of crumpled slips,” and Sloan said, “We all are,” and felt less like a man performing a vocation and more like a neighbor with extra sugar.

There were still people who sneered at the sign, people who thought a city can find safety only by holding itself as hard as a fist. There was still the afternoon when a woman said to her friend, “I don’t need a sign to tell me how to parent,” right under the sign, under the word ASK, and a teenager with a skateboard slid by and said, without stopping, “It’s not for you then, it’s for the guy who can’t read your mind,” and the women both turned and said Hey the way women say Hey when they have been called in by a child, and then they laughed, and the teenager rode on with his mouth pressed into the smile he saved for when the world let him be exactly what his body had been wanting to be for eight years and hadn’t been allowed to.

One inch of weather can make people kind or cruel. The day the river rose two inches higher than anyone wanted and then two more and then shrugged at sandbags as if they were an old-fashioned hat, the Work of the City page posted a picture, with permission, of hands in neon gloves passing bag after bag after bag, and the caption said, Permission to rest granted after ten, and the comments were almost entirely people telling each other where the dry doughnuts still were. Micheal lifted until his back made a music that was not unpleasant, until the edge of the river had become less hungry, until someone with a clipboard said thank you as if they were not used to saying it and had been practicing in their car.

People brought their own small things to the bus shelter. A grandmother taped up a postcard that said WATER, BREAKS in marker because she had forgotten the comma and then decided she liked what the mistake implied. A boy left a bubble wand and came back for it later and left it again because it made the bench look like a party. Someone threaded a ribbon through a zip tie and watched it flap and then cut it down because its flapping sounded like a lie the shelter wasn’t ready to tell. The tiles gathered grime and fingerprints; they gathered a history of pointing. Someone broke a corner with a boot and then left a note that said Sorry and a dollar under a rock, and the dollar blew away but the sorry stuck as if words have better soles.

At the library, a reading took place in the children’s corner. The book was about a creature who lived under a bridge and turned out to be a neighbor who liked pie, and the librarian read it with a dignity that made ridiculousness an honor. Micheal stood in the doorway for a minute with his hands in his pockets and thought about whether to sit, and then he didn’t sit because the doorway was where his feet decided they should stand. He watched a little girl lift her thumb to the picture and then turn and put it down and then lift it again because she had learned that her body could try out answers without owing the room an explanation, and he felt something like envy and then something like ache and then something like instruction. When the children stamped their feet in a pretend troll beat, he stamped his foot once, quietly, and felt the floor answer him.

The day the first tile cracked all the way through from a tiny invisible hairline to a confession, it was the tile with YET. The crack ran right through the crossbar of the E, giving the letter a scar like a hinged door. For a minute, the damage drew a little circle of dismay and then a circle of hands. Liam took a picture of it in the oblique light and posted it with the caption We’re not stronger than weather; we’re in conversation with it, and for a day the comments were earnest enough to make a person suspicious of the city and then they softened into people offering to bring grout. Micheal put his finger on the crack and followed it with his fingertip all the way along, as if it were a seam on a quilt, and then he stepped back and let somebody who had better glue than he did do the repairing. “It’s right,” he said to no one, and to everyone. “It’s right that this is the one that broke and we fix it and it still says what it says.”

When the first letter came addressed to LaundrySalt care of the university, the secretary who had learned not to judge strange envelopes brought it to the folklore office with the same look she’d use if she were delivering a cake with its name spelled wrong. The return address was from a woman in Sandusky, which made Seranella smile because Michael had once said the word and enjoyed how it scratched his mouth, and inside there was a photograph from the eighties—someone’s fingers with raisins lined up on their knuckles, a kitchen table that could have been anyone’s, a dog under the table with an expression that said today is the day I graduate to pie. The note said, My brother used to line them up like this and now he is gone and I’m glad someone else knows. The handwriting had the shape of marching ants. On the back, someone had written the word yes in pencil and rubbed it out and written it again and rubbed it out again and left the ghost of each attempt as if the page had been practicing an answer.

By the time autumn made its annual, theater kid entrance with a scarf and a plan, Seranella’s class had a rhythm that felt like a cure and not a job. They collected local variants of myths and did not let them become weapons. They listened to a guest—Raymond, the man who had commented about the Thumb Man in the flood wall days—tell them about how stories do not warn so much as practice, and how sometimes what they practice is paranoia and then you have to be the person who practices softness louder. They went to the shelter in small groups and stood around pretending to be waiting for a bus and asked strangers for permission to say hello, and counted how often yes came out of the right mouths. They built a small online archive of Work of the City with care instructions, like you get with plants: water weekly; praise often; bring back to light after bruises; ask aloud.

One night, after a long day that had been both good and ragged in all the predictable ways, Micheal walked not under the bridge but to the middle of it. He stood where the cars do not get to linger and leaned on the rail. The river did not perform for him; it was busy trying to solve another of its own impossible equations—how to move while remaining itself, how to accept bottles and rain and reflections and yet not become them. He pulled the napkin out again and looked at it because even when you know a word by heart sometimes you need to see it written on something that isn’t you. He thought of the tile with the crack and how it had been put back gently and how it would never be uncracked and how that was exactly the point. He put the napkin back into his pocket and said out loud, because the bridge wanted it said, “I am not what they said I was. I am not what I said I was either. I am the part of the story where we stop and listen to the page turn.” He laughed then, at his own earnestness, and a teenager on a bike went by and said, “Preach, buddy,” and he waved without thinking and then looked at his hand and decided to let the gesture go unexamined for once.

In the house with the plant that tapped and the cat that had finally agreed to forgive the word consent for being overused in earnest circles, there was one more small thing. On a low shelf, behind the frame with a face in it and a good amount of dust because you cannot be an honest person and pretend your shelves are always curated, Seranella placed a tile. It was not one of the public ones; it was a test piece, glazed too thin, the word HELP a little crooked, the corner chipped. She liked it because it looked like it had been used. She liked it because it asked without apologizing for asking. When Theo came home whistling the part of a standard that sometimes saves her from herself, Theo saw the tile and kissed her with half-closed eyes and said, “We’re all just rearranging furniture in the same room,” and she said, “Exactly,” and they turned off their phones without making a ceremony of it and let the building speak to them in its piping and its clanks and its night creatures moving through the walls like ideas. The rain came in the middle of the night and, without asking anyone’s permission, tapped on every window in the city saying, in its only language, yes yes yes, and in a thousand rooms people said yes back and pulled the sheets up and let themselves be held by the place they were in.Chapter 7

First ice comes disguised as clarity. The river put on a skin so thin that even the geese did not trust it, stepped onto it with their comic hesitations and then backed off, muttering. Light went hard. Sound traveled farther than it should have, so a laughter over by the donuts shop could be heard under the bridge where only crows used to live. Micheal’s breath made steam that threaded itself into the fog that had forgotten it was not supposed to be here in December. His knees let him know the barometer had opinions. He did not go under the bridge much now—he did not like the way winter collected men there like bad coins—but sometimes he came and stood at the mouth of it like a man who has forgiven a house for how it made him feel. He wore gloves that someone had put on the fence by the church with a note that said TAKE THE PAIR, NOT JUST THE LUCK, and they were too small and made his hands look like bread being braided. When he went to take a picture, he took one glove off and put it in his pocket because he did not want to drop it into the water and witness a metaphor he hadn’t asked for.

Work of the City looked beautiful in cold. The hands were padded, wrapped, idle at stoplights while their owners blew into them, busy at knit nights in the back of the library where someone had hung fairy lights and called them “seasonal ambition.” He asked to take pictures of mittens with permission, caught the wide gesture of a plow driver’s wrist as she flicked a switch that made the blade curl up like a cat. He watched a woman in a laundromat thread a string through the hem of a coat because a drawstring is how you keep winter out when your zipper forgets itself. He took a picture of a hand spreading salt with a little scoop, the granules catching light like cheap jewelry, and he captioned it With permission: salt is a plan you put on the ground. He learned to ask to photograph the napkin when a cook folded utensils into it like a baby in a blanket. He kept saying, with permission, with permission, until the phrase stopped tasting like a foreign language and started feeling like a door with hinges that had been oiled.

On campus, the plant in Seranella’s window leaned away from the glass as if it had learned the word frost as a verb. She put down a saucer to catch the extra water and wrote in a margin the sentence she was trying to remember: some seasons want to be explained and some seasons want to be carried. Invitations had begun to stack, which is another way of saying that a thing had become visible enough for the people who mail invitations to notice. A foundation that specialized in community projects written mostly in photographs wanted to fund the signs. The city’s marketing office wanted to call the tiles an “initiative” and design a logo that looked like the inside of a dentist’s office. The dean wanted her to stop saying the word ogre in front of donors because it made them think about teeth and poverty at the same time. She said yes to the foundation and no to the logo and to the dean she said, “I won’t tell them about the ogre; I’ll tell them about the tiles,” and then she told him about the tiles so tenderly that he asked for one for his office and she gave him NO in cobalt because he didn’t know how to say it and needed the practice.

They held the meeting at the rec center because it smelled like effort and not like a press conference, and the people who came were exactly the ones you hope for when you imagine a city walking into a room on purpose: bus drivers and sculptors and a grandmother with a cane that had been carved by a cousin, teens with posture that swore, a guy who ran sound for a punk venue and brought clipboards like a wedding. There were cookies that could have been carved into soap and coffee in silver urns that always dribbled a little no matter who poured. A woman from the foundation wore a sweater with small beads along the collar and did not say synergy once; instead she said, “Our money wants to sit next to your table so you can feed it only what you think it should eat.” Seranella said, “Feed Spike’s kitchen first,” and the woman nodded and by the time the meeting was over there was a little list with actual numbers on it and not just air. It felt like a trick and it wasn’t; sometimes institutions make a sound like a door creaking and the door is, in fact, opening.

Then there was the patrol. Dell was the man’s name, a name like a field pretending to be gentle. He had a coat with a patch that declared him part of something that decorated itself with the word vigilance, and a small camera clipped to his pocket that was always on. He had a son in third grade at Washington and a fury that he could not spend fast enough. He found Micheal two blocks from the bus shelter and called to him with a tone designed to turn a person into a target. “Hey,” he said, walking fast in boots that had the sound of a plan. “Hey. You. Your face is on my neighborhood watch. You’re not supposed to be near the stop.” He had two other men with him, a cousin and a neighbor, both vibrating in that way men vibrate when they wish someone to hit them, or want to hit someone, so they can call it conclusion.

Micheal had a card in his pocket and a name for the wind and a promise he had made to himself about how to stand when someone wanted him to kneel. He put his hands up, palms empty, and said, “I am leaving now,” before any of them could get to their own speeches. He pointed, slowly, at the church and said, “Soup,” because that was the word that saved him most. He took a step back and another. The men stepped forward. Dell said, “You think you can just move along and that’s it,” and his mouth got small, and anger made him look ten years younger and twenty years meaner. “We know who you are. We know what you want.”

There are moments when the city decides if it wants to be a witness or a mob. The librarian from the branch came out, because librarians hear yelling and gently dislike it. The sergeant with the painted hair was called by the teenager who had learned last month how to set a boundary without looking like a cop, and he answered in that way where he kept his voice low so it traveled farther. Liam, who had been on his bike and had the instinct to film the wrong thing at the right time, put his phone back into his pocket like a warm egg because he was trying to be the person who did not feed fires unless they wanted warmth. Seranella arrived out of breath because she had been upstairs at the donuts shop arguing with a graduate student about whether enchantment was a political strategy, and she had left mid-sentence, and the student had understood.

“What if,” she said into the air between the men, “we let the police do what they learned to do for exactly this moment,” and Dell turned and said, “Lady,” because a certain kind of man says lady as if the word rhymes with leash, “lady, you know how this goes. He does something weird, people get worried, nothing happens, and then something happens.”

“The something that happens today is soup,” she said, and her voice did not tremble only because she had taught it not to when wind blew. “And a conversation that will go on paper and not on your face. And a walk to the church. And a call to your school’s counseling department so you don’t have to spend this whole month with your body running without permission. You can decide not to be recruited by your own fear.” The sergeant, whose car had ghosted up with the confidence of a well-trained turtle, stood with his hands out by his sides in a gesture that made both the librarians relax and the men feel seen. He said Dell’s name in the way a man says another man’s name only when one of them is very close to making a mess that will be the story of the year at Thanksgiving.

It did not end with a hug, because that would have been a lie. It ended with a note made at the Public Safety desk that said a warning was reiterated and would escalate if lines were crossed, and with Dell snarling while signing a piece of paper he did not think would protect anyone from bad endings. It ended with a boy on a scooter zipping by and rolling his eyes so theatrically his mother had to pretend not to laugh. It ended with Micheal in the church kitchen with the bandana at his neck and the onion in his hands and an apology in his throat that he did not owe to anyone and would not say out loud, because apologies are a fruit you hand to the person you have taken from and today he had taken from no one. Later, in Sloan’s office, he said the thing that tasted like a small nail, “I wanted to show the man my card like a boy shows a scar,” and Sloan said, “Next time give me a call you don’t relish and we’ll put our heads together hard enough to hammer.” He let that silly metaphor sit between them and be useful.

Theo wrote a piece called The Yes/No Suite and played it once at the brewery and once at a school board meeting because the board had learned that music can do more for shame than speeches can. The suite had three movements: the first sounded like a question asked by someone training their tongue to be polite without being cowardly; the second sounded like a clean no that did not apologize for the taste it leaves; the third sounded like a room full of people who have learned to ask for chairs instead of standing because they didn’t want to bother anyone. People cried during the second movement and laughed during the third, and Theo afterward leaned against a wall and let strangers bring their small confessions to their coat sleeves. Seranella sat in the back with a styrofoam cup of coffee her department would never reimburse and watched hidebound men become for ten minutes sort-of-priests and felt less alone than she had since June.

Sloan gave homework that rode in the pocket like a little warm stone. Write a letter, he told Micheal, but not a letter that expects an answer. Write it as if your body were allowed to be a mailbox. Micheal took paper that didn’t know anything and wrote the names and then wrote this: I did not know my yes was a thing I could hold. I thought I had to hand it out to keep the night busy. He wrote: I want to tell you how small yes sounds from a child. It sounds like the clink of a spoon on a cup. He wrote: I will build you a wall of soup tickets and rain boots and the round part of a saxophone where it bells and turns polite. He folded the paper in half and thought about putting it in the water because the river likes being a postal service for people who have run out of stamps. He put it in his pocket instead, where it found the napkin and the business card and the small tile Sloan had pressed into his palm the week before like a dare.

The bus driver, Ms. Johnson, sprained her ankle on the second Thursday of hard incident and let herself be taken home with a kind of honor that good workers have to be taught to accept. Work of the City made a fundraiser that did not have the stink of pity and did not have the purity of anything in this world. They asked for permission to take pictures all along her route. With permission: a hand putting a note on a refrigerator that says Ms. Johnson takes care of us. With permission: a bus stop seat covered in an afghan someone had crocheted in the colors of a faded advertisement. With permission: the steering wheel with no hands on it, just the impression, the way beds hold the shape of bodies who only got up five minutes ago. Donations were small and full of coins; the soup kitchen put a jar on its counter and filled it faster than people meant to. Ms. Johnson cried two times only and both times behind sunglasses, and when a boy in a dinosaur shirt drew her a card with a bus that looked like it was dancing, she laughed and then set the card on her kitchen table and said to herself, out loud, “We are idiots when we do not ask for help,” and felt the strange warmth of being the person who can say that without dying of it.

Ice took down power for a night and reminded the city that candles are not romantic unless you want them to be. The church opened as a warming center and in came faces that knew each other from arguments and block parties and softball and Facebook comments that had gone wrong. People sat with their coats still on, hats still on, phones plugged into a hydra of extension cords, the air full of the sound of devices sighing and reviving. Spike made a soup that could feed a choir; Nan put together trays of peanut butter sandwiches that made the church smell like kindergarten. A girl whose mother had been saving batteries for Christmas toys walked around with a basket of AA and asked people what size they needed as if she were a haberdasher. A man who had never before wanted to be in a room with strangers gave a stranger his glove because the stranger’s hands remembered being cold very vividly and his own hands had forgotten. The sign at the bus shelter across the street from the church glittered with a skin of ice and the tiles were glazed again by weather, and someone had scrawled in the fog of plastic with a fingertip two words that would be gone as soon as it warmed: US TOO.

After the lights came back on in the neighborhood where lights usually stay on longer than they should, after the charge bars crawled up to green and the soup pots were washed even if their corners still remembered chili, a letter came for Work of the City from the county office that liked to say no first and yes only after three meetings. The letter said the tiles were lovely and the paint was inspiring and the signs were fine, but there were rules about adding things to bus shelters that did not belong to anyone except the people who used them, which is to say the city that forgot it was a person. The letter said the tiles should come down. The letter said someone had complained about the color of NO. The letter was written in a font that was trying to be friendly but kept being a little condescending, like a dentist who calls you kiddo. The sergeant took his copy of the letter and set his coffee cup on it because it made a very good coaster. Seranella read hers with Theo over cereal, and Theo took a marker and drew a tiny crown over the word NO because sometimes the only reply to bureaucratic foolishness is to be peacefully rude. Micheal pressed his hands on either side of his own copy and then folded it into a paper crane because he had never learned cranes but he could learn it now and a new shape is a kind of argument.

They did not take the tiles down. They wrote a reply in the voice of many people at once, which is a sound that has its own authority if you get the harmony right. They invited the letter-writer to walk with them to the shelter and watch as a twelve-year-old held his mother’s hand and used the word ASK without tripping on it. They sent Ms. Johnson’s handwritten thank you, because gratitude is a weapon with a soft head and it leaves bruises you can call pride. They sat a county official on the bench and let them watch ten people read the signs and leave looking like their coats fit better. The official, who had a daughter named Marigold and a secret fondness for signs that told the truth, wrote back three days later with a letter that had less font and more voice. The letter said, Keep them. The letter said, If anyone breaks one, we will learn how to fix tile. The letter said, Tell us if you want them in three more places. The letter did not apologize because governments cannot apologize without birthing new paperwork, but it did something like apology without naming it.

The lightning-bolt jaw came back in a different story. He was at a shelter two neighborhoods over, closing his hand over a child’s wrist with the thoughtless urgency that means a person doesn’t know any better yet and maybe doesn’t want to. A mother shouted with the voice that comes out when survival sits up in bed and says I’m awake now. The sergeant drove and did not turn on his lights because sometimes sirens make the wrong people run. Sloan, on his way back from buying a tie that had cranes on it, stopped because he recognized trouble even in profile. Micheal did not go; this is important. He did not go because he did not belong to every emergency, and because not showing up is one of the new skills he has learned, a hinge he can now call by name. The man with the jaw went away in a car that takes people to places where they get told No by people who have the right to say it. The mother’s hand shook afterward and she went to the shelter to put it on the tile that said THANKS and then on the one that said STOP and then she took a picture of her hand there and did not post it and also did not delete it and that is how some people make a memory.

Liam defended his project in a room where professors held pencils like gavel alternatives and other students watched as if curriculums are small animals that might bolt if you clap. He played the part of the patrol in a voice that made the room stiffen, and the part of the librarian in a voice like a creek, and the part of the sergeant with a painted hair in a voice that did not mock. He asked his listeners to create a new variant of the Thumb Man story that ended in a sign and soup instead of a chase. He did not show a picture of Micheal because that was not what the project was for. He showed a picture of the cracked tile, fixed and still cracked, and asked them to tell him whether they believed cracks are weaknesses or maps. He sat after, and his breath came out in the small, controlled bits of a person who has learned not to faint in front of authority. His professor said, “This is scholarship that could feed a town,” and gave him a grade he showed to his grandmother by holding it up from the sidewalk as she stood on her porch and clapped without knowing what letters stand for anymore.

At home, where the radiator clicked the way radiators do when they are thinking about whether to turn back on, where the plant kept tapping its small arguments against the glass, where the cat had decided to love winter for the blankets and not for the windows, Theo and Seranella made a ritual they did not name because naming rituals makes them less portable. Before bed they stood in the doorway and said the words out loud that they wanted to give the day. Sometimes it was just two small words. Thanks. Not yet. Sometimes they put a hand on the tile that said HELP and let the edge of it bite their palm so they would remember that asking costs a little, and they went to bed thinking about the way the whole city was really just a complicated system for helping hands and stopping hands and hands that need to be told where to rest.

One morning, when the cold had been so consistent that the city stopped complaining about it aloud and began the quiet negotiation that winter requires, Micheal walked across the bridge at the time when buses were late and people were polite about it. He had the napkin in his pocket because he always did and the card and the small tile and something else now: a folded flyer for a volunteer ceramics class that took people’s clumsy hands and taught them how to hold mud without apologizing to it. He had been invited by the woman with the beaded sweater and had laughed at the idea of himself at a wheel and then found himself practicing cupping in the air as if his hands had been waiting to be told to turn into bowls. He stopped at the shelter and checked the zip ties like a man checks his gate when a storm starts. A boy with a dinosaur hat—different child, same dinosaur, because some tastes are a species—looked up at him with the curiosity cold gives children before they learn what they are supposed to ignore. “Are you the yes guy?” he said, and the mother half-turned, ready to intervene.

“I am one of them,” Micheal said, which was true and easier. The boy nodded as if checking off a list of superheroes. He put his palm on the tile that said ASK, turned to his mother and said, “Can I be cold without gloves,” and his mother said, “For three minutes,” and the boy grinned as if he had just won a coin toss with weather. Micheal felt his body do the small slide it does when a memory tries to take the wheel. He put his hand on the tile with the crack and followed it down with a finger as if the crack were a creek he could learn. “Yet,” he said, testing it one more time aloud because the world is always the same test in a new coat. The river, which had no ears and all the ears, kept moving as if movement is the closest thing to prayer a body can reliably remember. He turned his glove inside out to warm his fingers and made a plan to put his hands in clay that afternoon, to let them learn a way to hold something without keeping it, to let them come home with a bowl that would wobble on the table and be beloved for its unsteadiness, the way unsteadiness is beloved when it has finally learned how to put itself down without breaking.Chapter 8

Clay remembers what your hands did to it the way snow remembers who walked first. The ceramics co-op smelled like wet earth and hot dust; the kilns hummed with the self-importance of machines that know they make permanent what people only meant to practice. Maritza, the instructor with wrists like small engines and a braid coiled at the nape of her neck like a sleeping animal, stood behind Micheal and put her hands on his hands without touching them. “Anchor,” she said, which was a word he was already learning to love. “Press. Don’t bully it. Ask the clay to come to the center, and then keep it there. It’s stubborn. So are you. Meet in the middle or you’ll be trimming lopsided moons all afternoon.”

He laughed because she had caught him, and he pressed the heel of his palm down until the clay stopped wobbling like a baby deer. Centering was a secret you performed with tendons, not brute. The wheel hummed; the slip spun out in a pale galaxy. When he tried to open the lump, his thumbs wanted to do what they had always done—lead without listening. He paused, breathed, felt the old habit flare and fall. “With permission,” he said under the roar of the fans, and slid his thumbs into the soft, coaxing a hollow that did not collapse. It was a bowl in the way a newborn is a person—mostly in promise. Maritza nodded. “Good,” she said. “You can leave your print in the rim. We teach students not to, then we get old enough to know the rim wants a memory.”

By the end of the hour, his table was a geography of almosts. A mug that leaned like it was asking a question. A shallow dish with the faint, honest whorls of his fingerprints along the lip. A small cylinder that might become a vase if it forgave him for the way he kept listening too late. He did one more, a low bowl that gathered itself around his hands in a way that felt like trust, and he pressed letters into the side with a rubber stamp Maritza kept in a cluttered drawer—L I S T E N, not as an instruction for anyone else, but as a reminder that even clay replies if you leave it the room. When Maritza lifted the piece to the ware board, she added his name to a masking-tape label. She spelled it the way his pocket had taught him to love it. He was surprised by how it felt to see it right there, not a correction, not a joke, just a thing that belonged to him, drying among other hopeful shapes.

While the bowls learned patience in air, the world insisted on being itself. On campus, Seranella met with students from a community group that translated official notices into the languages people actually spoke at home. They gathered in the library’s glass box of a study room, steam from coffees making small clouds on the panes as if the breath of their sentences could stick. A woman from the Karen community tapped a finger on a list of words and shook her head over NO; in her tongue, the strongest negative could carry shame if handled wrong. A man who had grown up toggling between Spanish and English argued gently that ASK had to be more than pedir; it needed to be the version that included respect, permiso, the way you ask a grandmother to let you use her oven. A teen with headphones around his neck like a wreath suggested that the Burmese word for thanks they’d used on a city flyer last year felt transactional and that gratitude in his family looked more like an acknowledgment that you’d been changed by the help. They agreed on four languages for the next set of tiles and three for the small sign at the shelter’s far side. They argued over fonts for longer than anyone needed to and laughed at themselves for it because letters have costumes, and they wanted this costume to be something that let the words go to work without being stared at.

The foundation’s check cleared, and with it came the particular anxiety of being believed. The city marketing office sent a man with a blazer the color of unripe avocados who said “branding” like it could rescue a deer from ice, and when he suggested a palette of “approachable teal” for consent, Seranella found her mouth making kind shapes while her hand under the table squeezed Theo’s knee so hard he would have a bruise, and afterward they went to the shelter and watched a mother trace ASK in yellow with the pad of her finger and say to her son, “It’s a sunflower,” and the boy nodded solemnly as if permissions had petals. They stuck with cobalt and green and red. Sometimes a message wears boots. Sometimes it wears a scarf. Either way, you want it to get there.

A rumor tried to run and tripped. A screenshot of a screenshot claimed the tiles were a stealth government project for collecting fingerprints. The comments lit up with the usual chorus, but this time the Work of the City page had a reply ready, not defensive, only tender and precise. With permission: here is a video of Ms. Alvarez, who helped translate, pressing her own palm to the tile and then wiping it off with her sleeve and laughing and wiping her sleeve on her jeans because she forgot sleeves aren’t napkins. With permission: here is a goofy photo of Liam with grout in his eyelashes and a zip tie around his wrist like a bracelet he forgot how to remove. The rumor did what rumors do when they’re hugged by facts; it sputtered, invented a new adjective, and went to sleep in a corner where it could feed on something else.

Dell, or Mr. Vigilance as the moms called him when they were tired enough to be cruel, showed up at the PTA meeting with a face that had learned to hide its serrations. He looked older in fluorescent light. His son, a boy with a cowlick that would not obey community standards, ran up to the mic during the open-comment time and said, “Ms. Johnson says we can decorate the bus with paper mittens,” and the room had to rearrange its posture around the sudden introduction of joy. Later, after the bake sale sign-up had pitched into its annual polite war, Dell stood near the coffee urn and said to Seranella, “I don’t… I won’t say I was wrong. I will say I was tired and thought I could outrun it by making a bad guy. I liked having one.” She let him have the sentence. He looked at the tile list taped to the wall and said, “My son came home and told his sister that he had a big yes and a small yes and he needed both. He was… proud of putting them in his pockets. I like that in his mouth better than in mine. That’s all I got.” She didn’t say good for you. She didn’t hand him a cookie. She said, “Keep him bragging about his pockets,” and poured more sugar into her coffee than she needed because sometimes nervous systems want sweetness as evidence.

There was one night, the kind that pretends to be quiet until you realize it has been carrying a thousand noises like a waitress with a tray, when someone took a marker and scrawled across the base of the sign NO MEANS NEVER. The script had anger in it, and exhaustion, and a little glee at making a mark. In the morning, a group gathered the way people gather when something happens to something they have loved in public. The sharpies came out. The debate warmed the air faster than breath. “It’s not wrong,” a woman said, “and also it makes me tired.” “It’s a good rule,” a man said, and a teenager snorted and said, “Rules are just stories that got uniforms.” Micheal stood back, thumb pressed to the crack in YET as if it were a bleeder he could staunch with his attention, and Sloan, who had arrived with coffee and gloves and the face of a man who teaches his own hands to stop wagging, said, “We can leave it and contextualize, or we can wash it and ask the person who wrote it to come to the next tile night if they want the word to be part of the room.” They decided to put a small tile below it that said REPAIR in weathered brown. They decided to add a poster at eye level for adults that said, in plain letters and a tone that borrowed authority from soup recipes, No means no; not now can become yes or no later; yes can change; boundaries help us be neighbors. They didn’t pretend the marker wasn’t there. They put a frame around it in tape, like a little museum of haste, and let it be what it was: a flare in a night that lasts longer than you think you can stand.

Ms. Johnson came back to the route with an elastic brace and an ankle that told the weather without asking for applause. The kids had decorated the bus windows with paper mittens they’d cut at school during indoor recess; each mitten had a word scrawled on it in marker fierce enough to bleed a little. PLEASE. THANKS. MINE. YOURS. ASK. YES. NO. YET. The bus looked like a parade float designed by grammar. Work of the City asked permission and took a picture from inside, so the camera saw Ms. Johnson’s eyes in the rearview mirror and the mittens around her like paper applause. Underneath, Micheal typed With permission: how many words does it take to drive a city. The comments piled up. An aunt in Florida sent five dollars toward gas cards like they were talismans. A kid in a different district wrote, My driver sings. Mine too, someone else said, and the thread turned into a hymn about routes, into somebody finding out that their drivers were old friends, into a reunion that would happen at a VFW after all this snow left people alone.

On the hill by the park, where cardboard becomes sleds and then rubbish if no one minds it, a small tribe of teenagers staked out a run and marked it with signs they’d made with leftover tile boards. They painted YES at the top like a dare, and halfway down they painted ASK with a little arrow toward the slicker lane, and at the bottom where the slope ran out into sidewalk and then street they stuck STOP into the snow with stakes. Micheal watched from the edge with a paper cup of cocoa he’d stirred until the sugar had dissolved; he held the cup too tight and then not tight enough and then exactly right, which felt like a parlor trick. A little boy in a dinosaur hat stood at the top and squinted at YES as if it were a judge. His mother shouted, “Pick a track and check your left,” and the boy did, and he flung himself into gravity with a sound that made two college students clap. When he got to STOP, he put his boots down and dragged them as if he had invented the concept of friction and wanted to show it off for them specifically.

Sloan taught urge surfing with a cheap plastic toy he’d bought at the dollar store, a bright blue surfboard with a sticker peeling off. He set it on the table and pushed it with two fingers until it slid off and clattered to the floor. “If you jump on a feeling, it will buck,” he said, with less sermon and more mischief than you’d predict. “If you watch it, it will still buck, but you won’t be the animal. You’re the guy on shore thinking about whether to put your feet in. When the wave rises, notice it. Get curious. Where do you feel it. What stupid things does it want you to do. How long does it take to crest. Put a stopwatch on it if that helps. Most waves, even the dramatic ones, peak and go. There’ll be another. There’s always another. We are not in charge of weather. We are in charge of whether we run into the lake with rocks in our pockets.” Micheal held the plastic board and flicked it like a coin. He said, “Sometimes the wave is small and I still end up wet.” Sloan nodded. “That’s practice. You don’t get graded. You get towels.”

A woman in Sandusky wrote back, the one with the marching-ant handwriting, and in her envelope was a photograph of tiles, too—someone else’s project, at a bus stop that smelled like lake. The words were different. HOLD HANDS, one said. WAIT, another. HERE. The inked letters had that slightly off-kilter look of new systems finding their stairs. The note said, You made us feel like we could say things out loud to our own children in case we forget we know them. We put them up with permission. One has already fallen and a girl with elbows like a rescue picked it up and said, “It’s right.” Seranella held the picture in the pool of the desk lamp’s light and thought about geography as a string of small bridges people throw across spaces they used to think were rivers instead of streets.

The muralist snuck a joke into paint. One morning the bricks at the edge of the shelter had a flourish of fish near the bottom—koi with ballooning cheeks rendered in a handful of strokes, nothing permanent enough to be an offense, sweet enough to be a nod. Sloan came by with a tie in the correct theme and pretended not to notice it until Liam pointed so hard he almost knocked his own eyebrows off. They took a picture together, with permission, and Work of the City posted it with a caption that did not out anybody and still made everyone who knew snort into their coffee: With permission: sometimes even fish need signs.

There was a gala, of course there was. There is always a room where a town wears too much jewelry and sneaks its real intentions into speeches about “impact.” The foundation invited them to say a few words in a hall that had once been a train depot and now pretended to be a greenhouse in winter. There were lights in the rafters like netted stars and tiny forks you had to hold like pencils to look civilized. Seranella wore a dress that made her look less tired and Theo wore a suit he called his “sax funeral outfit” and a tie with small polite swears in the pattern that no donor would ever decode. She did not bring Micheal because he had asked not to be a symbol, and also because she knew that in rooms like this the air thins and your story gets pressed to fit a frame someone else can put on a brochure. She brought Ms. Johnson instead. When it was time, she did not talk about ogres. She talked about the sound a child’s boot makes when it hits STOP. She talked about permission like it was a switch you install in a community center. Ms. Johnson took the mic like she takes a corner—steady, no flourish—and said, “If you wave at me please do it with all your fingers and not just one, and if you send your kid to the bus I expect you to send their words with them, not just their lunch,” and the room laughed and then took notes without realizing.

The next morning, while the donor photos were still being sorted, the cracked tile at the shelter split itself off from its grout with a soft, exhausted sigh. It didn’t shatter; it stepped out of its bed like a stubborn tooth and sat at an angle. Micheal found it because he found everything now that had that particular frequency of needing a hand. He did not try to put it back. He picked it up with the kind of care you reserve for things with edges, and he carried it to the co-op where the artists were laying out the next firing on a shelf that looked like an altar to domestic perseverance. He set it on the table and asked Maritza how to fix a thing like this without making it fake. “Kintsugi is one way,” she said, running a finger around the crack without falling into art talk on purpose, “but gold makes people think of absolutes. You can use a slip the color of mud and then when you run your hand along it the seam will be a seam and also not an apology.” He brought the tile home with a small jar of that colored slip and a brush as fine as a mosquito’s leg. He worked at his table with a towel under his elbow and mended the crack in strokes that felt like speaking softly. The seam dried dull and honest. He pressed his thumb into it—permission to himself—and felt the way the surface told him a story that was now about a break and a repair and a life that would always include both.

Carter’s composition class turned in consent slips attached to drafts, and he brought them to the coffee shop like trophies that were also little maps. He read one to Seranella that had the earnestness of a child and the precision of a lawyer: I give myself permission to cut the paragraph about my mother’s lasagna because this isn’t an essay about lasagna even though I want to make it one. Another student had written, I give my roommate permission to tell me to stop reading this paragraph aloud. Someone else, in thick pencil, had scrawled, I give the reader permission to put this down if it makes them feel guilty about not calling their grandfather, and the whole paragraph was, in fact, about calling your grandfather, and Carter had cried onto it and the pencil had run. “We’re bad at this,” he said into his cup. “And yet,” she said, lifting her eyebrows at him until he made a face and groaned because she’d made a pun he wished he had stopped her from making.

The Work of the City page did a series called Winter Hands with permission. A knitters’ circle in the library’s back room, fingers leaving steam on mugs, yarn feeding from baskets like a tame animal. A mechanic warming a stubborn bolt with the small blue tongue of a torch while his other hand held the wrench like a promise. A line cook buttering twelve buns at once with a spatula in a rhythm that could be applied to any better life. Each caption began the same way because rules were now a comfort rather than a leash: With permission. Each ended differently because humans are variables with good posture. “I didn’t know people wanted to look at hands,” someone wrote in the comments, and someone else wrote, “It’s easier than looking at faces and just as brave.”

One ice-heavy afternoon, when the sky had decided to be the color of spoons, the lightning-bolt jaw man’s court date was set, and half the town felt the internal tilt that happens when a story moves into a room with benches and a flag. Micheal did not go. He took his mended tile back to the shelter and knelt in snow to butter it into its bed with his cold-stiff fingers and a putty knife, and the sergeant stood nearby pretending to be a man on break so that his presence could be a sandwich and not a sentence. “You got glue on your jeans,” he said, and Micheal said, “It’s a uniform,” and they both laughed a single note. A kid stepped around them, careful, as if they were a sleeping dog. He put his mitten on the word and patted it twice, approval. “I like that one,” the kid said, and ran back to his mother, who called after him, “Watch for cars,” and it all sounded like a language that had been practiced, not perfect, but owned.

Night makes the river sound like something trying a new language. Under ice, it booms not like thunder but like doors elsewhere opening. Micheal stood on the bridge and listened to those reports travel through the metal and into his bones; he imagined the sound was the city learning to say please and thank you without sarcasm. He took the napkin out of his pocket not to pray to it, not to ask it for permission to go on, but to touch the worn places where his thumb had folded it. He wanted, for the first time in a long time, to leave it for someone else, not because he didn’t need it, but because maybe the napkin wanted to be a citizen. He tucked it under the edge of the shelter’s bench, inside the plastic, where only a patient person would find it, and he wrote on it, in his square, careful hand, I am practicing, and he did not sign it because practice is a group sport.

By the time he got home, his bowl had come out of the kiln—glaze pooled in the low places like rain that had decided to stick around, the word LISTEN fired so it would never rub off no matter how many spoons clinked. He held it like a small, declaration-shaped planet and placed it on his table and put nothing in it yet. He liked how it contained air. He liked that a vessel is only itself because of emptiness. He liked that his thumbs had helped make a thing without asking anyone else to give up anything to do it. He sat and watched it while the radiator told its small talk and the building creaked like a boat and the city, enormous and ridiculous and real, rolled over and practiced sleeping on its other side.Chapter 10

Ice did not so much leave as loosen its grip. It slipped off the river in rafts and plates, turned itself into the sound of crockery breaking in a polite kitchen. The geese found swagger again; the ducks argued like couples who love each other too loudly. Sidewalks began to confess their cracks under a film of melt, and the bus shelter’s plastic walls wore the cloudy fingerprints of a season that refused to exit without touching everything. The tiles, newly mended and a little salt-blushed, caught noon in their glazes and gave it back as a lesson about persistence. People shook their shoulders as they walked, as if shrugging off coats they still had to wear for two more weeks but could already picture not needing.

At the university, the email that predicted spring as a budgetary line item arrived with its usual cheery tyranny, and Seranella read it and then let her eyes move to the whiteboard she had refused to erase since autumn. Threads crossed the map where no map could hold them: the bus shelter, the soup kitchen, the ceramics co-op, the library reading room. In the margin she had written a sentence that had turned out to be a task list: make a thing you can touch, make a gathering that is not a meeting, make an invitation that does not cost anyone courage they cannot spare. She walked that sentence across campus to the rec center office, where a woman with a pencil stuck in her hair like a declaration guarded an empty gym with a calendar large enough to be mistaken for faith. They booked a Saturday and called it a fair because fair is a word that makes hands remember they know how to reach.

They put up flyers like seed packets: Consent Fair, it said, but under it in smaller letters that sounded like the city speaking through their mouths it said Ask, Answer, Practice, Eat. The soup kitchen set up a table with tasting spoons and a tip jar that said YES TO ONIONS. The ceramics co-op brought little slabs of clay and letter stamps, single-use aprons rustling like a flock of birds. The Parks Department dropped off sawhorses they hadn’t meant to lend, and someone draped them with quilts because wood that holds up a thing deserves a soft day sometimes. Theo built a bandstand out of borrowed risers and sheet music folded into small boats, and he coaxed three other musicians to join him with the promise of free donuts and a chance to play a seven-eight time signature in front of people who might clap on purpose.

Micheal brought bowls wrapped in towels like asleep animals. LISTEN, said the one he had made the night ice cracked out at the bridge; ASK circled the lip of another like a child’s necklace. He set them on a table that neighbors had built out of old doors and sawhorses, and he put a sign in front of them that said Bowl Library: Take One, Return It When You’ve Used It to Feed Someone. He had practiced writing the words until they didn’t look like a dare. He wore a clean shirt because Maritza had threatened to come up the hill and pull him by the ear if he showed up wearing his onion bandana, and he left his visor at home because he had come to understand that costumes can be accidents too.

People arrived not in a rush but in a drift, the way weather decides to happen. Parents came with small faces and a certain set to the jaw that winter gives, teens came in shoals smelling like gum and resolve, elders came in pairs leaning on one another and on canes that were not medical so much as declarative. On the gym floor, someone put painter’s tape in looping arrows between tables and printed YES and NO and YET at intervals so often that the floor looked like a board game with extraordinary manners. Liam stood at the registration table few needed and wrote tiny nametags in his tidy hand, adding pronouns not with the virtue of a post but with the ease of a habit.

At the translation table, words wore new coats that fit. The sign that had said YOUR YES BELONGS TO YOU now also wore Burmese and Karen and Spanish that sounded like respect and not paperwork. A woman in a headscarf cupped her hand around the word for boundary and told her friend, “This one means fence but not fence like keep out, fence like know where the garden ends so you don’t mow the strawberries,” and her friend nodded with a relief that made her eyes shine. A boy stood in front of the ceramics table and pressed a tiny tile with the word WAIT into his palm as if it had a pulse and then carried it to his grandmother as evidence of a language he could finally hold.

Theo’s band played in the corner where the acoustics were less than terrible, and the Yes/No Suite turned into a dance nobody announced. Children stepped forward during the second movement and held out their hands and then pulled them back in a pantomime of boundaries that made the room grin. During the third movement, a line cook who had come on her break put her head down on the table and cried quietly behind her forearm and then lifted her head and clapped like she’d found a sister. A man in a blazer shot video for twenty seconds and then put his phone down and closed his eyes for the rest, discovering that a lens is not the same as a door.

Dell arrived late with a tray of rice krispie treats that had been cut too big and therefore perfectly. He stared at the tiles as if they might rearrange themselves into a warning without asking him, then he watched his son negotiate with another child over a donut. The boys said no more than they needed to, which is to say they said several no’s and two yeses and then they each took half a donut and smeared icing on their cheeks in mirror-perfect idiocy. Dell stood with his hands in his pockets and nodded at nothing and then at everything. He volunteered at the crossing guard table before anyone could ask him and picked up a stop sign that felt less like a weapon than it had in his head.

The Work of the City page had a corner of its own, printed out on honest paper in a way that made photographs into invitations instead of trophies. With permission sat under every image like a footstool under a chair, letting knees rest. People came to stand and point—to say my cousin is that cobbler, to say I remember that spoon, to say that is Ms. Johnson and look at the way her eyes tell you the bus is going to be okay. Micheal hovered at the edge and then did not hover. Instead, he guided a old man with a cane to a bench by the pictures and sat with him and listened to him tell a story about hands in a factory that had become a storage unit and about a woman named Minnie who could sew a zipper into the back of a coat without taking it off the person, and the story made of Micheal something both younger and older than he was.

In a corner of the gym where fluorescent lights softened into the warmth of bodies, Sloan held a little clinic at a card table that had already seen six bake sales and a fight about field trips. He took consent slips out of a shoebox and handed them to people like recipes. He said, “I am not your therapist unless you already know that I am,” which made three people laugh and one person burst into tears and two people sit down. He taught a half-dozen strangers urge surfing with a plastic toy surfboard and a paper cup of water that sloshed exactly the way a feeling does when you want to look away and shouldn’t. He wrote a sentence on a poster board in block letters and let a child color in the loops of the R and the O: you can always ask again later.

At the end of the fair, the gym floor looked like a story had been told and then swept gently. Bowls had gone out wrapped in towels; tiles had gone into pockets and purses; the band had played a song that felt like a clean kitchen; a boy had fallen asleep on a bench with his mittened hand still resting on the word WAIT. The sergeant with the painted hair had stood at the door for an hour longer than his lunch, introducing people to people they already knew on paper, and then declared aloud that he was taking Sunday off as if saying it made it true. The foundation woman with the beaded sweater slipped a check into a donation jar like someone feeding a tame dragon, and her eyes looked less like beads and more like water.

Two days later, the napkin showed up. Not the one; that one had been tucked under the bench at the shelter a week before and was now in a fourth-grader’s pencil box because she collected scraps of paper with sentences on them and believed they had their own weather. This napkin had its own handwriting, its own lint, its own confession. Someone had pushed it through the mail slot in Seranella’s office door, and it lay on the carpet that had been stained by good intentions and coffee. She picked it up the way you pick up a fallen leaf that you hope won’t crumble, and read, I found your word. I am practicing too. It was signed with a diagram: a little square labeled Heart with an arrow pointing away with the words Out loud now. There was no return address, only a smudge of grease the color of chili and a faint smell of fryer oil that made her smile. She tucked it into the frame behind the photograph of a man who did not like to be captured and decided to consider it proof without being evidence.

Spring’s first real storm came headlong and then apologized for itself in sun. The river spilled but did not insist; the Parks Department handed out sandbags with a briskness that made it feel like lending rather than mourning. Micheal carried the weight the way he had learned to—knees soft, back compliant, jaw loose. He fell into the line easily, the way a new habit welcomes an old strength, and he let the rhythm talk to him. Spike showed up with a spoon the size of sense, and Nan with a crate of oranges, and Ms. Johnson with an ankle that had become weather and a smile that had learned how to ignore pain without lying about it. A kid counted zip ties on the bus shelter as if they were the city’s rosary and reported proudly that they were all still there.

The county’s letter about the tiles went not only nowhere but somewhere useful. Someone filed it and then someone else wrote a memo on top of it saying we are trying this as an experiment in letting people be good. The marketing office, undeterred by being told to stop making teal, used its powers for hospitality and printed small lawn signs for bus stops where there was no plastic to write on: Ask First, Welcome Anyway, all in plain font that made the letters look as if they were trimming their nails. A teenager who had made a TikTok mocking the first set of tiles came by the shelter and filmed a new one, less sneer and more shrug, and said into her phone, “I made fun because I thought people were going to be annoying about it; turns out, they’re just… nicer.” It got fewer views and better comments, and she found that a trade worth making even if none of her friends agreed.

Carter’s students turned in final drafts with permission slips stapled like medals. One wrote, I give my professor permission not to like this, which made Carter’s laugh lift the cat at home off the couch like a small earthquake. Another wrote, I give my father permission to be wrong about my major, and in the back of the room a boy went very still and then very red and then looked straight at his shoes and smiled, because sometimes you have to write your own parent a letter in a classroom so you can take it home and say it by example. Liam presented his final project during a two o’clock slot that would have been empty in any other year, and the room filled with the kind of people who know that two o’clock is when actual magic is most likely to happen because nobody is expecting it.

Sloan bought a new tie at a thrift store that had four tigers hiding in its pattern if you squinted. He wore it to a group he had been resisting starting because groups are difficult to steward without turning into strange churches. He called it Listening Practice, and in the first meeting three men showed up and sat far apart and tried competing at remorse, and he steered them away from that game and into the one where you name the last small yes you gave that nobody noticed. One man said he had told his temper to go outside and it had, two minutes. One said he had let a child cry in aisle six without trying to fix it, and the crying had stopped before someone could become a hero. Micheal said he had put the napkin under the bench and left it there and he had not waited in the bushes to see who picked it up. They laughed in the quiet, a sound that looked like steam leaving a mug.

The lightning-bolt jaw man pleaded to a lesser charge and a court-mandated course with a name as complicated as its goal. People argued about the sentence online with a vigor that could have powered a small boat, and then the thread sank under posts about potholes and prom and a dog who had learned how to ring a bell to go outside and then to ring it just to say hello. The sergeant with the painted hair read the reporting and did not read the comments and took his wife to dinner at a place with tablecloths because sometimes dignity tastes like garlic and a check left with a smile. He stopped by the shelter on the walk home and put his palm on STOP and then on THANKS and then on YET and felt foolish and full as one learns to allow.

The dean, who had asked her to stop saying ogre, sent an email that was not an apology and still managed to be useful. It attached a fellowship application for a project he thought was about tile but was actually about training a town to say aloud what it used to swallow. “You could document this,” he wrote, “and I can pressure the people who decide on funding. They like anything that can be mistaken for art.” She wrote back that she would apply and that she appreciated him confusing scholarship with rescue if it meant he would sign the forms, and he replied with a smiley face he had learned to use because his grandchildren had made not using emojis look like a crime. She sat at her desk and wrote the proposal with the care she reserved for letters to people who didn’t know yet that folklore is a civic utility. She did not write the word ogre. She wrote the words bridge and kitchen and bus.

When the bowls came out of the second firing—a clutch of low, listening dishes with words sunk in like fossils—they held on to their heat longer than you’d expect. Micheal carried them wrapped in newspapers, the ink leaving little punctuation marks on his palms like his hands had been grading papers in a dream. He delivered three to the soup kitchen with a note that said for under the dish rack when the counter gets cruel, one to the librarian who had stood in doors to make them less dangerous, one to Ms. Johnson for her kitchen table, where it held receipts and change and a toy car for a week and then raspberries all at once because she liked the audacity of that color. He kept one on his own table and put nothing in it when he wanted to remember to be hungry on purpose.

On a morning too close to warm to warrant coats but too honest to allow bare arms, a group of second graders arrived at the shelter in a crocodile of fluorescent vests. Their teacher, who had hair like a great story in a bun, handed out little notebooks and said, “Collect words.” The children dutifully copied Yes and No and Ask and Thanks, their tongues out in the way of the intent. The boy with the dinosaur hat, who had become a person who taught younger people the rules of sledding in winter and of puddles in spring, leaned on the bench like a landlord and said to a kindergartener, “YET is the best one because it means you don’t have to lie,” and the kindergartener nodded as if he had been confirmed in a faith. Micheal wiped at the corner of his eye not because his eye needed wiping but because sometimes there is weather there.

Some stories, left alone, would have faded into the sweet, useless smoke of moral. The one about the Thumb Man did not do that. It changed costumes and took on a new instrument. On a neighborhood group, a grandmother told it the way her grandson had returned it to her: there was a man who collected thumbs in pictures because he thought the world would leave him alone less if he made a wall of yeses, and then someone gave him soup and another someone gave him a sign and a third person gave him a napkin with the word YET on it, and now when he walks by your bus stop he holds the ladder and brings glue. Under the post, people argued about whether that version cheated. Someone else wrote, Isn’t that what we’re here for, to teach our stories better tricks. The thread was archived by a moderator who had decided to take weekends off and therefore let the conversation die in a way that felt like rest rather than neglect.

In the evening, when the saxophone had put its head down and the cat had forgiven them for rearranging the furniture of its world one chair at a time, Theo and Seranella stood in their doorway and did the ritual they would not name. “Permission,” she said, and he said, “Granted,” and they both laughed at themselves because love can survive a joke about itself if it also gets bread. She put a hand on the tile that said HELP and felt the corner bite her, a small domestic pain. He took her hand and pressed his thumb to the place and said, “Yet,” softly, and she said, “Yes,” and then said, “Not now,” and both answers were correct. Outside, the river played at being polite, which was its way of being vast, and the bus hissed and knelt and people got on and off and used words they had earned with their feet.
