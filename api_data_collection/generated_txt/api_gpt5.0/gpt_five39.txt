The first tremor of summer dusk slid over the town like a silk ribbon drawn through a ring. It left everything polished with a hushed gleam: the edges of hedges, the backs of benches, the gold of a little boy’s bicycle bell. Somewhere a dog barked. Somewhere a mother’s voice called out I said don’t go too far! Somewhere a stone skipped three, four, five times over the canal and a child whooped as if they’d invented buoyancy on the spot. Then the blue hour came, and it did what it always did, which was loosen the seams of things. If you stared, the playground could ripple, shiver, transform.

Under the overpass where the ivy made a net, something else watched. She had chosen a name from some poster flapping on a lamppost, half torn and whole enough: CATH. It sounded like a hiss cut off at the end. She favored it. She wore it like a chipped crown. She did not know what she had been called before, down in the damp, when words were shapes and shapes were hunger. Troll was a word thrown at her with rocks and she collected all of them. She was a troll, if you needed a word that could carry her weight and the weight of her envy. She counted children by the sound of their shouting—three little ones, two lanky ones, one with a backpack too big for his narrow shoulders. A tally of warm, living bodies with their bright skin and laugh-glow and the awful easy way they touched and were touched.

Cath’s hands, if you caught a glimpse of them, looked purple at the knuckles and dusty at the ridges. Under her nails, a pink crust—made from crushed berries, a brick of chalk stolen from a tub in the school’s art room, a smear of stolen nail lacquer, a pinch of powder from a florist who wondered why his camellias kept turning up pale as ghosts. There were other ingredients you could not pronounce. Her jealousy made a heat in her that cooked color. She kept it in repurposed jars, jam and relish and one with a chipped blue lid. She called it her rain. She kept lids capped at every sound, every scraping foot over the bridge, every slide-squeak, every squeal. When the air finally loosened its hold on light, she unscrewed.

A pair of children made a fort under the slide using three jackets and imagination. A third wanted to be in, was told no, and the no stuck to him like a mosquito that wouldn’t swat away. He sulked. He went to sit by the fence with his back to the hedgerow. Cath could smell the green of him. She could smell the hot plastic of the fence links. She moved—first one foot, then the other, the way a beaver splices trees from water to shore, invisible, impossible, too solid. Anyone looking might have seen a shadow lift and set itself down, a dark net pulling itself along a seam of darker air. She spread three fingers over the jar lid. It came away with a soft pop and a ribbon of sweet.

“Wot’s this then?” the boy asked nobody. He had freckles that had fallen into a perfect constellation across the bridge of his nose, as if someone had been overly careful. A wrong kind of careful. He reached up to pick at the fence rust, and Cath’s breath snagged in her throat the way it always did, on hammering joy she could not keep from happening. She reached.

There was the slick glide of pigment, a daub and then a stroke, and his forearm gleamed wetly, a ridiculous, tender rose. He gasped, startled, and she pulled back hard and left three ovals of finger-print on his wrist: one like the moon at first quarter, one like a quail egg, one like a smudge of gum. He looked left, looked right. The sound of the slide fort collapsed, jackets slipping off in tandem. He stood and waved his arm to the laughter. They ran over, and the boy with the backpack too big said, “Mate, you’re pink.”

“Am not!” said the boy, naked in outrage, until the proof was held up in front of him by three other children reaching and pointing and touching. He was pink. He was, more accurately, kissed by a mistake in the air. Laughter came like a flock of starlings (startling, sure), and the boy’s mouth turned down and then up and then all the way back around until he looked like he’d swallowed an entire moon, the adventurous kind of moon. He stuck his pink arm in his own mouth and tasted raspberries that had never met a thorn.

Cath pulled back. She knocked her hipbone into a pillar and the concrete gave a dull report, which was soft enough that no mother jerked her head up. She pressed a hand over the jar lid. Laughter was the weight she could not lift, and it pressed her down, it pressed her thin. Her own skin she imagined as grey, and then darker than grey, then lighter than grey, always the wrong weight. Their voices were bright. They passed through each other, and through her, like through smoke.

“Oi!” someone yelled from the street. “Kids, time! Home!” The moment broke. The boy wiped his arm on his shorts and the color smeared, and the smear made a banner along his thigh. He ran. All of them ran. Cath waited. She had learned to wait even though her waiting tasted of wire and mud. When the last shoelace had crossed the curb, when only silence and the metal purr of the streetlight were left, she lifted the jar again. Her hunger sat up and smiled at her, which is to say she thought something like a smile. If they would not share their bright skins, then she would make hers the same. Or she’d make theirs different. Or both. She wasn’t sure. She was sure of wanting.

Mara Greenlay drove with the windows down. The river kept a line of cool air across her cheeks, tugging at the hair that had slipped free from her crown. Her phone pulsed on the dash, a little firefly doing a workmanlike job of being a nuisance. She let it blink three times before tapping the screen. “Greenlay.”

“Inspector.” The voice belonged to Sergeant Baines, who always sounded as if he’d been born wearing a tie that was too tight. “You’re going to see this on the incident log in a minute, but it’s got your name on it in my head, so—Church Meadows. Four kids came home painted, uh, pink?”

“Painted,” Mara said. Her mouth curved. “Parents ringing in with pitchforks?”

“Not yet, but the posts are posting. One gran said she’s never seen anything like it since—since never. The feed’s got pictures already.”

Mara signaled and turned off the road into a seam of oaks. “I’ll take a look.” She hesitated, then: “Thanks for the heads-up, Cliff.”

“That tone worries me.”

“What tone?”

“The tone that says you’re smiling.”

“Not smiling,” she lied, and hung up. Not because she liked kids painted pink. Because she liked the way a town made up a story in the first fifteen minutes and then had to live with it afterward, the way their fear ran around stamping on everything that might be true. She’d been born in Ajax, a town of straight streets and milky lawns and hockey parents who shouted love in three rough syllables: ’Attagirl! She had left, and she had come to this place with its bendy roads and its canals slick as fish, and given money where she had it to give and time where she had it to spend. The philanthropic press had made her into an anecdote she could no longer tell about herself. They liked to say she saw people. It was not that. She saw the seams of things. She saw where they didn’t quite match, where the fabric bulged, where the stitching puckered and wanted a little unpicking.

Church Meadows was a rectangle of green rolled flat and trimmed close with a line of ash trees for decorum. There were benches with memorial plaques and a slide that looked slippy even when it was dry. A mother with a stroller pushed by like she was on a treadmill and said, without saying hello, “They should put up cameras. I’ve said since last year.” It sounded like a prayer that had learned how to be an accusation.

Mara waved at the mother’s back and ducked under a chain-link fence already half unhooked. The slide tower wore a stripe of pink that clung to it like fog. She touched it with her knuckle, inhaled, and recognized sugar and the hit of cut flowers stabbed with a metallic afterscent. She called to mind the map of the area: schoolyard over the fence, canal drop at the far corner, the overpass shouldering in like a hard conversation. She walked toward the overpass and the shadows thickened and the air went a degree cooler. There was a smell of river and of iron.

“You’ll want to watch there,” said a voice behind her, as if they’d been walking together a long time and she’d simply got ahead. The lady who spoke had a neat mouth and a pair of shoes that had done their county service and then some. “The footprints. I saw them. I’m Mrs. Hargreaves. I do the nativities at St. Mick’s. Feet—big.”

Mara crouched, and the woman crouched too, making a little sound in her hip. There were prints, yes: size nine, ten, perhaps. Bare. A flattened pancake of heel and a splay of toes that didn’t run straight, more like a hand trying to be a foot. The mud had kept her a drawing, but only a hint. “How big are your grandsons’ feet, Mrs. Hargreaves?” Mara asked lightly.

“Not that big,” the woman said crisply, and then, as if something had slipped out of a cupboard inside her, added, “Troll, isn’t it. Don’t laugh. We used to say there was one there when I was a girl. Cath. Cathy. No. Cath.”

Mara stood and found the woman’s eyes. “Is that what you called her?”

“Who?”

“The girl who scared you when you were young.”

Mrs. Hargreaves blinked. A drop of memory rotated over its axis, gathering its own gravity. She shook her head the way a swimmer shakes off a surface. “Just. Keep an eye.” Her finger tapped the air near the pillar. “Children get marked and then what.”

“Then what,” Mara repeated. She took a picture of the print, knelt again, and pressed her palm over the shallow. Her hand was smaller. The ridge of mud pushed and gave. She stood, paced under the overpass, and listened. It shushed like a library stacked with invisible books, a place where you could learn your own crimes if you could read them.

There was almost no one at the station when she returned; that was one of the illusions of summer, that work could be done in daylight and nights were free for living. Baines lifted his chin at her as if to say don’t ask. The whiteboard in the conference room had a list and the list was, at the moment, a child's birthday party crashed by weather. She pinned up the pictures, the slide with its slick and the stripe as if someone had washed laughter down it and left a residue. PC Noor Hamid came in with a tea and put it in front of Mara without looking up from her notebook. “I think I’ve got six duplicate posts and twelve unique ones.”

“Anything useful?” Mara asked.

“The usual geometry of panic. Some call it a prank. Some say it’s biological warfare. One guy with ten followers says it’s the government.” Noor flipped a page. “But there was this. An account with two photos, both of cats—actual cats—posted a detail. Says there’s a lady under the bridge. Hangs there at twilight. Wears a coat in July.”

“A coat,” Mara said. “We should arrest her on sight.”

“Right, for offenses against weather.” Noor grinned, then sobered. “He calls her Cath. Says she watches the kids and paints them pink.”

“That’s specific,” Mara said. Their eyes met, and a corner of the room fluttered as if a moth had blundered in and needed coaxing out with a cup.

Baines, who did not believe in moths unless they were tax-paying residents, grunted. “We get someone down there tonight. We get a walk-through from the school. Find out if there’s missing paint, weird chalk, the art teacher’s got glitter in his hair for a reason. And,” he added reluctantly, “talk to whoever remembers fairy tales.”

Mara took her tea to the window. The town lay out like someone’s childhood drawing, rectangles for houses and triangles for roofs, roads sketched with a too-heavy hand. Ajax had been like that. When she was a teenager she’d biked in straight lines, the horizon pulling and bland as milk. Her mother had said, you’re going far and she had. And then she’d circle back, pockets full. She had money, yes. She had used it, yes. A shelter that needed new mattresses. Sports stuff for kids whose parents could not manage new. She couldn’t stop thinking of the boy’s arm, that streak, him tasting it, his face laplit from inside by something he wasn’t prepared to explain to anyone, not even himself.

At five past eight she put on her jacket, the one with the dull elbows, and Noor grabbed her car keys without asking. They sat in the car a minute longer than they had to, neither of them feeling like remarking on the laughter still echoing somewhere you could not realistically call a memory. Mara let the seatbelt sit loose and pushed up her sleeves. “Under the overpass first. Then we talk to the florist and see if someone’s been stripping his camellias for pigment. Then we knock on every art room door in three schools.”

“Do you think it’s a kid?” Noor asked.

“I think it’s someone who remembers being one and can’t decide what to do about it.”

Noor’s face changed, a recognition as simple as opening a door. “So, not cruel?”

“Cruelty is sloppy, Noor. This is—attention. Precision. They could have poured a bucket. They didn’t.”

Cars hissed past them like snakes on errands. The light under the overpass flickered like a note sung wrong. They parked and walked in as if the place were politely kept and they were expected. They were. The dark held its breath. A pigeon shifted in the rafters. Noor pointed with her chin: a glitter on concrete, a smear not there before. “She’s been here.”

“She,” Mara said, and the word phoned something inside her. A name. Cath. A girl and not a girl. A troll is a metaphor until it is not.

There was a soft sound ahead, not unlike a paintbrush whisked over rough paper. Mara lifted her hand in a sign to stop. Noor stopped. Their breaths separated from their bodies and floated a foot ahead, curious. “Who’s there?” Mara called, and the echo came back with a cough. “Police. Come out, we just want to talk.”

She knew when she said it that it was half true. She wanted to see and to see was to change things. She couldn’t help it. When she was eight, in Ajax, she had watched a boy named Jace take a ball to the jaw and go down like a straight shot of timber; she had run to him and put her hands on his shoulders and she had felt the blood slick his neck and she had felt something inside herself say now you know, and she had wanted to un-know. She couldn’t un-anything. That was what growing into herself finally taught her: love makes a mess of evidence and then tries to catalog it anyway.

A figure slid out of shadow and then did not. It hung there in the uncertain, and then it blinked, which is to say Mara blinked and something that had been there wasn’t and something that hadn’t was: a blotched coat with buttons like lost teeth, hair in a net of itself, hands like something burnt and cooled. The voice, when it came, had a scrape of gravel and something unexpectedly mild. “Talk, then.”

“Have you been marking children,” Noor blurted, bless her, “with pink?”

There was a pause. It lasted exactly the length of time it takes to recover from surprise at not having been lied to first. “Yes,” the figure said. “No. Yes.” The mouth worked around the word as if it tasted of metal. “They are already marked. Everyone marks them. I am—correcting. No. Not correcting. Copying?” A soft, hopeless laugh. “I don’t know the word.”

“Do you have a name?” Mara asked.

“Do you?” the figure snapped, the sharp edge rising and falling like a fish in a shallow.

“Mara Greenlay. Detective Inspector. This is PC Hamid.”

“Green-lay,” Cath said carefully, as if the name came with instructions and she intended to follow them. The voice softened. The softening was dangerous; it made Nora’s hand edge toward Mara’s sleeve. “I am Cath. That is what they call me. That is not what I am called. I don’t know what I am called.”

“Then you can try this one on,” Mara said evenly. “And take it off if it doesn’t fit.”

Cath made the slightest movement, like a shrug delivered to only one shoulder. “You will arrest me.”

“Not if you come for a talk. Not if you stop painting children without their permission.”

“Permission,” Cath repeated, and tasted the word as if it might be edible. “They laugh. They hated me for—” Her hand twitched and she tucked it into her sleeve by reflex, as if she’d said more than she wanted to and needed to hide the place the words had come from. “They laughed. I did not hate that.”

Noor said very gently, “But their parents were worried. That can hurt them.”

“Parents. Yes.” Cath stepped sideways. It made the shadows jitter, as if the place itself had jumped at a sudden memory. “I do not like the way parents call them. Like calling dogs. Sit. Stay. Come. Why would you paint a child the color of a chair. I paint them as something else.”

Mara didn’t move. Everything that moved now would have to move from love. She did not know how to do that neatly. “Cath,” she said, “if you come with us, we can make sure no one thinks you’re a monster.”

A soft, oblique smile. “Monster is a word for when it’s too late.” Cath’s head tipped. She listened. Mara realized, after a second, that she too was listening. There was nothing. That was the trouble. The nothing you heard here was thick. It made the next sound sharper. It arrived: a siren far off, not theirs. Somebody else’s trouble, not this one. You could draw comfort from that, but only for a minute. Cath stepped back. “You will put me in a place. You will say you are looking. You will look at me until I am a thing you can keep.”

“I won’t,” Mara said, because she had to try the truth on to see if it stuck. “I will look at you like a person.”

Cath made a sound that was either a laugh or its older, sadder cousin. “I am jealous of children,” she said baldly, almost proud. “They do not know what they have. The skin. The sound. The ease.” She had the jar in her hand now, or had she always; it caught the weak light and held it up like a cheap diamond. “I see them. I watch. I make them mine for a moment. It is wrong. It is art. I am not sure which.” Her chin lifted. “I will stop if you tell me a thing to do instead that makes the ache quiet. You cannot.”

Mara took one step. Noor hissed, barely a breath. Cath’s neck tautened. The jar tilted.

“Stop,” Noor said quickly. “Please.”

Cath stopped, not because the policeman told her to, Mara thought, but because the word pleased her mouth. St. Mick’s bells started up the quarter hour and sounded like someone dropping silver spoons onto a cushion. It broke the thread. Cath turned without commitment, and moved, and then was gone, melting backward into the shadow’s careful, well-practiced mouth. The pigeons above lifted one wing, then the other, resettled in their stink.

Noor hissed through her teeth. “What the hell.”

“That was a conversation,” Mara said, too calm, already making the story of it in her head because if she didn’t it would make itself without her. “We’ll do a second one. In daylight.”

“You think she’s mythical,” Noor said. “But she was just—she was a woman who had stuff. On her hands.”

“She was a woman who had jealousy boiling under her skin like sap, and she does not know where to pour it out. The world will always give you the wrong places.” Mara felt suddenly tired, and then, because she could, sat down on the curb like a teenager. “We’ll talk to the florist. We’ll talk to the art rooms. We’ll talk to a person who knows old stories. We’ll tell parents to keep their windows latched and their children less interesting in public. And then—”

“And then you’ll stop her,” Noor said.

“Yes,” Mara said simply. “I know I have to.”

She meant: because once you’ve stepped into a story you owe it an ending that sets things right. She meant: because a child had tasted his own arm and smiled and that made her want to protect that smile and its right to not have been interrupted. She meant: because the charity work wasn’t charity but a way of buying a little peace, and peace was a currency with a capricious exchange rate.

They went, because you can’t stay under a bridge all night and keep the dignity of your jawline. In the morning, the florist told them about a woman who had asked for camellia petals and been told no and had smiled very sweetly and gone out the back and made off with a handful from the bin anyway. He’d gotten the impression she wanted color the way some people wanted rain. He described her as wearing a long coat in July. The art teacher at the primary had noticed that his chalk was clumping and put it down to humidity. He had glitter in his hair. He had not noticed anyone. The music teacher said her class had sung two songs out of tune and she was sure it was a sign.

Posters went up. “Do you know this woman?” accompanied by a blur that looked like the idea of a person in a coat. The town did what it always did: it decided to take sides. One side claimed prank, the other side claimed danger. Someone bought a can of pink paint and dumped it on the war memorial, and a group of elderly men with square faces like old argument stone was incensed for the first time since someone had suggested changing the pub’s name. A lady called the radio and said a troll had painted her husband’s garden gnome. The radio laughed. Mara wrote notes she didn’t share. She wrote: she said permission. She wrote: jealousy. She wrote: children are not museums. She wrote: children are museums.

She went home to an apartment that faced the canal. It was not large, but it had a generous inclination to harbor more light than it had room for. In Ajax she had had a bigger place and fewer ghosts. Here she had plants she hadn’t killed and a small sofa with room for two people if one of them wasn’t nervous about knees touching. On her table, under a glass dish, a series of ribbons in different textures and shades, prizes gate committees had given her because she’d given them things. The last one was an award like a flat sun. Brave, they’d called her that time, because she’d stepped between a boy and a man. It had felt wrong like a coat in July. She didn’t want a word you couldn’t carry every day.

She slept badly and rose as if waking had been a decision she had to remember to make.

In the week that followed, children were marked again. Nothing worse than pink, always that tender, silly pink. Sometimes whole arms. Sometimes knees. Sometimes a streak like a sash across the torso. Always when they turned their faces toward something outside, at a window, at a hole in the fence, at a slat in a gate. Cath didn’t take, she added. That was her defense, and it was a weak one, and yet the town had had worse. Parents kept their small ones close and watched with suspicion any place where the shadows could stack. The rumor mill ground and spat out stones with teeth in them. A man named Harlan who had seen every season of everything posted: I saw her face in my neighbor’s birdbath. People called him names. He liked that, a little too much.

Mara met with the head of St. Mick’s and with Baines in a room that smelled like dust having an opinion. “This is either someone who needs help,” the vicar said, “or someone who thinks they need help. The difference is smaller than you imagine and harder to make out at speed.”

“Make a statement?” Baines asked.

The vicar held up a gentle hand. “No one listens to the Church until it sings the tune they’ve already got in them.”

Mara, who thought that was truer than she wanted it to be, laid out the photos. Here, a handprint on a shoulder blade that made the child’s back look like a canvas with a soft sunset whirled onto it. Here, a streak over a forehead, calling to mind warriors and children playing at them. “She’s patterning,” Mara said quietly. “She’s working out something. It’s how it is with compulsion. It teaches its own classes. What happens when she tires of pink. What happens when she decides to test boundaries. This is a time for catching.”

Baines looked at her, not unkindly. “It sounds personal.”

“It isn’t,” Mara said, which was the lie you tell when it is, because you need someone to step toward you without thinking you might drag them into your own thicket.

That night they tried again; a stakeout under the bridge with two officers in plain clothes and one community volunteer who insisted on coming because she was the kind of person who insisted on everything. Hours went by, which is how hours do. They breathed them. A fox came and went with its tail held like it knew people were watching and wanted to give them a piece of theater. A pigeon fell asleep and nearly fell and caught itself with a wingflap and looked around to see if anyone had noticed, which is how pigeons do. The volunteer told a long story about the birth of her third granddaughter, which terrified Noor and interested Mara, and which they remembered in detail for no good reason. When Cath came, she came soft as rain. Noor almost didn’t see. She had the jar in her hand and she held it up in the curve of her elbow like a baby.

Mara stood without standing all the way. “Cath.”

The figure froze. The volunteer drew in breath and let it out. It sounded like pulling a wish through a straw.

“I told you you would look,” Cath said ruefully. “And you do.” She tilted up her face. “Has it changed me?”

“No,” Mara said. “Not yet.”

“Leave her,” the volunteer muttered, and Cath heard and flinched as if struck.

“Please don’t talk about me as if I am not.”

“Come with us,” Mara said, and stepped into the circle she had drawn with her notions and her compassion and her work. “We can find a way to make the ache smaller.”

“You will ask me to repair it by helping others,” Cath said with weary accuracy. “That is what you do. You will tell me philanthropy is a ladder up. I will hand coins to things and call it healing, and it will not be, and I will miss the jars. I am not human in the way you think I can become. I am not a kindness waiting to be trained.”

“You’re a person,” Mara said. “And I am a person. And I know—”

“You are a philanthropist from Ajax,” Cath said with sudden speed, a little triumphant. “They said. I heard. You give. You take the story and break it over your knee and make it straight. Do not,” she said kindly, impossibly kindly, “find me a ribbon to pin on my good deeds. I want color. I want to put it where I want it. The way it feels when they see themselves bright. It is wrong.”

Mara’s throat worked. The silence’s weight shifted. Somewhere over town, fireworks popped, early practice for some festival unapproved and unplanned. The pink on the slide had long since been scrubbed, but Mara saw it, a ghost of a smear, as if things left outlines of themselves for a while after they were gone. “You’ll stop,” she said, softer than she sometimes allowed herself. “Or I’ll have to make you.”

“Make me,” Cath repeated, and shook her head. “You are small,” she said, and said it without malice. “We are both so small.” And then she bowed, like a queen in a ruined opera, and turned, and was gone, and this time she left no trace save for a petal on the concrete that looked like a tongue. Noor swore under her breath, but it sounded like a prayer that had been taught to tap dance.

Mara went home and took off her shoes and stood in the kitchen and did not turn on the light. She poured a glass of water and didn’t drink it. At her window the canal did its whole job of pretending to be a mirror. She saw herself there. She saw a smear of pink that probably wasn’t there, except now it was all she could see. She thought of the bravery award, the ribbon with a cheap sun, and felt a flash of embarrassment for something she had not yet earned and perhaps never would. She set the glass down and it made a map-shaped water stain that would dry and be gone. The phone blinked. She did not look.

In the morning there was a note slid under her door: old-paper thin and smelling faintly of musk. It was not signed. It read: Don’t look at her with pity. She will eat it like a cake. It will not feed her. Try sorrow. It is heavier.

She folded the note and put it in her pocket without making a story out of it yet.

By noon a child named Poppy came into the station with her father. Poppy had a stripe of pink over one eye like someone had tried out a thought on her. She waved at Noor and Noor left off her desk and crouched down and said, “Hello.” Poppy said, “She giggles,” and Noor said, “Who?” and Poppy said, as if it were obvious, “The lady under the bridge.” The father pinched the bridge of his nose. He had slept a total of two hours and his face didn’t fit him yet.

Mara came out of her office and kneeled too and said, “Does she,” and Poppy nodded and said, “She’s jealous.” Mara nodded. Poppy added, bright and terrible, “Me too. I’m jealous when my baby brother gets toast and I don’t.” The father closed his eyes.

“Does she say a name?” Mara asked softly.

Poppy looked at the ceiling as if the answer was written there in picture books language. “Cath,” she intoned, and then began to hum, tunelessly, the way children will when something in them has lately been moved. Mara hummed too. It sounded like two machines coming from different factories trying to talk.

When they left the station, the day was one of those days that makes you ache at the idea of anyone being indoors. Mara took the long way around to the overpass and stood so still the pigeons forgot her and resumed their dumb society. She could feel the town’s attention like a weather system. It wanted a monster. It wanted a neat. It wanted her to be a hero next month so it could set itself a parade route. She watched the shadow under the bridge. She said into the air, as if it could keep confidences: I know I have to stop her. She did not say how.

Under the overpass, something that was once a name and was now a habit sat and thought about children’s hands. She thought of bright new pink on dark blue jeans and the laugh that came not because someone was in on the joke but because the joke had licked their shin and made a note there you could hum. She wanted that for herself like a thirst. She pressed her thumb into the lid of a jar and thought of a girl named Cath who had cornered her in a hedge once and said you don’t look right and she had tried to put her mouth together in the shape of right and failed. She was fueled by jealousy. But jealousy, she was beginning to think, was a kind of coal that burned too fast. It wasn’t enough to run on forever. She heard her name in the distance and didn’t run because there was nowhere to run that wasn’t through somebody else’s heart.

That evening, when the sunset looked like a mess on purpose, thrilled with its own chaos, Mara stood at the community hall for a fundraiser she had stupidly agreed to attend because she thought saying no would look like an admission that she was not a saint. She shook hands. She smiled. She made jokes about having a cardboard cutout attend next time. Someone handed her an envelope with a donation and she felt the weight of it and wanted to hand it straight to a child with a stripe of pink across their face and say, Here, buy paint, buy anything, buy better shadows. She made a speech. It involved resilience and the word community repeated until it had the density of an apple. She looked at the back of the hall and saw a figure in a coat. The figure stood like someone who had misunderstood how rooms worked. She stepped off the small stage, leaving the microphone to hum for a second, and walked toward the back. The figure was gone when she arrived, because that is how figures at the back of rooms behave.

On the way home a siren bled into her lane and back out, a cut she didn’t notice until it stung. She parked. She paused with her forehead on the steering wheel. Then she sat up, put the car in reverse, and turned toward the bridge. There are places in towns like these where the light always seems borrowed. The overpass was one. Under it, the air again was cooler by a degree, a single degree, which is the distance between almost and too late. She stood with her hands in her pockets and tried sorrow on. It didn’t fit. She felt pity prickle, and refused it the way you refuse a second biscuit when you’re supposed to be good. She said: “Cath.”

“You will keep coming,” Cath said, from the dark.

“Yes.”

“And I will make it harder and easier, in ways I cannot tell you yet,” Cath said.

“Yes,” Mara said. “And then I will take you somewhere you can sit and tell someone the story of yourself until it is a story you can keep and live with.”

“That is a kind prison,” Cath said, not mocking. “Greenlay.”

“Cath.”

They were quiet a long time. The pigeons grew used to it. The town shifted, restless.

And because every beginning wants a promise, though it be quiet, though it be crooked, though it wear a coat in July, Mara said at last, “I’ll stop you.”

“Of course,” Cath replied, with a sweetness that could almost be mistaken for relief. She turned away, and the place where she had stood continued to be a little cooler, for a while, as if the air remembered her better than she’d intended. The bats brought their dark scissors and cut the sky into frenzy. The sound of a child laughing from a house at the corner took the shape of a bell.

The weeks tightened their belts. The color inventories at shops had small gaps in the pinks. The chalk at three schools went dusty overnight, then damp. The frames of windows in two streets got wiped down by unseen hands. Mothers gossiped louder; fathers learned how to carry their children on their shoulders again. Rumor did its sturdy work. The police drew circles on maps and then smaller circles inside those circles like someone learning to draw faces.

Mara held two truths like two ends of a rope and let them burn her palms. One: Cath was not trying to harm, not as harm was typically measured. Two: the town was being harmed anyway, because fear tilts the floors and makes us all stumble, and Cath’s self-invented art had rearranged the furniture of other people’s rooms. That was enough. That was too much. That was the line.

She walked to the bridge a final time that month and set her hands on the cool rail and said, not asking anyone’s permission, not expecting an answer: “I know I have to stop her.” Above the rail, dusk arrived late and flustered, as if it had misplaced its keys and had to climb the drainpipe. The world tilted slightly and then righted. She stood until the mosquitoes came out and decided she wasn’t worth the trouble. Then she went home and slept as if sleep had a job to do.

Under the bridge, the jars waited, lids on. A name waited, lid off. A troll sat with her back to a pillar and learned a new word by heart: bravery. She rolled it around until it made her laugh. It sounded, in her voice, like rain.The heat arrived with a politeness it did not mean, gloving the streets and hedges in a layer of compliance that had nothing to do with anyone’s wishes. Lawns went from glib to brittle, and the ash trees around Church Meadows made a sound in the wind like paper promising to be careful. Shop windows took on the habit of reflecting more than they showed, so that when you peered in you saw your own face wearing whatever was for sale behind it. Children learned the geography of shadow as a game, mapping the short strips that pooled between swings and benches and the long run of cool under the overpass that felt like a secret too easy to have found. The pink thinned and then returned as if it had been at the chemist’s for a top-up, a precise band on a shin here, a round stamp on a shoulder there, never more than the town could stand, always just enough to make a parent’s voice pitch higher.

Mara took to walking the lanes with her hands in her pockets as if her knuckles needed shelter. The note lived in her jacket and quietly altered the temperature of everything else she carried; it made her think of a glass marble kept in the hand too long, its heat indistinguishable from her own and yet foreign, a heat with an agenda. Try sorrow, it had said, and she tried, with a conscientiousness she had formerly reserved for the serious business of being alive when other people required it. Pity was easy; it puffed and fussed and puffed again, a self-feeding stove of a feeling. Sorrow lay heavier and refused to move unless you set your shoulders to it, the way you have to shoulder open a door swollen with rain. She remembered Jace of Ajax and the way the blood had looked so matter-of-fact on his neck, as if it were where it belonged until somebody told it otherwise. She held that in her mouth like candy, resisting the urge to bite down and finish it.

Noor found her on a bench outside the station with the day sunk in around her like a muffler. They had developed a shorthand of the eyes, and Noor used it now to say, I have an idea I don’t trust and can’t help wanting to try. “What if we give her a canvas,” Noor said aloud anyway, because sometimes speech pins things to the board so they don’t flap off in the next draft of wind. “Not a wall with a heritage grant and three committees attached, not an alley we can call urban renewal and feel smug about, but an actual canvas with a frame and string. What if we write permission across it and leave it where she is. See whether the word draws her like a hive hum.”

“There’s a confidence to bait in letting someone else see your plan and not flinch,” Mara said, and felt the edge of a smile look at her and consider approaching. “Baines will have heartburn. The town will say we’re enabling. The town is already saying we’re useless in seven precise shades. But the word matters to her. She said it like a foreigner tasting local bread.”

“We could also be there,” Noor added, not gently, because gentleness had not gotten them very far. “Not to spring, but to be sprung upon. Let her paint something that isn’t a child and isn’t obliged to take it to bed and field questions from a brother about why his skin got left out. Let her try making a mark that stays because it was asked for.”

“Bribe the ache with a job,” Mara said. She thought about the jars under the bridge, lids on like patience. She thought about the note and its strange intimacy. “All right. We do it clean. A proper canvas. Good linen. We write permission with the nicest hand anyone in this town has, which is probably Mrs. Hargreaves’ whether she deserves the honor or not. We put it where Cath can see it and we let the shadows see us not hiding. We take the heat if it backfires.”

Down in the cool where the ivy net hung like someone’s careless knitting, Cath mixed. The ingredients had changed not because she’d decided but because the town had, and she was a creature who couldn’t help fetching what a place offered when it did so in a mood. Pink berries were a memory in the hedges now, scrumped by children with sticky lips, and the chalk tubs were guarded as if they contained heirlooms instead of dust and color, and the florist had taken to keeping his camellias with the roses as if good company could learn itself into defense. She found other things. She found a piece of a siren’s throat left on the air and rolled it into violet until it made her cough. She pulled a coin from the canal and took what had washed off it, all that wished-for multiplying as blue so clear it forgot to be sad. She climbed up the embankment to the railings and scraped two knuckles on rust and tasted iron and made a thin red that looked like a line too fine to step over. She tried, in a single hour when the air itself was soft with exhausted heat, to paint a stripe on her own forearm. It beaded. It slid. It refused her as if skin knew the difference between hunger for and hunger from. She put the lid on the jar and said the word permission in her mouth because she liked the way the m’s made it go quiet in the middle and the way ending it felt like finding a step you hadn’t expected but wanted to use.

The canvas appeared because Noor believed in suddenness and Mara believed in the theater of the honest trap. Mrs. Hargreaves printed the word in a chapel hand and then apologized reflexively to no one. A length of string went around the pillar as if hugging it. The canvas, white enough to be impudent under the bridge’s respect for gloom, had a heartbeat in it because everyone who touched it left a little unwashed residue, and the wood learned those meant well. Baines stood and scowled until he got tired and went to fetch a bag of chips. A father watched from the verge with his arms folded so high and tight his shoulder blades complained to one another in bonespeak; he had the set jaw of a man who had seen something get into his house that he could not swat and who wanted his hand back from the air it had gone through.

Cath saw the word before she saw the canvas and stood a few yards off tasting each letter again as if to confirm that the p would be a door and not a trick. “It is a joke,” she said, and the apology hung under it like a tail. Mara stepped forward exactly one pace because any closer would be arrogance and any further back would be cowardice, and she was trying on a third thing that did not have a neat name yet and might never. “No,” she said. “It is a thing being offered. A test. Not the kind where you hope someone fails.”

“You want to catch me like a fish,” Cath said angrily, and the anger felt good on her teeth until it didn’t and then it sat there, hot and dumb, a lump she couldn’t swallow. “You want to make me ordinary with papers. You want to write me down and make the writing a fence.”

“I want to keep children from getting marked without being asked,” Mara said, and did not add the rest, which was I want to keep you from becoming a story the town can throw at other people. Noor lifted the canvas a fraction so that the string hummed and said, “You can paint this. We want you to. You can make something we can look at without being afraid of who it will be attached to. We won’t stop you. We’ll stand and look and be people who can be changed by looking without anyone being turned into a cautionary tale against their will.”

Cath made a face, which looked, in the low light, like someone had tried to wring her and only got a quarter-turn. “Paint for who,” she said, and Mara took a breath and said it with her mouth still, the way you do when the answer matters more than how you look saying it. “Paint for yourself,” she said. “And I’ll stand still for you, and if you need a living body in the room to believe your work is happening, you can mark me instead of a child. I am asking. I am giving you permission. I am offering a different kind of thread.”

Noor’s head moved in the corner of Mara’s eye, a quick jerk of what Are you doing married to Please let this work. The father on the verge made a sound that could have been a swallow or a swallow’s cry. Cath stepped so the coat whispered around her calves like a curtain in an old playhouse, and she came close enough that Mara could see the way the skin at her wrists didn’t fit quite right, as if the pattern had been cut for someone else and then let out or taken in and the seam allowance had given up protesting. “You are brave,” Cath said, considering the word as if it were a beetle with too many legs. “You hold your face like a person who has learned to make it into something that does not frighten other people. You are frightened and you hold it like a sparrow that might peck you for your trouble.”

“I am both,” Mara said, and showed her forearm, turning it in the half light like an object examined in a shop you can’t afford, looking for the flaw you can use as a reason to leave it be. “It doesn’t make me good. It makes me useful to you for one small thing.”

The jar she chose was not the pink. Cath lifted the one that had learned the siren, and its violet crept up to the rim and looked out as if sniffing the evening. Noor made a sound small enough not to count as an objection and big enough to count as devotion. The brush—where had Cath gotten a brush, and was it a brush or just a tuft of ivy shaped into a tool by the hand that held it—touched Mara’s skin. The cold came first and then the sting and then, unexpectedly, a sweetness like being given a second mouth to breathe with. The color drew a line from wrist toward elbow that wasn’t straight and wasn’t crooked, something in between that could be called honest if you were willing to spend the word.

The father stepped off the curb with violence like a second pair of shoes. He took two strides and Noor put a palm on his chest in a movement that didn’t read to him as a woman stopping him but as a wall, which was better. “No,” Noor said quietly. “Not this way.” He looked at her and saw not Noor, a person with a mother and the habit of boiling noodles too long, but a uniform without the uniform on, and he decided he would not push a wall in public if he could help it. He tensed his mouth in a compliance-shaped grimace and walked himself back to the curb as if returning something stolen to a shelf.

Cath’s line stopped at the bend of the elbow and she took away the brush as if remembering herself. “You are marked,” she said anxiously, as if the fact had occurred to her after it was too late, like pulling a pie from the oven and recognizing only when the heat rose that you had made an error in measurement. “It does not come off,” she lied out of fear, and then told the truth because some muscle in her had learned the difference this last week and the twitch of it hurt her. “It will blur. It will not leave you quite whole the way you were.”

Mara looked down and felt it, not as a stripe but as a pressure under the skin, a new road for her pulse to consider taking. “Good,” she said, which was not noble but was accurate. “I don’t trust wholeness anyway. It asks too much and gives too little.” She let a beat pass and felt the sound of it under the bridge like a stone dropping into a slow river. “Now you stop with the children. If you want to put color on something that breathes and makes a sound, you take me and however many other adults decide to walk up to your canvas and ask for their turn. You leave the playground alone.”

“Adults are dull,” Cath said, but it came out without heat, an ancient lament uttered as if she suspected it might not hold up in daylight. “Their skins have already decided all their arguments. Their windows are shut. They pretend the air in there is their very own. Children carry the air around like their coats.”

“They also sleep and wake without inventorying their terror,” Mara said, and caught Noor’s quick look of approval with the corner of her vision. “They get to have a morning without knowing what we are all frightened of this month. They get to keep their ease until they lose it the regular way and not because a woman under a bridge wanted to see a new expression.” She inhaled and felt the violet move like a thought. “Say yes.”

Cath’s mouth made and unmade shapes as if practicing lines for a play she’d been told she had the wrong posture for. “I will try,” she said at last, and tried to make it sound like a promise and it didn’t, quite. “I am jealous,” she added, with the stubbornness of a lesson too well learned. “Jealousy makes my hands move. When I do not move them, the ache turns to teeth.”

“Then we dull the teeth with another task,” Noor said briskly, and if Cath turned her head then to look at Noor properly it was not only because Mara’s forearm was giving off a light like a moth’s idea of a lantern. “There is a wall by the old foundry that belongs to nobody and everybody and is currently the color of long sighs. Paint it. We will write the word you like on it first, because we are learning, and we will stand far enough away that you can pretend we are the rumor you prefer to be listening to.”

The town did not like it when they stood with a canvas under a bridge and made a show of being kind because kindness, when it is not your idea and does not line up with your fear, can feel like a trickster god. Facebook said three different things and then said them again with the words shuffled. Mrs. Hargreaves printed a second permission in a hand that looked more forgiving. Baines gave interviews that managed to suggest both calm and disapproval, a feat that would have earned him a sash at a different sort of parade. Parents formed a chat and then two, because even anger splits sometimes, and one chat wanted batons and one wanted counseling and both wanted someone to call a name and have that name deliver the problem to their feet tied up like a parcel.

Cath took the wall at the foundry the way a storm takes a fence, with a decisiveness that suggests love. The first night she made only lines, not letting her hand choose shapes until it had gotten used to being asked differently. The second night the lines found a face and then changed their minds and one of the eyes became a coin and the mouth became a street. The third night she made a gesture of a child with their head thrown back, not made from any child in the town but from the idea of throats that remember how to let sound out clean. The colors did not stick to concrete the way they stuck to skin; they needed coaxing and the stubbornness that comes from refusing to pack up after the first failure. Noor stood talking softly to the air as if coaching it to behave. Mara stood further off, nearer the corner where the canal smelled like a penny jar in a school office, and let sorrow rest in her chest like a compress; it eased nothing and it helped anyway.

The trouble with giving people a place to look is that sometimes they bring their sharpest eyes. A man named Rafe who owned a van and a loud series of opinions brought his body to the foundry on the fourth night and tried to bring three others with him; two came, one stayed home and texted his girlfriend that it was boring. They had planned to shout and then they planned to catch, because they thought catching a woman would be simple, and because they had never actually caught anything that did not want to be caught. Cath felt them coming because jealousy has ears, and because the ivy tugged in a breeze that did not exist and told her like birds do without anyone writing it down. Mara moved before Noor’s hand touched her sleeve, which was wise and unwise in equal measures. She stood between Rafe and the wall and said, “No,” in a tone that reminded everyone in the yard that there was a difference between a small woman and a small problem.

The argument that followed had the usual shapes; words like menace and community and vigilante did their rehearsed walks and bowed at the edge of the stage. Then a bottle slipped and burst, not thrown, just stupid with gravity, and the sound frightened a child who wasn’t supposed to be there because her mother had said expressly not to go far. Poppy, because of course it was Poppy, shot like a fish toward the gap in the fence to get away from the shout of glass and forgot that the other side of the fence dropped abruptly to the canal’s shoulder. Her sandal snagged a wire; her knee knocked and she made a sound that mothers know is the one you run for whether you are dressed for it or not. Noor saw and moved and Rafe saw and swore because everything had suddenly gotten complicated in a way that would make him look the wrong sort of brave. Poppy tipped forward with the slow acceleration of a dream and then met water with a shock that would take a good portion of the next year to shake off.

Cath hit the fence before any of them and bent metal with her shoulder in a way that made Noor’s hands reflexively reach for laws that did not apply to bones. She went into the canal as if it were a house she remembered the floor plan of and came up with Poppy under her arm and her coat making a slick radius around them both. Poppy coughed the way a small engine coughs, indignantly and at length, and grabbed Cath by the hair with her tiny authority and held on. The men went still in the way men do when a child and a story they were writing about themselves collide, and then they made useful shapes of their bodies and helped Poppy over the railings and made a circle that for a minute had nothing to do with anger and everything to do with water. Cath stood below, hair down and coat a darker version of itself, and looked up like a figure in a painting about grace and then remembered that grace was often just somebody losing their balance in an attractive way.

Mara knelt and took Poppy from the man with the van as if the girl were a letter addressed to her care. She said, “It’s all right,” and Poppy said with wet authority, “No, but it will be,” which made everyone who heard it want to sit abruptly and reconsider their best days. Cath’s hands gleamed in the gelid light, the violet and the blue and the new thin red blur a little, the way colors do when they try to make friends and are still awkward at it. Noor looked down and met Cath’s eye and did not blink for a count of three because blinking would have felt like disrespect at a ceremony she was inventing as she stood there. “You saved her,” Noor said, and Cath shrugged with one shoulder, which had been a coat hanger once, and said, “I was jealous of her breathing.”

Rafe tried to make a noise that would translate into being right and couldn’t find the syntax. Baines arrived with two officers who had the expressions of men who wanted to put their hands somewhere useful and might have to settle for their hips. He took in the water and the fence and the girl and the wall and the woman below and he looked at Mara the way a tired man looks at a beloved kettle that has just boiled without anyone asking it to. “What now,” he said out of the side of his mouth, and Mara, who suddenly and for no good reason felt the stripe on her arm as a kindness, said, “We stop talking like she’s an animal.”

The next day the town did not become good, but its first impulse stood up slowly and went to the kitchen for water before it went to the computer. People looked at the foundry wall in daylight and felt their faces do things they had not instructed them to do. Somebody left flowers and then somebody else left chalk and a child drew a fish that, for a dead second and then a live one, seemed to be the sort that could tweak its way off the wall and flop into the canal with a competence all its own. The florist said to Noor, when she bought nothing and stood with her hands on the counter as if holding in a small earthquake, “Camellias want to be looked at but not for long. They were bred that way. Show and drop. Somebody taught them that. We can teach ourselves different.”

Mara woke with the sense that her body had added a stairwell in the night. The violet mark was a bruise’s handsome cousin and the skin under it felt smarter than the skin around it, which was an unsettling thought to have about your own elbow. She did not cover it for work because covering it would have been a lie and wearing it bared was also a lie; she could not, in good conscience, choose between them and so she chose to fail transparently. In the briefing she pointed to the map and then to the blank space near the foundry where the circles had been drawn and redrawn until the pen had begun to dig; she told the room what they already knew in an order that made them feel that knowing it might make them enough. “We pivot,” she said, because that is the word people are reassured by when everything is the same and none of the sentences about it are. “We call for volunteers—adult—who would like to be marked while standing in line of sight of four officers and a camera that I will not use unless something goes wrong. We invite Cath to paint on canvas, on wall, on people who ask. We ask her to stop approaching children because they cannot consent. We prosecute if she does not stop and if she hurts anyone. We reward if she stops. I do not know how to reward her. We will learn. We are allowed to learn out loud.”

Baines made a noise like a car seat being adjusted in a way that could not lead to comfort. “The press will call it a circus. The chief will call it a circus in different vowels. If she touches another kid we drop words like compulsion and art and call it assault because the law does not care for nuance when the town is tired.” He looked at Mara’s arm and did not look like he wanted to say anything about it. It was kindness, and it was a mistake she decided to grant him.

Under the bridge, wet hair braided itself roughly with a piece of ribbon that could have been from a basket or a medal, and Cath whispered words until one of them stuck. Bravery, she said, and made herself laugh because the sound of it in her voice was obscene and delicious like cake for breakfast. She thought about taking the jars into the daylight, putting them in a bag like groceries, and walking, coatless, to the foundry to work while the sun burned at the back of her neck like a lesson, and then she did not, because habits are bridges too and they do not fall because you think a new thought once. She sat and watched one long insect wake up on the concrete and decide to go somewhere not here, and she felt, in the tiny envy of its motion, the moment that always came and then went: the sense that if she just ran she could peel herself right out of the town and leave only a coat behind to be found and argued over.

The fundraiser committee for the canal festival met two nights later in the community hall that always smelled like sugar trying to sterilize itself. They suggested lanterns made by children and a boat parade and a memorial row for those who had drowned which was both honest and excessively on theme. Mara went because she could not unthread herself from the town now, even though the ribbon around her middle sometimes felt tight enough to make her step shallow. A women with a pearly cardigan and a talent for controlling the distance between her wrists and her teacup said, “We cannot have her there,” in a voice that left no room for asking who the her was. Noor, who had come for the biscuits and stayed for the sociology, said, “She might come anyway. Perhaps we plan for how to behave when the town’s reflection has its own ideas about attendance.”

On the eve of the festival, the foundry wall gleamed with a sheen that was not wet and not oil, something halfway, as if the concrete had invented a way of sweating out pride. Ten adults of various shapes stood and let Cath make of them what she could while working very quickly, as if speed could proof this new game against pity. She made of a baker a sash that made him look elected. She put on a librarian a pair of parentheses she wore on her cheekbones like certainty. She gave the old army man who had raged about the war memorial a bright coin on his throat that made him look like a singer at a tender age. Mara stood in a line she had put herself at the back of, and saw what happened when people asked, and made that one of the stories she told herself when sleep tried to stay away like a stray that doesn’t trust the dish you keep setting out for it.

Somebody, somewhere, saw the permission on the wall and went home and wrote, over a sink, on a plain sheet of paper, I do not give you permission, and taped it on the inside of their child’s window. It was not a spell, but it worked like one simply because it calmed a mother and then a child slept because the air in the room got less sharp about it. Somebody else wrote, with a heart they meant, Cath you can mark me, and left it under a brick by the bridge with a pear and a bar of soap. Cath picked up the note and the pear and left the soap as a gesture toward civility; she did not smell the way people’s stories said she did. If she smelled at all, it was of damp book spines and a corner of metal warmed by touch.

The festival was lights and bread and the sound of men who did not dance trying to behave as if their shoulders did not know this. Children with faces scrubbed to creakiness ran in looping patterns, towing their tired parents. The canal carried the lanterns as if they were ideas trying not to let go of their wicks, and some went out and some went oddly brighter as if a fish had liked the look of them and nuzzled. Noor bought a potato on a stick and ate it bite by shameless bite. Baines let someone put glitter on his cheek because he had already lost the argument with his grandchild about the nature of law and embarrassment.

Cath stood where the lantern-light didn’t quite meet the bridge and watched the town watch itself. Jealousy rose in her and made itself thin so it could slip through the crowd without being seen. She looked at the small ones with their blank hours and at the teenagers with their tensed elbows and their new careful mouths, and at the adults holding tired children and paper cups simultaneously with practiced tenderness, and she wanted to be all of them and none. She brought her fingers to the jar in her elbow and then she did not open it, and the effort made a sound in her bones like a hinge that had been asked to do something noble and was not inclined toward nobility. Mara stepped up beside her with the easy insolence of a cop who has earned the right to pretend she could be anyone for a minute, and said without looking, “I will walk you to the wall after this if you want. Or nowhere, if you prefer to try on nowhere and see how it fits.”

“I will go to the wall,” Cath said, with something like elegance. “I will make a blue that stays. I stole it from a coin, and I have not yet paid it back. I will try to give it to the concrete and see if it keeps it like a secret or like bread.” She glanced sideways and down and said, because honesty was a muscle that was pumping blood now whether she liked it or not, “I do not know if I can stop always. I am built with too many wants. You will have to catch me when I cannot catch myself.”

“I will,” Mara said, and let the words sit out in the air where they could be spotted for what they were. “Not like a fish. Like a person falling. It is a different verb, and the arms use other parts of themselves. We will practice.” The lanterns moved in procession like weeks wearing dresses. Someone on a harmonica invented a tune by misremembering three others. Noor leaned back on the bridge rail and laughed at something a child had said, and her laugh had the feel of something that had managed not to be taught too carefully, which is to say it was still useful for living.

When the crowd thinned, in that way festival crowds do, the wall took the blue the way a sibling sometimes takes a family joke and makes it into a profession. The color went on in sheets and then in feathers and then in tiny strokes that made a place for the strokes that were larger to rest without looking like they were lazy. People trailed past, not so many brave ones now, but enough to keep Cath from remembering she was a habit, not just a person. A woman in the pearly cardigan watched from a distance and then came closer and then put a line down on the concrete with a piece of chalk that had been left from a child’s pocket, and she smiled like someone who had not been intending to do that tonight. The army man stood guard with nothing to guard and enjoyed himself hugely. Baines yawned and didn’t hide it. When the blue finished being only blue it turned into a river that refused to be the one in town and was instead the one inside a story you might tell a child when you wanted sleep to sound like an adventure rather than something done to them by bedtime.

At the end of the night, when the wall felt like a kept promise and the air felt used in a deserving way, Mara put her hand on the cool of the pillar and thought she felt a degree shift, an old chill leaving and a newer kind arriving. Cath was a shadow pinned to a sound, and then not, and the place where she had stood held a temperature for a moment that matched the inside of Mara’s wrist exactly. As they turned to leave, a man put his hand out like a person at a cinema in the wrong row, and said, awkwardly, “Thank you,” which was not to anyone in particular and because no one said, Not at all, the thanks had to settle on the foundry and the canal and the bridge and Cath and Mara and Noor and the old man and the pearly-cardigan woman and the child who had left chalk like a bread crumb and then gone to bed, and it was heavy enough that it did not blow away right away.

The day after, a boy turned up to school with a pink stripe that matched none of the recipes Cath had lately been trying. It had the old sugar and the new metallic, and something else that made Noor frown at the photo and id something like a smudge. He said he had been in his kitchen pouring cereal and a breeze had touched his temples and then the stripe was there, not on his arm this time but on his forehead, and his mother had said a word he had been told was not for nine-year-olds. The boy said he had laughed and then cried and then laughed again because laughing felt like crying’s cousin and he liked the way they shared a laugh in their house. Mara put a palm to her own marked arm and felt heat there that had nothing to do with weather, and said in her quietest voice that still promised something, “We keep going.”

At noon precisely, under the bridge, a petal lay that had once been white and was now the color of the inside of a shell. It was bent in the middle where someone had held it too hard without intending to. It had no note. It did not need one. In the station, Mara slid the sorrow-note out of her pocket and put it in a drawer she did not lock. Noor, passing, did not ask. Outside, a dog barked exactly twice at nothing and then decided that was enough for that job. Somewhere, a mother’s voice called out, I said don’t go too far, and somewhere else a different mother said, Oh all right then, and both were right in the way mothers are right even when the line they are drawing is still suspiciously air-like.

In the evening, alone, Mara stood by the rail again and remembered her mother saying in Ajax, You’ll go far, meaning the horizon like a promise with a map, and in her mouth now the phrase meant a different thing, a length of a town’s patience, a length of a woman’s ache, a length of the distance between a child and a mark on a wall. “I will stop you,” she said to the place and to the person, and meant not a shutting down but a gathering up, not a cage but a catch that didn’t break ribs. Under the bridge, the jars hummed like a choir with a bad rehearsal space, and one of them, the one with the chip on the blue lid, cracked its seal with a sigh that might have been relief or might have been the sound color makes when it realizes it is about to become a verb.By the time the sun learned where to sit on the sky’s shoulder without sliding off, the mark on Mara’s arm had settled into itself the way a bruise apologizes for its own theater and decides to be practical. It did not soften into nothing as Cath had feared; it breathed under her sleeve like another kind of pulse. She caught herself touching it absently in queues and on stairwells, and each time she moved her hand away with the absurdity women use to correct posture when there are no mirrors. People noticed and pretended they hadn’t the way towns do when embarrassment is socialized. Noor noticed and did not pretend; every now and then she lifted her own forearm as if to weigh something invisible and then set it down again with an expression that suggested she was not finished thinking about that weight.

The boy with the forehead stripe brought them to a kitchen that had never meant to host a clue. His mother had scrubbed the counter to clean as penance for the word she had said, and the cereal bowl he had been reaching for was now a different bowl that did not hold the memory of a stripe arriving like a thought you could not unsay. The window over the sink was the kind that admitted only grudging breezes and a disproportionate number of flies. When Noor leaned out to look she inhaled the sweet chemical of dish soap and something else that was not river and not ivy, a plain plastic smell with ideas above its station. Mara pressed her palm against the sill and felt grit with a page-margins fineness, not Cath’s kiss of chalk and berry and stolen flower, but something newly born in a vat and poured into a bottle with a label that made promises it did not expect anyone to read.

“This is hardware,” Noor said softly, rolling a grain between finger and thumb and grimacing at the way it refused to break. “Acrylic. Somebody’s kid cousin of color. It’s not her.”

The mother stiffened at the pronoun without being aware of the stiffness, the way you tense before you know which muscle you intend to use. “So who comes to my window,” she demanded, the temper that had elsewhere kept a household fed and held making an appearance that did not care for charm, “and paints a mark on my child as if he were a door and they wanted to know whether he sticks.”

“We’ll find them,” Mara said, not as a wish but as a thing written in a hand you could take to a bank. She looked at the sill again, at the drag of something that had leaned in where only family had the right, and she felt that old disloyal rearrangement of the world cops endure and sometimes come to rely on: the way rooms tilt into the past tense even as you stand in them. The boy swung his feet from the kitchen chair, perfectly in his own present. He traced his stripe with two fingertips and looked at them afterward as if expecting them to report on a flavor. He had liked it, that much was undeniable, and his liking it sat in the room like a cat no one could lift.

They walked the row of houses afterward as if that could freshen the air. Every window had its own grammar; some were shut to the idea of attention, some were propped with a book because the science of weather required props and people obliged with whatever was to hand. The notes had begun to appear along the brick like a rash of consent and refusal. I do not give permission traveled alongside Paint me, Cath and Not the children in three different inks. Noor smiled at the ones with careful ligatures and sighed at the ones in pencil near the height of a knee. “We’re teaching a town how to say no without losing all its yes,” she said, as if remarking on lunchtime.

“Which is education’s oldest trick,” Mara said, her mind already chewing on the plastic smell and how it had nothing of Cath’s habit of collecting from places where color had accidents and then calling that art. A copycat was not so much a person as an echo that wanted to be a voice, and echoes with access to hardware stores had to be caught before they learned about thinner and hurled it into the narrative like petrol.

Pressure arrived the way weather does when it thinks the town has gotten too proud of its own breezes. The chief called Mara in and did his reasonable tone with the stamina of a man who had not seen the inside of his own patience in years. He made a tasteful circle with a pen over a map that did not need another circle and said, “We need to move from accommodation to intervention,” and he said it like a person asked to give a speech at a wedding for a couple he didn’t entirely approve of. “This is safeguarding. This is public reassurance. This is stop it.”

“It is also the difference between harm and presence,” Mara said, and heard the tone of her own voice as if it belonged to someone about to become less popular at work and more famous for the wrong reasons. “The copycat is harm. Cath is not harmless, but she is not harm in the way that is easily prosecuted. I can put her in a room and ask her to fold her wants into squares and put them on a shelf. She will unfold them when no one is looking. I can stand on the bridge and make a different kind of shelf that looks like a wall. She will use it as a place to hang a-h’s that make the town’s jaw unclench for a minute. How much of your calendar do you want full of unclenching and how much full of court?”

“You like being liked,” the chief observed, a cold kindness that did not know it would go on living inside Mara’s mouth for the rest of the day. “The town likes you for taking its children’s monsters and teaching them to sing. Do not mistake the tune for the work. Catch the vandal. Caution the troll. Give me a plan for both. Don’t make me admire you in front of people again; you know how I feel about sunlight on my badge.”

She took it; she took it all the way down to the place in her that had invented good reasons for bad rescue and bad reasons for good, and she gave him a plan that had the decency to include both the word arrest and the phrase community liaison. He signed off on money for two more cameras and wrinkled his nose in active distaste at the budget line for canvases. “You are a very odd policewoman,” he said finally, not quite unhappy, and she said, because she did not need to win this room to win the other one, “I am just formalizing what everyone else does with better shoes.”

The second note came like a paper bird forced through a slot too narrow for wings. Mara found it under the cup of lavender on her desk that Noor had put there to see if she would notice the joke. The paper had been folded and unfolded enough to make it tired of being a secret. Envy that cannot find a door breaks a window, it said. There was a sauce of pretension on the line that made Mara suspect a teacher or someone who read things with a pen in their hand, ready to underline. She did not know whether to thank the note for its accuracy or dislike it for the way it wanted to be repeated to someone else as wisdom; she put it in the unlocked drawer with the first one and told herself she was collecting a sub-archive for a case that had no box number yet.

Under the bridge, Cath had learned the hard posture you adopt when you are trying to keep from pinching yourself. The promise had become a garment that didn’t fit in the shoulders. She went at the foundry wall every night the way a person goes at an ache with a practical hand, not because it cures it but because it quiets the room around it. The blue gave her a job and she loved it in the way you love a kitchen when the rest of the house is too much story. She looked at the children and kept her lids on and some nights brought the jars out and did nothing but stack them by size like a child with blocks and then put them away again as if that were work too. She felt the mark on Mara’s arm in her own fingers the way you feel a stop you meant to take and then didn’t and then the train goes past and you consider pulling the cord just to sense your own power. She did not pull. She walked up and down the wall until the ground learned the smear of her steps and began to be less shocked by her.

She was not the only creature under the bridge now that the heat slept on top of the town like a heavy cat. Teenagers came to practice being silhouettes and to try out their laughs, and sometimes they left a smell of spray paint that had nothing to do with permission and everything to do with claiming a shape against the dark. Once she saw a hand she did not know, quick as a frog, slip through a hedge and leave a plastic bottle near the canal’s edge. The smell that rose from the neck when she unscrewed it was the same as the kitchen window. She capped it and put it on the pillar like an offering she did not accept, and later Noor took it with two fingers and a face like you make when you pull hair from a plug hole.

Poppy appeared at the foundry with a towel around her neck like a credential and stood with serious hands on hips watching a blue that, in that hour’s light, wanted to be green for a minute and then changed its mind because it did not like that hue on itself. “No,” she said calmly when Cath reached toward her face, not because Cath intended to touch her but because inevitability often makes hands jump. Cath nodded and looked relieved in a way that surprised them both. “No can be a color,” Poppy added, as if reporting from school, and Cath blinked twice as if a new word had been made legal and allowed into the library.

Noor knelt beside Poppy with a chalk stub scavenged from a pocket no one had had the heart to empty yet. She drew a square and then another inside it and then another, and Poppy filled them with different kinds of blue, writing her own names in soft letters: sky, coin, siren, water-when-cold, water-when-fish. The serious game took them through a half hour that could have been spent on the internet thinking up punishments for the nameless, and it allowed each of their shoulders to lower by half the height of a thumb.

Rafe made a run at relevance that week because addiction to a narrative is a thirst that wears a good coat and gets into nice rooms. The foundry woke to a sheet of hardware pink thrown at it with the lazy contempt that comes from people who think throwing is a craft. It bled down the drawing like someone had dropped a giant tongue on the face and waited for applause. The letters TROLL OUT hung there with all the subtlety of a brick. Noor cursed with efficiency and Baines brought two officers with scrubbers and the army man fetched a hose and the pearly-cardigan woman made tea on a fold-out camping stove while she issued orders to bystanders in a voice that could have organized a battle and probably had, if the PTA counted. The pink did not quite come off; it pulled aerials in the blue and made new veins where none had been intended. Cath stood across the road in a coat too hot for the day and did not flinch, which was a kind of flinch you learned late.

Mara bent to the run of the color and inhaled as a way of hiding that she was thinking about court in tense verbs. “Shop-bought,” she said to Noor, who already knew, and to the town, which needed to hear it said out loud from a throat it trusted. “Not hers. Her marks never run like this. She seals her edges without knowing the word for it because hunger likes clean lines.” She got a call on her phone in the middle of saying something else and stepped sideways to hear. A shopkeeper had watched three shapes the night before arguing with a fourth shape about what counted as brave when there was a fence involved. “We have them,” she said to Baines without the pleasure you feel when you get to put a period at the end of a sentence that has been run-on all week. “Or we have at least their shadows and their stubby vowels. Rafe. His van. Two lads who think loyalty is a synonym for boredom.”

They took Rafe in, not in cuffs because there were eyes in the room that required theater’s opposite, and they let him huff his way through the part where he called them humorless and then the part where he called them naive. He had paint under his nails and a way of producing surprise at being called to account that suggested rehearsal. He had an alibi for the kitchen he had found somewhere on the back of a beer mat. He did not have a good story to explain why he had an unopened set of acrylics in the back of his van with a till receipt dated the day before. Baines played reasonable in a way that made reason blush. Noor held his gaze and let him see himself in her eyes looking not like a villain but like a man who had bent and would have to learn to straighten without cracking. He gave them his friends’ names with the slow heroics of a man handing over treasure he considered already spent. “No kids,” he said, suddenly earnest; the word earnest looked bad on him and he wore it bravely. “I told them. The wall, sure, that was a statement, but no kids.” His sincerity cracked a little under the heat of his own breath. “Anyway—” He flapped a hand toward the general idea of the bridge. “She started it.”

“Men have been saying that since the first time a woman had a thought in public,” Noor said, too sharply, and saw his shoulders come down not because he had decided to be less himself but because he had run out of useful adjectives. They fined him because the law had a ledger for this kind of thing and because sometimes the ledger did a good enough job. They made him scrub and paint and sit with the army man and the pearly-cardigan woman and hear, from two people who had taught themselves to like each other against both their instincts, what it meant to mess with something that was trying, however clumsily, to be a common good. He listened badly and then slightly better; the core of him that responded to being given clear jobs and a sandwich at noon took to their list with something that could be called relief if you were feeling generous.

Cath watched Rafe with a curiosity that could have turned to scorn and then didn’t, because scorn is easy and ease was not what she wanted. She came to the wall late that night with the pink still ghosting where it had been and made lines through the place it had claimed. The pink’s backing plastic smell lifted as she worked, embarrassed at being near a better scent; she painted over and through, not erasing the insult but teaching it a different grammar. The wall learned to hold both the wound and the work without being accused by either of infidelity. A fox trotted by with a chip bag like a trophy and blinked at her as if to say we are both scavengers and both queens, and she dipped her head to it, because sometimes you have to practice grace before the audience arrives.

The town pressed its face to the glass of its own story. The school sent home a letter worded carefully enough to land upright when thrown. The radio interviewed a psychologist who said things with the tone of an umbrella being put up just in case and referred to contagion and attention and to the perverse incentives of the public square. Mara washed her coffee cup and thought of viruses and of gossip and of how both liked warm, crowded rooms. She went to see the florist and he said he had started offering children a petal to take home if they bought nothing, which was a kind of protection spell even if he would have laughed at the word. The vicar left a basket of chalks in the narthex and a sign that said you may write joy here and people did, in awkward script, in furious script, in tidy script that looked like vows and in messy script that looked like apologies.

It kept being true that the boy with the forehead stripe was not Cath’s. The copycat group, when they were lined up in the interview room like badly chosen choirboys, gave her a picture they had taken of themselves laughing and then, clocking the audience, tried to look stern. It was tricksterism, it was boredom, it was a dare having found larger boots. It was the way fear is contagious and being the one to spread it makes you feel, for three seconds at a time, like a god with a cupboard full of thunder. Mara sat across from the youngest of them and did not say the dozens of lines that would have made her feel clever and him feel small. She said, “You touched a window that was not yours, and your hand will remember it even if no one else will. The next time someone suggests you put it somewhere it doesn’t belong, ask yourself what you earn by being the one who can’t keep his hands to himself.” He went red in a way that was not violent, and sullen in a way that was, and lied about wanting to apologize, and then did, anyway, to the mother with the kitchen, while his friends shifted their weight and tried to hide behind each other’s names.

She went to Cath the next afternoon not because the timetable said it was time but because the air in the station had begun to feel like a room where the furniture had all been moved slightly and you kept bruising your thighs. Under the bridge, the heat was a little less polite and the pigeons had decided that the important thing was to qua every twenty seconds. Cath had her coat off and looked smaller without it, not frail, but less like a shape and more like a person who could be interrupted. She had wrapped a strip of cloth around her palm, too clean to be an accident and too poorly tied to be anything but self-done. There was rust on the stanchion and a blood smear in a neat line like a misplaced definition. Mara took it in, and the blood on her tongue rose with the old memory of Jace, and she waited until her own past had had its little stomp and settled down.

“You did not do the boy,” she said. Cath’s head jerked with offense that wanted to be gratitude, and then she nodded once, because nodding twice would have felt too much like agreeing with someone else’s sentence about her.

“I did not,” she said. “He smelled like a coin left where hands find it. I do not like that smell. It is jealousy with its nails cut.”

“Someone tried to throw pink at your wall.” Mara did not couch the sentence. “Men who want to run a town like a war hobby.”

“They are jealous of color,” Cath said, and she said it without triumph, which made it dangerously gentle. “They are jealous of the parts that make a noise when they are moved without violence. They would rather break a chair than watch a child draw a circle. It makes their hands itch to see a line they did not lay down.”

“Do you need a doctor’s hands for your palm,” Mara asked, because dignity included practicalities.

“I need a person to tie a knot properly,” Cath admitted, and held out her hand, which was the bravest she had been in weeks. Mara untied and retied, tugging with a certainty she did not entirely feel, and Cath watched her face the entire time as if studying the way concentration changed it and making of that a small private drawing. “There,” Mara said, which is always a spell whether you mean it to be or not. “This holds even if you pull.”

“Do you practice words like that,” Cath asked, fascinated and a little tender. “Do they get dull with use if you do them for as many people as you give money to.”

“They get heavier,” Mara said. “They behave better when they are heavy. They stop rolling off the table.”

“You will stop me,” Cath said, tick-ticking at the bandage now that it belonged to her. “You keep saying it like you are putting a hand on a bird without closing your fingers. Can you keep saying it if your town decides it wants a different trick from you. Can you keep saying it when my hands find a window and you don’t arrive in time with a piece of paper that says permission on it and the paper matters like rain.”

“I don’t know,” Mara said, because lies in this air behaved so badly they bumped their heads on the low ceiling. “I know that I will try to arrive early with the paper and with the sorrow the note told me to practice, and with my own arm out in front of me like a test. I know I will spend a year’s worth of my dignity in a week if it buys us a child who gets to keep a minute clean. I know that I will be quite bad at stopping you if you’re running; I’m not a very good sprinter. But I am very good at waiting in the right place without letting the waiting eat me. Do you think you can meet me halfway on the slow parts.”

Cath tilted her head as if listening for the sound permission makes in a mouth that is not your own. “I will try,” she said, and looked as if she had been given homework and had secretly bought another notebook she did not need because getting the paper right helps some people believe. “The blue is good,” she added, faintly irrelevantly, and in her mouth it sounded like a compliment from stone.

At the next council meeting the phrase enabling was thrown at Mara like a plate and she ducked with the grace of someone who had learned to let plates be plates. A woman in a yellow dress said that letting a troll paint a wall meant you were inviting a forest to plant itself in the car park, and a man with opinions said that if you gave women an inch they would take your fences. Noor sat in the back and stuffed one biscuit after another into her mouth without chewing properly and texted Baines that he should arrive late to avoid saying something he couldn’t walk back from. When it was Mara’s turn she didn’t speechify because speeches were being hoarded and spent by people who liked the sound of their own punctuation. She put up photos of the copycat kids and the pink hardware, of the foundry blue after the pink had been taught manners by brushes, of Poppy’s square full of siren and coin. She said quietly, “We do not fix the parts of ourselves we hate by trying to drown them. We put them to work. We do not confuse a person with a paint brand. We stop harm. We hold what we can. We stand in doorways. We buy time for children. We are allowed to learn where we stand while standing.”

The pearly-cardigan woman spoke afterward to her privately with the intimacy that comes from having objected heartily to someone in public and wanting, quietly, to be forgiven. “I was wrong about the word troll,” she said, trying to make it sound as if she had been wrong about something else instead. “I forgot that fairy tales are manuals and not laws. I am not comfortable with this, but comfort is not the currency required here. I will bring biscuits to your next foolish idea.”

They tried sorrow on as a town and it did not fit them neatly yet. People flinched at one another less and saved their sharpness for their own kitchens, which was arguably worse and arguably necessary. Children practiced saying no because adults told them it was allowed in this instance, and then adults had to sit and consider what would happen when the no came out in other rooms about other things they had hoped would not be questioned. Noor ran a session in the school about consent and penciled in two more lines on her schedule for the next time she would be accused of teaching children to disobey the people who clothed them. Baines found a way to make kind noise to reporters without being recorded as endorsing art in a place where vandalism used to go to breed. The army man bought a set of brushes and took them to a great-niece he claimed not to be fond of, and the way he handed her the bag could have been read as apology if you had lived long enough to learn that men sometimes apologize like that to themselves for things they are not going to tell you about.

The heat broke in a night of rain that made every gutter in town remember its job with sudden righteousness. The overpass dripped with the authority of infrastructure doing exactly what it intended. The canal snored contentedly and shook off the lanterns it had kept like a dog returning from something it thinks is a fetch even if you never threw anything. Under the bridge, the jars sweated like a choir after hymns. Cath sat with her back to the pillar and let the damp do its business on her hair and coat and some of her ache. The jars’ lids ticked in the old music, expanding and slowing, and the one with the blue chip let out a sigh that matched the one her own chest made when she remembered that someone had asked her to paint something without stealing it first.

She went to the foundry not because she had promised (though she had) but because promises were beginning to sound inside her like bells and she wanted to see whether the noise changed at the site of the work. The wall took the wet with dignity. The pink that had resisted going before went softer, embarrassed at being caught out by water, and folded back into its own binder. She worked a line into the rain and laughed, actually laughed, at the way the water carried it into places she had intended to leave white. The laughter made two people at the end of the lane look at each other and then away as if sharing a pastry that had fallen and that they had each taken a bite of before realizing there was not enough for two. Mara arrived, hair doing the absurd thing hair does when it is trying to make sympathy into a shape, and leaned her hip against the wall like a woman finally admitting that stability is a family trait she is going to have to borrow.

The blue ran and made a river within the river, a map inside a town map, and the night shook itself like an animal and found its own skin again. Noor came, late and carrying three cups of something that had once been hot and still had the ambition, and the army man showed up with a plastic poncho he tried to press on Cath, who took it and then didn’t put it on because she could not manage the idea of being the kind of person who rustled when she moved. Poppy fell asleep in her father’s arms with her towel cape gone damp and heavy and no one had the heart to take it off her until her father sneezed and woke her in a burst of outraged grace.

In the quiet after the rain, the boy with the forehead stripe came and, because life is frequently obscene in its insistence on allegory, he had under his arm a paper hat he had made from yesterday’s news. He tipped it at Cath and then at Mara with a ceremony that suggested he had invented a country and was now offering its diplomatic gestures to those he deemed sovereign neighbors. “It’s still there a little,” he reported with the edible solemnity of children explaining the world. “My mum says that’s because some things want to stay. I told her the color probably likes me better than it likes the bathroom sink.”

“Some things do want to stay,” Mara said, feeling the truth of it along her rib cage like a zipper you were not sure you had the right to pull. “We usually let the right ones.”

“How do you know which are right,” the boy asked, because children will do the work grown-ups avoid by hiding under words like nuance and policy. For a second no one answered because every adult in hearing was trying to decide whether honesty would ruin the lesson.

“You ask,” Cath said quietly, which was not an answer and was the only answer. “You ask and if the answer is no you practice not wanting. You paint a wall. You tie a knot. You take your hat off at bridges. You learn to put your hands on the right bit of the fence so it doesn’t bend.”

The boy nodded as if a spell had been given to him and it fit in his pocket. He left them and the rain lifted its skirts and ran off into drains built by men who had intended things and had not known about trolls and blue and the way jealousy could be taught to sit, stay, heel, and then, on a good day, roll over.

Later, after the town had gone home to inspect its windows and leave on counters small notes for unseen things to read, a smear of pink appeared on a back door two streets over, a streak too mean to be art and too proud to be pity. Noor found it on patrol and used the end of her sleeve to lift the smeared edge and smell. Hardware again, but cheaper this time, a tin bought at a discount or stolen off a skip. A copy of a copy, weak tea of an idea. It was fading even as she looked, sliding off the gloss paint like an apology someone had not meant to make. She wiped it away with her hand and a square of kitchen roll the householder had passed out with a look halfway between fury and relief, and she thought of what people do with other people’s stories like tourists stealing rocks from beaches and wondering why the cliff falls on someone else later. She wrote a note in her notebook in capital letters that were gentle anyway: WE ARE NOT DONE. Some part of the town would keep trying to keep the fear fed because fear looks so much like appetite from a certain angle. Another part of the town would keep trying to build a banquet out of biscuits. It was her job to keep the table level.

Mara went home, top button undone, sleeves damp, hair doing the thing hair does when it has decided to speak its mind. In the canal, the lanterns of the festival had all gone out or been rescued by persons determined to reuse them for romance. She put her brave ribbon—still under a glass dish because she had not learned what else to do with proof that people had thought that about her—on the table and put the two notes beside it and felt the three of them looking at each other like guests at a dinner party who would not have chosen to sit together but were, now, obliged to make small talk. She turned the lamp off and let the room be lit by the sign outside that said CLOSED and meant it more politely than a person would. She lay down on the sofa with the mark on her arm cooling under the air and said aloud into the apartment, “I will stop you,” and heard, not in reply but in the fold between two kinds of silence, the word try answer back with none of the smirk and all of the weight.

Under the overpass, a girl named one thing and called another unscrewed a lid and listened to the suck of a jar remembering how to breathe. She pressed a thumb into the color that had boy and siren and coin and Not This Pink all stacked like bedclothes, and she thought, for the first time with the kind of linear practicality that belongs to people with lists, about leaving. She pictured the road peeled out ahead of her like a ribbon tugged by a bored god, and the towns it tied; she pictured new bridges and new ivy and new children whose mothers would call at different registers and whose fathers would carry them on their shoulders with alternate knees. The ache moved in her as if it had learned the town’s streets and could find its way with its eyes closed now. She put the lid back on and stacked the jars again by size, and this time she left one out, not because she intended to use it, but because it was a relief to have something uncontained looking at her not with threat but with invitation. Above, a train went by, and for a moment the world sounded like any other place that had to move people about to earn its keep. She slept and in her sleep she dreamed of blue poured into a mold that made a door, and in the dream she opened it and on the other side was not a room but a brass band playing a tune she half knew and could hum by heart if someone else started first.The morning wore its rinsed smell like linen put out on a line and then forgotten until the first blush of sun found it again. Pavements behaved, for a few hours, as if they had been designed for walking and not for arguments. The ash trees shook the water from their leaves with a dignity that made other plants consider their own posture. On the canal the moored boats had gathered the rain in small private bowls on their tarps, each a coin of sky kept close for spending later. Mara woke in the hour before alarms decide whether to be enemies or allies and lay for a while with her arm over her eyes, feeling the violet through her sleeve as a fact and not a story. She got up and the floor told her she was a person who had decided something in the night without remembering the sentence of it yet. The kettle clicked like a polite mouth, promising a boil it had every intention of delivering. Her phone, which had slept where it could watch the door, buzzed once like a cricket making its point without needing a field. She left it to its dignity and drank tea with a seriousness that would have pleased her mother if her mother could get used to seriousness that didn’t come with a list.

On her walk to the station she noticed that the permission notes had multiplied, not geometric, not viral, more like ivy: a reach here, a clutch there, a cooperation with brick that pleased both plant and wall. Some were tucked into window frames so neatly you couldn’t tell whether the houses had always intended to carry labels. Some had been plastic-sleeved against weather by people who trusted lamination more than custom. On one red door someone had written, in a left hand that leaned as if tired, We will say yes when it is our yes. On a blue painted sill a child had drawn a square and written inside: Not for today, in letters so round they looked like they liked each other. It was school time and small bodies bicycled past with their effort making a whirr that felt like civic pride in miniature. A father had turned his raincoat into a cape for his son and the child wore it with the solemnity of borrowed responsibility. Mara felt the town’s heart beat under the day’s cool like a dog asleep under the kitchen table, present even when not remarked upon.

Noor had a box on her desk the size and shape of a cake tin and the face of a woman who has brought something into a room and would prefer not to have to explain it too soon. When Mara pressed a thumb to the lid and lifted, it wasn’t cake inside but chalk, stacked, fat sticks in gentle colors housed with the reverence of artifacts. “Mrs. Hargreaves,” Noor said, and it was both explanation and apology. “She found it in a cupboard labeled for angels and thought it was better used on mortals this week. She told me not to let the headteacher borrow any for diagrams, because the word permission needs to be written with a hand that has drawn lambs and knows how to make them not look like potatoes.”

“There are worse credentialing systems,” Mara said, and touched a pale blue with two fingers as if checking its pulse. “We’re turning into a town with a stationery policy.”

“We are turning into a town that understands signs are spells if enough people read them,” Noor replied, and tried to say it like a joke and didn’t quite manage. She had a line between her brows that suggested sleep had come with terms and conditions.

At the foundry the wall glowed in the new light as if it were smug and trying not to show it. The blue had dried into a skin that welcomed hands when people put them near, and the runs left by the rain had resolved into tributaries in a way that made three different onlookers separately say oh under their breath, the dumbest and therefore purest word. Rafe was there before he had agreed to be, a bag of tins set down at his feet like an apology he wasn’t ready to hand to a person. He was wearing a shirt with too much branding on it, the kind you buy because it does immediate work of pretending you belong to a thing and therefore to a story, and he stood with his hands in his pockets as if afraid they would wander and misbehave. The army man said something to him that made Rafe laugh in a way that made him look younger, and then older, and then roughly the age he was supposed to be.

They scrubbed the last pink ghost in companionable silence, like two men washing a car that had done them no wrong and was, by doing its simple job, forgiving them for all kinds of things they had not asked for absolution for. The pearly-cardigan woman supervised with a brew in each hand as if tea were a technology she meant to keep in local control. When they finished, Cath stepped out from the shade at the corner of the yard and lifted her brush with a poverty that had nothing to do with money. She added three strokes, swift, like sentences you leave on a letter when the postman is already up the path and you have remembered something essential about a story. The strokes turned a shape previously theoretical into a shoulder, and the shoulder made the rest of the figure less likely to fall. Rafe watched and, because the human eye is an animal taught tricks by necessity, he did not blink for the three strokes, as if blinking would erase them and place the responsibility for erasure on him.

The copycats were being processed with the lightest bureaucratic touch Mara could bear to defend. Baines’s grumble had found a purpose beyond display, and he used it to keep both the chief and the bored lads in the interview rooms slightly off balance. Noor did the family calls with a mixture of formality and a humor you could build on; her tone made room for parents to be furious without being invited to enjoy it. When the youngest’s mother came in, she came with an anger so clean it surprised even her. Mara watched the way the woman held her bag, clutched underarm like a shield when no shields were needed. When she spoke, it was with the careful slowness of someone making sure the words belonged to her and were not inherited from a television show. “He’s not cruel,” the mother said. “He’s stupid. And tired. And I am too. He wanted to be big because everything lately makes him feel small. If you can teach him how to be big without making other people smaller, I will bake cakes for your birthdays until the law runs out of numbers.”

“We can make a start,” Mara said, and would have said it even if cakes had not been involved, though cakes are a kind of law enforcement even a skeptic can pledge allegiance to. She kept her expression mild because mildness is what keeps some people in rooms long enough to hear themselves finish a sentence.

Cath tried leaving in the afternoon on a day that pretended at being mild but couldn’t help showing its teeth. She took a jar with her, the one with the chipped blue lid, and a bag that had been a bag for oranges once and now felt like a symbol whether she wanted it to or not. She followed the canal because leaving along water is easier on the body; the world remembers people who went by that way and makes the path plausible. The boats ignored her in the way boats ignore everyone who is not carrying a rope. A dog on a narrowboat barked once and then reconsidered its role in civic life and wagged instead, squared off against its own impulses like a child deciding to wait for a biscuit. A woman painting the roof of her barge looked down at Cath with the unapologetic curiosity of someone who prefers questions to the stories people hand you without asking, and said, “Are you going somewhere or are you practicing.”

“Practicing,” Cath said, and was startled by the accuracy of the answer climbing up from her without passing through anything polite. The woman nodded in approval as if that were the right way to begin, dipped her brush in paint the color of a bruise two days old, and went back to teaching metal to behave as if it were rainproof.

At the third lock, where the path curved in a way that made you unconsciously put a hand on something for balance, Cath turned back. The jars in the bag felt like a responsibility and a prize and a set of cutlery she had borrowed from a place that would miss it and have to do sums about what to feed whom. She had seen the road unroll beyond the arches and for a second it had looked like a sentence you could finish and then live with; now it looked like a river that would take her to bridges she had not taught herself how to speak under. She did not know if she had failed at leaving or succeeded at staying. She went to the wall to ask it what the difference might feel like in the body.

When the second note arrived, Mara was trying to make the ribbon on her table stop being an icon by moving it from one end to the other like a salt cellar. Noor found the note propped against the ribbon like a friend with bad timing and pointed at it with her chin because she did not want to pick up a thing she thought of as a wire. It read, without perfume this time, Grief is the sibling pity disowns in public. You will need both at different doors. The handwriting had gone less graceful, impatient at its own insight. Mara felt friendship and exhaustion at the same time toward the unseen hand. She showed it to the vicar that afternoon, because he had a face that had practice being looked at while people decided whether to trust it, and because she wanted to watch his eyebrows.

He smiled the smile clergy sometimes have when something worldly lines up accidentally with something older and less fashionable. “I have written worse sentences anonymously,” he confessed, as if bribing himself into honesty with his own past. “But not these. I think you have a pedagogue. The tone is collegiate. Or someone in love with the idea of being collegiate. Or someone who taught and had to stop and is trying not to die of that stopping.”

“Would you like to be them,” Mara asked, too intent to be teasing, and he spread his hands in a shape that suggested both humility and a little bit of greed. “I would like to be anyone who gives you a thing you can use,” he said. “I cannot be them today. But I can keep my doors open after choir and let children draw notes and pin them up and call it art. That helps some days more than sermons that have had careful homes in notebooks for years.”

Baines discovered, in his own unbeautiful way, that it irked him when people spoke about bravery as if it were confetti. He cornered Mara by the station kettle and let his eyebrows be his whole speech for the first ten seconds and then said, “If this goes sideways and a child gets hurt the chief will turn our kindness into joblessness. If it goes straight and no child gets hurt we will have used the word troll in public without being taken for fools. If it goes sideways but the child is saved, we will be saints for a week and then the budget will get cut. You have chosen a road with snakes on it and also with tourists.”

“I see the snakes,” Mara said. “I hear the tourists. I am still going to put my shoes on and walk. The other road is the kind where you put Cath in a room with white walls and someone on a stipend and ask her to explain herself until the explaining becomes its own hunger. The hunger will not give up because it has a chair. We might as well give it a job that cleans something.” She poured their teas with a discipline that made it look like an ancient rite.

He grunted and took his cup and stood there drinking less like a man and more like a kettle’s father. After a minute he said, “Your arm. Does it interfere with your ability to hold a line.” She held his eye because looking away would rewrite his question into something about women and softness neither of them had time to indulge. “It is a line,” she said. “I hold it. It pulls. That is the definition.”

Rafe told Noor a story by accident on a Thursday when the town had collectively decided to eat late and nobody’s sugar levels were where they should be. He said his sister had fallen in a paddling pool once and he had stood there and watched, an idiot boy with a crisp packet, and that the memory had turned the insides of his cheeks to metal every time he heard water touch anything. He said he had thought about pushing someone into the canal most days since just to see if he could make it come out right this time, a confession so ugly it had to be true. Noor said nothing at all for half a minute and then said, “You don’t have to rehearse a rescue by inventing a drowning,” and he looked at her like she had given him a spare coat and he was trying to figure out whether it fit where shame lived.

Cath tried to paint her coat. She laid it out in the dust under the bridge like an animal she was tending and she opened the chipped-lid jar and she made a gesture she had learned from the woman on the barge who painted without fear of being caught doing anything but looking after a thing she owned. The pigment pooled and looked at the fabric and slid a little as if it were the world’s least interested snail. It did not bead the way skin had; that made disappointment hurt differently, as if the rejection were less personal and therefore more insulting. She worked the color into the wool with a patience born of not having much else and the sleeve took a stain as if it had been waiting to be convinced. When she put the coat back on the color lay on it quietly and did not shout, but it also did not disappear, and when she walked in daylight it made the street’s eye shift a degree, a kindness that felt like a new kind of indignity until it didn’t.

Poppy saw the coat and said in a voice that had taken on some of her grandmother’s authority without any of the old woman’s frost, “Later can be a color too.” Cath stopped like someone had pulled a string attached to the back of her heart. “What is later,” she asked, genuinely curious, because time for her was usually a place she listened to, not a thing she bent. Poppy considered the coat as if negotiating with it. “Later is the bit after now where you put the thing you want because now is doing something else,” she said. “Later is purple. Or green. Or both if you fold it.” She took her towel off and put it on Cath’s shoulder like a deputizing, then took it back because it was hers.

In the kitchen with the cheap pink, a man tried to make a monster because the shape of his life had gotten away from him and he wanted something outside him to match. He had dipped a brush with too square a head into paint with too much personality for indoor use and he had leaned into his own window and he had made a mark with the concentrated self-love of a person looking in a mirror. The paint had run and the boy had cried with confusion and the mother had said the word and then another and then a third that neither she nor the boy knew she knew. The man was not one of Rafe’s; he was his own kind of petty, the kind that looks at a story other people are making and cannot stand not having a line in it. The mark had washed off easier than the fear, which had stuck in corners that would go undiscovered until washing day. Mara stood in his hall and listened to him lie and did not do the satisfying thing, which would have been to break his lie in half in front of him and then hand him the pieces. She did the boring thing, which is more expensive and far more likely to stick: she told him what would happen if he did it again in words that made a line his feet could find without tripping. He nodded with the politeness of a signing ceremony at a primary school.

The vicar admitted to the notes in the way a man of faith admits to anything that involves ink and secrecy: with a look toward the ceiling and a half smile that suggested he was willing to be judged if you brought biscuits. He had not written both; the second belonged to a woman whose hands had long ago learned to fold programs and whose mouth had learned to argue about hymn choices without making enemies. She did not confess and did not need to; the town had half a dozen women who could have written a sentence like that and none of them wanted the credit. It was not anonymity, exactly. It was a kindness toward authorship that towns with limited oxygen sometimes manage to generate: content yourself with the sentence having arrived. Mara, who believed in receipts out of habit, put a hand on the drawer anyway every time she passed it, as if checking on eggs incubating.

The foundry wall’s face resolved. It was no one’s and everyone’s, the mouth a street and the coin eye a thing that saw and remembered and forgave and did none of those. Children drew their hands beneath it in chalk and Cath traced around one with a fingertip without touching and wrote the word permission beneath in a hand that had learned calligraphy from ivy. An old couple walked by and the woman said, “I don’t like it,” with the honest malice of someone who has earned the right not to, and the man said, “I do,” with the easy betrayal of long companionship, and they bickered for the pleasure of the meter it gave their walk. Mara read somewhere—probably on a mug someone gave her by the sink at Christmas—that good art makes a mess of your shelves, and she thought about her ribbon and the notes and the way her arm had become both shelf and mess.

The chief called her again and this time he did not draw a circle, because his pen had run out, and because he had seen a photo in the free paper of Cath’s coat in daylight and realized he did not want to look at it and also could not help it. “You will need to end this,” he said without huffing, which is the highest courtesy he could pay her devotion. “You will need to end it in a way that leaves us in work and the town in its skin. I do not know what that ending looks like. If you find it and hand it to me, I will pretend I was the kind of man who thought of it first.” He had tired of his own disingenuousness for the day and he set it aside like a jacket on the back of a chair in a meeting he didn’t enjoy.

“What counts as an end,” Mara asked, not as a teacher checking a student’s comprehension but as a woman drawing chalk lines on a pavement and trying to decide which ones you could step outside without losing the game. He looked at her with a compassion he would rather have reserved for a sports team he actually supported and said, “It will feel like sleep, the good kind. People will begin putting their notes in drawers and forgetting to read them. They will look at their children and see only their faces. They will count pink as a color we have all agreed to like again.”

The finger of weather that had been stuck on Grimy slid a notch toward Gold, because towns like to please themselves even when no one is watching. Cath walked the high street with her coat and its not-quite blue shoulder and noticed that she drew a screen of the eye now, not a full appraisal. It was a relief and an ache, because she had learned to live off the gasps that used to catch in throats when she moved at the edge of things, and absence is a hungrier food than presence some days. A girl at a bus stop looked right at her with the boredom of youth and the sharpness of something else and said, “That’s a good coat,” as if giving the thing a passport stamp into fashion. Cath smiled in the untrained, poorly tailored way she had when something pleased her so much it made her posture go wrong. She thought of leaving again and felt the idea toss and get comfortable in her mouth.

Mara met her at the bridge because there are some places a conversation will not occur properly in any other geography. She brought with her a ticket with no destination printed on it, a voucher bought from a machine that wanted to be helpful without prying. She held it like a tactless flower. “If you go,” she said, “go with a paper that says you can. It is not permission in the sense that matters. But it is a doorhandle in a town that likes to keep feelings logged. Use it or keep it or burn it for heat under the bridge when you decide fire beats metaphors for the day. If you stay, I will help you choose winter clothes. You can borrow one of my stupid hats that makes me look like a person who enjoys festivals more than she does. If you go, send me a note that says you are not dead, so I can stop keeping a space on maps for a ghost.”

Cath took the ticket with two fingers as if it might bite. It was light in the way things are when their meaning is heavy and so the object tries to be helpful and not add its own weight. She tucked it into the inside pocket of the coat and the blue on the shoulder flashed once as if it were laughing at all of them and then got on with the business of being color. “I do not know the word for what you are doing,” Cath said, not quite appreciative and not quite suspicious. “If it is kindness, it is ruder than some I have seen. It is taking off a lid and putting it back on, to see if the jar likes the sound.”

“It is that,” Mara said, relieved to be told what she was up to. “And it is the best version of stopping I have. It is me interrupting what you do not control, not erasing what you are when you decide to be not a lesson.” She looked past Cath at the water’s shoulder, which had learned her habits, and then back at Cath’s face, which had learned her own name without loving it. “You can leave after you finish the river,” she added lightly, like an invitation to stay late at a party that would be more interesting at two in the morning when the people who cared about their shoes had gone home.

Noor found the kitchen with the cheap pink again two days later, not because the man had done anything but because she did not trust tidy moral arcs and she liked to watch them for frayed edges. The note in the window had been replaced with one that read You may not, which was both more and less articulate than the last. The boy had drawn a fish with shoulders. “That’s not how fish are,” Noor said mildly, and the boy said, without a trace of doubt, “Mine are.” Noor resisted the urge to invite him to the foundry to draw that fish into the river until it flopped off. She knew when to let a mystery school keep its own hours.

Baines went with Mara to Ajax, which was not the plan she had imagined for that town in her head. He had to drop something off at a station two towns over and he decided to keep going because sometimes seeing where a person had their variables set helps you not shake your head so much in meetings. Ajax’s straight streets surprised him by being kind, the way an ex-soldier’s posture sometimes hides a laugh. They walked past a rink whose concrete had taken on the memory of ice in summer, and past a field where a boy kicked a ball and his father shouted love in two syllables. Mara showed him a hedge where she had bled for the first time because she was not paying attention with the vertical half of her mind, and he nodded as if that had been the right place to launch the future from. They didn’t stay. The trip was as much a note to Cath as a pilgrimage: the fact of having a place you could point at and say from made some choices more legible in the mouth.

In the week that unrolled with a lack of drama that felt like generosity, the wall gained a horizon and then lost it because Cath decided the picture had been lying flat too long and should stand up if it wanted to be looked at properly. A teacher brought her art class down under the premise of civic engagement and let the children argue with their own adjectives out loud, which made two of them cry in a way that afterward they said felt like swimming without getting wet. Someone in the council wrote an email about liability and the email went into Baines’s folder named For Later, which meant for never unless it became relevant to someone whose name could make a room go quiet. The chief’s pen wrote a circle again and he pretended it had always been what he wanted. Mara’s mother sent a message from Ajax that said in her economical way, There is a story on my local news about you. I will watch if there are no adverts that make me shout. Mara sent back a picture of the blue and wrote it’s louder than adverts when it is in the sun, and her mother sent three balloons because she did not have a blue in her repertoire that did not involve sadness and she was trying.

On the morning that would have been nothing at all in another town and would have been the whole of a month in a different one, Cath stood at the bridge with the coat behaving and the inside pocket making a sound like paper thinking, and she breathed in and looked at the town with the expression of a person about to walk to the front of a room and thank too many people because leaving without doing that would look rude. She did not open the jars. It cost her a pinch behind the ribs that might have been three ribs pinching each other out of habit. She took out the ticket and felt its bureaucratic magic, the permission of a machine that had never seen her and would not, and thought of doors. She thought of the blue she had put on concrete and the way children had taught it names it would not have discovered in art school. She thought of Poppy’s later and Noor’s squares and Mara’s line, the one she held without letting it cut. She thought of envy like a dog taught three tricks and eager for a fourth. The train on the line above came and went, and its sound might as well have been the sea, that other thing people go to when they have run out of sentences. Cath put the ticket away. She went to the wall. She made a stroke so simple it felt like breathing, and for the length of the stroke the ache inside her pressed its cheek against something and slept.

Toward evening, as if it had been written on a board in a staffroom somewhere that the day still required an educational exercise, a girl in a yellow dress — not the council woman but a child whose dress had belonged to three girls before her and showed it in its love of sun — came and stood with her chin up and said to Cath, “You’re not a troll,” with the relish of a person testing a prohibited sentence and finding it delicious. Cath tilted her head and let the word sit on the air like a moth that had landed of its own accord. “No,” she agreed, and then, as if making a gift to herself in public, added, “I am hungry and learning to cook. Tell your mother I will not come to your window and I will come to the wall. You can bring a pear and a soap if it helps her.”

The child nodded sagely and said, “Soap is a bit bossy,” and skipped off, as if she had invented the idea of permission for a family of four and was going to write it down in the notebook under the telephone. Noor watched her leave with the posture of a person unwilling to let luck be mistaken for a plan. The army man hummed tunelessly and used a roller with the contentment of a person who has named his tools and is called by them in return. Rafe took a call, said “yeah, okay, yeah,” five times, and then didn’t go, which counted as progress measurable on a scale invented specifically for him.

That night Mara took the ribbon off the table and put it in a drawer without notes. She had not earned it and she had, which is what made all awards suspicious. She lay on the sofa with the light off and the window open and listened to the town breathe like a choir after a hymn. She slid her palm over the violet and felt it living there, not angry, not fading, a tenant with rights and chores. She said again, because repetition is how some promises get real, “I will stop you,” and it had begun to mean a set of interlocking sentences she could at last say to herself without sounding like the kind of woman who believed she could knit a bridge over a river. It meant, today, that she would walk to the foundry again at first light and check the run of blue where the rain had made it ambitious. It meant she would put her hand on the pillar and listen. It meant she would spend her language carefully on men in vans and girls in yellow and women in coats until the town learned to stop asking the bridge to do its thinking for it. It meant she would sleep until the drains forgot their labor and the water, somewhere, took a breath for the joy of it rather than because oxygen insists.Morning laid its pale coin on the foundry yard and let it shine there without fuss, as if tipping the town for services rendered. The blue had dried into its authority overnight and wore the runnels from the rain like veins it had earned by work. Mara arrived with the habit of arriving before anyone had had time to wrap the day around their worries, and she laid her palm against the wall the way you might lay your hand on a child's hair when you wanted to check for heat without advertising that you were checking. Noor came up behind her with coffee pronounced as a blessing and said, because her mouth was quicker than her caution, that she had dreamed of doors with the word yes written on their backs and woken up annoyed that this implied the answer had always lived on the side you couldn’t see until you committed to entering. Mara smiled into her cup and said that this was architecture's oldest joke, and that she would like, one day, to have a room in which no surface had advice written on it unless it was recipes that ended with butter.

They walked the edge of the yard like two women patrolling their own doubts. Noor showed Mara a smear where the cheap pink had tried again under cover of rain and dignity, and how it had failed for the simple reason that water is better at being permission than plastic is at pretending to be pigment. The smear had become a ghost of itself and looked almost shy, like a child hiding behind its own arm because it wanted to stay to watch the story but understood, dimly, that it had miscast itself. Mara crouched and touched the stain with one knuckle, the way you touch a bruise on someone else and expect it to tell you a story it doesn’t owe you, and she said they were not done and Noor nodded because the sentence had acquired the force of ritual. The army man appeared with a brush he had named and a Thermos his great-niece had painted with dogs that looked like bread, and he offered them tea he couldn’t afford to give away and refused to let them refuse.

By ten there was a room with carpet squares that thought of themselves as heirs to pews, and in it a consultation with the kind of title that gives the impression of certainty by stringing four nouns together. Safeguarding, Liaison, Community, Partnership sat on the printed agenda like cousins who only behaved at funerals. The headteacher had brought a folder and an expression that could cut cake; the social worker had brought a pen and the kind of patience you bake in low and long; the council woman in the yellow dress had brought her certainty and wore it with the pride of a garment that had never once split a seam. Baines scowled sympathetically at everyone and distributed biscuits, and Mara put the ribbon from her drawer in the bottom of her bag because she had been thinking about whether a heroic noun in your house altered your posture at meetings. They spoke about Cath as if you could pin a woman to cork with a map pin and then chart her using different colored string, and they spoke about the copycats as if boredom itself ought to have a probation officer, and they spoke about the wall as if concrete had a responsibility to set a moral tone.

Mara listened and then said, when the room tipped toward slogans, that lines on paper did not keep hands off windows and that what seemed to work was a town learning to say no without having to set fire to its own yes to do it. She spoke of canvases and permission, of the blue and what it had done to the run of the street, and of a girl with a towel who had managed, singularly, to name a color for later. She did not say pity because the word behaved badly in rooms like this, and she did not say sorrow because that would have made the social worker cry and then they would all have had to behave better. The headteacher asked her if she wanted assemblies and she said yes, but not ones with PowerPoints, and the council woman said something about precedent and people painting anything they liked if you let them, and the vicar, who had slipped in late and taken the chair nearest the coffee as if spiritual authority bought you proximity to caffeine, said that he had always found paint made more generous promises than blunt instruments and that the town’s walls would teach them how to be looked at if they were allowed.

Cath watched the town conduct its administrative ballet from a place under the bridge where you could feel through your back the intent of passing trains. The coat lay over her knees like a beast that had consented to be domesticated but was not above reminding you, with an ear twitch, that it had a different family elsewhere. She took the chipped-lid jar out and set it down and did not open it, and the refusal made a sound in her blood like someone asking politely not to be interrupted while they were learning. The permission notes had multiplied along the path, folded and taped and laminated and tucked, and she ran her fingers along the edges as if sight could be acquired through touch in a town that still believed in the alphabet. One said You may paint our bin, which was honest and funny and possibly a trap; another said Come to our wall and do your worst, which was bravery and idiocy having a row on paper and then shaking hands because one of them had brought cake.

At midday, the florist leaned on his counter between camellia and hyacinth and told Noor that a person had come in asking whether there were flowers you could steal color from without the flowers minding, and he had answered like a man who had learned ethics late and was enjoying making use of them. He had said no and yes in the same breath, and then he had offered marigolds that would have given their orange away for a coin or a joke, and the person had declined with a seriousness that suggested she had begun to understand that borrowing was different from theft only if you meant to return something other than regret. Noor tucked the story in her pocket like a good luck charm and left a pound for the church flowers because she could not bear to leave a shop that smelled like this without buying a holy.

The camera the council insisted upon installed itself under the overpass with the diffidence of a spy sent to a party hosted by people who know where cameras live. It hummed not at all and looked exactly like a camera tries to look when it is in a place where people do not want to be filmed, which is to say apologetic and unavoidable. Baines signed a form that implied he believed in the efficacy of infrastructure, and Mara shrugged and said if the camera caught anything it would catch absence, which is useful in court and terrible in poems. The camera’s eye took in pigeons and the dark and the departmental blue of owlish midnight and then, at dusk, a coat with a shoulder that had learned to hold color without hoarding it.

They met again, because that was the shape the thing had taken, at the rail when the day had decided to go sit elsewhere for a while. Mara spoke first because she always did, and she said that the council wanted to call it closure, and Cath smiled at the word as if it were a dish she had once been served and had no intention of ordering again. “Closure is what shopkeepers say when they pull the blinds,” she said, and her voice had the calm of someone telling a true thing they did not need anyone else to applaud. “It is not a word for hunger. It is an umbrella and it will not keep this from getting on the paper bag where you keep your lunch.” Mara winced because she had used the word herself earlier to the chief, and because she knew precisely what sort of umbrella she had imagined when she did.

“I need something else then,” Mara said, and she tried for a joke that would open the room and found the room wanted a key instead, so she put the joke down gently and used the key she had. “I need a promise you will not go to windows, not to children, not because you did not make art there but because you broke their houses doing it. I need to say the word stop and have it mean we are lowering a hand not to strike but to take away an object you have begun to throw without looking. I can give you something instead, but I cannot barter this one any longer. They will come to take you if you go to a window again, and I do not like their hands.” Cath looked at her hands as if she had never seen them before and then she looked at Mara’s, which were steady in a performative way people in her job trained for. “I will not go to windows,” she said, and the sentence went into the air like a kite that would behave itself if watched.

Noor came then at a pace that suggested she had tried, and failed, to walk slowly for the sake of decorum. She had a letter that smelled of polish and a kind of ink only older hands use, and she said Mrs. Hargreaves had been bullied into writing it by a committee and had, in her resentment, found a beauty she would not have achieved if she had been pleased. The letter said, in a formal hand that made all the words stand up straight, that St. Mick’s would like to commission a painting indoors, in the parish hall, on a wall that had nothing on it but a calendar with kittens and a nail where someone’s coat would go in winter. It said they had discussed liability and prayer and decided both were useful and neither would do the work alone. It said they would give a small fee and a generous silence. Mara watched Cath read and saw the part of her that knew about rooms flinch as if you had opened a box and the air inside had been the wrong air.

“Indoors,” Cath said, with the sadness of a fox asked to learn to like leashes. “It is not my air. I do not know how to make color be polite for long enough to live there. It will itch and then it will shout.” Noor, who could be rude only when it was medicinal, said that shouting was what parish halls were for, and that if the paint came off they would call it liturgy, which is a word people use when they want repetitive acts to have meaning in public. Cath laughed with her mouth and not her lungs and said she would look, and that was all anyone could ask for, and even that might have been too much if you were honest about the way the coat had begun to object to ceilings.

The camera caught the empty when Cath left, and it caught the way air has a different weight after someone has stood in it with intention. It caught a fox giving the world a critique in the form of a trot. It did not catch a man with acrylics because Rafe had, for once, gone home to peel potatoes and listen to a program in which a man shouted about sport as if shouting were a kind of intelligence. It did not catch the boy with the stripe because the boy was at his table doing maths and eating crisps with the solemnity of ritual, or the girl in yellow because she was in the bath making a ship float and then sink and then float again, which is the way people learn to bear their own futures. It did catch, long after midnight, a figure who stood with her head against the pillar like a person who had said something she would have to keep saying and wanted to hear how it sounded against concrete. Mara watched the footage the next day and turned the sound off because she did not believe you needed your ears for this kind of listening.

When the parish hall offered its wall it did so with the humility of places that know they have been useful for stupid reasons and want to have their usefulness upgraded. The kittens came down and someone put them in a folder marked for later and later, and Mrs. Hargreaves stood with her hands folded in front of her and did not make the joke about lambs because she had offended Noor last week with a remark about potatoes and did not want to repeat her own worst material. The air smelled of polish and books and the kind of tea that arrives from a tin with a painting on it and therefore has opinions. Cath stood at the threshold like a reluctant bride or a conscientious thief and then stepped in because stepping out had been her habit and habits had grown into errors lately.

She touched the plaster and it smelled like the color white thinks it is when it is fresh. The vicar said they had scraped back a patch and found an older color beneath and that this pleased him too much to say out loud in front of the committee, and that if she encountered ghosts she should be kind and ask them to sit down because standing ghosts unsettle everyone. Cath touched the wall again and whispered to Noor, as if asking permission of an accomplice, that she would begin with a square. She made it blue and thin, a mere nothing, an outline that was a rehearsal for weight. She made four more and then the room learned the geometry of what a single woman can do when asked, and the children who came in for choir trailed their fingers just above the wet like locals looking at a lake that had been forbidden to them by mothers trying to keep shoes dry.

During the week of squares the copycat boys tried a different street and failed again because Noor had left chalk everywhere and the town had learned to shout no in letters as large as doors. Someone wrote, over a smear, THE WALL IS THAT WAY with a rocket for emphasis, and shared a picture that traveled not because the internet likes rocket ships but because the tone hit that small sweet spot between mockery and invitation that humans crave like salt. Rafe turned up to the parish hall with a mop and shame and said he wanted to be useful even if he couldn’t be brave, and Mrs. Hargreaves made him carry chairs as penance and then praised him in front of people, which is a currency worth more than coins on Tuesdays. The army man hung lights because he had been told his fingers were too rough for paint and he took small revenge by making sure the light was excellent, which is a painter’s favorite weather.

Mara’s mother arrived from Ajax without warning and stood in the hall with her arms folded, looking at the squares as if they were grandchildren someone had failed to introduce properly. She had one of those faces that had learned to look like advice only because advice had been asked of it too often, and she said, when Mara hugged her, that she was sorry for the way their town had pronounced her daughter brave instead of useful. The apology lived happily in the hall alongside the blue and was forgiven instantly, which is how some sentences earn the right to stay in a place without paying rent. Mara introduced her to Noor and the vicar and the army man and the pearly-cardigan woman and Poppy, who was wearing a cape because she considered halls with new paint to be theaters. Poppy asked if Ajax had its own bridge and Mara’s mother said it had an ice rink instead and that, if you squinted, it was a similar kind of magic that taught people how to trust a surface without breaking it.

On the eighth day of squares, because weeks love a tidy myth, the council woman in the yellow dress brought a journalist with a pen that did not run out and a tape recorder that did not trust itself, and the hall learned what it was to be a page in a paper. The article was kind because poverty had been put to work as narrative and the journalist had decided it was a better story to leave readers feeling like they had plan. It called Cath an artist and called the town resilient, and it called the police the word partners because the paper liked to flirt without committing. The chief cut the article out and pinned it on the board in the break room with an expression like a man who has found his glasses in the fridge and is choosing to assume this was deliberate. He told Mara to keep it up until the budget meeting, and he meant it like a man who wanted to keep his job and thought perhaps he might if the wall kept behaving.

Then the fog came, not the kind that creeps but the kind that lands, full-bodied, as if sky had gotten tired of pretending it was far away and decided to come down to gossip. Windows blurred themselves and then became mirrors that showed kitchens with labor in them and faces that had forgotten how to move in certain ways until someone else walked in. The canal took the fog like a shawl and wore it with vanity. Under the bridge, sound behaved oddly; you could say a word to the pillar and it would walk three feet, consider its options, and then sit down. Cath moved through the fog like someone who had finally been given permission to belong in a place that liked its edges hidden. She did not open lids. She counted the squares she had made as if they were stiches in a row and as if skipping one would make the jumper unwearable forever.

Mara walked the fog with her hands in her pockets, which is the posture of someone who suspects the weather might steal from you and wants to count her coins without being seen. Noor used the fog to practice being the kind of person who could slip in and out of arguments without being named. They met under the bridge because they could not help it; because weather calls the shots in romances and detective work alike. “If the camera fails we will have to draw it a picture later,” Noor said, grinning, and Mara grinned back, and then stopped, because the fog held another shape in it, not human at all and yet exactly that, as if a line Cath had drawn somewhere had come to stand and look at itself thinking.

What stood there was a door. It had no hinges you could see. It was drawn in fog with a confidence that made wood feel embarrassed about its own pretensions. It was larger than a person and yet not unkind about it, the way a horse’s face can be large and still not decide to frighten you. On it, because narrative does not miss opportunities, the word permission had been written by many hands, over and over, in inks that had bled and chalk that had run and one pencil that had been used until its metal teeth showed. Poppy’s hand was there with its roundness, and Mrs. Hargreaves’s with its chapel, and the vicar’s with its apology for the guilt that always rides on that man’s shoulder when he talks about anything fun. Cath stood and saw it and put her fingers an inch away from the fog and did not push and did not pull, which is a restraint you have to teach yourself if you were born in damp and raised on want.

“I can stop now,” she said, and for a second every pigeon in the district put its head under its wing in case someone shouted. She said it again, because the fog had eaten the first one, and this time Mara heard all of it. “I can stop going to windows,” Cath said, and she did not add the rest, which would have been about hands and shoulders and the need to be near a thing you did not own in order to learn the shape of it so your own shape could find a way not to ache. She reached up, as if placing a hat on the head of a person taller than her, and she pressed her palm to the space beside the door. The fog held the mark for a second and then it let it go, which is what all good doorways do unless they are in stories that end badly.

They put the last square in the parish hall that week and it was not square at all, because the habit had begun to bore Cath and boredom is not a vice in art so much as a compass. It made a curve that argued with the rest, and the argument pleased everyone except Mrs. Hargreaves, who disliked arguments and curves unless she had been the one to start them. The choir sang beneath it and their vowels acquired a hint of water, and the light made a noise in the dust so gentle you could have mistaken it for prayer without getting laughed at. A child with the kind of attention span that will one day be called genius stood before the curve and told her mother, with the calm of future leaders, that the line had gone on a walk because it had been sitting too long, and the mother nodded like someone happy to be taught by their own offspring and then bribed her with a biscuit for being delicious.

At night the copycats got bored because the fog did not flatter them and the cameras ate their outlines with hunger. Noor caught one alone and tired and unwilling to run, and she talked to him long enough that he began to see himself as an individual and not as a man in a picture with three others, and that is the beginning of every reform anyone has ever sat through without clapping. She told him his boredom was a luxury, and he blinked as if she had removed a comfortable coat he hadn’t realized was stolen. She told him there were brushes at the hall and that paint does not ask questions but will tell on you later if you use it for harm, and he said he would come and then did, because life is sometimes satisfying on Wednesdays.

When Cath finally took the ticket from the coat it felt less like leaving and more like honoring a dare you had talked about for too long in kitchens and then not done. She went to the station the way a woman goes to a new hairdresser: braced for disappointment, fully prepared to apologize for her own hair for no reason. The machine gave her a destination this time because that is what machines do when you ask, and she chose a town downriver because she liked the logic of rivers and suspected they communicated behind the backs of maps. She stood on the platform with the coat behaving and the jar with the chipped lid in her hand and the blue on her shoulder making the day a fraction easier to carry, and she waited for the sound that would give her an excuse for her feet to move. Mara did not arrive because this was not that kind of movie, and Noor did not because she was at the hall teaching a child how to draw a fish with shoulders without getting scolded by the laws of nature; instead, the army man appeared with a sandwich wrapped in greaseproof paper and held it out and said, in a way that made both of them laugh, that trains don’t feed you properly anymore unless you’re rich.

“You’ll come back,” he added, and he did not make it a question because that would have put a weight on her she might have disliked. Cath took the sandwich and took the kindness with both hands and said she would come back if the wall needed a line she hadn’t taught it how to draw yet, and he said walls always need lines they haven’t learned and people too, and then the train came and did its Freudian thing of standing for both departure and arrival. She stepped on and found a seat that did not argue with her about whose field of vision belonged to whom, and she put the jar in her lap like a sleeping animal, and she looked out the window at the town that had stopped being only a story she could haunt and had become a place with people who would miss and then get on with it, which is the cruel bargain of living in public. The doors shut with the musical authority of good civic engineering, and the train took her, which is what trains love to do when given half a chance.

The town did not hold its breath, because towns cannot, but something like breath held the town. The fog lifted with the air’s innate vanity and pretended it had not been curious about anyone’s business. The parish hall smelled like tea and drying paint and an argument that had been shelved lovingly for later. The wall kept its blue like a promise and did not ask to be thanked; it asked to be looked at, which is different and harder and does not always come with sandwiches. Mara stood at the bridge and put her hand on the pillar and felt only stone, which, for once, felt like a gift. She said, because there are words that have become, for her, a way of keeping her neck straight, that she would stop her, and this time the sentence meant she would stop other hands from making cheap versions of a hunger because they liked the noise panic makes in their own ears, and she would stop herself from taking credit when the work belonged to a dozen stubborn women with pens and chalk and kettles and proper shoes.

At dusk the camera caught nothing but bats. Noor walked home and counted the permission notes as if counting sheep and laughed at herself when she reached ten because she had always disliked domesticated arithmetic. Poppy went to bed with her towel cape near enough she could reach it if the night asked her to be a superhero and far enough she would not strangle herself in a dream; in the morning she would tell her class that later had been purple and green at once and no one would argue because she had learned to speak in complete sentences with gravity. The vicar wrote a sermon about doors and tore it up because it sounded exactly like the notes he had not written, and he decided instead to let the choir sing something with too many alleluias and not enough patience. The pearly-cardigan woman bought a new cardigan and told the mirror she would only use it for meetings where kindness was required to look like policy.

When the first postcard arrived it was not a postcard but a ripped piece of cardboard from the back of a pad, and on it was a color that did not know its own name yet and a circle with a line through it that could have been a river or a throat. It had no words because Cath had learned not to waste them when pigment could do the job, and because writing itself had begun to feel like a lid. It smelled of damp and something like coin but not coin, more like a story about metal told by a river that preferred gulls. Mara held it and put it next to the notes and the ribbon and felt the three and the fourth sit together like a family at a table where the cutlery was mismatched and no one apologized for that. Noor came in and looked at it and said the color was not one she had met in the town yet, and that this pleased her like a teacher discovering a child had invented a grammar that worked.

The copycats got bored, and then they got jobs, and then one of them wrote a paragraph in an application about the time he had scrubbed a wall and been made to feel like he belonged to it as a citizen, and the person reading the application did not laugh and gave him an interview, and then he got to wear a high-visibility vest that made him think of himself as lit. Rafe sent a box of acrylics back to the shop with a note that said sorry and ten pounds and the shopkeeper put the money in the till and thought about the nature of apologies you can buy and decided not to be clever about it because sometimes moral clarity is an expensive spice. The army man started sleeping better and stopped walking past the memorial at dusk with his jaw clenched, which no one noticed except his dog, who relaxed a degree and became the kind of animal you could trust with a child's sandwich.

On a Friday that behaved like a Monday and would have gotten away with it if not for noon’s insistence on existing, Mrs. Hargreaves found a handprint on the parish hall door at shoulder height, in a blue none of them had seen before, and she stood there with her hand almost on it, the way people do when they want to be touched by a thing without becoming it. She left it there because it gave the door a face and because a woman who arranges nativities knows the difference between mess and sacrament and which one makes the better story when told over sherry. The townspeople learned to come and go under that hand like people passing beneath a lintel in a house they had not built and were now responsible for heating, and every now and then a child jumped and tried to match it and failed, and laughed, and was told, not unkindly, to try again later when their arms knew more.

Nobody closed it. That was, for a while, the most anyone could ask.
