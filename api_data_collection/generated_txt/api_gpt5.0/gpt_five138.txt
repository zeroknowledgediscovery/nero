The ferry came in under a lid of cloud so low it scuffed the cranes. Grey gulls turned and turned again over the harbour like hands searching a coat they’d lost, and the cold slid in through the seams of Di’s jacket and down her spine. She had a paper cup of coffee that had gone lukewarm and bitter, and she kept it because she needed something to keep. That’s what she thought, anyway. Hold the cup, hold the morning together.

They had sent her ahead because she could pass through places without drawing the usual attention that a detective inspector drew. A youngster from Helsinki, newly seconded from the office that wore its modernity like a clean shirt. She was supposed to watch and listen, ask a few careful questions of an artist who had made a name painting nurses, the kind of gentle scandal the papers liked to chew. Nothing more complicated, her supervisor had said. She heard the echo of his voice even now, in the slap of rope against a cleat: Please, Di, do not make this complicated.

She got off the ferry and walked up the quay and the city breathed around her in smells of diesel and kelp and the faint sugar scent of bread from somewhere unseen. It wasn’t her city, but it was familiar in its winter melancholy. The streets had names she mispronounced and old stones that weren’t impressed by her badge. The gallery was three blocks up from the docks and had a door painted the blue of a bruise. Inside, the light was good in that expensive way: even, without warmth.

The woman there said her name was Carla. She was taller than Di, and wider across the shoulders, and she had a way of dragging each word a half-beat late, as if it weighed something that could be taxed. Her hair was the colour of dry bone and she had hands with a dusting of paint that never quite washed away. Her smile was a careful arrangement.

You’ve come to look, Carla said. To look is fine.

I’m curious about your work, Di said. She made her accent lighter, smoothing out Helsinki’s hard edges. She had learned a long time ago that some conversations went better when people decided you were almost like them.

They walked together between stretched cloth and frames. Nurses turned their heads from the walls with that look that nurses get, the one that says they’re waiting for something to happen but they’ll be there when it does. White uniforms without faces, in some. In others, the faces were all there but something else was missing. The hands, maybe. Or the shoes. There was a lot of attention paid to the shoes.

I see you like a uniform, Di said, and Carla laughed.

A uniform is a promise, she said. It says I’m not here for me. People love a promise that doesn’t involve them doing anything.

Do you have… models? From the hospital?

Sometimes. Commissions. She lifted one shoulder. Sometimes there is a face that tells a window story. That’s what I paint. I catch it before it shuts.

Di stood in front of a canvas that had a hallway in it, fluorescent lights buzzing. The nurse in the centre had her gloves half-pulled on and her eyes fixed on something outside the picture plane, as if the painter were behind her, or the exit. In the lower right, a pair of shoes were set neatly against the wall. It was unsettling. The light was wrong in a way that made her imagine longer corridors than the paint allowed.

How old are you? Carla asked, like she couldn’t help herself.

Twenty-six, Di said. She let it lie there like a coin on an empty plate. People always had a reaction.

So much work in a small box, Carla murmured. She didn’t look at Di when she said it. She looked at her own paintings, as if addressing a child.

It wouldn’t have been anything but an odd visit in a foreign city, a police officer blowing through a gallery and staying long enough to make a story, if Di hadn’t walked through the wrong door. She needed a bathroom and her nose found the rawer smell at the back where the office was. She pushed the door that didn’t close properly and found a room that had shelves along every wall, glass upon glass, and her coffee dropped to the floor with a soft, embarrassed thud because her hand forgot what it was doing.

The light through the small window fell across the jars and across what floated in them like thought. Not gore, not horror bought for a cheap thrill. Something else. They were pale and careful, like wax castings. Like somebody had wanted to capture how a life stood on itself. Toes, arches, ankles. A dozen at least, a makings-of dozen more. There were labels written in a neat hand that didn’t smudge: dates, initials. Di reached for the doorframe to hold herself in place.

You found my museum, Carla said behind her, and there was no surprise in it. Some doors don’t like to stay closed. I am always meaning to fix that one.

Di made a sound that was supposed to be a question but came out as a cough. What is this.

Preservation, Carla said. History. The past does not hold itself. People think the past is a thing that sits and waits. It forgets, like anything else. So I help.

They look real, Di said, and the room blurred at the edges for a second.

Carla stepped past her, big and patient. She set her hand on one jar and straightened the label. Real is a funny word. This, she said, and her finger tapped the glass, is something I have, and something you see. Between those two, what more do you want.

Di tugged herself back together. She’d seen worse things, but what this was did not have a name she wanted to use. She made her face a little colder. She made her voice a little more official. We have laws.

A rueful look, as if they were both embarrassed for the world. We have laws, Carla repeated, and then she sighed, and the sigh had a weight to it that might once have rattled cutlery in a cupboard. I do not take what is not given. That is my law. Also, I take payment when it is owed. That is my other law.

Your other. Di seized on it. Greed, she thought—there it was, the pulse under the paint. A collector’s hunger wrapped in art language. An ogre, she thought, the word rising up from old books her grandmother read by the stove, monsters who kept things they didn’t need just to know they could keep them.

You have a face like you are throwing a coin in a well to see if it makes a wish, Carla said, amused. Don’t. It will only splash.

There was a sound in the corridor. Light, brief. Di turned her head reflexively, and something small and white flicked across the doorway and was gone. She could have said mouse but the movement had had a different quality. Rabbits, a word rose up, unhelpful. She remembered the old dock with its broken boards and weeds, and the way a rabbit once had sat in the snow outside her Helsinki apartment building, in that thin, electric winter, watching nothing with enormous patience. She hadn’t told anyone because it felt like telling about a dream.

You have… pets? she said.

No, Carla said. Messy. I do not keep things that chew. She had that little backward smile again, secret and not secret at all.

Di left the jars with care and let the door swing almost closed behind her. In the gallery, the nurses watched her again with that expression that wasn’t one. She looked for other signs now. She found a small tuft of white fur caught under a baseboard where a frame leaned. She didn’t touch it. She straightened, she asked for water, she let Carla make clinking glass sounds in the kitchen, and she looked at the invoices tacked on the corkboard with the casual gravity of someone who will say she didn’t see anything if asked later. There were names she recognized—hospital administrators, a charity with a glossy brochure, a private clinic—but nothing wrong in black ink. Nothing is always nothing until it isn’t.

We’re planning a night opening, Carla said. You should come. I paint better when the weather is bad, and the forecast promises a night to remember.

Di smiled, because her mouth knew the piece and played it without thinking. I’d like that. She counted to five while she stood still. Then she breathed and left, and the cold took hold of her again like a friend.

On the quay, gulls shouted their only joke. A man humped a crate of fish and did not look up when he passed. A boy with that particular club of adolescence in his shoulders leaned against a pole and watched everything and nothing. He had a white paper bag, grease already making that telltale transparency. Out of the corner of her eye, Di saw a small animal move along the shadow line of the warehouse and vanish into a clump of old pallets. Not a rat. Not a cat. A flick of ear, a suggestion of back feet. Not possible, she told herself, and then immediately corrected it: entirely possible. Everything that happened did so with the complicity of clouds.

At the hotel she bought a notebook with a cover that pretended to be leather and wrote the word ogre on the first page. It looked silly there, and she almost crossed it out. She drew a box around it instead, as if that would make it belong. Then she wrote: nurses, uniform as promise. Feet in jars—legal? Gift? Bribe? Story? She put a question mark after each, and then, reluctant and bored with herself, she wrote: rabbits? and added a second question mark because she didn’t believe it and didn’t not believe it and the extra punctuation seemed to split the difference.

She called Helsinki and spoke to her supervisor while looking out at the line of cranes like creatures that had stopped to drink at the mouth of the bay. She gave the polite version of events. He made agreeable noises in the pauses. Are you well? he asked.

Fine, she lied. The window glass hummed in a wind that wasn’t there. She drank a mouthful of warm tap water and the taste of metal reminded her of childhood.

At night the city changed its face. The gallery opened its door and the bruise-blue paint shone under the lamps, and people shed their coats and their voices lifted. Di put on a dress she didn’t like because she didn’t have the right one with her. She stood among strangers with the art and she watched the room the way a lifeguard watches a public pool. It was a useful place inside her where she could go and stand and not think. She heard a woman say, I love that she takes something so clinical and makes it… human, and another woman say, My sister would kill me if I bought a painting of her in uniform, and a man say, You can smell the disinfectant, it’s incredible. Carla floated through, laughing, her big hands touching shoulders into place. She was one of those people who were loved because they knew how to make other people feel like they were the only one in the room, until they weren’t.

A nurse in real life stood by a canvas of a nurse in paint and tried to look as if she was not doing exactly that. She had hair tucked up under a cap and a quiet face that looked like it hid an emergency exit. Di put herself next to her and let the conversation find them.

Do you like it? Di asked.

The nurse considered. It seems as if she has just put on her shoes, she said. Or has she taken them off.

Does it matter?

It’s not the same feeling, the nurse said. She glanced at Di as if assessing whether she was the kind of person who knew there were different feelings. Even so, it’s true.

What’s your name, Di asked. She always asked names. It made people real and that helped.

Ilona, the nurse said, and then laughed. You’re Finnish, you already know what it means.

Light, Di said, and the room did not get brighter but it felt like it could have.

They were interrupted by applause that wasn’t for anything real, the way rooms of art applaud because sound is energy and energy makes itself. Carla stepped up onto the low platform that held a sculpture that was deliberately bad so you would talk about it, and she raised her hands as if she were pulling the night closer. Thank you, she said, drawing out the vowels, making it a toast without a glass. Thank you for being here to look. That is half the work, and I appreciate employment.

Polite laughter, hungry.

I have been thinking of promises, she said, and a murmur went through the crowd because promises is a word that tastes good in the mouth even if you spit it out later. A uniform is a promise. Art is another. Money, god bless it, is a promise in chopped leather. We live on these. Tonight, I give you another: I will show you what the city keeps under its nails. I will show you what it discards and what I keep. No fear, only clarity. Everyone wanted to clap when they were told they would have no fear, and so they did. Carla bowed and her hair fell forward, and for a moment there was an impression that the light around her had to bend. It could have been a trick of the lamps. It could have been a trick of the eye.

A white shape moved along the edge of the platform. Not a napkin, not a dropped scarf. Di’s breath paused. It came and went too fast, and when she turned, Ilona was looking down at the hem of her skirt with a puzzled expression as if something had brushed her ankle.

In the kitchen, where she wasn’t supposed to be, Di opened a door and found a cold room where the smell of something sweet and medicinal wrestled quietly. There were more jars, here a different sort. They held nothing she could name, and that was worse. She closed that door. She opened another. This one was a pantry with shelves of glasses, a coil of rope left in a careless nest. The rope had been gnawed at one end. She bent, touched the frayed fibres and pulled away a single thread. She looked around for a cat bowl, a bag of feed, anything that would make a small thing eating rope ordinary. There was nothing. The pantry had a floor of old wood that had known too many feet. There were small droppings in the corner like punctuation, neat, round, almost tidy. She stared at them because somehow this felt indecent.

You look like you’ve lost your way to the front of the house, Carla said, appearing without having approached.

Di wiped whatever had been in her face away. I was looking for a bathroom. That door stuck, she said, pointing vaguely. I think it would be difficult for guests.

Carla’s eyes did a kind of counting. She saw the rope. She saw the droppings. She said, sometimes the wind comes through in this old place. Things fall. My assistant is no good with knots. She made it sound like a joke, and everyone in the world is trained to laugh at the right point in a joke, especially when they are somewhere they want to be asked back.

I could recommend a good knot, Di said. Her voice was light. A clove hitch, or better, a constrictor knot. It is difficult to untie.

Carla’s mouth did that slow move again. You’re a useful one, she said. Everyone should keep one of those. She reached past Di and took the coil of rope, testing its weight. There was a small smear of something on the back of her wrist. It could have been paint. It could have been a lot of things that are like paint.

When Di stepped outside to breathe, the street had emptied. Parties always look full until you are by yourself next to the trash bins and the lace of your breath is visible. She stood there and watched her breath and thought about feet in glass and labels that didn’t smudge and the old story of an ogre with a hoard, a narrow bridge, a clause that had to be paid. She thought about Helsinki winter light, so white it makes its own paper. She thought about rabbits, because once you start, it’s not as easy to stop as you expect.

A movement at knee height near the shadowed alley made her head turn faster than was dignified. She held still. A rabbit hopped out as if this were a perfectly ordinary place for such things. It sat, and its ears went up in that way that sometimes reads as alarm and sometimes as a kind of listening you will never be capable of. It made a small, decisive bite at the air. Then it hopped twice, turned as if to go, and turned again to watch her. It did all of this with an economy of motion she envied and found irritating. If she took a step towards it, it would go. She did not take a step.

Under the streetlamp, its eyes were dark and reflective. It had a pale nick in one ear, as if something had almost happened to it and then selectively decided to leave. There was a mark along its back she could not name, like smudged graphite.

She crouched, because people tell themselves that getting lower will make wild things love them, and she knew it wasn’t true but she did it anyway. Hello, she said softly. Rabbit, she didn’t say. That would be foolish.

The rabbit twitched. It shifted, looked toward the gallery’s back door, looked back at her a last time, and went. She could have followed. She did not.

Inside, the nurse named Ilona was standing in front of a picture of a nurse named nobody, and her face had a pinched look that wasn’t quite pain. Di joined her again because she had liked the nurse’s name and the steadiness she carried around like a wrapped gift.

Are you all right? Di asked.

It’s too bright in here, Ilona said. But she did not leave. People do not always take the steps that resolve the thing they say. They stand inside their own sentences and shrug.

We could go outside. I know a place where the sky is less crowded.

Ilona laughed a little and shook her head. It’s not the sky. It’s… she hesitated, and then, as if the words had to step over something on the floor, It’s the paintings. They make me feel as if I have already done something I have not yet done. As if I am tired before I start. I know that sounds foolish.

No, Di said. It sounds like you need a day where nothing startling happens.

Do you get those, Detective? Ilona asked, and Di didn’t remember telling her what she did for a living and then remembered that people notice things as a hobby.

Sometimes, Di said. Often enough to make me suspicious of them.

Ilona nodded as if that made a kind of sense, and then someone called her, and she was gone into the crowd and Di was alone with the painted nurses again, the ones who promised and promised and didn’t give you a thing you could hold.

The night thinned. People left their conversations stacked on tables, gathering coats, gathering faces. Carla hovered, hands empty now, with a satisfied look like a cat at a window in winter. Di went to say goodbye because it’s polite to greet and polite to close, and in the space between those two politenesses, things are often revealed.

Thank you for coming, Carla said. Did you see what you came to see.

I saw what’s here, Di said.

That’s something, Carla said, and then, in a quieter voice that arrived with no escort, Have you ever been hungry in a way you could not feed. There are things you cannot buy enough of. All the money in the world is a thin soup. She looked for a long moment at nothing, as if she could sense the emptiness where a story could be put. Then she shook herself, and smiled like she had caught herself napping, and put her hand, briefly and carefully, on Di’s shoulder, as if steadying a picture on a wall. Take care, she said.

The street had rearranged itself when Di stepped out. The wind had come up and paper skittered, and somewhere a shutter knocked against itself. She walked back toward the hotel with her collar up and her mind running along its rails. She passed an alley mouth where the smell of cabbage was thick. She stepped over a white feather and then she looked back at it, and it wasn’t a feather at all but something else small and pale, a piece of a glove, perhaps. She didn’t pick it up. She made herself keep going. The trouble with curiosity is that it behaves as if it doesn’t know what happens next.

She dreamed that night of a corridor filled with a clean light that wasn’t cheerful, and shoes lined up along the baseboard like punctuation. She dreamed that a rabbit sat in the middle of it and that its eyes were black as if ink had fallen in them. The rabbit turned its head and she saw something it carried in its mouth that was not grass and not a leaf and not a string, and she woke up and lay very still, keeping quiet as glass.

In the morning, she went to the hospital because she liked to start at places where things begin, and hospitals are two-faced in that way. She walked through foaming antibacterial smells, past notices written in a language she could read if she didn’t hurry, and she found a door that said Staff Only and a window where sunlight tried and tried. The head nurse was a woman who had the comfortable body of someone who liked food and was never allowed to sit down. She had a name tag that leaned alarmingly. She had a voice that could cut through a flood.

We have no time for the police, the head nurse said before Di had finished saying she was the police. We have patients and we have forms and between these two things there is no daylight.

I understand, Di said calmly, because she had learned that pushing got you less time than waiting. I only have a couple questions. About art.

This threw the nurse just far enough off her lines to let the conversation be possible. Art? she said, as if the word were a prescription she had not written.

Carla paints nurses. She makes money. She says she doesn’t take what isn’t offered. That’s not a question, but the nurse answered anyway.

She has a way, the nurse said. Some of us sat for her. Most of us refused. There were rumours. There are always rumours and I have no budget for rumours. The nurse’s eyes flicked around the room, catching small things that were off and setting them right without moving. People pay her for the pictures. People pay for many things I cannot afford to think about. You want to tell me what you’re actually after, Inspector?

Feet, Di said, carefully. And the way she said it made the word softer, less alarming. Preserved. Collected. Is there—are there— She stopped and started again, because the sentence kept objecting to being made. Would anyone have given her something like that. For a museum.

The head nurse stared at Di for a long time. Then she looked down at her hands, which were busy with a paperclip they had picked up without meaning to. We send to the medical school, she said eventually. We send to the fire. We send to places where a piece of a person is used to help another person. We do not send to a museum. We do not send anywhere with names attached. Not ever. Her voice had the weight of a thing that had been said a thousand times but still needed saying.

Di nodded. She was not satisfied and did not try to pretend. If I were to ask around—informally—

The nurse made an expression that might have been annoyance or might have been approval in a different dialect. You will do what you do. I will be here, holding the line while you are elsewhere. That is our division of labour.

A man in scrubs brushed by and dropped a handful of plastic key tags. They skittered and fell under chairs and into corners. Di bent and picked up one. It had a small picture of a rabbit on it, the kind printed in an attempt to make even utilitarian objects friendly. She handed it back, and as she did so the back of her hand brushed the varnished corner of the desk. There was a little sticky spot where a label had been, removed. She wondered what it had said. She wondered too much.

On her way out, in the corridor, a nurse came past, the real kind, shoes squeaking, and she carried a tray with a jar on it, and in the jar there was something that could have been tissue or could have been a cloudy nothing that hospitals and galleries both know about. The nurse didn’t look at Di. Di stepped aside and let her pass. The light through the jar made a pale pool on the floor as if it had dropped a piece of the moon.

Outside, snow had started in the faintest way, undecided and intermittent. Di thought of Helsinki, where snow knew its business. She thought of Carla’s hands. She thought of the rabbit’s ear. She went to a café and ordered coffee and bread and sat with her notebook and wrote down what felt like too simple a list: Carla, gallery, jars, nurses, Ilona. Rope, droppings, rabbit. Head nurse. She made a line after each like she was building a ladder she would have to climb when she was tired.

At the next table a man was reading a newspaper that had a picture of Carla on the cover, and above it a headline that said Collector of Angels. Di laughed aloud at that, a small dry sound that drew the man’s glance. He did not seem to mind being caught admiring a headline. Who doesn’t collect angels, he said, as if talking to the room. We all take what we can. He sipped something with cinnamon in it and made a satisfied face. The paper fell open further and there was a photograph of a nurse whose face had been blurred because that made it more mysterious. The article quoted Carla at length, and the sentences were generous and carefully shaped into meaning. We keep what we cannot bear to lose. It’s a kindness, she had said, or had been quoted as saying. It was the kind of line the world would keep.

Di put her cup down too hard and coffee leapt onto her notes, making the rabbit into a brownish cloud. She didn’t dab it. She watched it spread and fade and settle. She put her hand over it and felt the warmth.

On her way back to the harbour she took the longer route through a stand of trees that looked thrown up by something impatient, and she saw, as if she had conjured it by thinking too hard, a rabbit sitting and doing nothing. This one had no nick in its ear. It had a piece of grass in its mouth and it chewed at exactly the pace of a clock that was running ten minutes slow. She stopped. It didn’t care. It lifted its paw, precise and delicate, and washed one ear, then the other. Behind it, in the shadow under the hedge, something shifted. A second rabbit, maybe. Or maybe the idea of one. She stood there longer than she intended to, and when she finally walked on her feet were cold in her shoes and she had the nauseous sense you get when you know you are being watched by something that will never tell you why.

In the gallery that afternoon the door was locked, a sign hung skew-whiff that said Closed for breathing. Di peered through the window and saw the nurses looking back like a choir without a song. She didn’t knock. She walked around the building and looked up, counting windows. A small one at the back was cracked open, too narrow to be useful. The lower edge of its paint was gnawed away in a neat semicircle, as if by small, determined teeth. She stood on the wet ground and thought: this is ridiculous. Then she thought: this is the bit where ridiculous becomes the door you must go through.

She didn’t go through. She went to the station and she filled out the form that said: I would like to search. The man at the counter had the bored solidarity of all men at all counters. The form was long. She filled out the part that asked for cause. She wrote: suspicion of possession of biological remains without legal documentation. She did not write: rabbits. She did not write: ogre. She did not write: hunger.

The man stamped the form as if he were blessing it with a heavy hand. Come back, he said, as if she had left. She smiled at him because her face knew how.

At dusk, Ilona called her. That was strange, because Di had not given her number to anyone but she remembered that people like Ilona always knew how to find the person who had asked them questions. I can show you something, Ilona said without introduction. If you come now. I will be off the ward in five minutes. Don’t come in the main entrance. Go around to the back where the dumpsters are. It’s not pretty, but there is a door.

Di went, because that is what she does. The snow had given up and gone to sulk. Behind the hospital, lights hummed and the smell of trash was not as bad as it could have been, which is faint praise but true. Ilona came out in a sweater that had threads coming loose at the cuff and with her ID badge turned backwards. She held a small cardboard box in both hands.

What is it, Di asked.

I don’t know, Ilona said honestly. That is why you are here. I found it in the supply closet behind the old autoclave. Someone had slid it behind a crate of gloves. It would have sat there until mice found it. But we have no mice in that closet. We have traps. We have a schedule. And yet.

She opened the flap. Inside was a jar. It had water in it, or something like water, and in the water was a foot. It was small, like a child’s, but not a child’s. No, not a child’s. The nails were painted, neat, precise, a pale pink like gum. There was a label. A date. Two initials. The handwriting was exactly the same as the handwriting in Carla’s back room.

Ilona’s hand shook, just a little. I don’t think this belongs here, she said. I don’t think it belongs anywhere.

Di took the box from her, gently. No, she said. But here it is. She felt a kind of calm that she had learned to mistrust. It came to her sometimes like a false weather. It made you think the path was obvious. It made mistakes. But sometimes it also held you steady enough to cross the brittle bit of a bridge.

We will put this back in the box, Di said. We will take it somewhere it cannot be lost. We will do this quietly, for now. She did not say aloud that suddenly the city, this not-her city, felt like a place where someone had been leaving little neat parcels for someone else to find. She did not say that if she were to furl this thread and pull, who knows what would come along with it, fingers, promises, the odd little bounce of a rabbit in the corner of your eye.

Ilona looked at her in a way that told Di that she was being measured and found just exactly tall enough, no more, no less. I am not brave, Ilona said, as if that were the thing that needed most to be put in the air.

Brave is a verb, Di said. We do it. Not be it.

Ilona made a face that might have been confusion or gratitude. She moved a step closer, as if by accident, and then away again almost immediately, the way someone will when they remember the world. You will call me, she said, and it wasn’t a question.

Yes, Di said. She closed the box. The cardboard made a soft wordless sound. The jar inside sloshed as if it contained a small sea, or a small sudden decision.

On her way back to the hotel, Di walked past the gallery and stopped with the casual solemnity of a person who is trying very hard not to be a person who stops with casual solemnity. The blue door was very blue now, and a single light burned somewhere in the depth, not a room, not a hallway, not quite anywhere. She stood there and felt the weight of her own foot through the sole of her shoe and the pull of gravity making its case and the small human miracle of not falling over while standing still. The rabbit came then, or a different rabbit, or the idea of one, and it sat directly in the middle of the street where it could be no one’s business but everyone’s, and it watched the blue door, and its nose pulsed, and then, without doing anything so crude as running, it was elsewhere, which is a thing you learn how to do only if you live long enough to grow ears like that.

This is nothing, Di told herself firmly. Then she did the mean thing we do to ourselves and added, you are making it something because you are alone. Then, finally, the truth that lives beneath both scoldings: it is something, and you are alone, and you will still do it because that is the assignment.

In her room, she lifted the jar carefully out of the box and set it on the desk. She wiped the outside with a towel, and then with a second towel. She folded the towel and laid it next to the jar. She wrote the initials into her notebook and sat for a long time in the chair that was never meant for long sitting. She did not call anyone. She did not sleep. The city made the small noises cities make. Somewhere a siren started. Somewhere it stopped. Somewhere, on a floor that wasn’t hers, a shelf creaked. She put her fingers on the glass and then took them away. She thought of water, and of thumbs, and of jars, and of that last look the rabbit had given her as if it were asking her to consider—what? That all the stories she had grown up with were not jokes. That monsters rarely look the way the illustrations insist. That sometimes the treasure is not what you think it will be. That sometimes there is no treasure at all, only the habit of wanting.

The night had the length of a long corridor, and she walked it with all the care of someone carrying a thing you must not drop, even though your hands are shaking and your feet do not want to go forward anymore. The morning would come. It always does. It comes whether you ask or not. It arrives with its list of errands. It insists you choose which doors to open and which to pretend are sealed. It shows you the creature sitting in the road and refuses to tell you if it has been there all along.Chapter 3

Morning arrived grudgingly, like a clerk unlocking a door he didn’t want to stand behind. Di watched the light come up through the slice of window and did not touch the jar again. It sat on the desk with the difficult composure of something that had been told it now had a role in a larger play. When she finally stood, every motion felt deliberate, as if the night had written instructions into the muscles. She wrapped the jar in the towels, then in the hotel laundry bag, then inside the cardboard box again, because even pretending at precautions sometimes keeps your hands from shaking. She took a photograph of the label and zoomed in until the initials were coarse white strokes and the curve of the date blurred into something like a horizon line you can’t cross.

She didn’t take it to the station straight away. The station would make it official and official would bend the whole business into a shape she didn’t yet understand. Instead she went downstairs and asked the desk for the safe, and the man with the glossy hair and the bored politeness led her to a back room with a low ceiling. She slid the box in and watched it vanish into a numbered compartment with the irrational hope that numbers would behave better than people. The man closed the door with a clack that sounded like a small verdict. She signed where he pointed. The pen felt heavier than it was.

The hospital had the morning shift change smell, which is to say you could taste coffee and rubber and something antiseptic that sits at the back of your throat and thinks about whether it will make a life more bearable or less. Di signed herself into the visitors’ book because she liked people to know where she had been when there would be questions later. Ilona had left a note for her with the porter, and the porter had the face of someone who had heard every reason anyone ever had for needing what they wanted. He tipped his head toward the elevators and said, second floor, end of the corridor, left, and then, as if an afterthought he couldn’t quite keep to himself, the rabbits have been at the bins again. He said it with the phlegmatic tone of a complaint one is fond of because it returns reliably.

Di looked at him in the friendly way that asks for more without insisting. The porter snorted softly in a voice that was mostly nose. You laugh, he said, pre-empting her, everyone laughs. They’re bold as you like, broad daylight or near enough, and you can put down pellets and traps and they will nod and step around them like old men avoiding puddles. They like the soft things. They pull the gauze right out if you leave a door. One of them took a roll of green tape in its mouth last week and set off across the loading dock dragging it like a bride, and no one could leave because you shouldn’t step on a roll of tape while you’re carrying a person, and there we were, waiting on a rabbit to be reasonable. He did not sound as if he suspected that Di had a reason to be listening so closely. He sounded like a man who had found a story that made his mornings less like the previous ones, and he wanted to show it.

Ilona met her by the vending machine that had a little plastic revolving thing inside that spun like a spell. She had slept, or she had not, and in either case her face had a softness that made Di think of snow under streetlights. They went to a little room with a sink and a poster of hands washing other hands, and Ilona sat on the edge of the desk as if it were a rock by a stream and watched Di read through a photocopied list. It was amputations for the month, which is a sentence that looks like it belongs in the wrong book. The list was dry where the jar had been wet. It had columns and initials and dates, and one of the dates was the date on the jar.

M.K., Di said.

Mara Kesti, Ilona said before Di could ask. Diabetes, infection, the whole sad chain. Lives alone above the fish shop on Kapteeninkatu. She is the kind of person who knows all the weather names and will tell you every one of them while you change a dressing. Ilona’s mouth bent in not quite a smile. I liked her voice. It made the ward sound less like itself.

Did she consent to… donation? Di didn’t say the word art because it made the air silly.

She consented to disposal in accordance with regulations, Ilona said, because that is the line that always prints. She didn’t sign anything more interesting. But she is a person who gifts things when she has them, like those wrapped candies that taste of bark, so it wouldn’t shock me if she thought someone could use a foot better than a furnace. Ilona watched Di’s hand tracing the line on the spreadsheet. Be kind to her if you go, she added, as if kindness were a skill Di might forget she had.

They went together, because leaving nurses behind is how mistakes begin. The fish shop had a low door with a bell that sounded apologetic, and the air inside was cold even for a winter city. A boy behind the counter looked up with the unearned authority of youth and said, she’s upstairs, as if people had been going up and down all morning, which they probably had. Di and Ilona climbed carefully, as if stairs were a species that could take offense, and emerged into a room that had plants in odd containers and a table with a top made from the seam of an old door. Mara Kesti sat in a chair by the window with her stump resting on a pillow that had a pattern of birds in a color that made Di think of old postcards. Mara’s hair was the grey of morning ice, not dark yet, and her cheeks flushed and cooled while they looked, like a kettle debating.

She saw the badge, or the posture, or simply recognized the profession that carried itself up hills. She nodded as if to an equal, which was generous, and said, if you have come to tell me what you have found, you should have brought bread. Words sit better with butter.

We can fetch some, Ilona said, and meant it, but Mara waved her hand the way you wave at dust.

It is not a house without bread, but this is not a house where bread is urgent, she said. Why do men always send young women to do their walking. Her eyes were sharp and mild at once. When Di sat, the old chair under her made the exact sound of a hauler straining a line.

Mara’s foot—or the absence of it—sat between them with a private dignity. Di put her hands on her knees and met Mara’s gaze because that was the price of any answer worth keeping. Did you give permission for it to be taken, she asked, and the quiet in the room felt proper, not empty.

Mara considered, looking out over the street as if the answer were about to drive by. We are not so tidy as to ask permission from what we no longer carry, she said after a moment. But if you mean, did I let the piece of me go before I was done with it, yes, I suppose I did. It was a heavy thing by the end. You let go of heavy things because you are tired of lifting. Her hand went to the blanket and patted at it as if making a bed that had not learned how to lie flat. You want to know if someone asked me for it, as if it were a loaf. Someone did. Her eyes did not leave the window. A woman asked, the big kind, with hands that had forgotten how to make a fist. She came with paint on her fingers and a way of speaking that made the day slow down to hear. She did not ask until after, when I had already slept in a new length, and I told her the truth: I have never kept anything well. I break plates and lose scarves and misplace the names of dogs. You may take the piece of me I have dropped if you can make it useful. She laughed at me. It was not unkind. She said, usefulness is a lie we tell to stop believing we are selfish.

And did she offer you anything in return, Di asked, though the answer was already leaning toward them.

A picture, Mara said, as if it were obvious. One of me when I was still the shape I had been so long, so I could put it on the wall and pretend I would not turn my head and step off an old habit. Or money. Money was in the conversation, a pale thing, embarrassed by its own voice. But I did not want the picture. It would have made the room smaller. I told her she could owe me a favor I would not collect. She said, that is the only kind of favor. Then she went away.

Ilona had not expected the conversation to go there so neatly. She shifted and the chair made the sound of an old ship trying to remember how to be a tree. You saw no one else, she asked softly. No one with a box.

You want the part with the rabbit, Mara said, and smiled with one corner of her mouth. People always do. I sat in this chair and watched a rabbit sit in the dustbin lid for an hour, like a saint on a plate, and then it went away. Later, there was a scuffle in the hallway, as if small paws were thinking through a problem. In the morning, something had worried the fiber of the doormat into a neat little circle, like a bird’s idea of a nest. I found a bandage there, rolled tight. And that is all. People leave signs when they try to be silent. It is a comfort to believe we can be read.

Di let the smile come and go because it didn’t belong to Mara; it belonged to the strangeness settling around all of this like fog. She thanked Mara and rose, and Mara caught her hand and looked one more time in the direct way of women who are done with apologizing. If you are going to shame anyone for what they kept, make sure you have first counted what you yourself hold with both hands, she said. Everyone is an ogre where bread is concerned.

On the street, Ilona breathed like a person who had been holding a door that wanted to swing shut. She touched her sleeve with the fingertips of her other hand, a small calming trick. I don’t know if I helped, she said, as if she had offered a fork to someone eating soup.

You did, Di said. You kept me from deciding too early, which is a kindness rare as a warm winter.

They parted at the corner because work waits in particular places with its arms folded. Di walked toward the station with the not-heavy feeling of a woman going to introduce a truth to a room that would not thank her. She retrieved the box from the hotel safe because keeping secrets in institutional furniture turns out not to make them lighter, and she took the long way along the water because sometimes you have to let your legs decide how to put the day together. The gulls were tearing at something on the plate of the quay with relish. A rabbit sat on a coil of rope and watched the gulls eat, which seemed impolite and entirely reasonable.

At the station, the man with the stamps raised an eyebrow at the box and did not ask, probably because he knew that anything left unasked would sooner or later make a noise. She filled out the chain-of-custody form and did not look at the line that would require an explanation that did not embarrass her. The officer in charge of evidence was a woman with calm hair and a voice like a road that had been recently resurfaced. She labeled the jar in a way that managed not to blame it for existing. When Di asked about the warrant, the woman pointed at a tray where papers sat like slices of bread that had to be toasted in order. She will approve it after lunch, she said. If she has lunch. If she likes your signature better than she liked mine yesterday, which she might, because you are new and she is bored.

Di went back to the gallery with the printed piece of authority folded in her pocket and the knowledge that paper is only ever as sharp as the person holding it. The blue door looked as if someone had recently wiped a hand across it and left a clean streak. Inside, the air was close, and the expensive light seemed tired of being even. Carla was not in the front room; her assistant, if that was what she was, had acquired a name badge that read VERITY that probably did not belong to the life she had before this job. Verity looked at the paper, looked at Di, and then shrugged in a way that could be pasted onto any circumstance. She said, she’s in the back, like you were asking where the salt is kept.

The door to the museum-room was shut this time, and it had been fixed in the expedient manner of people who dislike trouble: the latch had a new shine. Di handed the paper over and Verity made a face that said she had once promised herself she would never be the kind of person standing between people and cupboards. She stepped aside in a ritualistic way, as if obeying an old charm, and Di pushed the door.

The shelves were there and the glass, and the light that made everything look a little like a mistake. But the jars were not the same arrangement as yesterday. They had been moved, or replaced, or perhaps Di’s eye was rearranging itself. Two shelves were naked wood, with the imprint of circles where glass had long stood, and on the other side new jars had been set with a precise, recent haste. The labels had a conceit of orderliness, but in the corner one lay face-down like a card someone had turned in the wrong game. Di took out her phone and photographed without dramatics, corners and all, like a tourist who wanted to remember everything and would forget the important parts anyway. Verity stood in the doorway as if the light might refuse to leave the room if she walked away. She chewed the inside of her cheek in a rhythm, as if practicing a scale.

Carla spoke before Di heard her approach, which meant she had moved like a person who has learned to map a floor with noise. Inspector, she said, and there was a pleasantness to it that would have made an apology for you if you asked for one. Her hair was up in a knot that had pinned itself without needing help. I was about to call you, she said. That was the first lie, and Di admired its poise.

We found one, Di said. Hospital. Closet. Dashed-off sentence, the kind that refuses to put on evening wear. It belongs here or it belongs nowhere, and either way it does not belong in a place where interns can mistake it for a jar of beans.

Carla looked at the shelves as if they were a choir that had missed a note. That is none of my practice, she said. I am exact in my thresholds. I am particular about the manners of a gift. I do not leave things in corners to be discovered by accident. She put her hand on a jar and did not move it, as if touching it qualified as restraint. I do not take what is not given, is the line you remember me saying, and you will say, yes, but who is giving, and to whom. If it helps you to stand up straighter tonight, you may decide that I am a receptacle for guilt and offcuts. It will make me briefly useful to you. But then you must go and look at the city, Inspector. It is a mill. It grinds. The product goes somewhere.

Verity made a small sound, not at any of the moral freight, but because one of the rabbits had stepped neatly into the room and stopped under the lowest shelf as if arriving for an appointment. It was the kind of ordinary rabbit that there is no reason to remark upon, and yet. It looked at Di and then at Carla, and then back at Di with a patience that daylight seldom induces. Its fur was coarse near the haunch, and its eye reflected the room and all its mistakes back into itself. Carla sighed as if someone had knocked a spoon off a table and then said, shoo, but she did not lift her foot or throw a cloth. The rabbit went nowhere. It simply rotated and showed them the other half of its symmetry, which is a trick animals know and people forget.

They stood there a moment longer like a set of figures in a cautionary tale that no one tells their children anymore because it might teach them something useful. Di put the paper down on a shelf and it looked stupid there. She said, I spoke to Mara Kesti. She believes you have paid her in a favor you will not be asked to deliver. Carla’s mouth did something unfamiliar, a tiny stutter, as if the word favor did not fit in its usual place.

She told me I could owe her, Carla said, without any of the triumph some people carry into such sentences. I said yes because it was the oldest grammar. You are thinking that such a debt is easy on the debtor. Perhaps it is softer where it touches the hand. It is not light. You may not believe this, but I am kind sometimes. I prefer debts I can feed.

Di turned so she was no longer looking at Carla and was looking, instead, toward the little high window with the gnawed edge. The paint flakes had been swept up, or had never been there, or had convinced her she had imagined them. Outside, a gull landed on the ledge and peered in with the expectant look of a tourist who has been told there is a show and it is late. If someone is moving your jars, she said, it is either because you have trusted the wrong person or because the mechanism you rely upon has begun to rely back.

You have a way with engines, Carla said, amiably. Verity laughed without sound and then, finding herself ridiculous, lifted her hand and covered her mouth as if the laugh might be contained and used later. Carla looked at her with a tenderness that did not last. I do not mind the rabbits, she said. I mind the hands that feed them sugar cubes and tell them where the carrots lie. There are always hands. She stepped back and the heap of her shadow fell across one of the shelves and made the jars look like small moons. If you plan to take, take and be done. I will stand here while you decide if your paper has courage.

The evidence officer would have scolded Di for the way she looked at the room and made no immediate moves. She thought of Ilona’s careful shirt cuffs and Mara’s neat-eyed patience and the porter’s bride tape snaking sunlight across the loading dock. She thought of the boys with their fish crates and the gulls with their single, stupid joke. She thought of the rabbits walking through the city like small benign thieves who do not know what property is. She took three jars whose labels matched dates on her list and set them in the tub she had brought because she was a person who brought a tub for jars. She photographed the empty circles they left like absences everyone had anticipated. She signed Carla’s copy of the paper and the copy for the station and the copy that no one would read. She did all of this without talking because words were too available and too cheap.

As she left, Carla said, Inspector, in a tone that made the corridor hear its own echo. Di turned and Carla was looking at her with the weary affection of someone who has recognized an animal at a window and has decided not to feed it. If you pull long enough at any string, you will arrive here, where I am, she said. I have built a very small throne in a very small room. It has only ever controlled the light in its own corner. Do not confuse that with power. Do not imagine the queen of rabbits, it will make you laugh and then the laughter will stick in your teeth.

Outside, the weather had chosen rain that wanted to be snow and thought better of it. The tubs in her arms made her a shape people stepped around and then remembered to look twice. On the sidewalk, one of the rabbits crossed her path at a slight angle and paused to lick its paws, as if washing itself after touching something that did not agree with it. It finished and then tipped its head sideways and stared at the tubs and then at Di, and if she were the kind of person who would have said aloud what her head was doing, she might have said, am I being read, and not liked the answer.

The evidence room took the jars with brisk professionalism. The officer with the calm hair labeled, started a log, made a phone call to a pathology consultant who would arrive in the afternoon with detached phrases. The bored man stamped something gratuitously because stamping is a pleasure that people who cannot act indulge. Di asked to photograph the labels under better light and the officer pointed to a lamp that had obviously been used to interrogate both glass and men. The handwriting, enlarged, was the same as the hospital box. The initials repeated themselves like a song you hear at the market until you know the chorus in spite of yourself.

She called Helsinki and said less than she meant. The supervisor listened with the patience of someone whose coffee had gone cold at least as often as Di’s had. There was a pause and then the sound of paper being turned, not because anything was written on it that mattered, but because gestures make sentences feel dressed. He said, proceed carefully, and Di said, of course, and both of them knew that careful is sometimes what you call it when you cannot afford to be honest.

From the station she walked to the hospital again because people who are lost return to the last place they were sure they knew. She went around the back because Ilona had taught her that back doors are where people put the parts of the story no one visits. The dumpsters were not as offensive as they could have been, and that fact was somehow what made the rabbits believable. On the slab of concrete by the service entrance, she found a line of small marks in a dried puddle. They were not prints in the way ink makes you think of prints. They were more the ghost of a movement, barely insisting on itself. A roll of gauze lay under a stair, unspooled by a foot that did not weigh much. A single glove finger, as if cut from its body, lay there like a worm.

She sat on the step because sitting is sometimes what calls thinking out of its sulk. A man in a stained apron came out and lit a cigarette and looked at her with the indulgent cynicism of older men who have seen enough young people taking notes to know that the world will not be fixed today. He smoked like prayers were still taught in schools and you could do one or the other. He said, you’re with the gallery, without making it a question, and Di shook her head, and he added, same difference. He flicked ash in a neat line and said, used to be cats. We fed them scraps and they took the rats, and then someone said health codes, and the cats went and the rabbits came and now we have no rats and also gnawed cords and no peace. Do you mind if I do this, he asked, indicating his cigarette too late for it to matter. When he left he put his foot exactly on the place where the marks cut off, and Di watched his sole carry away whatever softness the ground had been generous enough to hold.

She found Ilona in a break room where the chairs committed the quiet crime of being too low for the table. They shared tea with the guilty relief of people who know the world expects more of them in a minute. Ilona told her about a patient who had decided to live and then changed his mind and then changed it back, and how the room had celebrated all three decisions because that was the trick with rooms. Di told her about the jars and about Carla’s analogies that sounded like apologies until you listened for the hinge. They were quiet then, and the quiet stayed.

When Di walked back to her hotel in the early dark, the city felt like a deck that flattens under your feet and lifts when you are not looking. In the lobby, the man with the polished hair was practicing his smile in a reflection of the check-in screen. She went upstairs and found her door not quite closed, as if someone had tried the handle and changed their mind or as if the building, that old honest liar, had shifted its weight. She pushed it with the heel of her hand and it swung in without drama. The room smelled of nothing that should not be there, and everything that should was in place. The jar was not on the desk. Of course it wasn’t; she had it at the station. Even so, she stood there waiting for the relief to arrive fully, to sit on the chair and stay. It didn’t. She went to the window and looked down into the street and saw the blue cut of the gallery door in the next block and the skim of something pale across the gutter as if a pipe had coughed up a ribbon.

She slept because exhaustion is often righteous and never negotiable. She dreamed less. In the morning her phone had two missed calls from a number she did not know and one text that said, you will not like this, which is one of those phrases that will do for almost anything. It was from Verity, who had apparently decided she was a person who made things known to the police now that there was paper in the world. Di rang back and Verity spoke at once in a level voice that suggested she had practiced the lines in the mirror. Someone was here. Not a rabbit. A person. They asked questions about last night. They had keys that fit nothing in our building and then fit everything else when they wanted. I do not like their suit. I do not like their certainty. I will be in the café two doors down with a drink I do not wish to be drinking. If you come and speak to me, it will look like a mistake and that is the only way we will get away with it.

Di went because there is no other answer when the day pushes a hand between your shoulder blades. The café had plants that were all one shade off the color you think leaves are supposed to be. Verity sat with a cup that had foam making a heart and a face that had decided hearts were not trustworthy shapes. She said, they asked about what had been taken, and I do not mean you. They asked as if the room itself belonged to them and we had trespassed by arranging it differently from their memory. One of them said, this is a collection and collections are subject to review, and then he smiled the way a person smiles when they have all the words they will need and you have only the smallest ones. Verity’s hand shook and she put it flat on the table to disrespect the tremor. If you did not take those jars, he said, they are gone already, and he said already like a door closing. Men and women came with large respectful bags. They put on gloves. It looked more like a museum opening than anything we have ever done.

Who, Di asked, because sometimes the smallest words are knives.

Verity shrugged one shoulder, an unhappy bird. I did not ask for credentials because I am not that brave before noon. The card said a department with three words and a crest. He put it away before my mouth could make the wrong sound. He touched the wall where your paper had scratched it, and he made a face as if the room had upset him. I wanted to throw something and instead I drank my coffee too fast. She looked at Di as if asking permission to be afraid. If things disappear into men like that, do they ever come out again, she asked.

Sometimes, Di said, because there is comfort in a generous lie when what you are actually offering is the poor truth. She thought of Carla standing among her moons and telling her that the throne was small. She thought of the porter’s bride tape making new lines on the day. She thought, not for the first time, that the city is a mouth and you have to be careful about what you put your fingers near. She stood then, because sitting had stopped helping. Do not go back to the gallery for an hour, she said. Walk. Pretend you are someone else. Feed a rabbit your anger if you have to. It will chew and not be harmed. Verity nodded like a person who had been given an impossible assignment and appreciated the respect in it.

On the quay, men were shouting about nothing essential and making it sound as if it mattered terribly. The cranes had their heads together like conspirators. A rabbit sat underneath the bronze statue of a sailor who had not actually looked like that, and it flicked one ear with the practiced elegance of the bored. Di felt the day tip. She went to the hospital one more time because you go where the seams show. In the long corridor where it always smells like yesterday’s soap, she saw a small square on the wall where a plaque had been removed, and the glue had left a tacky shape like a missing tooth. A nurse went by with a tray and did not notice that she had a pen tucked behind her ear that was leaking.

Ilona found her in the staff stairwell because stairwells are where people consent to what they have already decided. The head nurse wants to know what we are doing, she said, and it was a sentence with more meanings than there were people to hold them. Also, the porter swears he saw a man with a can of blue paint sit down in the loading dock and write a name you will recognize on a crate, in careful letters. They took the crate away while he was on the phone trying to decide who you call when letters bother you. Ilona’s breath made a white fog that called itself tiredness. We could set a trap, she said, and then laughed at herself for using a word that belonged to a different conversation.

We will set something, Di said. It will not be called a trap. Names are how people forgive themselves. She looked down at her shoes, which had salt lines on them where the water had dried. For a second she thought of the little neat shoes lined along the painted baseboards, and then she stopped herself with the practiced cruelty of professionals who know when thinking becomes a vice.

At the hotel, there was an envelope at the desk. Her name was written on it in the neat hand that had labeled the jars, as if handwriting could cross thresholds without the hand. Inside was a card, heavy stock like a business doing better than yours. On it was a sentence. The sentence said, I take payment when it is owed. Under that, a time and a place: the old ferry pier, midnight, bring no one who apologizes for a living. She held the card and felt a muscle in her forearm jump as if remembering something heavy. She put it back in the envelope and in her pocket and did not say, of course I will go. Some doors you arrive at by telling yourself other stories entirely, and that way the step can be what it has to be when you take it.

She went to her room and sat on the edge of the bed and tied and untied the constrictor knot in a length of hotel laundry line she had bullied out of housekeeping. It held like it was supposed to hold. It was difficult to untie, like it was supposed to be difficult to untie. She thought of rope in Carla’s pantry and of small teeth and of which part of a knot a rabbit would prefer. Then she set the rope aside because the night was coming with or without it, and she would need her hands for other shapes. She looked at her notebook and the box she had drawn around a silly word and she shut the cover because there are days when you don’t improve a thing by looking at it too long. Outside, the weather had finally decided on snow, thin and precise, like handwriting you needed to learn to read. The city put on its winter face and Di, in her jacket that was very nearly warm enough, went down to meet the promise it had decided to keep.Chapter 5

The old ferry pier wore snow like a grudging habit, thin and provisional, more gesture than season, each flake deciding separately and arriving late. From the promenade the boards looked black where feet had polished them, silver where they had cracked, and where the tide had thrown its breath up, ice had stitched itself along the edges in a seam that wouldn’t last. The cranes out beyond the mole had turned their heads away from the land, as if embarrassed for it. The water below the planks moved in a slow, muscular way, as if thinking was a physical act. Di stepped out onto the pier and felt the give in the wood translate itself up her shins. It was a place built to take weight and to ask a price for the privilege. Her breath hung in front of her, and the cold found its usual shortcuts into cuffs, between buttons, through the place at the back of the neck where even sensible people forget to guard.

She hadn’t brought a flashlight because bright, directed light sometimes makes a place angry. She carried her hands in her pockets not because of the cold but because hands look better when they are not performing ambition. In one pocket was the length of hotel laundry line tied into a knot that politely refused untangling. In the other was the card, the heaviness of it multiplied by the knowledge of the hand that had written her into place and time. The wind pushed the smell of the city down the length of the pier and mixed it with kelp, old boat, the metal tang of the bollards themselves, the ghosts of fish. Somewhere a gull laughed to itself, pleased again by the one joke it would not stop telling.

Carla was standing in the angle where the pier widened out at the end, a big shape that didn’t need the assistance of light to be present. She had a coat that made its own weather and a hat that ignored the opinion of the wind, and from ten paces away you could smell paint on her as if she had been in a room working and had not bothered to wash her hands for the benefit of the night. When she turned, the bones of her face registered first and then the rest caught up. She didn’t lift a hand; she didn’t have to.

You came, she said, and her voice made the planks a little more honest.

You asked, Di said, and the sentence formed its own breath in the cold.

Carla looked past her toward the city as if counting its windows. I was not sure if you knew the cost of refusing someone who has your handwriting in her pocket, she said mildly. Some refusals are lighter than others. She gestured a little with her chin toward the water, in a way that would have made sense to a gull. This is where I come when I need reminding. Bridges teach arithmetic, but piers teach faith. You will want me to hurry, and I will not, because we have a payment to agree and because haste is how people injure themselves on simple objects.

Di stepped closer until the grain of the wood had its own separate smell. She had spent the afternoon talking herself around to several different brave things and finding all of them either pompous or beside the point. The card in her pocket had settled the argument with the sentence that didn’t pretend to be anything other than what it was. I take payment when it is owed. She had thought at first that the debt was imaginary, that it was the way people with appetites invented justification, like putting a napkin under a stolen glass. By dusk she had begun to suspect the debt was hers and not imaginary at all. What do you want, she asked, and was surprised at the relief in her own voice.

Carla smiled like someone whose favorite song had started up in another room. We will walk first, she said. It makes your questions less sharp and my answers less polite. She set off along the length of the pier, her boots making a sound the boards recognized. Di fell into step at her shoulder and looked down between the planks where ice had made fretwork over black water. In one of the slats where the crews had once pried up old nails and put in new, a tuft of white caught. It might have been a scrape of rope. It might have been fur. When they walked past a mooring ring the size of a dinner plate, Di glanced and saw teeth marks on the short tie-line hanging slack there, not the rough tear of a knife but the steady work of small, patient mouths.

You use them, Di said, because it felt foolish to pretend she hadn’t seen it.

I allow them, Carla said. If use is a word you need, use it. I try not to keep anything that makes its own rules. They come because the city does not care if they live or die and because I do, within reason. They take this to mean I have secrets worth guarding. They are wrong and right. She tapped her finger against the railing, and frost dusted away in a small sigh. As for payment, I will not ask you for your jars. They were never mine when they were in the room and they are not yours now that they are in your room. I will not ask you for a name you do not have yet, though I would like it when you do. I will not ask you for your foot, because your work requires that you go up and down stairs unassisted. The world has made a joke of too many women’s mobility. We need not help it.

Then what, Di said, and did not try to keep the impatience out of the word. She had learned to be careful with her temper because it often mistook itself for clarity.

A story, Carla said simply. One you have not told, or one you tell only in a version that flatters you. It is coin that spends well here, because it cannot be returned and because it is worth something to both of us. You will think this is indulgent. It is not. It will allow you to stand in a place with me where the floor is suspect. It will fund my trust enough to tell you what is under the pier that should not be, and what men in crests think they own. It will also please me, and that is part of the economy. She looked at Di sidelong and her mouth moved in that private way it did when she was about to give something heavy a joke to carry. You may keep your jacket on while telling it; I am not a monster.

Di considered telling the shallow version of three harder things and then recognized the cowardice of that, like cutting bread thin and calling it enough. Her first case wanted to be told because it made her sound capable and put the mess on other people’s desks. The story of the boy pulled from the river wanted to be told because it would explain to strangers why she disliked blue plastic tarps. The rabbit in the winter outside her building wanted to be told again because it was a neat circle and would save her having to hand anything of substance over to anyone. She looked down between the planks and saw her breath condense in a false fog. Then she said, because you do not feed monsters by feeding them, when I was thirteen my mother left and I believed it was because my feet were too loud.

Carla did not make the mistake of sympathy. She waited, and in that waiting there was a kind of courtesy rare enough to deserve notice.

We lived in a building where everything spoke, Di said, aware of how absurd that sounded in the air and not minding. The stairs told you how much they had worked that day, the neighbor’s radio told you what time his favorite program started by the way the volume climbed, the pipes shouted in winter like old men at a bus stop. I grew into my bones all at once and I had a pair of boots I loved that were red where other boots were brown, and when I ran I didn’t lift my feet the way the silent girls did, I let them slap, because I felt something good leave the ground and return to me. My mother would say shh in a voice that made you the kind of quiet that hurts your teeth, and then one Thursday she stood in the kitchen with a bag that was not for groceries and said, you are breaking my head. She pushed her hand at me as if moving a plate you were finished with. She left with the bag and the neighbor’s radio turned up just then, the song he liked, and the pipes chose that day to bang and the stairs complained like a ship. For a year and part of another I walked in a way that made no sound except to me, and I still felt loud. It took longer than it should have to know that she had meant herself. She had meant the weather in her own head. She had meant everything but me. Meanwhile I learned to move in rooms without drawing any notice, which is a profession, as it turns out.

Carla’s breath went out in a shape that could have been satisfaction if you were the sort of person who misread generosity for appetite. That will do, she said. It taught you to pass for light and to be heavier than you looked. It made you think your feet owed the world something. It is the kind of thing that collects a person around a core. She put her palm flat on the rail. The metal recorded a print that would leave when the next piece of weather came. I am paid, she said. Now I will earn. Come.

At the very end of the pier, where a newer repair met the old planking with a seam that carpentry couldn’t hide, a panel lifted the way a trapdoor lifts in a theatre when the effect is believable but not dangerous. The trick of it was in the extra hinge built for salt and tiredness and in the way the weight of it had been calculated so that a woman alone could raise it without looking as if she had trained to do so. Beneath, the black made itself persuasive. The water touched the pylons in that intimate way it has with still things. A ladder dropped through the square, the rungs worn like the spine of an often read book. The first three had frost across them in a lace that would not survive a foot. Carla tested with her boot heel as if asking permission and then set herself on the ladder and looked up with that same inexplicable domesticity with which she had once straightened a label on a jar. Come, she said again, and then she went down out of the night.

Di hesitated only in the space that was required if you wanted your legs to remember something later about care. The cold clung to the metal and translated itself into her hands. Halfway down she smelled the harbor up close and then another scent beneath it, faint and infuriating, the clean sour of disinfectant and the softer, sweeter thing it tries to beat. At the bottom, the ladder disappeared into a slat of uncertain ground. It was not a room in any sense a building inspector would recognize. It was a curtained space created by the sloping geometry of the pier’s undersides and by the skins of water, light, and shadow that hung there. Every surface was slick or salt-furred. Further back, where the pylons had been doubled for strength, somebody had wedged pallets into planes and made a floor that did not ask too much of you if you asked little of it. And there, on that precarious platform, were crates.

They were the big, stupid kind that always look as if they are protecting something important simply because they have the right corners. Some were newer, with straps that had not yet grown cynical. Some were old and had given up on the idea that they might travel to interesting places. All had paint on them, either the old stencilled names or the new handwriting of men who enjoyed claiming. On the nearest one, fat little letters in a careful hand said, REVIEW, and under that, in smaller script with the edges of the paint still wet-looking even in this light, was a name. Not Carla’s. Not Di’s. A name that would mean something only in a corridor or on a whiteboard. ILONA, it said, and Di took an involuntary step, a betrayal of the floor’s tolerance.

Carla’s palm landed on her arm with enough weight to be considered faith. Look before you decide what you are seeing, she said, quiet as waking a child. The names are how they frighten us into comportment. They label a thing with a person and make the person feel already inventoried. They seldom mean the thing contains what the name says. It is a trick with blue paint and ink. It is also a test, to see who will run. They will learn us that way, they think. She crouched and slid her fingers under the crate’s edge and tugged slightly. It didn’t move, because men always think a heavier object is more honorable. She laughed up her sleeve and added, the porter at your hospital saw the paint, yes? Good. He told the story in the right direction.

The rabbits were there. Di counted three, then four, and then revised the number because they do not obligingly sit still while your eyes inventory them. They moved like punctuation, coming where a sentence needed breath, gone again before grammar could call them by name. One crept along the outer ledge where the slush had made a skin and tested it the way a person tests the trustworthiness of a chair by pressing their palm. Another sat on the pallet edge and performed that particular ritual of cleanliness on its paws, precise and devout. Each time it lifted its face, its whiskers stuttered in the draft and its eye collected the ladder, the woman, the dark, and gave none of it back.

You asked to see what the city keeps under its nails, Carla said, moving from crate to crate with a familiarity she did not show to any room with light. You did not know that you were asking to see what the city gives up without noticing. The crates come because someone likes paperwork more than sleep and because they have made a shape called a unit and fitted people into it like knives. The unit does not believe in private museums unless it runs them. It has three names, and a crest to make the second name feel noble. I have no quarrel with classification as an idea. You can spend a life making shelves less cruel. But here, now, there is a joy they take in their capacity to collect. They will tell you collection is protection and perhaps sometimes it is. It is also hunger, like mine, and theirs is hungrier and less honest.

Di put her hand to the side of a crate and felt the damp suck at the wood. There was a sound below her of the water remembering to be tide. She could not bend and pry and still pretend to be only a listener. So she did not pry. She said, what is in these.

Cloth, mostly, Carla said. Gauze, tapes, drapes, soft things. Protocols. Forms. Things that could be burned without making a noticeable smell. Sometimes jars. Sometimes gloves in rolls like white tongues. Sometimes nothing but their own importance. She pushed a toe against the corner of one box and it wobbled in place and then did not. See how the lines are gnawed, she said, and Di looked and saw it: the sharp, tidy scallops where teeth had gone through a strap in a place a knife could not have reached. They think in straight lines and we think in corners. It is a small advantage. Do not mistake it for a strategy.

Di crouched because crouching made her feel less like a person standing in judgment and more like someone with a useful amount of curiosity. There was a mark on one of the pallets, a smear you could eat if your life were desperate and the sea had nothing else to give you. It was the hospital’s unkind sugar, the residue of something sweet meant to be bitter, the caramel that tells you syrup and disinfectant have met. The world of rooms was here in the world of tides and no one had bothered to keep them apart. The rabbit nearest her stopped washing and did the thing that always looks like prayer and is actually vigilance, paws carried close to chest for a moment, and then it dropped them and chewed air as if tasting a thought.

They come when the tide is right and bring a boat that looks like any other boat, Carla said, and her voice lost its manners and spoke plain. They do not knock. They do not submit to inspection because they have invented a word that means inspection, and it belongs to them. Out there where no one bothers to watch because the cranes are sleeping, they take things named and unnamed and put them into a hold that is very clean. If it comforts you, sometimes they throw things overboard because they are boring. The city collects these things. It is too embarrassed to admit that is what it is doing. The rabbits watch because that is their nature, and because watching is how you live long enough to breed in a place where men like to set traps that only work on complacency. She bent and slid her fingers under another crate and made a face at its arrogance. Help me, she said, and Di set her hands where Carla’s were and together they shifted the box enough that light from a gap in the planking above could do its poor work.

Under, wrapped in a plastic that had not been made for kindness, lay a line of shoes. You could call them that. They were hospital things, soft and white, molded to a shape of foot that did not belong to anyone particular. Some had been worn and cleaned and worn again until the material gave up and lay down. Some were new enough that the laces had not decided which way they preferred to lie, but whoever had packed them had tied them to one another in pairs with a knot that had made up its mind about permanence. There were labels. Dates. Room numbers that were meaningless out here, in the dark. Someone had taken a blue marker and written the word UNSAFE across the side of a bag, and someone else had then crossed out the UN and written HAND in a different color, a joke or an insistence. The rabbits did not look at the shoes. They did not care. Shoes belonged to a human fuss and rabbits did not wear them.

It is not a crime to wish to keep a record of work, Carla said, and Di heard the plea in it and the confession. It is a crime to imagine that your record is the world. I take what is offered because I am greedy and because otherwise the person who offers has no place to put their offering. The world makes a fool of them and I am a better fool. They take what is not theirs because they have decided they are the only people who can be trusted to take anything at all. It is a piety with teeth.

The cold crept up Di’s wrists because kneeling on damp wood invites any weather under your shirt cuffs. She pushed the crate back the necessary inch and made her body stand. The ladder looked further away than it was. Out past the end of the pier a boat moved with that confident economy that comes from knowing who owns the water tonight. It did not have its lights running in a way that would withstand a lecture. It did not need to. The snow made a softness of its outline and of the men on board, and everything became less particular without losing any of its intention.

You wanted payment, Di said, her voice steady not because she wasn’t angry but because anger makes a mockery of precision. I gave you one. Give me mine. Who writes the crest on the card. Who tells the porter what to ignore. Who writes Ilona’s name on a crate while your back is turned. Who is taking your jars when I am not the one taking your jars.

Carla’s mouth did an unbeautiful thing she seldom let strangers see. She collected herself the way women collect themselves when they do not have another choice at the moment and would like the dignity of deciding when one arrives. They call themselves the Heritage Rehabilitation Unit this week, she said with a disdain that landed without apology. Last month they were the Cultural Materials Tasking Office. The crest is the same; the shape of the letterhead changes. They were born of someone’s allergy to anything that might be called a private keeping, which, if I am specific, means they were born out of a quarrel between men in a ministry and men in the boards of old museums. They do not know what to do with flesh. They would like it to be a category that behaves. They prefer paper. They have discovered that naming things poorly is a method of control. They have a man in your hospital who likes forms and dislikes nurses who tell him what to do. They have two women at the freight office who enjoy refusing to be hurried and who are very susceptible to the suggestion that a crest makes a crate heavy with the nation’s dignity. They have nobody at my gallery, and so they came and pretended they owned it until I made a noise they were not expecting. She smiled, showing the part of her teeth that wanted to bite. Even that is not the heart of it. The heart of it is this: they have discovered that they can make you and me spend our hours on the business of keeping or stopping, and while we are doing that, the city goes on grinding, and souls go in and out of the wards, and you have less time than is kind to write a letter to anyone saying this: we failed, but not at the things they will accuse us of.

Di had to lean into the conversation to stay inside it. The boat edged closer, not because it meant to be menacing but because night and tide had decided on that convenience. From under the pier, sounds rose that the planks above would tame: the slap of water on a new beam, the click of something small thinking about a corner, the heavy wet breath of lines moving against each other under strain. A rabbit nosed at her shoelace and found it uninteresting. She stepped back and almost put her heel into a gap and corrected with the gracelessness that keeps you alive. If I asked you to give me a name and a title I could print on a line and have stamped in three places, would you, she asked, and in her own voice she heard her mother say shh to things that had earned their noise.

No, Carla said. Because the name will be a man’s and he will be replaced by another, and the stamp will be a stamp and the paper will be used to line a box that I will find under a pier. Because I am not your kind of useful and tonight I have used up my courage for telling truths you cannot paste onto an order. But, she added, seeing the way Di set her jaw like a tool, he is in a room with green paint and a row of clocks that have all been set to the wrong time on purpose, and there is a rug with a pattern that wants to make you fall, and he is the sort of person who practices being the only one in his building who is not tired. He will have a title with Director in it because men like that sound. He will call you by your last name and then by your first, and he will give you coffee that does not apologize for itself, and if you are very lucky he will not make a joke. She looked at the crates without affection. He writes in blue because blue looks official to people who have never had to paint a door twice.

The boat nudged the pilings with an unembarrassed thump. There was the nicking of a hook against metal and then the careful gush of a line thrown and caught, the small grunts of people whose bodies do that for a living and who are too bored to give each other orders aloud. Carla’s shoulder went up, down, the gesture of a person who knows whether a style of arrival is usual or not and has decided that this one is neither but will pass. She put her hand on the crate marked ILONA and patted it as if comforting a foolish animal. She will not be in there, she said quietly, because she is busy, and people who are busy are more difficult to pack.

They climbed. The ladder was meaner going back; ladders often are. At the top the pier took them back like a shore takes back its tide. The snow had made an effort while they were beneath the world. It had settled on the hats of the bollards and on the ropes, and it had begun its neat work on the footprints of gulls. The boat out beyond the end shifted and settled a rhythm. A man near the bow looked toward the city and then away again. From under the pier, the scuttle and knock told Di that whatever bargain the rabbits had with the world was being kept without her help. She stood with her hands on the rail and her breathing sorted itself into the kind that did not show.

You will want to arrest me and also to pity me, Carla said after a moment in which the cranes made the noise cranes make when they remember they are skeletons. Do neither for now. Write in your book that the jars you took will not make anyone nicer. Write that the men with the crest will make themselves busy until someone tells them there are photographs to stand in front of. Go to the room with the green paint and the wrong clocks. Take a rabbit with you if you can manage it, which you cannot. She put her hand in her pocket and brought it out with something small and pale and unreasonably clean. It was a shoe, the kind a newborn’s foot pretends to fill, white and soft, with a bow that someone had tied once with two fingers, and inked on the inside flap were two letters that made a name and did not. This is a lie, Carla said, because it has never been worn by the person whose initials are in it. It is a courtesy I sometimes extend to people who do not know how to leave a room. If you must, you may return it to me when you have learned why I would have it. Or you may keep it and be ashamed of that. I will accept either. She held it out as if offering a sweet to a child who had no business taking sweets right before bed.

Di did not put her hand out for it at once because you do not let a person like Carla make your decisions for you while your blood is still filament-hot. Then she took it because it was ridiculous and because ridiculous things have rescued her as often as serious ones. It was light enough to be nothing and just heavy enough to be present. It had the faintest smell of talc, or of a drawer that had once held talc. She tucked it into her coat where the card had been. It did not change the shape of her. She thought of Ilona’s name in blue on wood and of the head nurse’s hand worrying a paperclip and of Mara’s neat birds on the pillow and of Verity with the foam heart she did not trust. She thought of her mother in a kitchen that had not gotten any smaller for becoming empty.

The men on the boat called to one another in the idiom of people who own weather in pieces. The sound came with the cold and went with it, with nothing to catch on. Carla lifted her chin at them like a neighbor who does not care for your choice in fences and will tell you so while borrowing your hammer. Then she looked back at Di and let her mouth be kind without insisting. The rabbits will take care of the crates we want, she said. They have very firm opinions about corners. The rest will go into the city’s memory and be lost or found on a day that suits someone else. Go see your man. Sleep not at all or all at once, whichever makes you less stupid. And, she added, as if returning to a detail that pleased her, your feet are none of this. They are instruments; treat them as such.

On her way back along the pier, Di did not look down between the planks, because you can want too much from an image and then you have to live with what you have taken. She walked with the muscle memory of a girl who had taught herself how to leave a room without making the tableware scold. The snow heaped itself and slid away and returned. Halfway to shore she stopped, because the rabbit with the nicked ear was sitting in the direct middle of the path like an appointment kept. It looked at her and then at her pocket, at the place where the ridiculous small shoe sat under fabric, and then it did the slow, generous blink that animals perform when they have decided not to die immediately. She nearly laughed. The sound of that laugh would have brought the boat around, would have brought men to the edge to see who was impolite in the cold. Instead she put her hand in her other pocket and found nothing of use except the poor knot and her fingers, which she would need.

Back on the street, the gallery door was a bruise against the whiteness. The hotel’s lights finally earned their existence, yellow without apology. She walked with ILONA, written in wet letters, translucent now, impressed somewhere behind her eyes. The card in her pocket had nothing more to say. In the lobby the man with the hair had changed into a different expression without changing his face. Upstairs, the room had kept to itself. No one had moved her cup on the table; no one had examined her rope; no one had decided to be a myth in the night. She set the little shoe on the desk and looked at it. It looked back with the perfect blank authority of objects we pretend are innocent.

She stretched out on the bed without believing she would sleep. The ceiling believed it could outwait her. The night discovered its stiffness and then wore through it. Somewhere a sound like a soft animal moved in the wall, or in the air, or in the world. She held still and tried not to say shh to anything, even in her head. When morning came, it would ask for names and for coffee and for her coat. It would ask for directions to a room with green paint and wrong clocks. It would require boots and a willingness to see something without telling herself first what it was called. It would ask, again, for care. This time, perhaps, she would have enough to give it.Chapter 7

Morning made good on its threat and came in bleak and efficient, a ledger in the sky with no room for a flourish. Di laced her boots with the care of someone preparing to walk into a story that would insist on thinking of itself as a room, and she stood for a moment with her hands on the small white shoe as if it might tell her the precise angle at which to tilt her head so that the day would behave. It was absurd, tiny, the bow off-centre in a way that declared the knot was tied by affection or haste, and it had the faint smell of a drawer with folded linen, a cleanness so old it had learned to be patient. She put it into the inner pocket above her heart because that is where people in books put talismans and because sometimes using the wrong rules is better than having none.

The building that housed the green room and the wrong clocks had an address that told a story about history that was at least half invented. It had a facade that wanted to be dignified and mostly achieved implacable instead. The crest over the door had been redone at some point by somebody who liked an honest line, and the glass in the entryway was the modern kind that never fogs and never cracks in interesting patterns and has never known the satisfaction of being re-puttied by a glazier who tells you about his brother. Inside, the smell was of toner and floor polish and an orange cleaner that had never seen an actual orange. The reception desk was a trench lined with pens on chains, and the woman behind it wore a badge that declared her to be a gate with a name, and her smile said she did not mind being a gate because the view was satisfactory.

Di showed her card, the one with the badge that said I am allowed to ask questions and the photograph that said yes, that is the face that goes with this voice. The gate took it with the care you give something you intend to take away, typed with two fingers that moved like conscious animals, and said, second floor, end of the hall, green door, which was the kind of generosity heavy with amusement. As Di walked away, she felt the woman’s look travel with her like a ribbon laid behind, a faint drag, the kind you notice only because you have trained yourself to notice when something has decided you are its entertainment.

The hallway was long in the way that says someone once thought it would impress, and now it simply wastes time. The carpet had a pattern so intricate and without rhythm that it made your feet argue with your eyes, and the walls were painted that institutional green that had learned to call itself tradition. The wrong clocks began four doors in. There were six in a row, each a familiar face with a differently misbehaving minute hand, one a deliberate hour off, one hesitating between marks the way a cheap compass trembles over north. They were set high on the wall the way pieties are hung when you hope height will make them true. Di looked at them long enough to be sure they were wrong on purpose and not out of neglect, and then she returned her gaze to the green door and to the pattern that wanted to carry you sideways.

He was the kind of man who makes a point of standing when you enter and then does it in such a measured way that the politeness becomes a policy. His hair had gone to grey without thinning and without the vanity of colour, and his jacket fit without drama, which is a trick that costs money and self-awareness. He smiled like a man who believes his teeth are part of his argument and said, Inspector, and then, after the briefest pause in which he made a decision about how the next part would go, he added, Di, in the tone of voice you use when you have decided intimacy is a shortcut to victory.

She did not correct him. She took the coffee because refusing it would have been a kind of thesis and she had not come prepared to submit one. It was good coffee, brutal without apology, and the cup was heavy in a way that told your hand it was being taken seriously. The rug was an old thing with a pattern from somewhere warmer and older, and it did want to tip you if you stopped trusting it. The green paint was not a novelist’s green; it was the kind of green old surgeries used, the kind that assumed humility would be free if you rubbed it into the walls. The clocks were here too, the same wrongness, the same studied disarray, and they made the air move in a way that said time in this room would be a negotiation.

He introduced himself last, after the room, after the ritual objects, as if his name were only one of the tools he meant to use. Director Kaarlo Riikonen, he said, and it was a name that thought background noise would do as well as context. He extended his hand, and it was the hand of a man who signs things without waiting. There was a pen lying on his desk, and it was not just blue, it was that weighted bottle-blue that insists it has gravity on its side. There were no personal photographs. There was a small plant that was either dying ostentatiously or thriving in a manner difficult to love.

We don’t often have visitors from Helsinki, he said, as if Di were a holiday, as if holidays were inconvenient, and she filed the line in the place she kept false hospitality. He gestured toward a chair that had been designed to make sitting in it feel like an accomplishment and folded himself back into his own seat with the assured movement of a person who knows the legs won’t betray him. You’ve come about an overenthusiasm for collection, I imagine. The word did not quite consent to leaving his mouth without comment.

A hunger, Di said, because she did not intend to dance without naming the music, and because it is impolite to pretend you don’t smell the kitchen. Private museums, private hospitals, quasi-private grief, he returned, ticking off with his elegant fingers categories he had spent time persuading himself were insufficiently accountable. The law is a slow animal, Inspector. It moves when kicked, it dozes in sun, it sometimes bites the person who feeds it. In the meantime, people like your—he made a small pause to choose a word he could live with—Carla, they decide to perform citizenship without the burden of consultation. It is charming and dangerous. He lifted the blue pen without quite conscious intention and set it down again, a small mechanical confession.

She watched his hands and his choice of plural. She said, an elderly woman tells me she consented to her amputated foot being given to a person she believed would keep faith with the story of it. Your men with a crest and a card calling itself rehabilitation took away boxes labelled with names that exist now as people and will exist no less if their names are written on wood. Are you rehabilitating the names or the boxes or the impulse. And if the answer is yes, to which.

We are rehabilitating the relationship between gift and record, he said smoothly, and if he believed his sentence, he had made a very good job of convincing himself early and often. He leaned forward the way people do when they think they are telling you a secret, the way they do when they are about to hear whether you will applaud. I am sure you know this from your own work: nothing is more corrupting than a good intention allowed to become a habit. Private keeping is a good intention. It births silences and loyalties and excuses that do not bear the weight we place upon them. The Unit—he capitalized it in the air—exists to put weight where weight belongs. His smile flickered toward beneficence and stayed because you have to pick a position when the floor is green and clocks refuse to be useful.

You write in blue, she said, and the fact of saying so felt petty until it didn’t. He glanced at the pen as if it had introduced itself and then nodded, unsurprised to be known in a small thing. Clarity, he said, as if ink could be an ethical stance. Red is a quarrel. Black falls asleep. Blue tells you what you have done and invites you to accept it. He folded his hands and the sleeve of his jacket caught, briefly, on the watch he wore, which had the dishonest habit of pretending to be modest. Tell me precisely what you want, and we will see how close to it we can pass without either of us losing our jobs.

She said, I want to know why your men were at the pier last night moving crates through a private arrangement beneath the pier head that cannot possibly be in your budget and is not mentioned in any list of approved city ingress points. I want to know why a crate had the name of a nurse written on it in paint wet enough to be seen by a porter who thinks names should stay with the people who own them. I want to know who is making decisions about what constitutes cultural material when that material has been cut from a living human being, offered with sincerity to a woman who made a practice of keeping her promises, and then carried through the rain and the practical dirt of a city to a room where light is careful.

He let her have the run of the room while she spoke, let the air deform around the words, and then he reached over and nudged one of the wrong clocks on his shelf with a fingertip he kept deliberately gentle. It ticked obligingly and stayed incorrect, which seemed to please him. He said, we do not keep entrances, Inspector; we make sure that things that want to become secret have fewer places to hide. Men do work at night. It is when most complicated matters move without the theatre of complaint. The name on the crate was a mistake or a test; it is fatiguing to distinguish between the two because the correction is the same. We do not collect body parts to admire them like silver. We collect context. We take away the raw things that make other people hungry to touch what they should not. And, he added, as if returning to a refrain he’d meant to introduce earlier, we keep grief from becoming an entertainment.

Who entertained you, she asked, before you learned to call it context. The question came out softer than she’d expected. He let it sit on the green like a glass with a ring under it. The plant by the window made a soundless effort at life. Outside, a gull stitched a line between two rooftops with more care than it had in the harbour.

He said, when I was young, one of the museums in the interior had a room where a child could walk between skeletons of animals that had never been alive near one another. A giraffe next to a wolf next to a horse with a broken leg repaired in bronze pins. I loved it the way children love a permission they know is special. Later someone took away the broken leg and put up a placard explaining the history of orthopaedics, and I found that I hated the new truth because it had made the old lie uninhabitable. That is as close as I will come to telling you the story you are asking for. He looked at the blue pen again and did not pick it up.

She took the small white shoe from her pocket and set it on the green of his desk like putting down a piece in a game in which you didn’t believe but were willing to move through as if you did. His eyes widened a fraction the way a man’s eyes widen when a thing refuses to stay in its category. He reached toward it and then stopped his hand with visible force and put both palms flat on the desk as if bracing a wall through which a train would pass. There was a blot of blue on his right thumb, something he had made earlier in the morning without meaning any part of its coming. It struck Di then that he must have been up before the light, signing, advancing, securing, and that he had liked the quiet of being the first person to call the day by its name.

He said, what do you want me to see. There was impatience in it, but also something more interesting: a scout’s curiosity that had not been completely crushed by meetings. She said, that you cannot label mercy into existence with ink. That your crest does not make your box more honest. That a promise on a wall can be as binding as one on paper and that you do not get to be the only person who writes those. And I want this object to trouble you when you are alone. Keep it if it helps you; return it if it makes you think you have fixed something by handing it back. It will not help you go to sleep either way.

He did pick it up then, with the care you give a foundling you might have to hand to an officer, and the blue smudge on his thumb made a faint fingerprint on the white bow that would not be seen by anyone who wasn’t trained to look and would not ever, in a sane world, be seen by anyone with a rightful claim to the shoe. He looked toward a corner of the room where a clock had stilled itself mid-minute and seemed not to be suffering from the experience. This, he said, every bit as quietly as Carla had said the words that mattered, is not evidence.

No, Di said, and in the saying she felt something in her shoulders let go. It is a story. And you have taken collection of the stories as well. You can call that rehabilitation if you like; it won’t stop the rabbits taking your straps. He blinked at the word rabbits because the Unit has no form for them and because he was the sort of man who would be pleased to discover an animal where a metaphor was supposed to be.

He put the shoe down. He said, there will be a review. He said review the way other people say prayer. He slid a piece of paper across the green, the movement of a magician making you notice the wrong hand, except it was the right one. It was a copy of a memorandum with blocked-out sections that pretended to be secrets in the places where nothing mattered and revealed quite happily the parts that should have been kept closer. There was a list of collection points, and one of them was the old ferry pier, not called that but by a euphemism made of three hyphenated words. There was a schedule, and there were two names at the bottom. One of them was his. The other belonged to a person who would have to be found by walking along a corridor that smelled of burnt coffee and paper shorn at neat angles, not by any index. He said, you will not be given more than this without asking in a way that will make my life less comfortable than I can afford.

She did not smile. She said thank you without making it sound like surrender. She looked again at the wrong clocks and thought of the green in operating rooms and of the rabbit that had sat in the middle of the street and decided not to die in front of her. The rug’s pattern wanted to make her fall and she refused to give it the satisfaction, stepping at a pace that made compromise look like cunning. At the door he said, Inspector, and when she turned he had his fingers on the shoe again, and then he took them away as if it had spoken. The Unit will not be your ogre, he said. We lack the appetite. His mouth suggested he wished he did not lack anything.

On the landing outside he had placed a plant in a pot the colour of water that has copper in it and a low chair that knew how to hold the coats of men who have never been cold enough. A woman in a skirt the precise width of policy walked past holding three folders and a mug and managed not to look at the plant, Di, or the way the corridor sloped toward the clocks. Down at the desk the gate had surrendered to the deliciousness of a gossip magazine whose cover pretended to be about shame and was actually a collection of photographs of people catching flights. Di signed herself out because it is elegant to do so, and because she had seen too many mornings ruined by an absence of ink on a line.

Outside, the city had decided the snow could be ignored without consequence, and so it had become a dirty lace at the sides of things and a wet intention underfoot. In the small courtyard tucked behind the green building, someone had planted conifers in neat martial rows that would remain the same shade no matter how many seasons passed them by. A rabbit sat in the border soil like a misplaced shoe and worried at a white ribbon of tape it had found under a bush, dragging it free with a pleasure that was all body. It pulled and pulled and then, with the sudden courtesy of a creature who knows when to share, dropped the tape, let it spring back, and picked up the end again as if teaching a human a game. A woman smoke-stressed and coatless opened a side door, saw it, made a sound that belonged to rooms at three in the morning, and shut the door again because admin has no form for rabbits taking up residence near the idea of justice.

Ilona’s message was short and did not pretend to be about anything else. Head nurse says men with crest in the lobby asking for protocols on disposal. I am being cross on purpose. Come if you are not already somewhere you shouldn’t be. Di turned her steps because you go where your name is being used by people you like. The hospital’s entrance had the honesty of a place too busy to redecorate its lies. At the back, the porter was telling the story about the tape again with a detail added—the rabbit had paused in the middle of the dock as if to admire its bride-ness, and a surgeon with three appointments and blood in his voice had had to wait while a ward aid walked around a loop of tape as if rehearsing for a parade. The porter saw Di and raised his chin toward the side corridor as if offering a conspirator’s assistance. I took your advice, he said without needing to specify what the advice had been. The rats are receiving no letters of recommendation.

In the bright part of the hall where the nurses keep their coats, a man in a dark suit was explaining policy to the head nurse in that measured way that suggests he has been assured that women like her become more tractable when they hear their own words used back at them. Ilona stood watching with her arms folded in a way that made it clear that no one would be helped until there was a reason to help them. The man had the same blue on his thumb, like a contagion or a club. He said, the Unit is here as a courtesy, which is not a sentence that ever launches a kindness. The head nurse said in a voice that would cut a steak, these are not cultural materials, and he said, everything that is organized is material, and she said, we are not your cupboard, and he paused as if to consider the artistry of her sentence before deciding not to admire it in public.

Di put her body in the conversation like a doorstop and felt the world recalibrate three degrees. The man looked at her with the mild delight of someone to whom all opposition is flavouring. He said, you’re the one from the green room, and somehow made it sound as if she were a daily occurrence. She gave him the look she saves for men who decide her feet are the only interesting part of the conversation. He said, it’s untidy to be arguing over garbage, and the word garbage slid under the keel of the nurses’ faces and thudded against something important. Ilona made a small, almost invisible move that meant she was about to find a way to make this man less comfortable with the idea of his jacket. The head nurse took a step that put her shoulder to Di’s and the air changed.

Di said, we will sign for what we take and we will record what leaves, and no box will carry a person’s name through the building. We will not pretend that writing the word review on a crate makes it a hymn. The man had the grace to look as if he had not expected competence to be the weapon chosen, and then the lack of grace to proceed anyway, as men do who have discovered their momentum can outwit their conscience. He took out a form with the crest on it and blue lines waiting and a space for a signature that had already been printed with Di’s name without her knowledge. He put his blue pen within range of her hand as if he had given her a gift.

She looked at the space where she was supposed to consent to the exsanguination of her day and then at the gauntlet of the women around her and thought about rabbits laughing without opening their mouths. She said, we will inventory together and in our own language, and we will take photographs with your pen lying across the bottom of the frame, and if you object to the composition you may insist on moving it with your blue thumb. He made a sound that might have been admiration had it been a different shape. He said, the Director likes you, and she felt the white shoe under her coat like a lie that had decided to pay rent.

They spent an hour writing down the dull specifics of things that had once been urgent, and the act of writing dulled the men in dark suits as if someone had sanded their corners. The head nurse called one of the house doctors to come and count, and he did so with an innocence that meant he would probably not survive in administration. Ilona fetched three cups of tea and put them on a counter without commentary, and one of the men drank from the wrong one and flinched at the taste of someone else’s sugar. The corridor’s light made the labels pale, and the camera on Di’s phone recorded the funerary evidence of practical work, and the blue pen did what it could to make itself central.

When the men had carried away what they could justify and two boxes less than they had expected because the porter had found a reason to delay a lift, the corridor let go of its breath. The head nurse put her hand over her tag as if steadying it back into a position it preferred. Ilona leaned with her back to the wall and closed her eyes for half a second, and when she opened them again her gaze fell to the floor near Di’s boot. There was a pellet of rabbit droppings there, neat and unashamed, and it looked so perfectly placed that for a moment the world felt scripted. Ilona raised her eyebrows just enough to be seen, and Di had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from grinning like a fool.

In the café on the corner where the sugar was in a glass jar with a lid that had seen better lids, Verity was waiting with a face that had found a way to be both indignant and entertained. She said, they came back and stood around an empty room as if the absence had been the point all along, and when they left, one of them shook my hand like it was a cheque. Carla is not in evidence, nor is she absent in a way that would shut anybody up. She told me to tell you that the weather will break before the afternoon does, which I took to be either a threat or a love letter. Also, she left this, because nothing makes sense without an object. Verity slid across the table an envelope that had been taped with green surgical tape across the back as if the tape itself might be a signature. Inside were three photographs, printed on paper that had not been expensive, and in them were details Di had asked the world for and had not dared hope it would give in such a docile form: a manifest number, a harbor seal for the freight office stamped in careless red, and a comma where there should have been a period. The seam had been shown and was ready, if approached correctly, to be picked.

The freight office lived in a building that had been left behind by improvements and had decided to become good at holding grudges. The two women behind the counter were the sort who would have found themselves in charge of a convoy in a previous life and had acquired now the kind of power that comes from knowing where all the paper has to go before anyone else knows where to look for it. They were not immediately susceptible to Di’s face, but they were susceptible to the way she took out a pen that was black and unashamed of being so and wrote down the manifest number. The shorter one with hair the color of a new coin—too bright for the room, just bright enough for the story—ran a finger along the list as if it were rosary and then stopped and gave the paper the look a person gives a child who has told a clever lie too cleverly.

Here, she said, tapping. Review. Then overlaminated with an instruction that this should not be reviewed at all. The other one snorted, a noise with ancestry. You have to laugh at men who write no and then write yes over the top and think they have invented a process, she said without taking her eyes off the screen. Di wrote down the name of the ship and the hour at which it took things that did not belong to it, and she smiled in a way that made both women feel, briefly and without resentment, as if they had joined something thrilling by accident.

Outside, the gulls were arguing over a bread heel that had been dropped by accident and had become a philosophy. A rabbit hopped between them, indifferent, interested only in the crumb that was never going to be a crumb again. The day had learned the trick the clocks in the green room had been teaching: how to be wrong with intent. Di stood with her notebook where the word ogre had been boxed and tapped her pen against the margin with a rhythm that might have belonged to a song if she had admitted to herself that she knew its name. The cranes were looking away again. The pier, if you walked back to it, would have a new set of marks on its slats, the tasteful inscription of the Unit’s day, and under the pier the rabbits would have considered which corners belonged to them now. The shoe under the Director’s green hand would have gone quiet or would have continued to speak in a voice that could not be recorded, and either way it would be in the room with the wrong clocks when the lights went out and the green learned how to be black.

She turned toward the water because doing so made the next hour choose her instead of making her choose it. The harbor was all kinds of grey, the working kind and the pretty kind and the kind that lasts between those two being mistaken for each other. She made herself keep her hands out of her pockets so that anyone watching would know she was not cold enough to go home and she could tell herself the same. Somewhere along the dock, she would find the man she had not yet met whose signature was the other one on the paper and who could be softened by a particular arrangement of words and the sound a pen makes when it refuses to lend its color to a sentence. And tonight, perhaps, if the snow kept its appointment and the Unit discovered that it is boring to be right when no one is watching, she would walk past the gallery and see if the blue paint on the door had continued to learn pity. If she was unlucky and therefore blessed, a rabbit would cut the distance between and sit until she had to decide which foot to move first.Chapter 8

The office that held the other signature had windows that pretended to look at the sea and in fact looked at a stack of pallets gone soft in the weather, and it had a heater that laboured like a conscience. A calendar on the wall insisted it was a month earlier than it was, the picture a glossy photograph of a ship whose hull had been scrubbed for the camera, and a plastic plant in the corner broadcast a cheerfulness the room did not deserve. Behind the desk sat a man whose suit said he did not intend to climb anything that did not come with stairs, and his name on the little plaque said Timo Laitinen, which was a name that could be stapled to a dozen occupations and not look out of place. He wore a tie with small anchors on it and he hummed between sentences as if keeping time for the papers.

Di showed him the manifest number as if offering him a loaf he had baked. He hummed, nodded at the sheet with the professional boredom of a man who had lost interest in the shape of numbers years ago and now only cared about how they behaved in a fight, and he said, of course, that load went out last night under review, as if the word were a weather condition and not an intention. When she asked him what review meant in the world he occupied, he leaned back and the chair made an objection and he smiled because smiles are cheap and said, it means someone with a seal told me they were to be moved without delay and without delay is a phrase we all understand if we want to keep the heating on.

She said without raising her voice that the seal had combined with a name, and the name belonged to a person who would find being a label an insult, and he stopped his humming because the pitch of a conversation had changed. He ran a finger down a column of figures as if stroking a cat in the wrong direction and said he had no control over the adjectives, only the route, and that for routes she would need Petra with Harbour Authority because she was the only person left in the city who still knew what a tide was. He looked at Di’s badge in the flat way of a man who preferred invoices to faces and he asked her if she would like a coffee that would wound and then improve her, and when she declined he nodded, finished the last hummed bar of whatever song he had in his head, and called Petra’s office himself because sending a woman from one desk to another without a hand extended is a cruelty even men like him consider bad form.

Petra Vik arrived in a smell of cold air and old rope because she kept her own rope in her office for the comfort of it, and she had the permanently narrowed eyes of a person who had made their peace with glare and wanted no part of anyone else’s lighting. She was taller than Di by a head and managed to make the room seem to stand at attention, and she shook Di’s hand with authority and without welcome because she had made a habit of saving her warmth for things that did not talk. The Unit were overreaching, she said before she had agreed to a greeting, and Di liked her at once for using the present continuous, and then Petra folded herself into a chair that had never held her before and explained in the voice of a teacher who does not care if you like the subject that a small barge called Edda had taken to appearing in the lee of the pier when the schedule wanted to pretend it was asleep.

They had three launch windows a week that did not exist on any list Petra was allowed to submit to the city, and the crew were men with faces like unlabelled jars because they would be filled by whatever the day was keeping. She had lodged a complaint because that is what you do when you want to lose twenty minutes you will not get back, and the Unit had responded with a leaflet explaining heritage in terms that would have embarrassed the worse sort of school child, and she had taken to standing on the mole at night with a wool hat that had belonged to her father and swearing under her breath because sometimes that is the only instrument you have. If you want to stand there with me and call the tide names, she said, you are welcome, and if you want to bring a pen and a form and make the men on Edda write their names on a paper that will not cure anything, you may do that also, and Di said that between those two honest options she would choose a third and find the man whose name sat under the Director’s on the memorandum and make him remember his handwriting when a woman looked at him.

The man with the other signature did not work in a green room and did not own a blue pen because he was a sorrowing kind called a customs liaison who had once worked on water and now worked in a building that had carpets, and his eyes had the habit of looking for horizon lines that buildings deny. His name was Henrik Aalto and there was an old cut in his lip where a hook had taught him a lesson he already knew, and he met Di in a bar whose windows were covered with sincere condensation and whose floor had acquired a slant from men carrying too much in and not enough out. He wore a jacket that had belonged to a better day and he did not stand when she arrived because he was saving his standing for something else, and he said before her mouth had found a phrase that the Unit had written their names on his list and then borrowed it, and that he was tired of having his ink used as the handle for someone else’s bucket.

He explained without pleasure that perishable cultural material was a category that had been invented to keep faith with salmon and had been recruited to keep faith with things no one had asked to name, and that the words perishable and culture made a salad that men who like rooms use when they want to sound as if they are caring for a thing when in fact they are in a hurry. The Edda had permission to berth because someone had pressed the right stamp on the wrong day and because after that day men had developed a taste for doing it that way, and if Di wanted to undo the knot she would have to find a finger to put on the rope that did not belong to anyone on shift. He did not drink until after he had put the shape of his problem in the air, and when he finally swallowed he did it like a man committed to the honesty of his poisons, and he told her that somewhere in that chain a person with a soft voice at the hospital answered their phone after hours and never seemed surprised by the request for signatures.

The hospital was a belligerent hive when Di returned, and the men with the crest had mostly gone because they had found less glory than they were used to and because the head nurse had discovered her most effective volume. Ilona in the nurse’s station looked like a person shutting a door gently so it will not remember to squeal later, and she pointed her chin toward a side office where the man who likes forms had arranged a field of them. He had a smile that had been beta-tested on people forced to sit in chairs that make your knees ask questions they have no words for, and he said he was surprised to see her because everything was in hand and in order and on file, and he gestured toward a cupboard where files lived like parcels you intend never to open and said that the Unit had been quite clear about their need for compliance.

She asked him how long the switchboard kept a key for the back door and he started at the wrong answer and then arrived at the truth because he did not know how to hold his face still for the time between those two stoplights, and he said, well, we do not like to have people waiting if there is… a necessity, and she said, necessity has three names, and one of them is habit, and he laughed because you laugh when your own house is being described politely as an accomplice. He had a blue smudge on his thumb and he did not know how to hide it without demonstrating the attempt and he folded his hands perfectly wrong and asked her if perhaps she would like him to describe the policies in place for the respectful disposal of tissue, and she said she would rather he described a rabbit to her because the policy was already written and the rabbit would tell her more about who he was.

He flushed because men like him do not know what to do with animals that are not domesticated into metaphors, and from the corridor came the sound of a small cart struggling with a linoleum seam, the small insistence of practical life demanding attention, and Ilona appeared in the doorway with a polite question about a form that did not require an answer and a look that said now would be a good time to stop pretending you don’t recognise a trap. When Di stepped out the head nurse said in a tone that could slice a loaf and butter it without a knife that the man with the crest had suggested shadowing nurses for an afternoon to see how culture is produced, and she had suggested he walk into the street without his shoes and see how quickly you learn to regret making the soft parts of life a spectacle, and that if the Unit were planning a return visit they would do it with less paperwork next time and she wished them a long life in which to learn their limits.

The gallery had a closed look that afternoon, a kind of private face even the bruise-blue door could not soften, and Verity let Di in with the care of a person who has taken on a role without finding a name for it yet. In the studio, on an easel set slightly askew because perfect angles offend people who live with paint, there was a canvas half-made that had the ribs of a corridor sketched in, the light already determined, the shoes placed with a compositional certainty that made Di’s chest feel a little tight. In the lower left there was a surprise as if the hand had done something before the eye admitted it; a rabbit had been sketched in with a few pencil lines, the lines careless and accurate, head turned toward the viewer as if to check whether you were going to be ridiculous about it.

On the bench under the window where the paint had made a new geology, there was a document with the comfortable brutality of legalese, and it was a contract between the gallery and a disposal service that had a different name for itself than anyone else did. The contract promised dignity and discretion and continuous chain and salaried responsibility until the moment at which dignity became ash, and it had been signed by a hospital man whose handwriting had disguised itself as sincerity and by Carla in a hand that did not disguise anything because it did not believe in shame. Verity watched Di read with the look of a woman who had delivered a letter to the wrong address and was hoping the occupant could make something human out of it, and she said that Carla had left with her hat on and a piece of rope under her arm and the kind of smile she preferred not to see in daylight.

There is a point in an investigation where it is required of you that you decide to be obvious, and Di arrived there in the early evening while the snow remembered its training and began to fall as if it knew the steps. She moved through the hospital and along the promenade and past the freight office not as a woman looking for anything in particular but as a person insisting on being seen by the day so that the night would be obliged to make an answer. She spoke to the porter about knots and to a cleaner about the places where the rabbits preferred to sit and to a woman in the cafeteria about milk deliveries and to a crane operator about the way the wind had changed, and each of these conversations provided a little piece of string you might tie to nothing and still find useful in a room where someone had turned off the light.

When the dark got to work and the city made the sounds it always makes when the day has been misused, she went to meet Petra on the mole, and Petra was wearing her father’s hat and the hat had found its shape again like a horse remembering that it likes to run. They stood with their shoulders confusing the wind into thinking it held less of them than it did, and they watched Edda approach with the practised indifference of people who want to be underestimated and have long since learned how to perform that. The barge came in as if to a dinner invitation and then shifted its weight the way a bored animal shifts, and from beneath the pier there were movements that had learned how to make themselves into silence.

The Unit’s men were efficient enough at their own dignity to know not to carry boxes as if they were precious, and they walked with that stiff-jointed urgency of people who like to look busy even when they do not have to, and they had the crest on lanyards that had learned how to flip themselves under lapels so that you could not quite tell who was on duty and who was pretending. Di let them make their lines and their looks and she stepped forward when the first strap went taut and she named, in a voice she had practised on men with more knives and fewer stationery budgets, the irregularities in the company of the night.

She did not say illegal because that word wakes lawyers out of warm beds and it is ungenerous to disturb a person when their nature would not help you, and she did not say halt because men like these are trained to hear that word as a dare and to step forward anyway. She said, your manifest is carrying people’s names without their consent, and your pier is not a pier in any book the harbour owns, and your lanyard has fallen inside your jacket and I do not know where to look for accountability, and the man nearest her with the patient jaw and the blue thumb looked as if he might enjoy a quarrel if it had more theatre and less weather.

Then the rabbits entered the scene without fanfare because theatre is not their idiom, and one crept under a strap and another investigated a knot, and a third performed the complicated and absurd dance of dragging a curl of green tape across a slick surface while three men tried not to look undignified and therefore could not step on it, and what dignity remained in the operation departed politely without announcing its intention. Petra put two fingers to her mouth in a whistle that would have scalded a gull off a railing if she had meant it to, and the men flinched because sound can open an old book in your head and you do not always know what you have read, and Di took that small involuntary flicker and put a paper through it.

She named the clause in the harbour rules that had to be written when a war had left the city with bad habits and that no one had thought would ever be useful again, and it required any transfer of medical materials to be documented not only by the Unit but by the hospital and the harbour and the Board of Health, and she said she had two of the three and was willing to wait for the third. The men made a small, elegant huddle because men who consider themselves immune to the weather like to practice their immunity social, and then they unfurled and the leader with the pen, not the Director but the pen’s younger cousin, conceded with the kind of grace that tells you he believes he will be back with a better costume in a week.

A crate was prised and pried because compromise demands the tearing of some small thing so both sides can grieve and move on, and inside there were not jars but numbers, not shoes but pads, not trophies but forms, and underneath, in a compartment someone had made by stapling plywood into a smaller geography, there were a half-dozen thick envelopes each marked with a pair of initials that any woman who keeps lists of names at a hospital could have matched to a human face given an afternoon and a pencil. Di took one because she had asked and because they had offered, and she said she would sign for it as if it were a parcel that contained soap and not a word heavier than six lives written in a hand that tried not to be personal.

Carla arrived in the way someone familiar comes into a story, late enough to make you wonder and early enough to stop you from losing your nerve, and she stood with the rope under her arm like a prop and with her hands empty enough to convince a policeman she had come to see and not to take. She asked Petra if the tide was telling better jokes than last week and Petra said the tide had never once learned a new joke in her lifetime, and then Carla turned to Di and made her mouth kind around a sentence that would have come out barbed in anyone else’s mouth. There is a man in your hospital who will put down his blue pen tonight and pick up a phone and speak to a woman whose shoes you admired, she said without looking at the Unit’s men because she had learned that they would grow if you watered them with attention.

We cannot stop him wanting to be efficient because the world has taught him that efficiency is what makes his mother love him, but we can make his efficiency ring a bell you will hear, she added, and then she slid her hand into the pocket of the coat she never wore with the buttons fastened and produced a ledger with the mean-spirited anecdotal margins of a thing that has been used honestly, and the cover had a rip across the corner like a laugh that had hurt and healed. Give this to the head nurse and tell her to remember what days feel like when the room keeps its own list, she said, and Di took the ledger as if accepting a cake from someone you do not allow yourself to love because it would make your life too clean.

The Unit made their formulaic retreat because retreat is an art not everyone recognizes when it happens, and the Edda shifted in a way that told Di it had been thinking about how to feel disappointed and had succeeded. Petra combined pleasure with cold and said something foul about a crest that sounded like a blessing if you turned it inside out, and the rabbits went about their business with all the decorum in the world because rabbits understand the expression on a human face when authority is pretending it has been educated by experience. Di signed a paper in her own ink and rolled the envelope until it felt like a thing she could keep in her pocket without changing the line of her coat, and she thought of the white shoe sitting on the green and collecting a blue thumbprint and of the Director’s refusal to do anything so obvious with his face as regret.

Back at the hospital, the head nurse took the ledger as if it were a scrap of cloth she could stitch into the hem of a uniform where it would drag and remind you of what skirts were meant to do, and she said it had been an age since anyone brought her a book that had been written in a room that smelled of a breakfast and not ink. She opened it and the names were there in pencil that had been re-traced when a day did not go according to its own hand’s expectations, and there were entries that said the kind of things that are not useful to a Unit but are the only things anyone ever remembers on a night when lights go out, like pumped the soap dispenser three times and still nothing, and Mara K. sang under her breath the song about the herring, and Ilona sent for the good gauze and brought back a roll with its edge bitten, and all of those facts went into a place where nobody but women ever looks and where all the world’s sins would be smaller if anyone did.

Ilona had been in and out of rooms all day and looked it, the calmness she wore started to scuff at the edges, and when she stood with Di by the window in the corridor that watched a bit of the sky that never did anything interesting, she put her fingertips to her upper lip and said the Unit’s man had asked her whether she felt that art took advantage of the work of care. She had told him that everything took advantage of the work of care and it was care’s difficult glory to go on anyway, and he had nodded as if he had heard philosophy and not instruction, and she had decided to add his name to a list in her head labelled Might Learn if Given Honest Work. She looked at Di with that unembarrassed frankness and said she had dreamed the previous night that the corridor was full of rabbits who carried in their mouths not grass but the ends of bandages, and they were unspooling the bandages around her feet without making any mess at all, and when she woke up she had been crying because someone had finally taken off something she did not know she had been wearing.

The envelope that had travelled from the pier to Di’s pocket to the nurse’s station was filled with copies of consents, each with a signature that had been asked for thoroughly enough to make the requesting seem voluptuous, and each witnessed by a person who had always been asked to witness and who had always said yes because refusing is a kind of rudeness you cannot afford when a body has decided to do something new. At the bottom of each form, in a script that was careful enough to be a tell, was the notation that the Unit had been informed. The teller’s name belonged to a woman who answered the switchboard after hours, and when Di went to find her she found instead the empty chair and the neatness of small things waiting to be noticed and an apology written on a pink slip for having gone home at a normal time.

Di went to her hotel because the day had insisted beyond reason and the snow had made itself a way of seeing and she had nothing left in her but the behaviour she had learned, and she sat on the bed and took the shoe from her pocket and held it the way a person holds an egg of a bird they have no business encouraging and she thought not about the Unit or the Edda or the Director and his green indulgences but about her mother’s hand pressing air in a kitchen and saying the wrong name for quiet. A rabbit crossed the street below her window with the certainty of a creature that will never know what a crest is, and it left a line of prints that did not commit to memory because weather is an eraser. Out on the harbour the cranes had turned their heads as if embarrassed again, and in the gallery the painting of the corridor would be gathering itself into colour while the pencil rabbit waited in the margin like a note you make when you are afraid of being alone with your own thoughts.

Morning would roll itself up to the door with bills and with mercies, and she would take the envelope to the Director because that is what you do to a man who thinks his room controls time, and she would be there when he put his finger on the wrong clock and it failed to move for him. She would go back to Mara because you do not take the story of a favour and leave without repaying it, and she would stand in the freight office and ask the women there if there was a way to set a clock in a list so that it told the truth for just long enough to give you a foot in the door. She would go to the mole and stand with Petra and teach herself to love the way a tide refuses to learn new jokes, and she would let Ilona stand against a wall and breathe the kind of breath that people allow themselves when they have been told they will have a day with nothing startling in it and decide to spend it anyway. And for a few minutes in the night while the city tried on its softest face she would imagine a room in which someone kept a ledger of promises made and not yet called in and she would write a single line in it with ink that was not blue and not black but the colour of the harbour when the sky remembers itself.Chapter 10

The day came in low and grey, the sort of sky that thinks a city should learn humility. Di folded herself into her coat, the one that had decided to go on with her through weather and doubt, and walked toward the green building because beginnings, however provisional, like to be visited before they forget their manners. On the way she passed the quay where the gulls were rehearsing their single joke and a rabbit was sitting on a coil of rope with the philosophical look of an animal that has never once needed to understand a crest. Its whiskers went sideways at her and then it returned to thinking about the glove finger it had pulled from under a pallet and worried into the shape of a question mark.

The lobby of the Unit’s building had the same polite glare, the same plant that was either thriving or performing valediction, and the woman at the desk put a polished finger on the sign-in line and watched Di’s pen make black where blue had previously insisted on its authority. The green room had learned nothing but looked as if it had learned discretion; a clock had stuttered forward in the night into a wrongness of a different flavour, and the rug was still full of malicious geometry. Director Riikonen stood before his desk, hands blended into the colour of responsibility, and the small white shoe sat to one side as if it had auditioned for the job of paperweight and been modestly turned down.

He did not offer coffee, which was either a courtesy to their last conversation or the first sign of fatigue. He touched the shoe with decisive lightness and then returned his fingers to the safe practice of folding them. The envelope with the consents had worked on him; she could see the outline of its contents on his face, not regret, not self-rebuke, exactly—more the recognition of a label that refuses to stay on the jar you intended it for. He said there would be a pause in operations that were not anywhere on the public map, and he said pause the way a man says truce when he cannot yet say surrender because he does not know what will be taken from him in the agreeing.

She took the shoe back because talismans work by movement, not by hoarding, and she tucked it where the ledger of the day would beat against it and keep them both honest. He watched the small gesture and allowed himself half a smile, as if watching someone choose a superstition in daylight gave him permission to like his job for another hour. Someone at your hospital is in love with process and has convinced themselves that process is a synonym for kindness, he said, and there was a dry salt at the back of the words. I cannot yet decide if I want to recruit them or fire them. He leafed without picking up paper and he told her the Unit had been promised a donation by a foundation whose name made him wince—The Angelarium, he said, with the weary accuracy of someone who has pronounced ridiculousness in rooms where it cost him—and he pulled a sheet from a drawer and slid it toward her with two fingers extended as if he were feeding a wary dog.

The letter had the delicate threats good stationery carries. It thanked the Unit for “intervening to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable narratives” and promised support on condition that “materials of corporeal heritage” be safeguarded against “aesthetic predation.” There was a gesture of a signature, elegant and self-amused, and under it a name that had been in the paper above Carla’s photograph once, not in the headline but in the laudatory paragraph that used the words patron and visionary as if they were the same shape. Di said the name aloud and watched it make itself a shape in the green air. He nodded and made one small face that conceded the world had listened to the wrong people again and that he had helped it along.

She told him there were rabbits at his back door and he took that with more seriousness than most men would because he had understood something yesterday about animals that do not know you exist until you get in their way. He reached to a clock and, as if to show he knew how small gestures mattered, he set it to the time it believed and not the time it ought to believe. The second hand stalled obligingly at the bottom of the minute and then stuttered forward like a person who has remembered their shopping list halfway to the shop. We are not, he said softly, the only appetite in this, and the admission made the room a fraction less green.

Ilona texted while Di was walking down the corridor with its vexing carpet. Her words were small and sharp, an economy learned on wards where adjectives get in the way. Someone wrote my name in blue on the door to the staff room and then wiped it with alcohol, she wrote. It left a smear that says IL still, like a kindness that forgot. Also, there was green tape in my locker tied into a ring, which seems like either a wedding or a promise to behave badly. She added, because the day was not done with humour, I am not marrying tape.

The head nurse had put the ledger on the counter and weighted it with a coffee mug that had chipped itself into a better personality. She had started a new page that morning with a line that declared: unit men came and looked; did not see. Beneath, Ilona had written, in the careful hand of a person who knows readers come later, Rabbits in the waste store cupboard; custodian takes lunch later; we avoid stomping. The man who liked forms was not at his drowning of papers, and Di felt the absence the way a person notices a missing bell—everything is calmer but you begin to wonder what you do with your hands.

In the gallery, Verity had the look of a woman who had been holding two doors open for longer than anybody decent would have asked. The sign read Closed for kindness in an imitation of Carla’s hand that made Di’s heart do an unflattering thing and then settle. Inside the big room the nurses’ eyes did their usual work, and in the studio the easel had an emptiness that felt specific. There was a cloth thrown over a canvas; there always is, in stories and in practice, and it always means more than it pretends. Verity lifted it because secrets do not hold if nobody is allowed to see them, and the painting underneath was still finding itself but had already decided the light. It was the corridor, the good clean one, the one in dreams that is full of illumination but no cheer, and the shoes were there in their lane like punctuation. In the lower right corner, just where a viewer would decide to stop seeing themselves, there was a small bright slash of red, the exact red of a pair of boots that had learned to walk quietly and were tired of it, and the line of the slash had already decided to be a pair of laces if the hand allowed.

On the workbench there was rope, the new clean kind, not yet taught anything, and it had been tied, with a domestic satisfaction that made Di’s throat go tight, into a constrictor knot so precise that it could have illustrated a book. Someone had left a smear of blue on the loop, not deliberate, not accidental in the way of chance either; it was a blue that carries authority like a smell. Verity said, she laughed and said she was practicing being hard to walk off with, and then someone called and she took her coat like she was claustrophobic in her own shoulder blades, and I have not seen her since. She didn’t make Verity say I’m worried, because the room had already said it.

Mara Kesti welcomed Di as if she had been living with an expectation of a visit and had baked it into the walls. The fish shop smell had less bite in the morning and more of the dignity of work. She had the birds pillow again and a plate with bread that had not apologized for being yesterday’s. She said yes, a woman had been knocking in the building two down, in a coat that had decided to be green and a smile that had learned its manners at fundraisers, and she had used the words honour and legacy as if they were cousins of the same surname. She had hands that did not know how to hold a mop and a list that knew the routes of the district nurses as if she had once had a fever that ached for them.

Mara said she had not liked the woman, not because of the money in the coat—the city was full of money that didn’t make you wrong by itself—but because she stood with her feet turned a little in, the stance of a person who intends to wedge themselves somewhere and lever. She had spoken about culture with the air of someone delivering a cake and tasting each slice first. Mara had said, if you take from the living you must feed the living, and the woman had smiled as if she had always fed someone and did not think to justify the menu. I told her to learn the names of the cats on my street before she asked for anyone’s anything, Mara said, and then she asked for jam and did not receive it because I had no jam.

Petra, later, had a map that was mostly tide, which is to say it changed under your eyes if you let weather into your thinking. She put a forefinger on the pier and then made a slow moon to the little basin where refuse goes officially and where, unofficially, fondness goes with it. There’s a run under the spoil heaps, she said, where the city keeps the parts of itself it will not admit to in polite company, brick and rat and the bones of plans, and if I were moving boxes that I did not wish the daylight to learn the names of, I would let the tide do the work and call it heritage to make the men with pens feel good. Di thought of rabbits making their elegant minds up about corners and of rope gnawed neat. She thought of green tape and what it means when tape learns that it wants to be a ring.

At dusk, the hospital had that carnival of exhaustion that looks like efficiency if you don’t stand in it long enough. The man who liked forms returned with the spectacular meekness of people who have been given the wrong sermon, and he had lost none of his blue and none of his belief that colour could do the job of conscience. The head nurse found new ways to say no that sounded like yes if you didn’t know what to listen for. Ilona stood with her shoulder to a door jamming it against an insistence that did not belong to any human, and she told Di, in the tone one uses to speak of the weather on a day that intends ships to be lost, there’s someone under the stair with a box they will not admit to carrying, and I have decided to become the kind of person who obstructs with furniture.

They moved the furniture because furniture has always wanted to be useful in that guise, and the boy under the stair had a box that his hands loved and feared. His hoodie had the brand of a person who works nights and his eyes had not yet learned to pretend they didn’t. He worked cleaning, because of course he did, and he had been told by someone who speaks in crests and courtesies that a box might appear by the bins and should be moved indoors out of kindness to the weather. He had leaned down to lift it and a rabbit had put its nose on his shoe as if blessing or interrupting, and he had nearly stepped on the rabbit and in stepping had learned that the box had weight like a decision. He said he had brought it inside because people always explain themselves in the hope of being forgiven, and because the rabbits had looked at him as if to say, put it somewhere a woman will find it.

Inside were not jars. There was a ledger, not the one Carla had given, but a hospital ledger gone feral, pages excised and reassembled with green tape in a spine that had ideas about permanence. It was a list of movements made through the hospital when the procurement of garbage intersects with the procurement of dignity, and names had been written and then blue’d, the way secrets pretend to be taken care of. Underneath, in the bottom of the box as if it had gone there for a sleep and forgotten to wake, lay a canvas board with a pencil drawing half-made. It was a rabbit, not elegant, not sainted, not nervous, just the kind of animal that shows you it has been looking at you longer than you have looked at it. Under it were the initials C.S. as if someone’s hand had finished a sentence that the rest of the day had not been ready to hear.

The call, when it came, did not bother to make itself dramatic. Verity rang and said, I lied to a man with a crest and did not enjoy it, so you get this as compensation. A black car brought Carla back to the gallery and she went inside without the car having the grace to leave afterward. The car is sitting opposite the bin where the cats used to eat, and there is a second car at the end of the street that thinks it is not important enough to be noticed. If I knew how to choose a fight, I might choose this one, but I am not the sort of person with a persuasive punch, so perhaps bring someone who knows the names of the parts of a door.

Di brought Petra because Petra carried the harbour on her breath and the willingness to knock is part of etiquette at sea. The blue door was not new anymore; it had learned a dozen looks for the same person and had decided to compose itself. Carla opened without preamble and had the expression of a person who had been applied to by a bureaucracy and had refused to adhere. Her coat was off, which meant she had decided to stay through at least one difficulty, and her hair had gone up by itself, which meant she had been working with a brush or a plan. The black car’s man had come in and had accepted an orange without knowing what to do with it, and he stood in the corner with the orange like a question he had not asked correctly.

They had a paper for her. Not a warrant, not a fine, not a condolence, one of those administrative hybrids that can make you tired just reading the title. It said cessation. It said review. It said programmatic. It had blue written on top of its black as a kind of finishing salt. Carla took it as if it might have opinions about weight and read it with the patience of a person who has watched bread rise and can afford to let letters be dull. Then she put it on the counter among the honey jars and the nails and said, gently, no. She said they could put their hands on her walls when they had learned how to put their hands in basins without needing applause. She said they could stand in her light if they were prepared to have it show them how their faces behave when they are not using them.

The man with the crest did not wish to quarrel with poetry and so he tried not to quarrel at all. He said the word injunction in a way that sounded like he hoped a room full of paint would understand him better. Petra leaned on the counter in the exact manner of the sea getting tired of the polite line of a shore. She told him about mooring fees and about the clause in the old harbour rules that had saved Di’s evening, and she said she would enjoy the paperwork involved in an appeal if only because it would soak up two weeks of a man’s life who had never met a real tide. The orange man looked at his thumbs because oranges demand honesty, and the paper man tucked his blue pen back into his jacket where it could go home and write letters of apology to itself.

After, when they had gone and Verity had let her shoulders be where shoulders live when the room belongs to them, Carla went to the studio and pulled the cloth from the canvas as if to prove that there are things in the world besides forms. She looked, not at the corridor that was finding its light, but at a smaller board beside it where a sketch had been done in chalk that is blunter than pencils but kinder. It was a window, a low one, the kind in stairwells where people forget to look because they are occupied with counting. On the sill sat two objects: a rabbit dropping, perfectly round and tidy as punctuation, and beside it a blue bottle cap, flattened by a car, the ridges splayed like a bad halo. She pointed with one paint-dirty finger and said, I am going to make a saint out of that cap, Inspector. It has been walked on and kept its shape and performed its purpose badly and still wants to be useful.

Night took itself seriously. The thin snow from the morning had gone to slush where men in crests like to stand and to a gentle scrim where the rabbits liked their theatricality. The Edda came and tried not to look guilty; the men with their useful lanyards stood on the mole and pretended to discuss weather; the harbour wore its old hat with surprise and asked nobody’s permission to make waves where there shouldn’t be any. Di and Petra stood on the pier in the place that makes decisions out of you. Ilona, against reason, came too, a shape inside a coat that did not believe in maritime procedure but had learned the way cold lays a hand on you and tells you that you are not the most important person in the city.

They did not attempt theatre with stops and starts and shouted words. They enacted a kind of domestic ritual instead. Petra produced a chain that had once restrained a boat with ambitions and looped it where a line presumed to be safe; she reached for the rope and did not cut it but introduced it to a knot it would not enjoy. Di took the length of laundry line that she carried like a joke she was not ready to tell and tied what she had taught herself to tie, two constrictors in series with a shrug of plain square between, and the arrangement made a tidy mess of an operation that relied on straightness to persuade itself. Ilona, who had never minded the sensible pragmatism of gloves, put her hands on a strap and pulled not hard, but at an angle, which is the way you move things that have learned to resist frontal assault.

The men did not howl, because men like that are trained to express fury as folded documents and schedules revised. They conferred again with their decent outer coats and moved something else and found it also heavier than it had been, and one of them looked for the first time at the side of the pier where rabbits were performing their examination ritual on a box with the look of people who might have invented seals if anyone had asked. The Edda decided to huff its opinion, which was that men are foolish in the dark, and Petra told it in a tone that did no good that it was not the boat’s job to have opinions about the men who were not the sea.

The Unit’s liaison—the younger man with the jaw that liked to be seen doing what it had been given—stepped aside to make a call, and Di, without ever becoming the kind of person who listens on purpose, found that her ears had kept their school and had overheard a sentence that ended with, if it is going to be done, do it, and that sentence has ended too many days badly to let this one pass. She said the word heritage in a voice that made it sound as if it had to earn its keep, and said, between cultures there is a duty of care that is sometimes as simple as writing a list that is truthful. She touched the ledger under her coat and felt its boxy kindness and decided that not all paper is the same, however it looks.

Carla arrived late and luminous, carrying nothing but herself, and she stood with her hands in her pockets as if the sea had asked her to wait for it to finish something. She looked directly at the younger liaison and said, the city is not a box, which was unhelpful and exactly right, and then she said to Petra something about knots that made Petra grin for the first time that evening, and to Ilona she said, go home when you feel that your feet have had enough of the farce, which is better advice than most consultants will give a ward nurse in a crisis. To Di she said nothing, because there is a kind of conversation that gets injured by being named.

They did not prevent an entire operation. No novel has that kind of appetite for catharsis if it intends to tell the truth about how cities work. They prevented a box. They delayed a crate. They made a man in a good coat reconsider his job for the duration of one coffee. They let a rabbit drag a strand of green tape so that three suited people were made to notice the ground, and one of them almost laughed and then destroyed the laugh because he did not know he could afford it. The Edda left later than she hoped and bumped the mole with the graceless honesty of a boat that did not ask for this. Petra wrote down a number with her carpenter’s pencil and the graphite fit the page and smudged the next thing in a way that made the information belong to two places.

The Director, in his green room that was perhaps less green than it had been, called after midnight because men with titles do not sleep when their names have been used without their supervision. He told Di, in a voice that had developed new edges, that the foundation had withdrawn their kindness with a letter that congratulated itself on its generosity, and that the Ministry had asked if he would be willing to step aside while a review of reviews occurred. He sounded more alive than he had yesterday, like a man who had stopped balancing clocks and had decided to see whether time would continue without him. He told her the shoe had been moved to a shelf near his door so that he would trip over it every morning and be forced to think what it was for, and he said, without garlic around his breath, that he had thrown the blue pen in the bin. She did not believe that he would not fetch it out, but it was a beginning, which is all anyone can manage in an honest story.

She slept an hour and dreamed a corridor with a broom leaning against it and a rabbit that had decided the broom was a tree. In the morning, evidence had found her room in the shape of a small thing, as it often does when the large things are behaving poorly. On the carpet by the desk, where her shoe had decided to fall yesterday, there was a single pellet like a dot on an i, and beside it a piece of green tape with a hair caught in it, one of her own, red-brown like a rusted thought. She laughed because she was too tired not to, and then she put the green tape into the ledger as a bookmark and the pellet into her pocket because absurdity is sometimes an instrument.

Mara Kesti called midmorning because a woman with green coat had returned and discovered that Mara owned more determination than she appeared to in a chair. Mara had said, you can make your collection, but not with your hands on the living, and the woman had said, your inspector is bleeding you of story for her career, and Mara had said, no, she is letting my story pretend it is bread. Mara wanted to tell someone she had learned a new thing: there is more than one way to give away a part of yourself and not all of them are theft. She asked if anyone had found music for the corridor yet and Di promised her that someone had and that it would be the kind you use to find your own pulse.

The freight office women had adjusted their hair in no way and their opinions in several. They had helped Petra shut a small administrative door using the technique of a knee and a shoulder, and one of them had discovered that when you write a name carefully on a piece of wood you can never expect it to obey you, and the other had smoked a cigarette with the pleasure of a noun after a week of adjectives. They liked the way the word Angelarium sounded when you said it with a contempt that left no debris. They liked that Di brought them the gratitude of a woman who keeps a ledger. They liked less that papers existed which would keep them busy in unglorious directions for a week. They liked very much that someone had managed to make a man with a crest carry something he did not want to carry, if only for six steps.

Late that day, Di put on her jacket and decided to walk in a way that made her boots sound like both truth and apology. She passed the gallery and the blue door and the sign that had changed its mind and now said Open out loud in a handwriting that made seriousness look kind. Inside, Carla was by herself with her brushes and her rope and the corridor’s light. She did not turn when Di came in because some welcome does not need to be staged. The canvas had travelled another inch toward the inevitable. The red slash had become laces with no foot inside them, which ought to have been sad and was instead the precise opposite. In the corner, almost invisible, a blue cap had found its proper humility and its perfect halo.

Carla said, without taking her eye from the painting, I used the knot, and it held beautifully until I asked it not to. It is a comfort to choose when the holding and the letting go happen. She rinsed a brush in the jar and the water took the colour the way a city takes a story, at first reluctantly and then showing its pleasure. You have an ogre, she added, as if discussing furniture. It is not the one with the crest. It is the one with the folded napkin at the benefit table and the eye for a story with a ribbon. Its hunger will find another name, and its card will be cream where some men had the honesty to choose white. If you want to fight it, we will need bread and a band and a room that cannot stand applause.

They stood in the room quietly and let the light do its work because sometimes the kindest thing you can do for a room is let it be what it decided. Verity gathered cups, which is the way some women like to end their battles. A rabbit appeared in the doorway, precisely where a person would if they were going to ask a question and had decided not to, and it put its nose up and then down and then left without being dramatic. In the street, the slush had learned to be treacherous, and a man in a black coat took a step and discovered that he did not control his day quite as he had imagined; he recovered with grace and looked around to see who had noticed. No one had, and this made the moment better, not worse.

At the hospital, Ilona had taken the ledger apart and put it back together with a patience that people who are not paid enough discover they own when the world insists. The head nurse had learned a new word from Petra and was using it with relish on a man who did not understand marinara, much less maritime. The man who liked forms had chosen to read instead of write for an hour, and he had discovered, with the startlement of a child on a museum floor, that he enjoyed the sensation of learning a thing his hand had not put on paper. In the green building, the Director looked at the wrong clocks and did not touch them, and the plant by the window chose to live for another day without telling anyone. Under the pier, a crate shifted against another and made a sound like a sentence deciding not to end, and the rabbits, who have always understood punctuation, sat up and listened to see if it would continue.
