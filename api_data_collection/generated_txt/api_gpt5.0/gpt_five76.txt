Fog wrote its own parish register over Wokingham that morning, a grey script flowing along the hedges, over fences, pooling in the dip of every lane. People pretended—over tea, over bin lids—that they could still see as far as yesterday. But the mist thought otherwise. It wanted to bring the downbeats closer, to muffle dogs and bells and children. It wanted to make everything soft. It wanted to lay the town down quietly and say: hush.

Lady Hope walked from her narrow cottage to the surgery, the satchel strap cutting through her coat and into her shoulder, the hem of her skirt soaked to the knee. She didn’t remember why she’d chosen the skirt. It had felt sturdy when she took it from the wardrobe; now it was clingy as ivy. A car slid past, a ghost with its headlights breathing loudly. She could picture the driver’s knuckles clenched white, their late start pressing the accelerator as if urgency could cancel the weather.

She could picture everything, lately. The things people said in her exam room were clipped and tidy, but their eyes told fables in which doors could not be locked and children could not be held. The first boy had gone missing eight months ago, from a birthday party, saucers of ice cream half-melted in a suburban garden. They’d found his shoe in the hedge, then a smear of something that wasn’t jam. The second, two weeks later, on the way to school, tiny palm still inked with a stamp of a frog. Then another. The names accumulated in her chest like coins. She took them out to rub them smooth; she tried to spend them wisely, with careful words on radio programs, at PTA meetings, in the queue at the bakery.

She was a doctor. A practical one. She’d done the late nights on wards where the fluorescent lights turned bodies into pale puzzles. She’d caught babies, listened to chests, taken needles out and put needles in, told hopeful lies and kinder truths. Yet the town had begun to press her into a different shape. Someone had to say something when panic grew like bindweed through every conversation. And she had lived here long enough—the Lady was no title, merely a stubborn name given by a mother who loved archaic beauties, and from it the town had drawn a kind of storybook authority.

Inside the surgery, her receptionist Carol was painting her nails to keep from touching her face. “You heard about the jar?” she whispered, as if the walls were passing secrets along. The waiting room was empty; the mist had eaten the eight o’clock appointments.

“What jar?” Lady hung up her coat and shook her head until the worst of the damp slithered out of her hair. She tried to smile kindly, to bend her body into a listening shape. That was half the job: give people your body to lean their words against.

“The new thing. They’re saying this one keeps… fingers.” Carol’s eyes skittered away like pebbles on ice. “The police found one. Children’s. Like trinkets.” She tapped her nails, the color half done, a cherry shade that would look cheerful this afternoon and garish by evening.

Lady pinched the bridge of her nose. “They’re saying a lot of things, Carol,” she said softly. “Please take a breath. Today we’ll give everyone a little more time. You and I will keep our heads. All right?” She poured water into the kettle and stood with her hand on the counter while it rattled itself warm.

“But they’re saying the ogre put it on a doorstep,” Carol went on, whispering like a child telling a ghost story under a blanket. “Marie. With a note. That name’s everywhere, isn’t it? Just Marie, like a signature. And… it’s like she wants to be famous.” Carol blinked. The nail polish bottle tipped; the brush touched skin where skin shouldn’t be glossy.

Lady handed her the tea as if it could stop up a leak. “It’s fear that wants to be famous,” she said. “Let’s be cautious about giving it the looking-glass it likes.” She thought of the radio producers who had called her. Doctor Hope, what do you think, is this a serial thing, how do mothers cope? The longer you look at the cobra, the cobras behind glass begin to look handsome.

Still, when she walked into Room Three to see her first patient—the fog had given up two—Lady found herself glancing at the corners, at the spot behind the curtain where she stored the crash trolley and a folded pram. When she leaned close to check the child’s ears she looked away from the jar full of tongue depressors, all the slender little wooden things lined up like soldiers.

In the afternoon, the police came. It was Detective Inspector Alan Merton, who had a face shaped like a leather satchel: useful, sturdy, scuffed. He had the habit of pushing his knuckles into his coat pockets as if he would like to keep his hands from doing harm. His hair had gone grey not only around his temples but in haphazard lines across the crown, like a lawn that had been mowed by a distracted neighbor.

“Doctor,” he said, his voice low. “I’m sorry to bother you. Can we talk?”

“We can, but not here.” She gestured at the half-open door and the waiting room beyond, a handful of people hunched over their phones, fishing for reassurance or doom. “Let’s walk. It will be good to remember what legs are for.”

They walked in silence down to the churchyard. The fog had thinned to a tasteful veil; the stones reappeared slowly, as if apologizing for their absence. Merton took off his hat and held it on his chest. “There was a jar,” he said in a voice that would have sounded reverent if the topic hadn’t been filthy. “We found it on the steps of St. Margaret’s in Shinfield. The label read: For Marie, with love.”

“Whose label?”

“Typed. Neat. We’ve got the paper and the ribbon. And inside… well. It was what people say it was. Eight fingers. We’re doing the matching. Doctor—Lady—” He squinted at the sky as if he might find a way to fold it into a handkerchief and put it in his pocket. “It’s the copycats that frighten me.”

“We don’t even know if there’s an original,” she murmured. Her breath made a little white knot in front of her words.

He gave her a look as if to say: We both know better. “That name. Marie. At the first scene—do you remember? The chalk under the hedge. Kids draw names on pavements all the time. But the loops, the flounce. We’ve seen that hand on three other streets now. And then online, last night. My son showed me. Forgive the language. They’re calling her Mother Marie, like she’s… feeding. And kids—teenagers—are daring each other to leave jars on porches. It’s gone from the one, the thing we can maybe track, to… to the many. Johannesburg, Jakarta, Chile. It’s in the headlines with composite photos and grainy silhouettes. We can barely keep up with the false alarms. People who never had a cruel thought find themselves reaching for the nearest jar.”

Lady smoothed the back of her glove. “What do you want from me?” She spoke gently, not to rub away the scuff in his voice.

“For you to be a lid.” He smiled, crooked, acknowledging that it was not a policeman’s metaphor. “You speak on the radio, to the mums, the teachers, the people who want to say ‘ogre’ because it’s easier than saying ‘someone close to home’. You can tell them to hold still. And—” He hesitated. “And also. A parent has asked for you at the hospital. The last family. Clara Mortimer. She’s been… not herself. The pediatric ward thought you could do what we do not.”

“I’m not a psychiatrist,” Lady said, but she was already turning, already knotting her scarf tighter, already walking faster. The church bell began to track time in the soft air. She pictured her satchel on the chair, her desk calendar with a few careful squares inked in, the tin of glucose tablets Carol kept by the stapler. She pictured herself as a lid, and then as a cup: what she could hold and how much, how long until her hands burned.

She found Clara Mortimer with her forehead pressed to the chapel door, as if God might be sleeping behind it and she didn’t want to wake him. Clara had been bright and thin in the photos from the school fair, hair like wheat straw, smile like something that had just learned to leap. Here she was slate and closed and her hair dull as the lint on the hem of a cardigan. Practical grief. It had work to do, and it would do it.

“I’m Lady Hope,” Lady said softly. “DI Merton asked me to see you, but only if you’d like me to.”

Clara turned. Her eyes were the wrong color for her face, too light; they floated. “They returned his fingers,” she said. The words struck the edge of the hallway like a pebble tossed at a pond. Then, more levelly: “Not even all of them. Not even the lot. Two little things in a jar. My boy loved lists; he lined up his toy cars. Now I do that with a jar of—” Her voice broke. It didn’t cry; there was no water left to make a sound.

Lady listened. That was step one, always, even when a parent wanted a different step one: an answer, a medicine, an ending. When she laid a hand on Clara’s sleeve, she felt the woman’s heat, the way the body insisted on being alive when the mind had already taken off its coat. “You don’t have to look at that jar,” she said. “You don’t have to take it into your home.”

“They said evidence,” Clara murmured. “They say if he… if he is found. If there’s a trial.” She looked away, as if the floor tiles might explain the legal system to her in a kind voice. “And they’ve named her. Marie. That was my grandmother’s name. Marie baked buns in a tin pan on a Sunday, and now I feel filthy every time I turn the oven on. I don’t want that name in my house. But it already is. Someone put it there with a note. As if I’m supposed to be grateful. As if the world will applaud such tidiness.”

“We can choose other names for the things,” Lady said. “Stones can be called bread, and bread can be called morning. The newspapers have a hunger of their own, Clara; they will feed on anything that smells of meaning. Don’t let them into your kitchen.”

Clara laughed, a sudden bark that made the nurse down the hall glance over. “Doctor Hope. I hope. Such a ridiculous phrase. But here you are. Can you do this, then? Can you make the ghost leave? My boy is a ghost in every doorway, and this woman’s name is the key. When I say Marie I want my grandmother, not this… thing. Take the name from me. Hold it in your mouth until I can’t taste it anymore.”

Lady breathed in, then out. She felt the old steadiness return to her bones. “All right,” she said. “For today, give it to me. Let me hold it. You can take it back when you’re ready, or never. Either way we’ll put food on your table and get you to bed. And when you wake up you’ll say the boy’s name to me three times, and we will make him real again with all the real things. Do we agree?”

Clara nodded and then nodded again, and in that little rhythm Lady heard the first beat of a person returning to her body. So she stayed until the tea went cold, until the nurse found a blanket, until Clara fell asleep with her hand loosely curled. There were things to sign. There were colleagues she knew and some she didn’t. Lady left notes in neat, square letters and then stood in the lobby and thought about jars.

When she stepped outside, the fog had lifted and the day had turned a mild blue. She could see the slope of the hill down to the river. Wokingham looked friendlier when its edges were visible, though it was still the same town where the washing lines were bare because mothers wanted to keep a hand free, just in case. On the bench outside the hospital, a boy in a football kit was crying into his sleeve while his father scrolled his phone. The father’s thumb jerked up and down the screen with a desperate rhythm, as if a good piece of news might be hiding beneath the last bad one.

Without meaning to, Lady looked. She did not often. She’d learned to keep her eyes clear of that spillway. But today she looked. The headlines came, as if the world were a warehouse with all the crates stacked in rows of red letters.

Death Count Rises; Mapping Suggests Clusters. Secondary Clusters. Exponential Curves.

There were maps with points that blinked on and off like illnesses. There were graphs that wanted to be mountains. There were faces under their school photos: he liked frogs; she wanted to make a pasta that required rolling pins; he could whistle like a train. The world knows how to make a choir of the dead.

A message chimed. She nearly ignored it. Then she read: DOCTOR HOPE, THIS IS ALAN. I THINK SHE WROTE TO YOU. PLEASE TELL ME IF A PACKAGE ARRIVES. PLEASE DO NOT OPEN.

She looked at her hands as if they belonged to someone else and would be polite if asked to stop. Then she saw the van turning into the driveway of the surgery; the driver had a parcel in his arms, a square of brown paper, tape bright as new scars. She walked toward him before she knew what she would say.

“Doctor?” he said. “There’s a smell. From inside. I’m meant to ask you to sign—”

“Leave it,” she said, surprising herself with her authority. “Leave it on the step. Thank you. You needn’t wait.”

He needed no further encouragement; he thanked her twice and almost jogged away, the tails of his raincoat flapping like a bird unsure of its own species. Lady stood under the eaves and looked at the package. There were only two kinds of boxes, she thought: those sent and those kept. She could feel the fetch of it. For Marie, with love. Or: For Lady Hope, with something else.

Carol’s face had gone pale behind the glass. Lady mouthed: It’s fine. Then she took out her phone and called the number Alan had given her in that careful way policemen have, tiny dots between digits to make sure you understand it is a rope, not just a string.

“Don’t touch it,” he said. “We’re on our way.”

“I haven’t,” she said. “But it’s mine.”

“You don’t know that.”

“I do,” she said. “Someone wants to tell me a story. If we’re lucky, it’s only a story. If we’re unlucky, it’s someone who thinks telling is the same as doing. Either way, I’d like to listen.”

“Promise me you won’t open it,” he said. He sounded tired. “Promise me you won’t breathe through your mouth, even, just in case. Promise me you will be a stubborn lid.”

She promised. She sat on the step with the package four feet away, and she drank the air slowly through her nose. She could smell brown paper and something faintly metallic, like keys. Once, when she was small, she had put her ear to a jar to hear the sound of the sea. This felt like that: as if the empty place inside the box could hold a noise.

The police came with their quiet boots and their good gloves. They put up tape that fluttered in the mild wind like streamers at a party where nobody wanted to dance. A young constable asked for her statement; she gave him the bones of it. Alan bent down and read the label without touching it. He had kind hands; they hovered over the corners the way a decent man’s hands hover when he is comforting a sick child he does not want to disturb.

“For Doctor Hope,” he read aloud. “With my appetite. Signed, M.”

“Appetite,” Lady said. She felt her own stomach clench as if it had learned a new word and did not like it.

“We’ll take it away,” Alan said. “We’ll open it in a room where the walls have more practice.”

“Thank you,” she said.

They left, with their careful steps and their competence. The tape came down. Carol took a breath so deep it made her collarbone lift like wings. “I wanted to throw it in the bin,” she confessed, hands in fists. “I wanted to set it on fire and watch it pop. I wanted to keep it, just to know. I wanted to see, so that when I thought about seeing I would be thinking about something real.”

“We’ll let the people who can stand the seeing see it,” Lady murmured. She felt weary down to the furniture of her bones. “And we’ll have lunch. Is there any soup in the cupboard?”

There was. She took the cup in both hands and warmed her fingers and thought of other cups, other jars. This is what monsters know: the shapes of things. How to make a household turn against itself. But she also knew what mothers knew, what doctors learned: the shape of a day that holds its line.

That night, after she had done the calls and the dishes, after she had counted the children she knew and said their names in a whisper as if to tuck them in, Lady sat at her kitchen table and took out the letter that had been folded beneath her kettle this morning because she had not wanted to touch it in front of Carol. No stamp. Not post. Someone’s feet had walked it to her, someone’s hand had pushed it under the door. There was no smell to paper in the way that there was to brown card and ribbon. This was just a whisper of old trees.

Lady opened it with a butter knife because the letter opener her father gave her was in a drawer she never opened, because there were drawers you shut and never made yourself open again. The paper unfolded with a small reluctant sound like a breath taken between sentences. The handwriting was neat. The loops were tidy. The t’s were crossed lightly, as if the writer did not want to press too much weight into the word.

Lady,

I was a child once. Did you know? We all were, and then we began to bite. We bit into bread and air and the cheeks of the people who loved us because of the joy of it, because the world had invented smooth things so that we might learn the idea of an edge.

There are three kinds of hunger. One is for food. One is for the names people will say about you when you are gone. One is for the sound bones make in a jar when you shake them gently as if you were listening to rain. I do not like waste. I do not leave whole bodies for the birds like bad myths do. I take the parts that tell me a life. Fingers tell stories. They speak even when mouths lie.

You, Lady, are the fourth hunger. You are the thing I didn’t know I wanted until I saw you on the radio telling mothers to use their quiet voices. You make cages sound like nests. I want to hear what noise you make when you are afraid. Show me.

I am everywhere and nowhere. A woman once brought me a jar in Peru and asked for a blessing; she had braided ribbons into the lid; she had brushed her child’s hair so gently before he slept. I am not only me. They are me also. The curve of my name is a handle on a pot. Anyone can lift it. That is the beauty of a good idea. It feeds the people who hunger.

With appetite,
Marie

Lady folded the letter back into itself until it was small, until even the word Marie was only paper, until the curves meant nothing, until she could put a glass on top of it and see the wood beneath as if it had always been clear.

She did not sleep well. The dream was annoying rather than terrifying: she was cooking, although she did not particularly like to do so, and every recipe called for a jar she did not have. Some of the jars were full of air. Some of them held buttons. The labels were smudged, and when she wiped them they bled. She woke at three to the sound of her neighbor’s cat performing gymnastics against her garbage bin and thought, absurdly, of marbles. She got up, drank water, and stood at the window. The street was a slice of quiet. Someone had left their recycling box out early. The moons of yogurt lids, the throat of a soda bottle, a jam jar with a spoon still stuck to it, tiny sticky victory flag.

In the morning she went walking. The wood on the edge of town had learned a new skitter in the underbrush from the way people looked at it. Lady remembered walking here with children from the asthma clinic, showing them how to breathe around trees, teaching them that lungs liked leaves. Today she walked alone and traced the thin path where foxes stepped and then rabbits and then men. She could feel the town behind her and above it the sky, so mild, so indifferent. She spoke aloud without meaning to and liked the shape of her voice in the wood: “You love an audience. Fine. So do I. Let’s make rules. I don’t chase ghosts. You don’t use children as grammar. Come to me, then. Your quarrel is with me.”

The wood did not answer. It did what woods do: it sighed a little and dropped something soft on her coat. She laughed at herself because it is the healthiest thing. But when she reached the clearing where the kids had once built a den of branches and blankets, she felt the air press against her collarbone. There were tracks where no tracks should be, not deer. Not human. Something wide and heavy had leaned its weight, had shuffled. She crouched and saw a smear of blue glitter in the mud. She touched it with the back of her knuckle. Not wet. Not new.

A voice said: “Doctor.” Not from the trees. She stood and turned. A man with hair like last year’s nettles stood on the path. He wore a yellow cycling jacket and had mud all up his legs. He had that step people have when they do not want to move any closer but cannot bear to stand still. “Do you… this is mad. Do you believe in ogres?”

“I’m a doctor,” she said. “I believe in symptoms. Tell me yours.”

“It’s my niece,” he said, voice spilling. “She keeps saying the name. Marie. She won’t sleep without saying it. Seven times. Always seven. She’s frightened if she says it wrong the jar will show up in our porch. My sister thinks it’s just the news. But there’s a woman—my neighbor says there is a woman—she’s tall and she walks like she’s floating and she wears a blue dress that’s always clean. She was in the alley last week. She looked at my niece as if she wanted to… No.” He shook his head hard. “I don’t want to be a man who tells tales to a doctor in a wood. But I also don’t want to be a man who keeps quiet. She is an ogre, isn’t she? I looked it up. They lure with names. They eat the parts that look like small food first.”

“Tell your sister to turn off the television after eight,” Lady said. “Tell your niece to say the names of the people she loves instead. Tell her that will keep the door shut better than any number. And if you see the woman again, call DI Merton. No one floats. People only look like they do when they’ve learned where to hide their feet.”

He nodded and then nodded again, that same rhythm she’d heard in Clara Mortimer. He had come into the wood to deliver his fear the way people bring food to a memorial. He went away lighter, at least in a way that would last until night.

Lady put her hands on the frame of the kids’ old den. It had fallen in on itself last winter and someone had tried to prop it with plastic crates. The roof sagged like a shoulder. She righted one of the crates and imagined herself at ten years old, holding up a tree with nothing but her heart.

The camera found her that afternoon anyway. She had thought if she kept her head bent, if she avoided the high street, if she went to the butcher not at lunchtime but at four twenty when the blood had congealed and the butcher wanted a cigarette—still the camera came. The young woman with a dead-black bob and nails bitten to the quick stepped lightly into her path. “Doctor Hope,” she said. “We’re doing a piece about coping. About how to talk to kids without scaring them. Could we have three minutes? Two? Thirty seconds? Would you say something about the word ogre?”

Lady’s shopping bag hurt the crook of her arm. She thought of all the jars in the world, all the lids twisted on and off. “I’ll say this,” she said. “There are some words that people use because they let them look at the fear sideways. Ogre might be one of those words. But sideways is still looking. Better to say: someone hurt a child. Someone put a jar on a step. A different someone might do the same. And then, to our children, we say: here is how you travel, here is how you shout, here is who to call. We give them rules that come with verbs, not nouns. Nouns sit in the dark. Verbs move.”

“Beautiful,” the young woman said. “And… one more. The copycats. People are scared this will grow and grow.”

“It will,” Lady said, because she had used up her kindness for the day and all that was left was a small, blunt stone of a truth. “Someone has made a neat story and human beings are magpies for neatness. We like to see what shiny thing fits a pattern. The only antidote to patterns is stubbornness. We make our own. We sweep our porches. We ignore jars until the right people come. We do not write notes. We do not make names into prayers. And—this is important—we do not make monsters into celebrities. We can survive without a last name. We can survive without a portrait. We can survive without the thrill of being on the edge of something. We turn on the kettle. We call our mothers. We teach the seven-year-olds to cut their sandwiches in triangles because triangles are nice. That’s not a headline. But headlines don’t keep you warm.”

She went home and took off her shoes and found she had stepped in glitter in the wood. It had dried on the leather, a faint blue dust that made her brown shoes look festive against their will. She rubbed at it with a napkin and it came away in her fingers. She threw the napkin away and then took it back out and put it in a jar because she was, despite better sense, a person who wanted to understand patterns too.

At ten, her phone rang. Alan again. She thought: he should sleep. She should too. But the dead get first pick of the hours. “We opened the package,” he said without preamble. “There were eight buttons inside. Blue ones. The kind kids use on coats. And a note: Count with me.”

“Did you,” Lady asked, voice flat, “send someone to Clara?”

“I did,” he said. “She was asleep. She is safe. And there was another jar. Far away. Chile. The police called us because of the ribbon. Same brand. Exported from here. You know what this means.”

“It means it’s easier and easier to be a version of the same person,” Lady said. Her mouth was dry. The napkin in the jar looked back at her. “It means we’re all pulling on the same handle. And it means she’s watching me watch her.”

The window rattled in a small wind. The plant on the sill that refused to die no matter how neglectful she was knocked one leaf gently into another, a polite little applause.

“Stay on the phone with me,” Alan said, after a silence that wasn’t quite one. “Tell me something that isn’t about jars.”

She told him about the boy with the frog stamp who had learned to play the recorder with three fingers, who had come to her surgery once with three notes and a cough and left with two more notes and a sticker. She told him about Carol’s nail polish, how it had dried into a glossy red that would say party to some and blood to others and how much our minds insist on tuning things. She told him about the new cat in her garden that had discovered the birdbath and turned it into a personal spa. She told him, finally, about the wood, about the blue glitter in the mud, about the way the den had fallen and held, fallen and held, the way we all did.

“So she’s in the wood?” he asked.

“She is anywhere there is a pattern to admire,” Lady said. She didn’t want to give the woods the pleasure of being haunted; the woods had enough to do. “But if she wants my attention she will step where I can see the dent. She’ll come again. She wants to talk. Monsters always do. They write letters. They count. They congratulate themselves for having learned how to be hungry in a clever way. I’ll be here. I’ll answer when I can. That’s the rotten part of being useful, Alan. The need finds you.”

He made a sound she hadn’t heard him make before. It was not a laugh and not a sob. It was something that had thought it was both and then decided to be neither. “Be careful,” he said. “I don’t want to add your name to any list.”

“You won’t,” she said. She didn’t add: not yet. She rubbed the jar with her thumb where her napkin sat under the glass. Words were the lids that rattled or held. She had a steady hand. She could hold a jar without dropping it. She could also, when the time came, unscrew the lid and pour whatever was inside down the sink, and then wash the glass until it no longer held a smell. She could.

Past midnight, the town gave up pretending to be a safe place in a story and just went to sleep. The lights went out in rows. A fox screamed, which is what foxes do when we are unprepared. And on a hill not far away, in a house that had once been a school and before that a barn and before that nothing anybody loved, a woman in a blue dress stood in front of shelves full of jars that had never held jam and listened, smiling, to the sound they made when she tapped them. She did not need to tap hard. She did not even need to touch them. The room vibrated with the noise of people saying her name in houses all over the world, and she thought: yes, yes, that will do; the sound of rain. She placed the new button jar in a special place, and on its label she drew a neat little heart with two long loops.

“Lady,” she said to the empty room, as if it were an accomplice, as if the walls had ears that liked to be trusted. “Lady, my love. I’m so hungry. Come and see.”In the morning the fog was gone as if a giant had lifted the tablecloth, the crumbs of it shaken into the hedges where spiders collected them like pearls. The air had that honest light which makes even the litter on the verge look precise. Lady stood at the sink and rinsed the glass she had imprisoned the napkin in, watching the bluish residue collapse and bloom under the tap. She had slept but not deeply, her dreams busy with measuring spoons and people she half-knew from the waiting room walking around her kitchen, asking for refills. The letter lay in a thick envelope in the drawer with the tea towels, a place where useful fabrics lived and the corners smelled faintly of lemon. Keeping it with cloth felt right. Letters were a part of the housework now, wiped around, contained, brought out only when you mean to handle them. She dried the glass carefully and put it back on the shelf, and for a moment her fingers rested on the rim as if it needed comfort.

Her mother’s habit had been to begin every day with a three-item list in a little notebook: buy bread; sew button; call your father. The book had lived by the kettle in whichever kitchen they were living in, moving with them like an heirloom teapot. When Lady was small she had added items of her own in a different color, believing color changed the hierarchy of a day: teach hedgehog to swim; make a rope of daisies; find the secret door. The notebook had accommodated both kinds of tasks, practical and enchanted, without complaint. Her mother had liked that balance and had named her accordingly. Lady, she’d said, because titles can be armor for the soft, because language can be a hedge, because if people call you something long enough you might grow into the good parts and shed the rest like a skin. As a teenager, Lady had wanted to be a Sophie or a Claire or a Jo. But the town had made a kind of peace with her name, and she had, too. Authority was a coat you shrugged into in bad weather and hung neatly on a hook when the sun came out.

Alan called at eight, apologizing automatically and then not. He sounded like a man who had drunk coffee to keep his hands steady rather than to wake himself. The lab had given him ribbon news and paper news and the kind of news that came in couriered envelopes stamped with three languages’ worth of caution. He told her about fibers from a polyester blend popular in South America and a child’s school glue with glitter already mixed in, the lazy kind that saves you having to shake the pot. He told her in a good policeman’s way, laying out facts like screws on a saucer so she could see what might hold something together.

“Buttons then,” she said. “Why buttons?”

“Because they’re children without being children,” he said, and she could hear him run a hand over his hair and catch the bits that insisted on doing their own thing. “Because they are countable. Because they imitate. Because they sound like bones when you... I’m sorry. I should watch myself.”

“You should,” she said, but it was kind. “How’s your boy? The laddish one with the internet and the conscience.”

“Rowan,” he said, and the name came as if it had been sitting on his tongue since breakfast, ready to be said to someone who would understand its weight. “He’s angry with me for telling him not to look. And then he’s angry with me for looking for him, for knowing things he does not. He’s in sixth form. He thinks the world happens elsewhere. I am trying to teach him the terrible opposite.”

“Bring him to the surgery if he wants something to do,” she said. “We always need someone who can tell us why the printer sighs. We’ll give him verbs.”

She put on her boots and walked the long way to work by the school, because she liked to hear children’s feet on pavement. The head teacher, Mrs. Larkin, stood on the steps with the morning gate duty lanyard around her neck like a medal for patience. She saw Lady and waved in the way of someone who wanted to ask for something and didn’t yet know if the ask was reasonable.

“They’re saying the word at small people,” Mrs. Larkin said without preamble when Lady came near, keeping her voice low so that the small people would hear nothing more alarming than the whistle that called them to line up. “Marie. On the bus. At the chip shop. It leaks. We turn off the television and it leaks under the door. My lot are making jars out of loo roll tubes, would you believe, like a fairy house craft, and I can’t decide if discouraging is already too late, if I just make it more mythical. I would like to reclaim the jar. You know how we reclaim things. We did pirates after that summer with all the thefts. We did wolves when those patrol vans frightened the little ones. Wolves are not monsters, they are dogs with opinions. Could we do jars? Seeds, maybe. Marbles. Counting that doesn’t hurt. But the risk. The other side of that coin. What do you think?”

Lady did not answer immediately. She watched three sisters tie each other’s scarves in competent knots, one set of small hands twirling and tugging, nobody crying about it. She thought about pattern, about how it can be a trap and also a ladder. “If we do it,” she said finally, “we do it quietly. Not as a spectacle. Not as a headline. You make it science. You talk about volume and shape. You send them home with herbs and recipes so that kitchens smell like thyme. And you do not mention the woman, not even indirectly, not even in the way of saying we’re doing this to undo that. We don’t give her the reflection. You think you can hold that line?”

Mrs. Larkin nodded the way a general nods, regretful but determined. “We can hold any line you help us draw,” she said. “We could do a tasting of soups. We could do lentils. We could count lentils. The paperwork will be apocalyptic. The parents will be split like seas. But I am tired of letting fear teach my curriculum.”

“I’ll speak to the ones who come in sniffing for smoke,” Lady said. “Tell them the doctor says soup is medicinal.”

The day unfolded like one of those fold-out city maps nobody used anymore, with small delights tucked into corners and the occasional rip where a street had been opened and needed tending. A baby with a birthmark that looked like the leaf of an oak tree came for vaccines and sang each time the alcohol wipe touched her skin, not because it hurt but because it rubbed coolness on her own fat keyboard. An old man whose wife had died in the spring brought in his blood pressure and his shopping list, as if both needed measuring. A teenage girl showed Lady a picture of a dress she wanted to wear to the end-of-term dance and asked, with great seriousness, whether the neckline was likely to inflame her eczema. Lady told her to line it with silk ribbon and to take antihistamines on the day and to wear Vaseline like armor wherever it itched. The girl left looking as if a future had reattached itself to the hook it had slid off.

Between appointments she went online with BBC Berkshire, the studio reduced to a headset and a microphone the producer had couriered over, a boiled sweet of technology on her desk. The host did her smooth introduction and said the words empowering and community and mother more times than a sentence needs. Lady asked to speak without interruption and, to the host’s credit, permission was given. She said the things she had learned to say in the tone that most resembled a clean hand placed on a fevered forehead. She asked people to stop passing along videos which shook because the person holding the camera shook. She asked them to tell their children practical rules: don’t follow anyone who uses your name first, don’t go anywhere you can’t come back from in three minutes, don’t keep secrets about grown-ups, not even for a minute. She told them to make friends with their neighbors’ dogs because dogs tell you early when something is wrong. And then, because she heard herself becoming a list and lists can be cruel, she told a story about the year the river froze and the town skated on it and how even then, when danger was beautiful and collective, there had been rules about where the ice was thinnest and everyone had obeyed because they preferred living to falling through an idea.

She ended by speaking directly to the person who signed letters appetite. It felt foolish for half a second and then necessary. “There are people who want to become a word,” she said, voice low, feeling the way her breath pulsed in the microphone as if the thing itself were a living ear. “They want us to say it so many times it becomes the tiled floor of our mouths. We can decline. We have that choice. If you are listening, and I know you are, please hear me. You are ordinary. Your hungers are ordinary and unoriginal. You have tired of ordinary and so you have draped it in blue and given it jars and borrowed girls’ names. But the adults are speaking to one another now. We are making soup. Your tricks are boring at the level of the kitchen table. If you want to speak to me, do it without harming anyone else. Come into the bright and put down your props. We can have a conversation like people. You won’t, of course. That would ruin all the fun. But it is on record that I invited you.”

The producer texted hearts and lightning bolts and a pizza slice to say thank you. The host did earnest gratitude. Lady took off the headset and went to wash her hands because words leave a residue on the skin when you have used them with force. When she came out, Carol mouthed the name Rowan and pointed, and there he was in the waiting room, long and opinionated, hair like a broom somebody had propped in a corner, an awkwardness he had not yet made into pride. He wore a satchel with badges stating complicated positions about milk and planets.

“My dad sent me,” he said without the usual adolescent apology, but he had the good grace to look pleased by the errand. “He said to help only if I feel like it, which means he wants me to and knows I will do the opposite of what he wants if I feel pushed. Do you need a teenager?”

“I need a teenager to mend the printer and to tell me when a thing is a meme or a movement,” Lady said. “And maybe to carry boxes. And maybe to drink a cup of tea where I can see you so I can say to your father that I saw you existing in the world.”

He followed her into her little office and sat in the chair which always sagged for men of his age and straightened for women of his grandmother’s. He asked intelligent questions about microphones and whether she had considered doing a podcast, which made Lady feel both ancient and a little ridiculous. He mended the printer by opening its one mysterious flap and removing a piece of plastic which had no business being where it was. He drank his tea cautiously, as if it might be a trap. He told her quietly that all his friends had watched at least one of the jar videos in some alley known for initiation rituals, and he told her equally quietly that one of his friends had left a jar because he wanted to be thought brave and was now sick with shame because a small boy who lived in the house beside the porch had cried for two hours. He wanted to know if there was a way to undo a terror once you’d spread it.

“You go to the house,” Lady said. “You knock. You are honest. You’re prepared to have a door shut in your face. You say you are sorry and you do not ask to be forgiven because that would be another ask. You ask the grown-ups what might help them feel they’ve been heard. If they ask something you cannot give, you say so. You do not post about the experience to show how good you are. You don’t earn virtue for returning what you borrowed without asking.”

Rowan nodded, and the nod was so much his father’s that for a moment Lady felt as if she were speaking to two bodies at once. He stayed an hour, making himself useful in the way teenagers do when they suspect usefulness might be easier than flirting with disaster. When he left he waved and did not smile, which made the wave more sincere.

At lunch the surgery emptied itself of people and filled itself with the sound of spoons. Carol had made egg mayonnaise in a Tupperware older than the junior doctor who came on Thursdays to take bloods. The kettle complained. The news, playing on Carol’s phone, tried to slip into the room, but Carol swatted it away like a fly with the heel of her hand. Lady picked up a fork and then put it down again, appetite and appetite. She thought of the long room with jars and of the woman in her blue dress listening for the applause of a world that feared her. She wondered when the woman had first understood that hunger could be a rhythm if you taught people to keep time.

The afternoon harrumphed along. A mother with twins laid both babies on the exam table as if it were an altar; they smiled at each other in the mirror of each other’s faces and forgot to cry while Lady weighed them. A builder came in with a finger he’d nearly sawn off because his mate had told a joke at the wrong moment, and Lady stitched him carefully while he told the joke again to prove it had been worth it. Alan texted a link to a police circular that made the word ALERT look like an invitation to panic and then sent a second text apologizing for having sent the first. Lady turned off her phone and put it in her desk drawer under a white pad. It rattled twice and then stopped, like a child being told no by a kind hand.

At three, there was a shout on the pavement and the sound of something glass hitting something hard and then the growth of a murmur. Lady went to the door. A woman stood in the middle of the street, cheeks wild with color, a jar in each hand, one in shards at her feet. She had that look of a small person turned giant by rage, and her hair stuck out as if electricity were looking for an exit. On the steps of the florist lay a cardboard box with a neat bow. Carol made a small noise in her throat that might have been a prayer or a swear.

“Enough,” the woman shouted, and her voice had a countrywoman’s thickness in it, as if she’d been made of something denser than the town could dilute. “Enough with your parcels. Enough with your names. I have two girls and a boy and a dog with a stupid name to call in for dinner, and that is the story of my house. You hear me?” She raised the second jar and smashed it on the curb with satisfaction that was almost musical. Whatever had been inside scattered harmlessly: marbles, big cat’s-eye ones from a shop that also sold slingshots and chewing gum in long ropes.

Lady stepped out with her hands open in the universal gesture of not being a threat. She picked her way around the shards and stood near enough to smell the woman’s sweat and peppermint. “You are all right,” she said in a tone that was low and flat. “You are allowed to smash jars. You are allowed to be angry. Now breathe and come inside and let me see if you’ve cut your hands.”

The woman looked at her as if she had been offered the wrong part in a play and it took a second to adjust. “Doctor Hope,” she said, and the name was useful here not for any stories it carried but because it was the name of a person who would get blood off a knuckle before it dried sticky. “I’m sorry. I know I shouldn’t—”

“You should smash anything left on your doorstep by someone who did not knock first,” Lady said. “You should smash, and then you should call the police so they can practice being good at their jobs. Come in. Tea is part of the treatment.”

The street murmured its approval in the subtle way streets do, a softening round the eyes, the way one person reached for another’s elbow. The florist, a man who used to drive a coach for a football team until petrol cost as much as candyfloss and he needed to take up something with its own scent, bent and swept the glitter and glass into a pan and kept the bits that looked like they might grow into trouble. The cardboard box with the neat bow had a card on it with Lady’s name typed severely. Carol fetched Alan with a text that did not say help but conveyed it anyway. The woman with the peppermint breath cried a little and then apologized for crying and then laughed and then blew her nose and then laughed again because it was a day that did not know which emotion should go first.

Alan arrived with the stride of a man who had been with people you could not untell things to and was glad of a place where you could tell them something simple like wait here. He loomed and then made himself smaller because looming is impolite when a person has cut their thumb and is doing their best. He picked up the box and put it in a bag that meant science. He asked questions he had asked before and asked them as if this were the first time because the trick is to make people not feel rehearsed. He signed for the box as if he were the postman of fear. He handed the sweeping man a card with a number on it and was thanked with an armful of daffodils because gratitude is a currency some people still insist on paying in flowers.

“Blue ribbon again,” he said in the little office where the two of them sat after, with the sound of Carol writing fiercely in the next room, the kind of writing that put the world into stacks. “And a note on top this time: Sing for me. We’ll open in our room, not in front of your daffodils. I like your daffodils, by the way. They make all this look almost human.”

“Almost,” she said. “I asked on the radio.” She told him, and he winced the tiny wince of a man whose instincts wanted to keep everything in a brown bag until it could be labeled safely. “She won’t, of course. But sometimes it matters that the invitation was extended. It draws a circle that doesn’t belong to her.”

“Or it makes her feel courted,” he said, and then apologized and then didn’t. “Your woman with the peppermint. She did a good thing, smashing. But it will also make ten of them think smashing is a thing to do in order to be part of a story. I am not telling you to tell people not to smash. I am telling you that whatever we say, someone will find a way to take it as instruction. That is the despairing bit. And then the practical bit begins again, which is that we will keep saying the thing our way and trust that patterns can be softened if not broken.”

“There’s glitter in the wood,” Lady said, because it itched, because if she didn’t say it it would settle like grit under her tongue. “And the den the children built has fallen in and someone has propped it with crates that used to hold milk. Which might mean nothing. And a man says there is a woman who floats in the alley behind his house, though she is wrong to float, she walks, but we say float because we can’t bear the thought of feet on our own ground.”

“I’ll get someone to the wood,” Alan said. “Not a squad car. A pair of feet that look like boots and are boots. And I’ll have someone look at the milk crates. And I will talk to the milkman. It will be the dullest detective work in the history of our town, which is how I like it. Your man with the niece, will he call me if he sees her again?”

“He will,” she said. “He will because he said he didn’t want to be a man who keeps quiet, and I believed him.”

They parted the way busy people do, like tugboats moving away from each other to find the next ship, and the afternoon bled into evening which bled into that grey hour when everything tastes like it needs salt. Lady walked home the back way by the allotments because she liked to eavesdrop on carrots. An old woman in a blue anorak was talking to her runner beans in Polish, which sounded like knitting undertaken out loud. The air had a new crispness in it like bitten apple. She passed Mrs. Larkin’s house and saw a pile of empty jam jars in the porch, washed and waiting, a little army of glass with their mouths open. She wanted to tell the jars that they were safe here, that their fate was soup.

At her own door someone had written letters beside the step in a chalk so pale it barely showed, the white of a fingernail half-moon. LM, it said, which might have been anything, might have been Lady and Marie or Lady and Merton or Lousy Milk or Love Mum. It might have been the random flotsam of chalk-holders, teenagers more likely to write initials than PNAs. But the loops were certain and familiar, the L like a boot ready to step, the M like a shoulder shrugging. Lady bent and rubbed at it with the heel of her hand and then with spit because grandmothers teach you the use of spit for many things. The chalk came up in milky curls and stuck under her nails. She fetched the bucket and the mop and washed the step as if she were the caretaker of a church.

That night, after she had made an omelette that tasted of thyme even though she had not put thyme in it and eaten it with bread that was more crust than anything else, Lady opened the drawer with the tea towels and took out the letter again. She read it with her elbows on the table and her chin in her hands, a posture schoolteachers had tried and failed to break her of because it was comfortable and made attention possible. The neatness of the writing irritated her more tonight than it had in the morning. It was the neatness of someone who likes to put the sugar in the middle of the table, who enjoys controlling distance. She wondered if the woman had been the tidy one in a messy family, the kind of child who looked for a job to justify her presence. She wondered if praise had come to her like coins and then stopped, and if she had learned to mint her own. It is dangerous to imagine the childhoods of monsters, she told herself, because it makes them look so human you will want to offer them soup.

The phone rang. She looked at the display and saw Unknown Number and then saw from the way the number grouped itself that it was not sales or charity because those numbers showed themselves like peacocks, open and cheering. It had the small careful space of an unlisted line. She pressed accept and said her sensible greeting. The voice that replied was a woman’s, lower than she had imagined, the kind of low that comes from singing or from years of yelling in rooms where music was too loud.

“Lady,” the voice said, and the name made the air between phone and ear narrower. “You are so tidy. Your jars would be alphabetized if you kept any. Do you want to hear me eat?”

“No,” Lady said, and she almost laughed at her own smallness, the refusal so simple it felt like a child refusing an unpleasant vegetable. “I want to hear you tell me something that is not cliché. Tell me where you learned blue.”

A small pause, the kind that is at once vanity and calculation. “My mother liked Mary and blue,” the voice said, amused by its own confession. “She said it was the color that forgave. Sky. Lake. Dress for church. She made me wash saucepans until the black came off. I scrubbed and scrubbed and the water went blue with the soap because the soap said it was clean by being a color. Sometimes I think if I could scrub the world enough it would go blue with its own soap and we would have a clean killing. Does that count as not a cliché?”

“It counts as a story you tell yourself that made sense to you at a certain age,” Lady said. “What do you want, Marie?”

“To hear you say it,” the woman said, and there was the sigh of a smile, the sound you make when you have sucked a sweet into a certain position in your mouth so it rings the back teeth. “To put you in a jar and shake you gently and hear if you rattle like rain. To see if your bones make the sound of weather.”

“You could come to the surgery,” Lady said. “I would sit you down in a chair that sighs and ask you about your family and then I would phone a different kind of doctor and say here is a human being who needs looking after. You would hate it. It would be so ordinary. There would be tea and somebody’s dead aunt’s china. But you would be alive and we would get to hear what you sound like when you tell the truth to a person who won’t put you on the radio. It’s my only offer.”

“Your only,” the woman murmured, savoring the word. “I am making ten offers an hour to children in houses with steps that have chalk on them. They like my offers. They are bright. They glitter. You offer soup. You offer boring. You offer sleep. People will always choose glitter.”

“Not if the soup is made by a person who loves them,” Lady said. “Not if the boring contains the names of people who will turn up if you don’t come home. Not if the sleep is guarded by a dog with a ridiculous name you have to call across three back gardens.”

The woman laughed, and it was the laugh of someone who had not been in a back garden in a long time. “You are giving me lines,” she said. “You have a good pen. I liked your radio. I liked when you said verbs. You think words are the whole game because yours are so tidy. You think jars are symbols. They are not symbols. They are jars. You put things in them and then you own the things.”

“I know what jars are for,” Lady said. “It is my job to know. It is also my job to say to you what nobody else will say because they are busy being frightened. You are small. You are a person with a habit and a circle of admirers. You will be caught because you are not as clever as you think. You will be caught because people will get bored, not because the police are so wonderful. You will be caught because this kind of hunger is always bored in the end.”

“No,” the woman said, almost gently. “No. This kind of hunger has found a shape. It will last beyond me. It will have a museum room. Children will go on school trips to see jars behind glass with little buttons in them because You were their friend, Rowan, never came home. Mothers will hate me, and others will kneel to the idea of me. I am not small. I am an edge. And you—oh, Lady—are the nice blunt table we lay the jars on. It’s adorable. It makes the edge feel sharper.”

“I am not furniture,” Lady said, and because it amused her to be rude to someone who had built her life on other people’s carefulness, she added a word she rarely used in company. “And if the day comes when you are behind glass I will volunteer in that museum and I will swap the labels so that they say Button, approximately five millimeters. Ribbon, cheap. Woman, ordinary.”

“You will never get the job,” the woman said, laughing properly now. “They will not let you in with your sensible shoes and your old blouse and your eyes. You will scowl in the foyer and put change in the donation box and go home to make soup.”

“I will,” Lady said. “And it will be excellent soup.”

When the call ended, not — she noticed — with a flourish but with the small chirrup a phone makes when one person’s battery gives up, Lady sat awhile. The plant on the windowsill tilted toward the night. The cat next door knocked its head gently against her rubbish bin and then decided to sleep in a place where foxes would offend it and it could therefore have something to complain about in the morning. She did not call Alan, not yet. She did not want to give the call to the police in the way you hand a child’s drawing to a teacher and then cannot have it back. She turned the letter over and wrote, in her own tidy hand, one sentence to herself: Do not argue with myths after nine at night.

In the house on the hill, the woman in the blue dress dipped her finger in a jar of glitter and drew a neat blue line down the inside of her arm, watching how it caught the light even in a room with curtains shut. She had once been the sort of girl who tried on armfuls of bracelets at the market, who liked the weight and the small clink, who believed in a future where everything could be layered on, glitter and bangles and hearts. She had learned, somewhere between the years of loving bracelets and the years of preferring jars, that weight could be a story if you made it so. She hummed, counting under her breath in a tune the town would recognize because someone had played it on the organ when the power went out and the town had gathered to sing something older than electricity. She broke her own rule then and touched one of the jars, letting her fingernail click lightly against the glass. She had the habit of not touching to prove that she could. But tonight she touched, and the sound it made pleased her even though it was, if she were honest, very small. She stood and smoothed her dress and went to her desk and took out the paper that smelled faintly of lavender because a woman in Peru had given it to her with great ceremony. She wrote carefully in her good hand, not the note she would leave with a box, not the hungry one, but a letter addressed to a person who had told her the word no and meant it. She liked the way the letters L and M sat beside each other. They made a little fence. They made a ladder. She thought she could climb it.

Two days later the school sent a newsletter that made three parents furious and thirty grateful and the rest curious but too busy to be either, and with it came a slip to be signed that asked for jars and promised soup. The note was worded so carefully Lady wanted to applaud, the way a good surgeon is not above applauding a clean stitch put in by a student. There was no mention of fear. There was not even a hint of reclaiming. The jars were for science and cooking and counting kindnesses. The children were going to read a book about a girl who collected rain, and the librarian would talk about how to keep rain without keeping it in glass. On Thursday, Rowan turned up with two boxes of jam jars from a restaurant that, he said with teenage seriousness, had promised to reuse them but actually just threw them away. He went with Lady to Mrs. Larkin’s office and they stacked the boxes the way a person who cares about jars stacks them: gently and without turning their mouths to face one another, because jars like to talk and then they crack.

On the morning of Soup Day, the parents who had written angry emails came to see what sacrilege would be enacted. They stood at the back of the hall with their arms crossed and then uncrossed because a child had flung their arms around their waist and called for help with a lid. The hall smelled of lentils and carrots and the faint damp of a hundred small coats. Mrs. Larkin read the rain book with gravity and a voice that made raindrops sound like something you could collect and feed to plants. The children counted lentils and did not call them bones. They stirred soup and someone burned it a little and then they laughed and called it smoky and the children ran around outside to run off the fact of sitting still. Lady stood with a spoon and a paper hat and handed soup to small hands which took it as if soup were gold. She did not cry. She permitted herself a small happiness like the square of dark chocolate that sometimes came with the bill in a cafe she could not afford but sometimes went to anyway for the pleasure of the bill.

In the afternoon, when the pots had been washed and the last child had been collected by a person who had a key to their house, Alan walked in wearing an expression that had been ironed and then worn creased anyway. He held a notebook and a ribbon in evidence paper the size of a prayer. He did not say on the steps what the ribbon had been attached to and she did not ask because it was still the school’s day and the smell of soup was a living thing. In the office he told her and she sat down because it is polite to your knees to do so when someone says jar and ear in the same sentence.

“It is a pig’s,” he said quickly because he had thought to spare her and couldn’t. “Somebody’s idea of a joke or a copy or both. But the label was proper again. And there was a note in your tone. It said Bring your spoon. As if —”

“As if the kitchen were the theatre,” she said, and her mouth felt dry and she hated herself for the word theatre when a thing had been left on a doorstep in a clean village with a woman gardening ten feet away. “She called last night.”

He did not swear, which she admired. He simply stood very still and then went and stood somewhere else. “You’re telling me now,” he said, not as an accusation but as a filing system. “Thank you. Did she say —”

“She said she wants to hear me rattle,” Lady said. “I told her I don’t. I told her to come to the surgery. I invited her to ordinary. She found that offensive. Or funny. Or both. She will not come. She is making herself a museum in her head and in that museum I am the docent who won’t be hired. It makes her giggle.”

“You must have known she would call,” he said, and the it is unfair in his voice was not directed at her. “You brought her to you when you did the radio in that way of yours. You brought her anyway just by existing. And we are bringing her by saying no to her name while saying it. And the children are bringing her by pretending. I want a day when nothing brings her. I want to lie and tell you I can make that happen. I cannot.”

“So we do soup,” she said. “And we do tired parents’ shoulders. And we do dogs with stupid names. And we do not pretend that what we do makes her go away. We pretend what we do makes everything else stay.”

He put the ribbon away and sat with his hands around his hat again, as if he had developed the habit of using it as a bowl for his worst thoughts. “Rowan is going to apologize to a family at six,” he said. “His friend, not him, but it was his dare. He thought he might bring biscuits and I told him not to, and then I told him I didn’t know the rule anymore. Do biscuits help? Does bringing anything look like a bribe? He is furious at how the moral universe shifts under his feet. He liked it better when there was a set.”

“Tell him to bring himself,” she said. “Tell him to bring the words I am sorry and I will not do it again and I will tell others not to. Tell him to bring his eyes and not to look away. That is gift enough.”

They watched the last of the parents go, the last of the crumbs brushed from the long tables, the custodian fold the legs in with the principal’s hand, two sets of grown-up hands that had put up and taken down a hundred things. Lady felt the kind of tired that is a clean bed and not dread. She wished this could be the whole of it. She wished that jars would go back to being the way a mother knew how much summer was left by how jammy the pantry looked.

At home that night there was a new letter under her door and a small blue smear on the mat where a careless finger had touched. She washed the mat with salt and then with boiling water because women who had stood where she stood once had told her that salt and boiling water were born to clean scared places. She opened the letter after she had made tea and after she had looked out at the street for a long time to see if it would make any sensible reply to her stare. It was shorter than the first, as if the writer had decided not to decorate.

Lady,

I came. I stood at the back and watched you give soup to a boy who did not like carrots but ate three. I could have been anyone. I could have been anywhere. Isn’t that delicious?

Next time, sing. Your voice is good. Your voice on the radio made my windows hum.

M.

Lady folded the letter until it could no longer have the word next and put it under the heavy cookbook she owned and never used because it was all lamb and elaborate desserts and her life had no patience for either. Then she fetched from a drawer the thing she hadn’t touched in years: the letter opener her father had given her. It had a bone handle and a blade thin as an argument. He had given it to her on a day when she had got into medical school, the letter sitting smugly on the mat when she came back from night shift at the petrol station. He’d said, voice too bright for the hour, Here’s a thing to open the rest of your life with. She had laughed; he had cried, the only time she remembered that happening in front of her. She held the letter opener and wondered if myths could be pricked, if glass could be threatened by bone.

She did not tell Alan the bit about Marie in the back of the hall because telling him would make him remove the privilege of soup. She told him most of the rest. She told him everything he could use, and then she took the letter opener and put it in her bag with her stethoscope, like a medieval kit: listen, cut, stitch, speak. Outside, the fox screamed again, and she wished it would learn a different verb. But wishing is a noun in a night like this. So she did the thing that works: she set her alarm and turned out her lamp and lay down on her left side so that her heart could rest against something. The town breathed even when she did not like the sound. The jars on the hill thrummed lightly, a noise the woman thought was applause and Lady knew was simply air moving from warm to cold and back again, the sound a day makes when it puts itself to bed.Morning made itself plain, a sheet pulled tight over a bed, wrinkles flattened by light. Lady dressed with the deliberation of someone packing for a journey she would only take as far as the surgery. She put the letter opener in her bag beside her stethoscope and the chewy sweets for low blood sugar and a pen that did not leak. When she slipped her arms into her coat she felt the familiar shift of useful weight. The town had regained its edges as if someone had found a pencil sharpener. Children’s voices braided in the lanes. Somewhere a lorry reversed with a genteel beep and an old man watered his geraniums with the hose held attentive as a butler’s arm.

Rowan stood at the corner by the greengrocer at ten to six, exactly where he said he would, the appointment resting on his shoulders like a jacket he had accepted and not quite found a way to wear without self-consciousness. He had a small square of paper in his hand with I am sorry written three times the way a person rehearses a speech they are terrified of forgetting. Alan was three doors down, pretending to read a noticeboard put up by a residents’ association with more fonts than it needed. Lady had not meant to pass by, but the afternoon surgeries had been a tide and now, empty-handed, she was simply walking, and here they were, her detective and his boy in the situation every story about ethics disliked: the lesson delivered on a doorstep with a real family behind it.

She did not intrude. She paused at the corner where a magnolia had decided to bloom indecently early and adjusted a shoelace she had tied too loosely, which gave her the small gift of stillness. Rowan squared himself and knocked, then knocked again with the second-knuckle gentleness of someone who knows small people sleep on the other side of doors. A mother answered with her hair pulled back not with vanity but with purpose, and the look on her face said: you are part of the day I have had to bear. Rowan spoke, stumbled, recovered. He offered no biscuits because he had listened. He asked nothing in return and did not make himself a hostage to a forgiveness he had not earned. The woman’s jaw worked, then softened. A boy came into the hallway halfway through, thumb hovering near his mouth in that clever way children keep something almost-comforting in reserve without quite giving in to it. The dog with the stupid name barked in the kitchen and then sighed like an old cushion when the mother said its name. In the end the woman asked if Rowan would mind taking the garden gate off its hinges and re-hanging it, since the last attempt had left it leaning like a drunk. He did. He fetched a screwdriver from Alan without looking back and knelt and worked. Lady watched the verbs do the work nouns never could and then walked on because sometimes the best thing to do is let a scene have the privacy to make its own ending.

In the wood, men in boots that had learned patience moved as foxes do when foxes want to look uninterested. They had told their radios to behave and kept their voices low so that anything listening would not be frightened too soon or not frightened enough. The den had the unsettling dignity of a ruin; someone had tried to shore it up with milk crates stamped with the name of a dairy that no longer delivered to doors but still supplied cafes that liked the word local on chalkboards. Blue glitter had found homes in cracks and roots and the rough hems of bark; when one of the men brushed his cuff it travelled to him as if it had been waiting. A ribbon scrap lived inside a fox hollow as if a child had made a bed for a doll and then forgotten the doll. The officers collected what could be collected without disturbing the way the place was wrong. A child’s trainer print overlapped an adult boot in a choreography no one wanted to learn. A squat glass jar without its lid had a circle of dirt around it darker than the dirt it sat on, as if it had sweated or been moved from a colder room. They found a cluster of the cheap glitter-glue tubes, the kind with a nozzle that clogs the second time you use it and stains everything thereafter with its temper. They found a receipt from a shop that sold ribbons and raffia and the idea of rustic weddings to people who liked to think you could purchase charm. The receipt had no card number, just the time and the calligraphic name of a cashier who might be real or might be the kind of name that receipts have when they are trying too hard.

Carol took her lunch at her desk and then pushed the Tupperware away as if egg could bite her back. Her nails had survived the day’s paperwork; the red had hardened into a housewife’s bravery. When she came into Lady’s office at four she asked permission with her shoulders and then sat in the chair that forgave everybody’s posture. “He left a jar outside my mother’s door last night,” she said, breath too steady for the words. “Not this one. Not… that one. A boy, some boy. A copy-one. It had a toy inside. A plastic ring with a purple stone. She is eighty and she stands at the sink and sings off-key and she keeps biscuits in a tin that says Digestive even when it’s shortbread inside. He left her plastic. I wanted to hurt him in a way I did not know I had in me. I did not. I picked up the jar and put it in the bin. She said, ‘Oh, glitter!’ the way mothers do, as if it were a friend. And then she went back to singing and I wanted to be her and could not.”

“You did the right thing,” Lady said, which was inadequate and also the only thing that had any direction in it. “Bring your mother here this week. I’ll tell her blood pressure it is a paragon and ask her how she keeps her biscuits crisp. We will give her the good chair and we will say the word jar when we mean tea. Take the evening. Paint your nails a color that doesn’t know what to call itself. Sleep at her house or bring her to yours. No rules about distance tonight.”

Carol cried without bluster, tears as neat as her handwriting. She wiped them with the back of her wrist and then laughed because mascara wanted to make a point and failed. The laugh did what laughs do and loosened something that had got wedged.

There was a flyer tucked under the surgery door when Lady left at half past six. It was from the church, the font recognizably the work of the volunteer who had married his love of clip art to a sincere interest in community. The words said: Songs at Sundown. Bring voices, leave fear. She imagined the meeting where that last phrase had been offered and the way the curate had tilted his head while choosing. She imagined the argument in the vestry about whether you name the fear to vanquish it and the way people who have not lived with true dread often believe in incantations. She did not want to sing to anything that expected a performance, least of all to a woman in blue who would drink sound as if it was cooked just for her. And yet something in her remembered a time in a childhood kitchen when her mother had set two wooden spoons on a tin pan and asked her to find the beat of rain. Your heart will have it already, her mother had said, as if hearts stored rhymes the way drawers stored string. She folded the flyer and put it in her pocket and kept walking.

Mrs. Larkin possessed the rare gift of looking like a person even when wearing her lanyard. She came to the surgery early the next morning with a list and a sheepish grin. The list was of soups that would not cause hives, foods that could be pureed and still count as a treat, names of families who would need a word of reassurance delivered in the afternoon when the day tilted. “I thought we might sing on Friday,” she said, voice low, eyes quick, “because the hall belongs to us as much as it belongs to panic. We won’t do anything foolish. Just tentative rounds. Heads and shoulders. The rain song. Nothing that gives anybody the idea of a memorial. I will ask the vicar to come but not to speak, because vicars love to punctuate and I want air between the notes.”

“Do it,” Lady said. “Do it and tell no one outside the parents. I will come, and I will stand at the back and keep the air honest if I can. It will not make anything go away. It will make the afternoon easier. We are permitted to do the small thing that the day can bear.”

She made time for the hospital between the ten-fifteen and the half-past eleven. Clara Mortimer had acquired two more blankets from the nurses through the alchemy of kindness. She had eaten toast and had the look that toast gives you when you take it in a mouth that is raw with grief: gratitude and a little betrayal. They sat by the window while the pediatric ward inhaled and exhaled with its machines and its small cries. “The jar is not in my house,” Clara said without prompting, as if she had been waiting to say it to someone who would not correct her. “The police have it and I am allowed to think about it only when I choose and not every time I open the cupboard under the sink. There are rules we can make even though the world forgot how to follow them. The nurse says I can buy a plant for the sill. She says something that grows is a kind of surgery.”

“You can buy two,” Lady said. “You can buy six and kill three of them and still call yourself a gardener. We will go together next week. You will make a list of things that grow without applause.”

Clara rested her forehead against the cool of the window. “They are having the singing,” she said, and Lady wondered at how far the town could move a piece of news without a poster. “I don’t know if I want to go because I might hate everyone for knowing words I don’t, but if I don’t go I will hear it through the glass of the world and I don’t know if my bones can stand it. I want to not go and also go.” The line of her mouth made a decision without her. “I will come. I will sit near a door. I will leave if I have to. You will be there.”

“I will,” Lady said, and it was more vow than plan.

The ribbon receipt gave them a shop near the canal where brides bought twine in gold and called it rustic. Alan took a plainclothes officer there with an expression that promised to be more generous than curiosity if anyone deserved it. The shopkeeper wore a cardigan that made you think about moths. She had the particular politeness of someone who had learned to never assume a person’s budget or their grief. She remembered a woman who liked the ready-glitter because she said she did not have time, which could have been anyone. She remembered the lavender paper and the woman’s scorn of the rose-scented paper the shop had bought by mistake. She remembered hands that did not leave fingerprints because gloves were fashionable when you had cut your nails down to the quick. She remembered blue. When asked the ordinary question about names she gave none, and when asked the extraordinary question about faces she said, tentatively and with the shrinking of a person who does not want to be wrong, that she had the feeling of a person who did not belong to anyone. “She did not look over her shoulder the way it would be sensible to,” the shopkeeper said, arranging raffia in a way that suggested she was thinking hard. “She had the kind of back that made you think she was used to walking out the last door on purpose.”

They took the list of purchases and compared it to lists made in four other countries by four other shopkeepers who had sold quantities of blue ribbon that made no sense for weddings that spring. The paper trail was both sensible and incoherent in that way modern evil is: too many hands on the same pattern to make the fingers easy to count.

At the church, the organist ran his thumb over the keys in a blessing-he-didn’t-believe-in and played the tune he always played when people needed reminding that their throats were instruments whether they had lessons or not. The first sound children make when a hall is asked to be quiet is a rebellion of feet; then, if an adult taller than them asks them to do something with their breath, they will obey out of curiosity and then delight. The round began thick and mushy and then established itself like an idea that has finally found a sentence to live in. Lady stood against the pillar with her hands in her coat pockets because that was where the warmth was and because people felt freer if her hands were not arrangements. Mrs. Larkin led without leading, a kind of generosity that people who think leadership is being the loudest never learn. The vicar came and leaned, and to his credit he did not speak. The song laid itself over the room like a shawl.

Halfway through the second round Lady felt the hair on her arms pull itself to attention. She looked without moving her head, a trick learned on wards where the family is trying to decide if you are the kind of doctor who will change the day. The blue was not a dress this time but a scarf, and it was a clever scarf because it belonged to a woman who was possibly a grandmother, possibly an aunt, one of the women who smell of mints and laundry and know when to fetch a chair. The blue could have been coincidence. It could have been the town in love with an idea about itself. The face above the scarf was a face that could pass in any supermarket: eyes that had read labels, hair that had lost some of its big ideas but kept its shape out of habit. The mouth was the give-away, not because it smiled or did not, but because the corners held themselves as if they were waiting for a cue. When Lady met the eyes, the eyes did not flinch in the way guilty eyes do. They warmed with a curiosity that treated Lady like a new instrument. Lady looked away first by choice. She would not conduct for this woman; she would only sing.

The envelope under the organ lid had no scent because it had learned better. The organist found it when the songs had rolled their last note forward and quiet had returned, the kind of quiet a hall has that is full of breath. He held the envelope as if it might be the bill and looked for someone to hand the bother to. Lady took it because she was nearest. She did not open it there because the wood of the organ had the weight of things that deserve not to be tainted by bad penmanship. She put it in her pocket and smiled at the organist and told him he sounded like rain. He flushed and denied and gathered his sheet music in a tidy stack that spoke of griefs he would never name to strangers.

Alan did not stay at the back. He made himself inconspicuous by making himself familiar, greeting the parents who needed greeting and watching the corners as if corners were the kind of animal you could startle into telling the truth. He saw three blues. He saw a boy with a scar on his chin stare at the door with a ferocity that had nothing to do with the music. He saw the way people’s shoulders dropped a degree when a verse settled. He saw Lady’s chin lift when the third round took, and he lifted his own because a thing that works deserves witnesses.

They walked away together with no fuss, Lady and Alan, Carol and two teachers who had tidied for half an hour after everyone had gone because that is how schools survive. The evening smelled of damp coats and triumph. Lady took the envelope out under the lamplight and felt, without opening, the thickness of a single sheet. Alan’s hand hovered because that is what his hand had learned to do around her. They stood between two cars that had known the rain and Lady unfolded the paper so that it made the small sound that had begun to nauseate and hearten her in equal measure.

Sing, it said, in the same hand that had made appetite round as if it were a sweet in the mouth. Sing where I can hear you alone. Friday, midnight, wood. Bring the lid-lifter. M.

“Absolutely not,” Alan said, but the words were cordial, like a neighbor refusing a pudding.

“Of course not,” Lady said, and then added a quieter word that made both of them look at the ground and then away. “Unless.”

The policewoman with boots and patience found the house on the hill the way you find the source of a smell: not straight, not quickly, but with a series of braver turns than you would ordinarily take. It was no secret that there had been a school there once and before that a barn and before that fields that had grown something that made people hungry enough to work harder than they wanted. The house had become a rectangle with polite windows and the look of a person who wears a suit they did not choose. The track up to it had the habit of being muddy even when it hadn’t rained. There were jars in a shed that had once been a bike shelter and before that a place to store hay. That in itself meant nothing; the world has jarred its bulk for generations. But the jars had labels with nothing written on them yet, and the labels had the cheap kind of glue that leaves a residue, and the residue had glitter in it. The policewoman did not touch them because those were the rules. She looked at the ring on her own left hand and thought about soup. She wrote in her notebook that someone collected glass not fit for jam, and that the bins had paper that smelled of lavender without there being a lavender plant anywhere that the good will of the house might allow.

When she told Alan, he did not scold her for finding a thing before he had found it. He asked her to stand down because probable cause is a bridge you must cross cleanly or you drown halfway. He asked the neighbor at the bottom of the hill what the car looked like, and the neighbor said it was one of those that looks like a shoe, and neither of them laughed. He asked if a woman wore blue and the neighbor said she wore normal and came down sometimes to ask if the bins were Thursday or Friday because people who do harm can still need to know when to put their rubbish out.

Lady put the lid-lifter back in the drawer and took it out again because her father’s gift had never been asked to do this work. She put it in her bag with a sense of having decided not to decide and went about her evening as if the day were obedient. She fried eggs and burned one on purpose because the smell of scorch is a warning bell she trusts. She watered the plant that refused to die and apologized to it for ignoring it and laughed because there is a possessiveness to apology that is ridiculous in the mouth of a woman who is not certain she owes the apology to a plant and not to herself. She telephoned Clara and listened to her breathe for a while because sometimes breathing in company is what prevents people from having to name the things they will not survive. She took her mother’s old notebook out of its drawer and wrote three items. They were not a plan; they were a spine: Call Mrs. Larkin about jars for herbs. Bring Carol’s mother shortbread. Sleep.

Sleep, when it came, did not behave. It circled like a dog who does not trust the cushion you have provided. When it settled it brought her the now recurring kitchen dream in which ingredients asked for jars and jars asked for names. She held a jar under a tap and water filled it and refused to be called water, insisting on being called blue. She woke at two and listened for the sound of someone choosing her doorstep and heard only fox-talk and a late taxi.

She did not go to the wood at midnight. She went at eight, in day, the way people in her care would want her to. She called Alan before she put on her boots because their deal, never spoken and very firm, was that one of them would not move towards a story without telling the other if the story had teeth. He arrived with patience and a woman with the kind of eyes you want looking at your small disasters. They walked the path not like hunters but like people who want to prove to a place that you are not afraid of it. Lady stood where the children’s den had sagged into its best effort at being a fort. She felt the press of the wood like a hand over her mouth and she shook it off because the wood has no such intentions; it is the people who bring intentions and lay them like blankets over whatever a place was minding its own business being.

On a branch at eye level, too tidy to be fox, hung a ribbon tied into a bow with competence. Attached was a paper tag with a blue heart drawn with the roundness of the tip of a glue pen. The tag had written on it a single line a person might write if they had read too many fairy tales and understood none of their warnings: Count to eight, Lady. She took the tag off with the corner of her scarf rather than her fingers because the work of not leaving your own fingerprints is as much a habit as leaving none. Alan photographed it with his phone and looked older than the phone thought he should. The other officer photographed him photographing because layers are sometimes how we remember what we did in a place when a day asks questions later with a sharp voice.

“I’m tired of numbers,” Lady said, and her voice came out in a tone the wood accepted, the way woods accept people who do not try to speak louder than them. “I am tired of children doing arithmetic in fear. I am tired of being invited to theatre. I am tired of the kind of hunger that thinks it has discovered a clever way of making the world feed it. I prefer grocery lists. I prefer the way a town counts cups. I prefer the way a mother counts money and makes it stretch even when it won’t.”

“She picked a time because she’s greedy,” Alan said, startling himself with the small ugliness of using she when he preferred the grammar that punished monsters with neutral words. “She wants you in the dark because dark is where her audience sits. You won’t give her that.”

“I won’t,” Lady said. “She wants a duet. I will sing in a choir.”

Back at the surgery, a parcel waited, not on the step but with the post, the ordinary post with a stamp that had a hedgehog in a scarf on it because a charity had decided hedgehogs in scarves would make winter feel less like an illness. Carol held it with tongs used for buns and rolled her eyes at her own theatre and then did not apologize because in this season your own safety procedures are the only ones that will keep your hands your own. The parcel smelled of lavender, which made them both sigh with relief and disgust because it meant the ordinary horror, not the meat one. They put it on the back table and called the room where walls know how to hold their breath. The note inside, when the room’s hands opened it, contained not appetite or hearts but a list of songs that children sing badly and grown-ups sing worse and then feel better about themselves. It contained the suggestion that the second verse be sung alone by Lady because the writer liked her lower notes. It contained, folded in, the receipt from the ribbon shop with a neat blue arrow pointing at the time of purchase last week as if to say, cleverly and with an air of being a person who understood timetables, See how punctual I am.

The day before Friday ticked through the town like a practical metronome. The butcher put a sign outside that said stew meat with no apology for its lack of romance. The florists put daffodils in cheap buckets and did not mark them up beyond reason because spring is a kindness that does not belong exclusively to people with money. The head teacher met a parent at the gate who wanted to know why her child had come home smelling of stock and had to suppress the laugh that would have been unkind. Lady stitched and unstitched the same sentence in her mind a dozen times: Do not sing where the wood can hear you. She carried it the way you carry the knowledge that a tooth is loose. It is not an emergency; it is a reminder that something is about to change and that your tongue will worry at it until it lets go.

At dusk, when the foxes had not yet arranged their complaints and the boy with the frog stamp was somewhere on a bus seat drawing a drum kit in the condensation because muscle memory is a way of telling the world you are still coming, the woman in the blue scarf stood in a corridor with a polished floor and looked at a set of photographs on a wall. They were of previous school choirs, rows of small teeth and uncertain hair, a few eyes at half blink the way cameras always catch the honest one like that. She touched none of them. She had the good manners you learn in halls where people will show you themselves if you act as if you deserve it. She had made her plans with the simplicity of a person who believes she is owed a duet. She would go to the wood and wait and hum a part that sounded like weather. She would tap the jars back home until the room told her things it had not told her yet, the small notes she had missed amid applause. She would press the telephone to her ear and listen to the breath of a woman who told soup to be braver than it is and would decide when to stop listening. She smoothed the scarf down with a palm, approving of the flatness of it, the lack of creases, and then she smiled because she liked a crease when she put it in herself. She wrote a letter in the lavender paper that said Ready? and put it in an envelope and addressed it to a person who would not open it until morning because she had made herself into the kind of person who does not do midnight for anyone.

Lady’s list the next day was mean and brief to make room for things she could not put on paper. She wrote in the small notebook by the kettle: Ring the dairy. Send Rowan to Mrs. Larkin with jars. Call Mrs. Mortimer about plants. Beside ring the dairy she drew a cow with a halo to amuse herself and the idea of talking to the kind man who drove the shoes of milk to people’s doors. The dairy’s phone line put her through to a lad with a voice that had only recently settled into itself and then to a manager whose voice belonged to someone who had not smoked for three years but still missed it in his bones. Yes, they had lost crates. Yes, they had been asked to leave them in a place they did not usually leave them by a woman who knew the names of the former drivers because she liked to show that she belonged. Yes, they would send their list of routes to the police with the awareness that privacy and public safety had become housemates who loathed each other.

She took her lunch on the back step with the door open and Carol’s mother’s shortbread in a paper packet. A sparrow told her off for crumbs and then grew brave and then realized bravery is what makes you a cat’s lunch and retreated to scold from the fence. When the phone rang with Unknown Number she let it. It rang again and she let it. It rang a third time and she answered because endurance becomes perverse if you let it and because she had rehearsed the sound of her own voice saying no.

“You cheated,” the woman said, as if it were a flirtation and not a sentence aimed like a pebble at a forehead. “You did not come to my wood.”

“Your wood.” Lady let the phrase sit a moment as if you could embarrass a noun into behaving by making it self-conscious. “Woods belong to animals and then to trees and then to the people with maps and only then, if there is any left, to people with scarves. I do not come to dark places to do what you say.”

“You’ll come when a child’s name is the ribbon,” the woman said, almost kind. “You’ll come when I ask in a way that feels like duty. You’ll come when I put your initials on the step. You will come, Lady, because you like to win and it will annoy you beyond endurance not to.”

“I like to get children home and to have their dogs bark at me because they think every stranger is a wolf,” Lady said. “Win is a noun. Home is a verb. If you want a conversation you can bring yourself to a day that has ordinary corners. You can do it without props. You can use sentences that do not try to lift themselves onto a table.”

The woman made a sound of hunger dressed as amusement. “Sing into the phone,” she said. “Just once. I will tell you when to stop.”

“No,” Lady said, and she was pleased how uninteresting her own voice could make that word. “If you want music you can go to the market on Saturday and give a pound to the boy with the violin who always stands by the bakery. He is better than your jars.”

“I will teach you to be interesting,” the woman said, and then she hung up with the little sound of a nail laid against glass, a sound Lady had begun to hear when she wiped the table, when she set down the kettle, when she washed her hands after listening to a child’s chest. She put the phone down and ate the rest of the shortbread with a fierceness that surprised her because there is a point at which sugar is a fight.

That afternoon, a mother came in because her child’s hives had flared at the idea of soup and she needed a cream and permission to call it medicine. An old man came in with a splinter that had ideas above its station and a joke about fences that got better as he told it twice. Rowan returned with the smugness of a printer repaired and the red ears of somebody who had been thanked sincerely. He asked if he could carry anything, and Lady gave him the parcel that was only teabags so that his muscles would feel useful even though the day had not asked for them. He leaned against the door frame in the posture of a person about to say something heavy and then said something light about biscuit brands and how teenagers have divided the world, unhelpfully, into the part that accepts dunking biscuits and the part that refuses.

When the sun went down it did so without drama because some days know not to demand too much of anyone. Lady stood at her sink with her hands in the water because water is another kind of lid. You can put your fingers under and the day cannot hear them think for a small while. The letter opener sat on the windowsill and watched the fox walk a straight line down the path as if it had an appointment. A light came on up on the hill where the house had learned to pretend to be anything other than all the things it had been. The blue woman set a jar down on a table and wrote a label with a neat heart and thought about how to make the town sing on time. Lady turned off the tap and dried her hands on the towel her mother had bought in a market on a day when they had decided the money would stretch if they told it to in a cheerful voice. Then she went to bed because the only remedy for a day like this one is to step over it and into the next. She lay on her left side and listened to the town do its night business of settling. She let herself think, for three breaths and not four, of the thing she would say when the woman arrived in the kind of place where walls have more practice. After three breaths she thought of soup, and she slept.Chapter 7

Morning did not so much arrive as take attendance. It stood at each window and named what was behind it, ticked boxes for geraniums and paperbacks and shoes left beside doors by people who had come home too tired to put them anywhere sensible. It placed a small cross next to Lady’s kitchen where the plant that refused to die had gained a new leaf without asking permission. The kettle breathed steam that smelled faintly of ghosted tea. The letter opener lay where she had left it, demure on the sill as if it had only ever been a thing for invitations and never for prying at the lids of dangerous days. The town had the look of having made an effort. Bins were aligned. Recycling boxes sat with their throats tilted at the same angle like a choir that had been told to raise their chins. A man Lady did not know but recognized waved from the end of the lane in that British way that acknowledged both your existence and the need not to detain it.

Alan rang at eight because eight is when people who do not wish to be cruel disturb other people’s quiet. His voice was the one he used when there had been a small victory and the city had not yet arranged a thunderclap. “We’ve got the paper,” he said, and the way he said paper made it sound heavier than the word deserved. “The magistrate was amenable to the boring argument. We go up the hill at eleven with a key that is polite and another one that is not. I would like you there in your capacity as person-who-sees. Only if you want to be. Only if you can spare yourself the looking.”

“I have fifteen minutes at ten with a child who coughs more at night than day and a man who thinks his knee is Brexit,” Lady said, making a list of her morning in front of her without writing it down. “After which, yes. I will come. I will be dull if you need dull and brave if you need brave and a teapot if there is nothing better to be.”

“We do not need brave,” he said. “We need a witness whose pulse has learned to stand up at inopportune moments. We need somebody who will tell me when I call a thing what it is not. And we need your nose for the theatre.”

They arrived at the house in the kind of convoy that had practiced minimizing its own drama. The car that looked like a shoe was elsewhere; the track up the hill bore the record of it, a new smear folded over older smears like a palimpsest written by tyres. Up close, the house was ordinary to the point of insult. It had the echo of a bell that no longer rang, the memory of children’s voices packed into its corners and asleep there. The school sign had been sanded and painted over by someone who did not like to see the past peeking through, which meant, of course, that a sensible person could still read it. The barn bones showed in the roofline if you stood at the correct angle and squinted, the way history obliges if you insist.

Alan did introductions the way a host does, putting people in relation to one another so that when they bumped elbows they would not spill. The woman officer with patient boots nodded to Lady with the particular relief of a person who has been told that a difficult element will be handled by someone whose hands have done their learning elsewhere. The locksmith produced a case with the sort of quiet flourish that only a locksmith can pull off, manipulation of thresholds being as close to magic as we permit one another in daylight. The polite key announced itself and was ignored. The impolite key made short work and refused to gloat.

Inside was the smell Lady had anticipated without wanting to: lavender and dust and the artificial brightness of something that never belonged outdoors pretending to be the field beyond. There were shoes by the door that would have fooled nobody who had seen their like in a charity shop; they were size and shape and genderless in that way things purchased to be costumes are. The hall was the tidy of someone who believes tidiness is the same as goodness. The stairs had learned to accept quiet feet. There were pictures that had come with the frames, boats no one had sailed on seas they did not own, fruit bowls in a kitchen that did not like fruit. The main room, when they opened it, was the museum people tell themselves they would never build except here it was, without blood, without gore, without the theatrical cruelty of wet. Jars stood on shelves that had been affixed by a hand that knew a spirit level and liked its bubble to cough at the exact centre. They were empty of contents and full of sound.

It was not impossible, the way the sound came; it was petty, which is worse. Somewhere behind the skirting board a low speaker hummed a loop of rain that had been recorded too close to a drainpipe, the rush of it not the open field but the constriction of metal. When the jars trembled, it was not because anyone had put a string of nerves through their necks and plucked, it was because bass moves air and air likes to be seen to obey. Lady moved along the shelves with her hands half lifted as if to stroke a patient and not. She saw labels that had been written and peeled and rewritten, shards of names clinging in the glue like ghosts of vowels. She saw a line of buttons, blue, arranged by size on a ribbon like pupils in a science lesson about evolution. She saw the blue glitter that had escaped, stuck to the part of the glass the air could find, making each jar seem to wear a faint ring of frost. There were no tokens that any honest court would call flesh.

On a table that had once been a desk where a girl had learned to write w in the shape of two mountains was a stack of papers. The top sheet was the receipt from the ribbon shop, the childish arrow pointing at the hour an insult to craft. Underneath it, other papers, older. A school register with names that had been crossed out when families moved or children did not come back from summers elsewhere. A newsletter from the year all the children had been asked to bring jam for a fete and someone had written in looping pen on the margin Bring jars, too, because we will need somewhere to put the pennies. A recipe clipped from a magazine for lemon curd that would never set. A hymn, Be still, my soul, copied in a hand that was not a child’s and not an adult’s, the t’s crossed as lightly as if the weight of ink could injure.

“Do you need to sit?” Alan asked in the voice people use when they mean to ask without making the answer a test. Lady shook her head because sitting would have made the room own her legs. She moved instead to the small writing table pushed under the window. There the neatness broke in two places. A drawer stuck where it had been pushed too hard and the handle had given up dignity. Inside, the letter paper smelled of lavender because someone had insisted on that once and the scent had sworn never to leave. Underneath the stack a corner of a photograph peered, reluctant, like a person who has been caught eavesdropping. Lady used the edge of a ruler to ease it up without leaving oil. It was not the face she had seen at the back of the hall or not cleanly; girls change into women by means of haircuts and teeth and the set of the chin. Eight children in a row held glass jam jars full of daisies, mouths open at something to the left of the camera that had made them laugh. At one end a teacher, young enough to still have knees that wanted to crouch in photographs, and at the other end a girl with a plait that made her look more serious than the moment required. Someone had written Class 3 Summer in a hand that obeyed itself. Someone had later written March on the back in blue ballpoint with the bite of someone reminding themselves how to spell their own life. It might have been a month. It might have been a name. It might have been a joke.

“You see her?” Alan stood a shoulder’s width away because proximity is also a kind of permission, and he was careful with both. Lady did not commit. Faces punched in time refuse to answer if you force it. She needed the slant of a laugh, the recognition of arrogance turned sideways, the seam where a girl had learned to hold her mouth tight enough to be someone else. She shook her head once, not denial but patience. The patient officer took the photograph with the same tenderness with which she might have lifted a baby’s hand to look at a rash. The rooms upstairs turned out to be cupboards of costume. Blue, yes, in a dozen shades that had only one word among them, because the people who bought the fabric had not the time for sapphire or ultramarine, navy or azurine. Scarves that disguised hair and jackets that disguised elbows. Shoes that did not squeak. There was a box of ribbons sorted by width the way only rage sorts things.

In the kitchen, a saucepan cooled that had not boiled anything for two days. The bin had been emptied in the style of a person who believes emptiness is the same as innocence. The fridge contained three yoghurts and a wedge of cheese wrapped in a prideful parcel of greaseproof paper. A square of blue glitter had found its way into the butter. On the back step was an old milk crate that did not belong to the house and a little pile of stones that had been arranged and rearranged and, had you been a person whose work was to find pattern, would have troubled you in an unscientific way.

They took everything that paper can hold that will not turn to ash between one room and another. They left the jars for the second team because there is a kind of care you must take with the places people have told themselves are altars. Lady stood on the threshold for a time longer than she intended and then stepped out because staying would have lowered her faster than a sleep she had not chosen. On the track down a neighbour with arms like fence posts pretended to find weeds in his verge that needed urgent attention and then gave up pretending. “Did you get her then?” he asked, and when Alan said not yet in a tone like a gate closing and opening, the neighbour nodded as if he had thought decent policemen extinct and had been wrong. “She put notes in our bins,” he added, and showed the kind of mortified grin men wear when they have tolerated the intolerable because they didn’t want to be in a story. “Not for us, I don’t think. For herself. Something about pick up Thursdays and a small blue heart, like a teenager. She never smudged when she wrote. That’s how you know a person’s not normal. Everyone smudges sometimes.”

At the surgery Carol’s mother arrived at two thirty with a song half-finished and a biscuit tin disguised as something else acting as handbag. She wore a cardigan that knew her shoulders better than any person had and shoes that apologized for having to be work to put on. She sat with her hands folded in her lap as if one of them might misbehave if not supervised. “I heard the singing,” she said, without prompting, once the cuff was round her arm and had taught it the trick of squeezing and release. “I like the bit where you go after somebody else and you find yourself even though you thought you were lost. My Elsie says I shouldn’t watch the news because it makes my nose run and my head thick and I tell her I raised her to be right and it’s rude to tell me so in that tone. Are my numbers good, Doctor?”

“They are beautiful,” Lady said, making the numbers into adjectives because sometimes it helps. “You could cross the road on them. You could hang pictures on them. You could argue with them when they get silly. Shall we call the biscuits medicine and eat them ceremonially in the waiting room so Carol can scold us both?”

They did, with the solemnity of a national ritual, and Carol did scold them and then kissed her mother’s hair on the way back to her desk because there are moments you do not keep tidy to prove anything to anyone. The tin gave forth a second layer of paper Lady recognized from her own childhood: the save-for-special kind. Inside were three shortbreads and two squares of something that pretended to be cake and was actually a memory of a neighbor who had baked in war and therefore believed butter should be praised by name each time you used it. They broke the shortbread and watched it fracture into perfect golden geometry, and for a second all three of them were more interested in triangles than in fear.

The dairy man, when she rang, arrived in a van that smelled of metal and cream and the inside of his own mornings. He had a face like a path through an orchard, reliable and rutted, and hands that knew when to pass over the bottles so that the noise of glass in a carrier would not become a nuisance to people still asleep. “I know her by never knowing her,” he said when Lady asked him about the blue-scarf woman, and he laughed to hear himself being the kind of person who said such a thing. “I mean she doesn’t wave. Everyone waves. If you’re on the early run and the light is wrong and you nearly drop a bottle, you wave and they wave back on instinct even if they hate mornings. She doesn’t wave. She gets her bins confused on purpose and likes you to tell her the right thing with a smile so she can look at your teeth and think she knows what kind of person you are. She pays with coins like she’s punishing them for being small. She carries jars from here to there and none of them turn into jam. I tell my wife and she says stop making stories about people and I say the brain makes them anyway, love, it’s what it’s for.”

He wrote the routes for her in his blameless block capitals and left with a promise to beep at her window if he ever thought his crates were going somewhere that didn’t belong to tea. She took the paper and gave it to Alan with the little ceremonious handover that jokes about in films and we rarely get to do in ordinary life. He sent a photograph of it to the patient policewoman who had found the shed, and Lady found she liked the democracy of phones when doing good work; they softened power, if only a fraction, put it in pockets where hands could warm each other over it.

At five, a girl of eight called Bee in a yellow mac that made the day look more cheerful than it was sat on the exam table with the resignation of a person who has suffered a great injustice in the region of throat and nose. She had a jar in her hand she had decorated with star stickers and the last of last Christmas’s curling ribbon. “It’s for rain,” she said, because the school had given her the language Lady had asked them to. “Mrs. Larkin says you can’t keep rain but you can learn from how it moves, and I think rain would like to be kept by me because I always say thank you to it. But Mum says not to put it on the porch because of the woman who likes jars and names, and she said the name, and I told her not to say the name, and she said it again by mistake because that’s how names are, and now the jar has to live under the table and it smells of onions because that is where the onions live. Will the rain be sad under the table?”

Lady looked at the jar and then at Bee’s determined little chin and made a decision in the sort of voice that has more authority than it deserves because it has been used to try to persuade toddlers to let go of the biscuit tin and teenagers to put terrified tongues out for examination. “Rain likes onions,” she said. “Rain likes everything because it is rude to be picky when you are everywhere. Your jar can sit by the back door on the inside, and you can take it out when you and your mother go out together so the rain knows it is in good company. When you have caught enough, you can water a plant with it and say a very short poem of thanks. And then you can wash the jar and start again because jars prefer to have jobs that end.”

Bee nodded because the thing that had been in the way of her small happiness had been made polite. She told Lady her brother had said the jar was stupid and she had said his hair was ridiculous and they had both been told to go outside and run in a square. Lady told her running in a square is underused as a therapy and wrote a note for her mother that recommended it.

She found the envelope under her mat when she went home, tucked the way you tuck something for a friend when you cannot bear to knock. The paper was the lavender that had learned to outlast the flowers it had once been, and the writing was the tidy of someone who has not forgotten any of what the writing teacher said about loops and tails and descenders. She did not open it on the step because she had given herself the rule about not letting doorways hold your body hostage. She put it on the kitchen table and set the letter opener next to it and then turned on the radio to a station that would never tell her anything that bore capital letters. It was something about weather in Brittany and the price of oranges in Naples, and it soothed her hands down into themselves.

The letter said only one thing. It said: I took nothing today. It said it as if it were a gift. Lady wanted to be the kind of person who found the sentence insufficient and then she allowed herself the small, unglamorous happiness of a reprieve. She picked the letter with a fold of paper towel, slipped it into the plastic sleeve she had acquired at the beginning of this new life of hers as an archivist of other people’s appetites, and texted Alan a photograph without commentary because commentary is a way of encouraging the words to think they are running the room. He sent back a period and then the thumbs-up emoji because language has had to learn to share the house with picture-thoughts, too. She made herself a sandwich the way a person on an island makes a fire: carefully, aware that act and appetite are cousins. She cut the bread in triangles because triangles were still true.

On the hill the woman with blue scarf and ordinary hair looked at her own hands and thought of days when she had come home with ink on them and a teacher had smiled in a way that said trouble, but the good sort. The house had given up the jars without a fight because the house had never cared for them. The house had belonged to girls and chalk and the smell of winter shoes warming by radiators built like ribs. She had once taken a jar to school with a chrysanthemum pressed to the inside, the petals looking like something a chef might have cut from a vegetable. The teacher had put it on the windowsill and said it made the room kinder. She could feel the old impulse to cannibalize that kindness. She could feel the old argument with the part of herself she had convinced into believing that hunger is art if you dust it with glitter. She picked up the phone and said hello into it, and a boy answered in the voice of a boy who has never learned to say no to ideas and was ready to lend himself to anything that allowed him to see himself in a new light. She told him to leave a jar with feathers on a doorstep and to write a nice note because everyone likes nice notes. She told him to count to eight and to sing and he sang to her a football chant and she laughed and told him he would do, he would do. And then she put the phone down and looked at the unmade bed and made it because even monsters have domestic moments they cannot argue away.

Friday did not require her melodrama. It came dressed as itself and asked for the usual: the bins discreetly at the edge, the milk to be taken in before cats convened, the paper to be read with toast grease that would stain it and never quite come out. Lady stood by the school gates and watched the tide of small people flow with thirty parents brave in their lanyards, the small shoelaces being tied as if the tying were a spell, the small hands being slept in as if they were pockets. There were blues here because there are always blues. A scarf on a grandmother. A rucksack with a cartoon whale. A child’s tights that had seen better wash powders. The trick, as ever, was to decline all invitations to see symbol and see instead a person and their heavy bag.

She and Mrs. Larkin made their plans in a corner by the noticeboard that offered yoga at the community centre and a cheap piano with a sticky G. Herbs, yes. Jars of rosemary on string and windowsills that smelled like Sunday roast without the argument about whose turn it was to peel. Plastic buttons sorted by feeling and not by size, because feelings deserve as much attention as measurements. A kindness count where each marble dropped into glass was accompanied by a whisper that only the marble would really hear. The parents who would be furious had written their emails and were pleased to have been seen; they would bring their children anyway because nobody boycotts soup. The parents who needed the excuse would come and call it science for the sake of not having to call it fear. The clergy would come and stand with their hands in their pockets like everybody else and ask the church to consider what a song looked like when it wore a jumper.

When the school had been dismissed to the work of keeping itself busy until the next bell and she had done the bureaucratic miracles necessary to keep her list of appointments from occupying the next century, Lady took the fourteen minutes she had between a diabetic foot and a baby with teeth trying their best to erupt out of schedule and sat with the notebook that had been her mother’s. Buy bread, she wrote, absurd and necessary. Bring tins to Clara for plant risers, because saucers are scarce. Call Mr. Tiler about the serpentine crack in the surgery floor that had grown a personality and wanted attention. She added, as an afterthought that was also a vow, If she writes, do not answer in the voice she wants.

The blue showed itself twice that day with the carelessness of people who do not know they are staging. A girl at the bus stop had painted her nails with glitter over a base that had given up, the effect one of effort on top of tiredness. A boy in the park had a yo-yo that flashed blue when it moved, and the string barely survived the day because small wrists find ways to tangle everything. Lady refused the invitations these things offered and smiled at the girl’s nails because they were a sort of bravery and told the boy his yo-yo had better manners than any yo-yo she’d known, which made him grin and show her how it slept, a trick she had never learned.

The letter arrived at four with the post that had resigned itself to being less vital than phones and more reliable than news. It contained a list that could have been written by Mrs. Larkin in a different mood: London’s Burning, Frère Jacques, Heads and Shoulders, Rain Song. Sing alone, it said, in a simplicity that pretended not to know what it was asking. Midnight, it said, as if midnight were only a time and not a trick. Bring lid-lifter, it said, with the affectionate audacity of a person sure she could turn even the tool into a prop. Alan read it and swore when he thought he was alone and then didn’t when he remembered the walls have been listening longer than either of them. He sent two officers to the wood in the afternoon disguised as people with a flask and the sort of shoes you wear to look competent in fields. He told the foxes he was sorry through the medium of not stepping on their habitual paths.

The day closed in that kind way that Mondays never manage. The light did not dramatize its leaving. The town allowed itself to become transparent and then opaque with a soft tidy. Lady took a walk that had no location other than the places in her head that needed to be tamped down with the heel of a hand. She found herself at the canal where teenage boys taught each other to spit into water without making faces and an old man watched a swan throw its arrogance about and nodded in private approval. The ribbon shop owner had put a sign in the window that said Twine Special and looked ill at ease with her own cheerfulness. When she saw Lady she gave a serious kind of wave and then came out with a bag. Inside were three spools of brown string that smelt like storerooms and two of the cheap glitter-glue pens that had led them all here. “For the children,” she said. “For the jars. The proper jars. If anybody asks why, tell them I said sometimes the thing you fear gets fed better and it stops rattling.”

Night arrived at the hill house just as the fox scolded the dark for showing off. The woman placed two jars on a table and put her ear down to them experimentally as if she could coax a note. She had been denied the duet she asked for and did not know if she was disappointed or pleased; both had their uses. Denial meant escalation with impunity, the justified flamboyance of a thwarted artist. Denial meant she could tell herself the story in which she was brave. She wrote a final letter with less lavender than the paper would have liked and directed it in an old-fashioned hand that would fool nobody whose job it was to be fooled. Ready? it said again, because she liked the pregnant pose of the word; it was how she imagined brides felt just before someone told them to walk. She addressed it to a woman who had made a life out of telling fear to get down off the table and help chop onions. She lit no candle because candles are so beloved by people who need to perform feeling, and she preferred the electrics, honest and bright and unforgiving. Then she went to the wood in a coat that did not belong to her shoulders and stood where the children’s fort had collapsed and hummed the note you hum to a kettle to persuade it to boil.

Lady did not go. She went to bed on purpose and lay on her left side because it made her heart feel as if it were leaning against something that would not give. She listened to the police car idling three streets over for luck. She listened to the neighbor’s cat threaten the fox and then apologize with its tail. She listened to Mrs. Larkin’s text arrive and say simply We will make rosemary oil next week, yes? She listened to her own breath teach her its rhythm a second time in case she had forgotten. She was not asleep when the phone rang. She simply refused to be arranged by its urgency for three whole pulses of her own blood. When she answered, it was Alan, and the strain in his voice was not danger so much as the effort of holding all the nouns of a town in his two hands without dropping any.

“She sent a boy,” he said, and the careful kind of quiet he wrapped around it told her we were in something that would need verbs. “Copycat. Feathers in a jar with the stupid heart. Left it on a step. The family had the good sense to laugh at it. He cried when I knocked and confessed as if he had been waiting all day to confess to someone who had a pen. He will not do it again. We took the jar. The wood is quiet and remains itself. If she is there she is the kind of ghost that does not change temperature.”

“Good,” Lady said, then corrected herself because good is a word with too many hats. “Not good, but human. My letter says ready.”

“It always does,” he said, and she heard him pour the last of his coffee down the sink not because it was cold but because he had remembered his heart. “We have her house. We have her glue and her receipt and her jars. We do not have her. We will. In the meantime, will you come to the office at nine tomorrow and let me read you a list and tell me which names, if any, are not nouns anymore? There’s a teacher. There’s a lunch lady. There’s a girl in that old photo whose plait looks like a rope. There’s a March, which might be a word or a month or the sound a foot makes. I need your ear.”

“I will bring biscuits,” Lady said, because carrying something you can eat together is a superstition and sometimes superstitions are scaffolding. “I will bring the letter opener and not use it. I will bring a jar that smells of rosemary and lemon, and we will make the office smell like a kitchen where people choose to live.”

She slept after that, properly, the way bodies do when minds have accepted that there is nothing to be done in the next three hours that cannot be done better with daylight. The town tucked itself in, even those parts that convinced themselves they needed to walk the dark to prove something. The fox screamed, and she did not wake. The jars in the empty house chilled in their own shadows and hummed not because anyone asked them to but because houses make their own weather and glass is an obedient instrument. On the mantel, the photograph of Class 3 Summer looked at the room with the unflinching stare of children who have not yet been told that photographs can hold things still and that sometimes stasis is a trap. In the wood, the woman counted to eight and back again and thought how exhausting it had become to be interesting and wondered, inconveniently and with irritation at herself, whether soup, taken in company, would have smothered this hunger before it had found its shape. She shook the thought away because her story did not have room for its own cure. Then she tapped a jar with a fingernail, a tiny, precise click, and told herself it sounded like rain.Chapter 9

The police station had the defeated cheer of a village hall after a fete, streamers of notices clinging to cork boards, a confiscated skateboard leaning against a radiator as if it wished to be rehabilitated. Alan had claimed a meeting room that had once been a kitchen and was now only the memory of tea stains. He had asked someone to bring the good mugs and then apologized to the mugs as if he had set them a task beyond their station. Lady put her jar of rosemary and lemon on the table and the air took its cue at once, shedding the stale smell of carpet for a kitchen that had known Sundays. She set down the biscuits with the officiousness of a nurse arranging a tray, and for a moment they both let the objects be what they were and not the props fear turns them into when it gets its hands on a day.

He began to read names without drama, not with the courtroom cadence of accusation but with the farmer’s practice of inventory. There were teachers who had become other things and lunch ladies with surnames that sounded like the fields they had walked to get to work and a deputy head who had emigrated to a country where people pretend they do not keep jars because cupboards mean different things there. There was a Miss March on the list, because of course there was, a neat name with its own logic, and Alan set his finger on it as if to weigh it without bruising the fruit. “Miss March,” he said, trying the month in his mouth and finding the chalk of it drying his tongue. “Class 3 in ninety-eight and ninety-nine. Left to care for a mother, no forwarding address, the school changed hands and the records went to boxes in a room that leaks. We have an address for a brother in Reading who says he doesn’t read his post.”

Lady did not take the bait of narrative. She looked at the name until it lost boldness, until it became lines and humours, and then she glanced back at the photograph of the row of daisies and the girl at the end with the plait that made her look as if she believed in a rule book. “Miss March could have written March on the back of a photo because she wanted to teach the word the way months are taught,” she said. “Or a child with a pen and the thrill of ink could have practiced a word that feels like walking. Or the woman who writes to me could have gone back and written a clue because she wants to be the kind of person who leaves them. The problem with tidy things is that we assume they intend themselves.”

He accepted it with a tilt of the head like a man adjusting his cap to a change in weather. “There’s also a Marian Archer on the payroll, different year, support staff, who would have been young and might not be now. She disappears around the same time we lose Miss March. M. Archer does a curious thing when you squint. Rowan insists everything is a puzzle that can be completed if you only stand on the chair and look down at it. I am telling him that standing on chairs in a room full of glass is a bad habit.” He spread out the photocopies of staff lists that had been bleached by the machine into the shade of clouds on a day that cannot commit to rain. “Here is the bit that matters, perhaps,” he added, tapping a line that stated, in the bored typeface of municipal forms, that Miss March ran a jar stall at the summer fair two years running and organized a rain collection experiment in the science week that same spring. “Here she is doing what you are now doing and not eating the world while she does it.”

“We love our own ideas too much,” Lady said, and she watched him take the sentence as he takes tea, with a wince and then a second sip. “If this is her, she has taken something that once made sense for children and put it in a room where it only makes sense to one person in a blue scarf. I do not want your team to knock on doors and tell the town that jars are wicked. I want you to knock and tell them jars can be soup. If you find her and she turns out to be Miss March or Marian or somebody else entirely, you will need to be careful of the giant story waiting on the other side. It is not the job of a court to run on fairy tales. You must not let her become a month.”

He smiled without pleasure because she had named the thing that had kept him awake without giving it a large word to take cover under. “We’ll talk to the brother,” he said, and wrote it down as if it had been his thought all along, which he had learned to do with the ideas of people he trusted. “We’ll talk to a man who taught her to use a lathe because there’s a certificate in here for a woodwork course, and to a woman who worked with her in the lunchroom and remembers burns. We will not announce a witch hunt when what we need is a tired walk down a list.”

They ate biscuits with attention, because if you are to do a job that requires you to tell people they are ordinary when they have made themselves enormous you need sugar and the honesty of crumbs. Lady poured rosemary into her palm and breathed it, half for herself, half for the room, and then she tucked the jar back into her bag so it would not be mistaken for an exhibit. “I’ll be at the plant shop at noon with Clara,” she said, as casually as if it did not matter to the machinery of the day. “She needs pots and permission and saucers. Join us if you want to watch a woman memorize the shape of living things again.”

The plant shop had the humid hush of a chapel, its congregation lined in plastic that pretended to be terracotta until something watered in it died. Rosemary made itself available in small herds, the parsley looked like haircuts, and thyme tried to be modest and failed. Clara turned up in a coat that did not quite belong to her yet and shoes chosen by somebody who worried about slips. She ran her hand over the rosemary as if checking for a fever and looked at the leaves with the seriousness of a woman who had once believed in nothing aromatic, only in the cleanliness of bleach. “This one is a name that doesn’t feel like it was stolen,” she said, and then began to apologize for saying something poetic and stopped herself because permission is a muscle and hers had begun to remember its uses.

Lady did not go looking for the word brave in Clara’s face because that would have been theft. She lifted three small pots into a tray the way she had once lifted a child onto a scale: gently, with an apology for the indignity of the thing and a promise it would be over quickly. “You’ll need a drain and something to catch what leaves,” she said. “We’ll use jars for risers because saucers have all left town and you are not to be punished for the crockery’s love of adventure. You will water more than you think you need to and then less, and you will forgive yourself because all of us must learn the trick of being plants’ friends after being their jailers.”

Clara smiled, and the smile was not a flag but a folded napkin laid on a table that might hold food again. “I could not come to the singing,” she said, and Lady did not ask why because some things are not questions. “I walked in the corridor while it happened and measured how much my body wanted to be two rooms at once. The nurse walked with me and we passed the corner where the machine that pretends to be a lung hums and I told it I did not need it and it hummed anyway. Today I will take these redundant jellies home,” she added, patting the rosemary as if it had introduced itself by an old-fashioned name. “And I will not put them where the jar might have been.”

Because the day had learned not to showy itself off, Carol’s mother was there with a purse that felt heavier than money and a piece of advice about soil delivered like a recipe in the shape of a complaint. The plant man made change slowly because his honesty required him to count both out loud and inward. The door rang because a schoolchild wanted succulents and the schoolchild’s father wanted to be told, with great authority, that succulents die when you look at them with impatience. Lady watched the hands in the room more than she watched the jars on the shelf behind the counter. There was beauty in the way people touched the living and the things that will hold the living. It gave her a one-inch relief from negotiating with a woman who had learned to make hunger look like an art.

Alan did not join them because the brother who did not read his post had finally answered a door and started a story. He had the look of a man who had been the kind of boy who never took a jacket because the weather should be doing him favors. He had a house where the clocks were wrong by the same amount in different rooms because he had not attended to any of them with his muscles or his kindness. Miss March, he said, had been Elsie then and had taught a bit because she had a tolerable voice and could keep children in their places without frightening them. Marian, he said, had been a cousin, or possibly an aunt, whose name their mother liked to put in front of strangers because it had more syllables than Elsie and looked better in ink. He did not remember the year their mother had died but could tell you how to repair an engine with a bread knife, and the mismatch would have been funny if it had not kept her out of danger. He had not read his post because it came with requests in it. He had not heard from Elsie in four Christmases and had not missed her in a way he could identify because missing had never been the sport his family trained for. “She liked tidy,” he offered, because he had seen the room twist to make this relevant. “She liked those jars with the clip,” he added, and then made a motion with his hand as if clipping his own thought shut.

The minute after he took Lady’s call, he sent her a message with two words: not helpful, which always meant, with Alan, helpful enough to require us to change the angle of the problem. She went back to the surgery with the rosemary and put one pot on the sill so the waiting room could have something that did not tell it what to feel. The jar of rosemary oil lived behind Reception with the stamps and a scandalous little pair of scissors that had been bought with petty cash and therefore smelled faintly of injustice. Carol had painted her nails a color that was not quite orange and not quite bravery, and when Lady raised an eyebrow at them in admiration, Carol plucked a leaf from the rosemary and held it under her nose and they both breathed and pretended not to.

The ribbon shop called with a voice that told you what kind of ribbon you needed before you had made any decisions. The owner used the word she like a cat letting itself be seen in the corner of a room. “She came,” she said, and it felt like a confession. “Not by name. Not with anything you can take to a person with a hat and a notebook. She bought twine in a mood and took the kind with the blue fleck so that she could feel clever later, and she left a jar with buttons and a heart, as if I had never sold a button in my life. There is the car,” she added in the way of the world now, and sent a photograph where the shape of the boot was distinctive enough to be the kind of ugliness only a manufacturer imagines. The plate was visible and almost kind; a smear of dirt omitted one number as if disagreements had gone on in a lane. Alan took it and did not promise anything the day could not give. He sent a young officer to sit on a bench across from the shop and learn the way the light behaved when it struck the glass, not because the light would confess but because watching teaches patience.

School poured another small district of children onto the pavement and Lady stood where she had no official right and welcomed their noise. Mrs. Larkin had organized a kindness count on the sly, a jar with marbles near the door and a notice that had no clip art and therefore did not disturb the eye. You whispered what you had done and dropped a marble, and the sound it made was not applause but something regular and pleasing, the clink of a rule that wanted to be kept. A small boy whose shoes never tied wanted to put in two for having not punched someone and for having put litter in a bin that was not his, and Mrs. Larkin told him he could put in one and tell the other to his mother, which is a kind of economy schools still practice when they can.

A letter waited at home with an address that pretended to be her own writing. The paper still smelled of the lavender somebody had decided would make the world more forgiving. The note was worse, in its way, than appetite or hearts. It was a list of the school songs with three of the wrong words corrected, and a small drawing of a lid-lifter that could have been a dagger if you wanted it to be, and a time that pretended midnight was a suggestion and not an instruction. Bring soup, it said next, in handwriting that tilted hopefully. Bring your pot, it added, which was the kind of joke people make who want you to believe they know you. She did not ring Alan at once because she wanted to see if a single minute in which she did not hand over the words would make her feel disloyal. It did not, and after a minute she sent a photograph and a description of her own temper, and he texted back with a sentence that tried to be tired and honest at once: You’re right that she wants theatre, we will not play at knives and you will not go.

There was a small crowd at the church for Songs at Sundown again, less because Mrs. Larkin posted anything and more because the town had decided to put itself in a room where the roof could keep an eye on it. The vicar had learned to lean silently. The organist thumped out a tune and then apologized for thumping and did it better the second time, which is all anyone can ask of resilience. Lady stood with her back to the pillar and caught the blue not as a flag but as a mood. The grandmother with the scarf was there and the scarf decided to be the color of sky near the horizon when you have not decided if you trust it. The woman’s hands were gloved, because churchmen do not pay enough to heat stone for modern winters, and because gloves are costumes if you choose to make them so.

After, because parents could be asked to stack chairs hand over hand without calling it labour, the room emptied and only Lady and Mrs. Larkin and the habit of tea were left. The organist found an envelope under a music book because that is where envelopes go when they like to pretend they arrived by accident, and handed it to Lady with an expression like a man passing a nettle that does not deserve to sting. Alan materialized from somewhere he had promised not to be because sometimes promises are hard and laws soft. He read the note that said the old thing in a new way, and he and Lady shared the look that married people must share when a child has discovered a way to make rules and experiments the same trick. “We’ll not go,” he said out loud so the wood would hear it. “We’ll send our poor foxes a patrol and we’ll spend our midnight doing the job of sleeping.”

People do not sleep when told to do so by policemen. They sleep because they have taught themselves that the body is a pot you set on simmer so that you can wake to soup. Lady went home and set her lids on, not the ones Marie had made a noun of, but the ones she had learned as a child, eyes down, breath slow, thoughts counted like laundry pegs to see if any were missing. At half past ten the phone rang in a way that told her it was not Alan. She answered because not answering also becomes a kind of ritual, and she did not want to teach her hands any new tricks.

The voice was not as smooth as it wanted to be. It had the scrape of someone who has not used ordinary words for ordinary things recently and cannot find their ankles in their own sentences. “You will come to my museum,” the woman said, and she sounded almost bored, the boredom of an artist with an audience who has stopped cheering. “They are opening my room for me, I can hear it. The door breathed because you breathed on the radio. Bring your spoon.”

“It is not your museum,” Lady said, and she made her voice the kind that could spread butter without tearing the bread. “It is a school with different curtains. You left your jars there and we will decant them into bins because jars remember what you make them for, not what you want them to be. You sound tired.”

There was a ripple of interest at being seen with a small word rather than a large one. “Is that your trick?” the woman said, and she had a laugh that had been borrowed from women who have to flatter men for the price of their own safety. “You will call me small names until I become a lapdog who eats orange peel. I want you to hear me sing.”

“I hear you,” Lady said, and she allowed herself a small unlovely kindness, because it is possible to be kind even to a person you will help lock in a room for the safety of children. “You are humming someone else’s song and claiming it. Your museum is empty of anything that will stand up under lights. You’re afraid of daylight because it asks you to bring your own chair and sit like you belong. Come to surgery in the morning; bring your hands. We will look at them and decide what work you can do that isn’t this. Or don’t. Your letter today said you took nothing, and it was the first useful thing you have said to me. Consider doing that again. Consider doing nothing for a week. It is a discipline and you like those.”

Silence came with its own breath. Then a small, real sound, the sound a person makes when they are surprised by finding the corner of their own mouth, an inconvenience when you want to be a statue. “I will teach you to be interesting,” she said eventually, but there was less starch in it. “Midnight,” she added, because she couldn’t leave without the flourish, and the call ended not with a click but with the flatness of somebody who had not learned to say goodbye. Lady looked at the ceiling and then at the letter opener on the sill and then at her own hands, which remain useful however they insist on knowing the shape of a knife.

The wood did what woods do. Foxes argued with owls about the right to name the dark, and teenagers cut through the path because teenagers belong to the geometry of shortcuts. Two officers in shoes that pretended not to be boots stayed back far enough to be considered polite by any animal of rank. The woman came and she did not come; the place held both truths as woods do. A ribbon hung from a branch with the kind of competence that comes from practice, and a tag told a story about counting. The officers photographed it and refused to let themselves be cast as audience. A boy in a hood came to leave a jar with feathers because someone on a screen had told him that bravery required a prop; he was interrupted, very gently, by a voice that asked him if he would like to live his life without the word regret knocking at him at four in the morning. He cried and went home and threw away his jar and in thirty years he will remember the shame as a boundary that saved him more than once.

Saturday was the market, and Lady went because produce has its own grammar and an honest one. The boy with the violin stood dutifully by the bakery and made the tune he knew useful to the bakery’s idea of itself. The florists had a sign that said 3 DAFFS £1 and the misspelling had to do with haste and not ignorance. The ribbon shop owner had decided to put raffia in a basket where it could look helpful instead of everywhere looking omnipresent. The blue scarf showed itself once and did not stay. It belonged to a woman who asked the butcher for mince in a voice that had not asked anyone for anything in a long time and may not have been our woman after all, for quiet has a thousand faces and only a few of them belong to hungry things.

Alan sent a message at noon asking if she had twenty minutes to look at old papers under bad light, and she did because good work often happens in rooms that smell of two old colognes and a winter coat that has known dogs. He had found, with the help of a woman from the council who collects minutes not because she loves bureaucracy but because she despises loss, a newsletter from the year the school had closed. There was a note thanking Miss March for service with an awkward phrasing that spoke of money where there wasn’t any and an awkwardness around what to call a woman who had had to be three jobs to make the school end the day. There was a photograph of the jam stall with a sign in a child’s hand that said JARS 20p, and beneath it the small signature of a child called Marie in a loop that would be copied later by someone who needed handles. “What if your woman took a name from a stall sign,” Alan said, and the admission that myths have cheap births made him shake a little with fury and relief. “What if she was never a Marie and stole the placard off a trestle and wore it because it didn’t belong to anyone that mattered.”

“Then she is even smaller than I hope,” Lady said, and she allowed herself to wish for it because wishing is not planning. “Which makes her more dangerous, because small people with large myths will gnaw at anything until they have made a hole they can climb through. We will not help her climb.”

The violin boy played something that wanted to be a lullaby and the town listened because it wanted permission without asking for it. The jar in Lady’s bag clinked against the letter opener and the sound was ordinary, not a spell. She went to the plant shop again to buy rosemary for Mrs. Larkin to hang upside down in the classroom, because hanging herbs is a thing that makes rooms sensible. She took Clara a stack of tins for plant risers because Clara had admitted to hoarding tins like a magpie hoards excuses. She told Carol’s mother a lie about a card game being good for the wrists so that she would sit with a pack of cards and her daughter and deal until the kitchen felt like the kind of clinic where feelings can be touched without getting burned.

The house on the hill had become the kind of place people take drives to if they are the type that attend to addresses where bad things have been overheard. Alan stood at the end of the track and asked them to go away in a voice that had the grammar of Please and the punctuation of No, and because he had brought tea in a thermos and looked like a man who needed to keep the air simple, they went. He was thinking of March, he could admit to Lady because they had shared the word so openly there was no point pretending it had not crept under the door. He was thinking of Marian and of Elsie and of what happens old-fashionedly to girls who are praised for neatness and told they are sensible and then are left alone with their appetites when nobody offers them work that fits their hands. He was thinking of Rowan, who was at that moment telling a friend not to be stupid on the internet and hating himself for how much like a father he sounded as he said it.

Night, when it came, didn’t bring a letter; it brought a silence that had courage in it. Lady sat at her table and wrote three things in her mother’s notebook that were not a plan but were a promise. Bring jars to school. Keep herbs in the waiting room. Refuse invitations. The plant that refused to die would not be watered until morning because even plants deserve to be told, you can wait, we do not have to answer everything at once. She washed her hands and put the letter opener away because leaving knives out is the kind of untidiness that invites trouble and not interest. She thought very briefly of the woman in the blue scarf standing in a wood and counting to eight, and then she thought of marbles and soup and the noise chairs make when they are folded up by hands that love them, and that was the tune she took to bed.Chapter 10

Morning announced itself with a cough rather than a fanfare, a small throat-clearing over the roofs to say the air had ideas and none of them were melodrama. Lady let the kettle recite its old story and cut bread with the letter opener because it was long and thin and made a virtue of slicing without crumbs, and sometimes a tool needs reminding it was not born for theatre. The rosemary on her sill had forgiven the radiators and made a new sprig out of stubbornness, and she pinched it and the plant swore and then pretended it had not because plants like to be brave for other people. She put the jar of rosemary oil in her bag with the stethoscope and the fudge for Mr. Hughes’s diabetes bribery plan and wrote three small things in the notebook in the kitchen that had stopped trying to be anybody else’s: ring Reading, ask about March, find the tea towel with strawberries before Carol’s mother calls it evidence and steals it for her kitchen.

By ten, the surgery had opened its mouth and swallowed a morning whole. A woman came with a thumb split on the edge of a tin and a tale that should have been more about attention and less about beans, and Lady put the bits of skin in a neat figure of eight and told the thumb it would remember its job if it stopped sulking. A man announced that his knee was the victim of policy and Lady asked if it ached more uphill or downhill and he forgot to make his argument for a second in order to be a person with tendons, which is sometimes the only victory possible before lunch. A child with a cough confessed it once barked and was now a goat and Lady nodded because animal metaphors have their own pharmacology, and wrote a bottle for a syrup that tasted more of medicine than of childhood, which is, in the end, what sympathies are for.

Alan rang between cough and goat to say a brother had said a name and then another man had said a cousin and both had the slippery feel of story turned into mud. He sounded as if he had slept and then reconsidered it. “Elsie March is a person with a room full of other people’s names,” he said, unconsoled by having given the idea its sentence. “Marian Archer is a shadow you can fit your hand through unless your hand has been taught by the school office to read handwriting that no longer exists. And the paper said a thing about the jam stall that will not leave my head because there’s a child’s heart on the bottom of one of the signs as if she practiced the shape until it behaved.”

“Paper tells you patterns to soothe itself,” Lady said. “You are not obliged to agree. Come at noon. I have a pot of rosemary that needs insulting and a woman called Bee who promised to bring her rain jar to show me it is now on inside duty and no longer in the path of myth. We will look at names together and decide which of them are sturdy and which will behave like milk on a sunny doorstep.”

He came at half past, which was a kind of politeness because it meant he had waited fifteen minutes on purpose somewhere he would have rather moved, and he brought Rowan who carried a box labelled GLOVES with the pride of a youth who has been asked to ferry something that might undo danger. Rowan’s hair had made its own plan for the day and had not consulted his head. He took apart the printer again as if it had written him a rude note and whispered apologies to its rollers in a way Lady tried not to find endearing because she had decided not to get attached to anyone who could reach the top shelf without standing on a chair.

They sat with the names in the way you sit with a basket of buttons and look for pairs without being tricked by size. Marian Archer turned into M. Archer turned into Marcher in someone’s tidy blue ink and Lady felt the small click her mind made when it liked a coincidence too much and told it no, like a terrier with its nose under the gate. Elsie lived in the memories of people who had never used the words archive or crawling but could tell you which cupboard the hymn books had gone to and who had cried the day the coffee machine took pound coins. “She wore blue because Miss Larkin—she used to be Miss then—said it suited her,” said Mrs. Dean on the phone in a voice that sounded like a chalkboard kept in a cupboard, dignified and dusty. “She was tidy with the jars at the fair because children make anything sticky and she didn’t mind being the one to wash it off. She had a plait that gave her a headache. She liked to label things because she said labels rescued you at the end of a day. I don’t know where she went. The last thing I said was that the jars wanted to see the sun and we laughed, and if I had known that would be the last thing I would have said something else, but that is not how memory works.”

“Would you recognize her if she walked past your window wearing a sensible scarf?” Lady asked, looking at the rosemary as if it were going to help.

“I would recognize the way she holds her mouth when she has made herself behave,” Mrs. Dean said, and Lady wrote down that sentence and wished to leave it at that and then did not, because wishing is a noun.

The shop that sold ribbon had written Alan about a car and when he showed the photograph to Lady, she recognized it as the kind of shape a boot takes when its designer had been angry at a circle. The number plate was missing a smudge and the smudge had been made by rain, which is the sort of polite complicity the weather sometimes offers to a detective who behaves. Alan sent it to another room with the confidence of a man who has learned to expect his good fortune in increments. Meanwhile, a man from Reading called him back to say Elsie had not visited their mother when she was dying and he could not forgive her for her kindness in mail and not in person, which told Lady a little and told Alan not very much.

Bee arrived in a mac and the solemnity of a person whose jar had been given living quarters. She put it on Lady’s desk with the care given to newts and told the rain it had been good and it might have onions again next week if it behaved. She asked Rowan if he would like to hold it because he looked like a person who needed to prove he could be gentle, and he held it with both hands and the look of a person who was practicing not dropping other people’s weather. “We’re making rosemary oil at school to rub on our wrists when we want to count to eight without using a name,” Bee said, and the words came out in order because Mrs. Larkin had taught them that order is not the same as control. “Mrs. Larkin says when you breathe and smell at the same time your body remembers you have a nose and a job. The boys call it witch, which is rude and boring, and then they ask for a second sniff.”

“Tell Mrs. Larkin I approve of witchery that uses kitchen herbs and not the names of girls who went missing from bus stops,” Lady said, and Bee nodded as if to say, naturally, because children accept that adults do not need telling to be sensible until proven otherwise. The jar clinked against Lady’s letter opener where it lay momentarily on the desk and Bee frowned at the letter opener in disapproval, because children know when you have asked a tool to do a job outside its job description and always prefer contracts to be honoured.

The first sign of the next trick arrived just after two, disguised as thrift. Carol brought in a jar from the waiting room corner with a little Bluetooth speaker hidden under a layer of buttons that looked like harmless nostalgia. It had been left among a new pile of leaflets that smelled of toner and the optimism of designers. When she lifted it, rain began to play, not outdoors rain but recorded pipe rain, and then a girl’s voice repeated a name as if she were asking it to come in from the step. The air in the surgery made a decision to become cold at the back of people’s necks and then remembered Lady in the same room and decided against learning any new tricks. “She thinks she can live in our ears now,” Carol said, her mouth giving the words more jaw than they needed. “Shall I put this with the buns and pretend it arrived with the post?”

“We will treat it like all bad recipes,” Lady said, and they unplugged the little egg and put it in a plastic bag that made the cheerful noise all plastic makes when it gets to say, look at me, I am keeping something contained. Alan came with the bag in a box as if he were christening it and shook his head not to say no at the surgery for having caught the idea so fast but because he had hoped they had not arrived at the ostinato of sound. “Another in a florist,” he said, and the florist appeared at the door, hair full of the greenery of his day, and gave Lady a look that said, I wanted flowers to have only one job, I did not ask for this second career, and she gave him back a look that said, we are all doing two jobs now and we will have soup after.

By three, a woman came in with a rash that insisted on being the shape of leaves. She had the humidity of anxiety and the careful way of sitting that belongs to people who suspect a trap and will not be caught putting their elbows on it. She wore a scarf the color of a sky that wants to apologize for last week. Her hands were gloved and she removed one glove for Lady with an almost-dainty pinch that could have belonged to somebody’s aunt in a church kitchen. The rash had glitter in it, the cheap baked kind that makes the skin it occupies look as if it has aspirations to be a fish. The woman smiled as if at a miniature birthday cake and then took it back again because the gesture did not belong to a doctor’s office where serious people do ordinary things. “Glue,” she said, not in any particular accent except the one that knows what a plain word can do in a room where people know it too. “I help with crafts. School fair. Always glue. Always a child. Is it contagious?”

“It’s only human,” Lady said because nothing else felt honest. She took out the cream she would have given anybody else and paused with it in her hands long enough to let the room arrange itself around her. The woman laid the scarf on her lap and still managed to make it look like the scarf had been taught to obey. “You’ll need to be boring about the glue for two weeks,” Lady said. “No heroics. Gloves for things that require glitter. Destroy the glitter after showing the children how it looks in sunlight and telling them that sunlight is cleverer. Do not go to bed with glue still on and say you will wash it later. Later is where rashes live.”

The woman nodded, and her mouth did the small thing the shopkeeper had said it would, the held corners waiting for a cue. She blinked as if she had seen Lady in a different doorway and was making a new agreement inside her skull about which character she was set to play today. “Shall I come back after two weeks,” she asked, and her voice dipped into the register that belonged to phones in empty kitchens. “Shall I report back like a good girl.”

Lady turned the cream and put it in the woman’s hand so that whatever had told her fingers to reach would meet what they had asked for. “Don’t be good for me,” she said. “Be dull. Be tedious. Save good for your own table. When you go to the fair keep the scissors sharp and the pieces separate and be kind to your wrists. If you have to label anything, don’t use the children’s names. Use verbs. Fold. Stir. Stop. Carry. Glue is a noun that wants to be in charge. Teach it who works in your house.”

The laugh that came had not been fed in a while, and it did not know how to stand when it came into the room. “You want to cure me with soup,” the woman said, and it would have been flippant if it had not been so careful with its edges. “You want to put rosemary up my sleeves.”

“I want you to be ordinary where you think nobody is watching,” Lady said, and she saw the flinch, the way a person flinches when a back door is named as a front. She smiled, and made the smile small so that it would not be mistaken for a triumph. “I am very good at cream for glue. I am also very good at spots of hunger that think they can disguise themselves as rash. When the glue stops itching, you can wash the rest off your hands. When it starts, call someone who will bring a chair.”

The woman stood, and the scarf behaved like a well-trained dog, and the glove went back on. She left a small circle on the edge of Lady’s desk where a jar’s base might have rested, and Lady did not touch it, because to scrub at it would have been to put the scene into bold. Carol’s head came round the door in the reflex she had learned in a year when abrupt movements had been confused with heroism, but the corridor did not require her to be an audience that day. The woman left a smell that was not lavender and Lady felt both smug and bereft, which is how the body likes to punish itself for not letting fear do anything dramatic.

Alan ran the CCTV that evening with the reluctance of a father looking at photographs of his son that other people had taken. It showed a blue scarf and the competence of shoes that did not hurry. It showed a hand leave a jar in the reading corner and a child pick it up because children make friends with anything that offers a lid. It showed Lady’s face do the thing it does, settle into the kind of patience that in other rooms makes toddlers produce tongues and pensioners produce stories about the war. It did not show guilt because the camera does not understand it, and it did not show hunger because hunger hates being seen. “If we bring her in on this, it becomes a conversation about rashes and glitter,” Alan said, which would have been a lament on any other day and was a kind of boast now that they had learned the agility required not to give a myth its best line. “She is not bored, which is a pity, because boredom is custard and sets given time. She is amused, which is worse. We can follow her where she leaves thread. We will not yank it in case the whole thing snaps and she builds it elsewhere. I hate patience,” he added, and Lady made tea because there is no liturgy more suited to that sentence.

They went to Reading the next morning together because the boy who said he did not read his post had agreed to be in when the postman came in order not to see what he was missing. He had the eyes of a dog whose owner had died and the garden of a man who did not dislike grass but also did not know it could be persuaded. He told them their mother had collected jar lids to keep screws in and had called this thrift. He told them his sister had come home as an adult with a face that knew exhausted and a mouth that knew zipped. When asked what she was tired from he considered carefully and said, to his credit, “Helping and not being thanked for it,” and then took the kind of breath men take when they are about to say what they think is worse, and said, “Being the only one who knew where the plasters were,” and smiled because he had said plasters because there was a doctor in the room and he thought she would be pleased.

They stirred the alembic of memory and poured what came out into little bottles and labelled them later, because the day could not make new names. On the way back the road passed a field where crows were being clever on furrows, and Lady watched them with the kind of sympathy that surprises a person who has prided herself on never falling for creatures with complicated face-wrinkles. “She came to my surgery today with a rash and gloves and a voice she had stolen from a tired aunt,” she said, and the silence that followed had fear in it the way tea has tannin. “I gave her cream. She gave me a circle on my desk where a jar had been. I did not keep the circle. I did not phone you from the corridor because my feet would have tried to teach the world that haste is a solution, and I have promised myself I will not fund that myth.”

He kept his hands at ten and two and moved them only when the road asked, because this was the kind of conversation that wanted control of elbows. “Thank you for telling me now,” he said, in his best policeman voice, which is in fact his best father voice, and she felt briefly both seen and scolded and allowed. “We are going to catch her the boring way if we catch her at all. She is going to be found not by blue or by hearts but by council tax and a very old librarian who refuses to die until the index card in her head that says March is safely slotted where it belongs. And when we do, there will be school assemblies and a sandwich held up by a camera so it can have a point, and you and I will have the job of taking the words out of the mouths of people who think this requires opera.”

The town decided to do a repair cafe without putting the word repair in any poster, because the town had learned about words. Mrs. Larkin borrowed trestles from a scout hut and three kind men who had the look of fathers who talk to their children through the medium of soups turned up with kilner jars and screwdrivers. People brought jars with labels that had failed and lids that had rusted and shame that had trumped appetite, and the big hands undid the over-tight and the small hands stuck new labels that said thyme and sugar and dull things like staples. A child asked if a jar could hold secrets and a woman with a cardigan that had known rain said, “Only for a minute,” and that was written down as policy. Lady sat with a bowl and hot water and a little washing soda and taught people how to peel a label without reducing everything to bits. Halfway through the morning she looked up and found Clara standing in the door with a plant under her arm that did not like corridors and two saucers she had stolen from the hospital café with the cleanest kind of guilt.

Rowan mended a hinge on the school’s lost property cupboard and sneezed into his elbow because he had discovered dust that might have been a generation old. He told his friend who had almost left a jar that he had fixed a hinge and felt good about it, and the friend said, with all the suspicion we teach boys to feel towards feelings, “All right,” and then asked if there was any more of that going spare. Alan came in and stood in the corner where grown men stand when they have come to watch luck behave itself and did a strange thing with his face that might have been a smile and might also have been his jaw admitting defeat at keeping itself upright.

The blue scarf showed itself once at the edge of the hall and un-showed itself like waders do when you turn your head, and nobody stopped the day to name it because there were lids to be found and sugar to be decanted and a boy counting marbles near the door who made a noise that sounded like safety when he let each one drop. Lady felt for the first time the steady, plodding hope she had promised people and not felt in her bones. It was not triumph. It was the satisfaction of a hinge that stays where you put it.

The afternoon brought the kind of weather that makes people check their phones and forget to look up at the sky that has been trying to tell them everything in plain sight. A letter on her mat had no lavender in it, which told her she had not won anything except a reprieve. Inside was a single sheet with a drawing. It was a jar with steam rising from it and a spoon too long to be of practical use, and at the bottom a heart that had learned not to be neat. There was a smear where somebody had put a finger over something and decided against it. There were no instructions and no time and no invitation. Lady did not try to make the letter behave like a trap. She put it in a plastic sleeve because bodies have habits and hers had learned archival as a way to stop her hands from shaking, and then she put a small sprig of rosemary in the sleeve because up close rosemary looks like a row of baby hands and she wanted the letter to be kept company by something not clever.

She slept with the phone in the other room because the kind of emergency she was being offered required tools she refused to use after midnight. She lay on her left side and thought of jars and marbles and spoons and girls like Elsie who made summer fairs work and then were not given winters to mend themselves in. In the house on the hill the jars sat with their mouths closed and made the noise air makes when it is ready to become weather. The woman in the blue scarf stood in a kitchen with a spoon and a saucepan and did nothing with them because doing nothing had tasted good in her mouth when she had written it down and she wanted to see if the taste could survive being swallowed. She looked at her hands, which were clean enough to pass, and at the finger she had pressed to a mistake on a page and wondered with contempt, which was how she avoided wondering at all, what that would have felt like if she had left it. She hummed a small note and told herself it was rain. She did not tap the jars because she was tired of wanting applause from glass. She went to bed because even a myth must sleep before it can demand anything grand.
