He could balance six plates on two hands without looking, and sometimes that felt like the only talent he would ever need. The plates slid over his fingers like coins and he glided between tables, the restaurant a low-lit shoebox of murmurs and the clink of glass, the ceiling aircon dripping a soft, regular rhythm into a bucket the handyman insisted would be removed by lunch. Liang moved through it all with a strange hush inside him, a small lake of patience. Even the kids with fizzy drinks and the man whose face went red when they ran out of kampong chicken could not shift it. He had the calm a waiter learns if he wants to last: face blank enough to reflect whatever the customer wants to see.

On his break he squatted by the back door, a cigarette balanced between his lips that he never lit, and scrolled with his thumb. Britain’s Got Talent clips again, little rectangles of people on a stage almost too big for their bodies, freeze frames of judges he had memorised: two smiles, one arched eyebrow, a hand always ready to slap the big shiny button. He watched someone juggle swords and someone who said he could whistle and sing at the same time, and a choir from Wales whose faces all looked like rain. He watched with the phone pressed close, as if he could breathe in that stage. Sometime in sec one he had seen a clip of a shy boy with a trick voice, and something had had twinged inside him then, the feeling you get when a window opens on a floor you didn’t know existed. He’d thought: I can do that. He could feel it the way you feel a song start in your throat even if you don’t know the words yet. Ah Ma had laughed and patted his head and said, Can do, can do, everything also can. You want to be acrobat also can. Liar.

He did not tell his colleagues what he watched on smoke breaks. He did not tell them about the private show he put on at two a.m. for the plastic plant in their Bukit Timah hostel common room, alone but for the blinking router. He would stand on the stained rug and pretend the buzzing fridge was a crowd, turn to the plant as if it was a judge and hold his breath for that beaming, merciless quiet when your whole life condenses into the inches between your ribs.

“You practicing again?” Maya had asked once at dawn, stepping out barefoot, hair in a messy bun. The lodge had thin walls. “Your voice—”

“I know,” he said quickly. Then he grinned to disarm. “Solid right?”

She looked at him for a beat too long and then laughed. “Solid lah.”

The restaurant manager, Mr. Chua, had the groomed frown of a man who had perfected not being surprised. He was in his office, a room the size of a wardrobe, when Liang tapped in. “You’re late for break,” Mr. Chua said, even though he wasn’t.

“Boss, table sixteen wants extra sambal,” Liang said. “And—uh—sorry, I need to send a quick message.”

Mr. Chua waved him away, eyes not leaving the spreadsheet on his screen. “Make sure the sambal replenished. Last night so much complaint.” At the bottom of his computer, a calendar notification pulsed: Daughter’s ballet 6 pm.

Liang sent a heart to a chat with a number that only read +44. That was the country code. He liked the way it felt to see it. Like a window frame to a colder world, where breath made smoke in the air. He had left a comment under a talent show audition, a dumb joke that dropped from his thumbs before he thought it through, and whoever ran the page had replied with a winking emoji and an invitation to apply. Then an email had come that looked official enough to skate past his common sense. Congratulations! We would like to welcome you to the finals of Britain’s Got Talent! Special circumstance category, a brand-new initiative. We’ve seen your… he skimmed this part, as if it was rude to look too long at luck in case it blushed and ran away… and we believe you have what it takes. Flights and accommodation will be covered. Please reply with your full name, passport details, and the song/art form you intend to perform. Don’t tell anyone—we want to surprise our audience!

There were typos. The logo looked stretched, as if someone had pulled it too hard and it was about to tear. But he wanted to drink the words, so he let them be true. He wrote his name and NRIC number in carefully, hand trembling, then erased the NRIC and put his passport instead because some part of him remembered that the government said that was safer. He wrote: Singing. Maybe beatbox. Maybe some dance a bit. And then he hit send and watched the little loading circle turn and turn and then the message vanished, gone into the place where messages go when you have decided that you love them. He kept his phone where his heart could hear it.

At home, the HDB lift smelled like iron and rain. Ah Ma’s flat was on twelve, the corridor a parade of potted plants. Someone had hung a chalkboard that said: Block Twelve Committee Meeting: Please Attend, accompanied by a sad stick figure holding a clipboard. Ah Ma’s door was propped open by a stack of old Straits Times rolled tight with a rubber band. “No need to knock lah,” she called, as he stood there like a stranger.

“You left door open again,” he said, stepping inside. “Later people steal all your plastic flowers.”

“Steal they take only the dust.” She was in the kitchen, a small shape with hands like bird feet, stirring a pot of something that smelled like star anise and the way Sundays felt when he was eight. “Come, come, taste.” She held up a spoon. He took a sip as if it were something holy.

“Your bak kut teh can win prizes one,” he said. “Better than restaurant soup.”

“Of course better. I also got secret ingredient.”

“What secret ingredient?”

She smiled and tapped her cheek. “Ah Ma’s love.”

“Eeyer,” he said, making a face, and she swatted his arm with the spoon and then handed him a chunk of pork rib. “You know today I take break and watch your show,” she said, as if it was a soap opera. “The black one, with the people who scream. The judge always say ‘Absolutely yes, darling.’”

“Britain’s Got Talent,” he said. He tried to say it crisp, like a British person. Brr-ih-tin. “Ah Ma, later don’t laugh okay.”

“At what?” She was already laughing. “At your face, how you practise.”

He stood there in the tile glow and felt the words rising like steam. “I got in,” he said. “They want me. For the final. London. They will pay.” The words sounded ridiculous together, like the ingredients of a stew that had never existed in the history of soups. They still tasted good.

She looked at him so hard he wanted to look away. Then she said, careful, “They say you got talent?”

“They saw my comment lah,” he said, and it did sound stupid aloud, so he rushed. “Special category. They saw my videos.”

“What videos?”

He had sent one, of himself singing into the hostel mirror, because the form had asked for links and he had panicked and sent a Google Drive link he forgot to remove his other files from: taxi receipts, screenshots of recipes, a photo of his friend Ravi sleeping on a bus. “I sent.”

She reached to touch his cheek again, and then stopped herself and pretended to fix his collar. “Good lah, good. You go to London. I want fridge magnet, later you bring one with English flag. The red one. Put here.” She pointed at the fridge door where a galaxy of other magnets have already colonised: a clunky one from Malacca that says Historical City and is missing the T, a round tin from Bangkok that hides a bottle opener on its backside. There was a New York one he had bought at a Bugis Street stall, pretending.

He swallowed. “I want you to come.”

“Me go London? Please.” She waved a hand, but her eyes warmed. “What I do there? I wear coat and walk like penguin. Cold until die.”

“I carry you,” he said, as if that would solve it. As if he could lift her and all their history and the thing his mother had left behind when she went to work and didn’t come back. That thing which had cracked the air in their flat and never stopped sounding. He put the pork rib back in the bowl so he could keep from leaning on it. The steam fogged his face.

“You sing what?” Ah Ma asked, as if she could smell the next lie.

He thought of the songs he knew, the ones he could carry. He thought of English ballads that were actually other people’s jagged hearts stitched in shapes he did not understand. He thought of an old tune his grandmother used to hum when she scrubbed the bathroom, the one with no words that sounded like a boat rowing away. “I will sing… something new.” He could write it. He could write three nights and make a song. How hard could it be? People wrote songs all the time, at bus stops and in courtyards and under fluorescent light. They did, right?

She laughed and his relief launched itself against his ribs. “You sing your nonsense. As long you sing from your neck.”

He huffed. “Throat.”

“Neck throat same same.” She turned away to get bowls, and the moment thinned. He was grateful.

Later, after he had eaten until his stomach was a warm drum and he had washed the bowls and placed them upside down to dry, he sat with her on the faded sofa. The TV murmured something about a minister’s speech. The grand clock on the wall kept time with its soft plastic tick. “Your mother will be very proud,” Ah Ma said into the room, not looking at him. “If she can see you. You travel so far.”

“We don’t know if she cannot see us,” he said. “Maybe she is stuck somewhere only. Maybe—”

“Ai yah, don’t start,” she said, but there was no anger in it, only the old tiredness they shared. “Drink your tea. Don’t dream until forget to live. If not you will look up and your feet already leave ground. Then you cannot find way back.” She reached for his hand without turning her head, and he let her hold it, his wrist bones small between her fingers.

He went home to the hostel because work started early, but he wanted to stay. In the bed, a wafer of light fell from the window and landed on his blanket. Someone on the floor above played the same Mandarin pop song four times in a row. He lay on his back and watched the fan wobble. He typed a message to +44: Thank you for inviting me. I accept. I can do June 22. I will sing something original. Please let me know arrangement. He added a British flag emoji and a fireworks one, then deleted both, then put back the fireworks and deleted that too. When the message sent he stared at the check marks as if they were stones in a river he could hop across. In the morning, there was a reply: Great! Keep it hush hush. A driver will collect you.

Where? he typed, then fell asleep with the phone on his chest. He dreamed of a car with the steering wheel on the wrong side, pulling up outside his hostel, a man in a suit leaning across the dashboard to open the passenger door with the click of some quiet machine. He dreamed his grandmother at his back, saying Don’t forget your passport, boy, and his mother somewhere in the corridor, her voice a shadow that smelled like laundry detergent and sea salt.

The driver did not come. He went to work and the world was the same, a slightly different twist on a screw. He sang to himself under his breath, not actual songs, just the shapes of them, vowels and syllables he stretched like rubber bands. He beatboxed once on the way to the storeroom and Mr. Chua arrested in the act of stepping into the kitchen, one foot in the door, one out, as if a chord had caught him. “What was that?” Mr. Chua said.

“Air leak,” Liang lied, and Mr. Chua blinked and resumed motion. Maya saw him later and gave him a thumbs-up when nobody else could see. “Actually you’re not bad,” she said, meaning it as a gift. He opened it like a child and pocketed it and tried not to shake it to see if it made a sound.

Ravi, the dishwasher, had the quiet face of men who had been shouted at enough. He found Liang looking at plane tickets they could not afford and said, “My cousin flew to Heathrow last year. Twelve hours in the sky. He watched four movies and then they brought rice and it tasted like a dream you forget when you wake up.”

“I don’t need to buy,” Liang said, too loud. “They provide.”

Ravi nodded as if that was a normal thing. “Then you must sleep a lot before you go. And don’t drink coffee when the plane still on the ground.”

“Why?”

“Because then you will pee all the time.” Ravi looked at him a long time and then said, “Sing something lah.” The way he said it made it sound like he was asking for a truth.

Liang sang the boat song with no words because it was safe. He made the sound of an oar, the water splitting in grudging halves. He let it carry him. When he finished, he expected applause, he expected something to happen to the air, but the kitchen light just hummed, and Ravi went back to scraping at a pot as if it was the most interesting thing he had ever seen. “You got voice,” Ravi said finally, gently. “You must control that voice.”

He knew he did not have control. He knew he had ideas that outran his breath. But he told himself all gifts start like that, wild to the touch, their edges uneven. He told himself that is what training is for. He searched online for coaches in “stage presence” and found videos of people telling him to stand straight and plant his feet like trees and imagine his breath turned to roots. He tried in the mirror, legs apart, looking like the bad drawing of a superhero.

At lunchtime, he got a WhatsApp ping: ✈️ Heathrow car picks you up. June 20. Arrives 5:35 a.m. Terminal 3. Bring ID. Strict.

He stared at the plane and the words like they were choking on themselves. Heathrow. He’d never seen that place except when it was a line at the bottom of the screen in a movie, a place where the actors move faster because the director says so. He had four days. He told Mr. Chua he needed leave. “Family matter,” he said, because it was always true.

“School holidays,” Mr. Chua said with a sigh. “You pick the worst time.”

“I will find cover shifts,” Liang said, which he would.

“You better.” Mr. Chua tapped at the desk with a pen. “Your grandmother okay?”

He smiled. “Yes, she is okay. She is strong.” It was important to say that he believed this because sometimes she forgot his name halfway through a sentence and had to find her way back to it using landmarks like “boy” and “ah, the one!”

He went to Ah Ma’s after his shift because his legs took him there. She was not in. The door was locked, the plant on the step had drunk its saucer dry. He called her with his knuckle against the wood. Mrs. Tan the neighbour opened her door and leaned out wearing a shirt with a cat on it. “Your grandmother went downstairs,” she called. “She says she want to buy new thread.”

“What color thread?”

“Red.”

“For what?”

Mrs. Tan shrugged as if all questions were about weather. “Last week she said she want to sew something. You know your ah ma. She always sew and unsew. Because she miss the sewing machine, she told me. Is true, last time she sew at the factory. You know or not?”

He did. But she had not said it out loud in years. He went downstairs and found Ah Ma in the void deck talking to three old ladies. They were sitting on the stone bench like birds at a hawker centre table, their voices lilting toward one another and away. “Boy,” she said, when she saw him, and he had to swallow a small hard thing that arrived in his throat. “You come to show off your new shoes?”

He looked down. He was wearing the same black shoes he wore when he was nineteen and could not afford anything else and had to keep the soles together with tape. He had bought new laces, that’s true. “I came to say,” he said, trying to slow the words so he wouldn’t trip on them, “they say driver will pick me up at Heathrow. Terminal 3. June twenty. They say keep hush hush. You cannot tell the chickens downstairs.”

She slapped his arm gently. “Chickens also got feelings.”

He sat with them then, the heat inching up the concrete toward him, their voices a net his body fell into without resistance. He told himself he would leave in ten minutes because he had to go back and practice, but he stayed, because the shade was full of the secrets of long afternoons, and the old ladies told jokes that had no punchlines, only memories. Ah Ma told Mrs. Tan he was going to the UK, and Mrs. Tan said, “Last time I also go UK! Upper Khatib, lah!” and they laughed until all of them were coughing. He laughed too, because the joy was so unembarrassed it was contagious, and the men playing chess at the next table glanced over and then looked away like it was impolite to stare at happiness.

Night fell in a quiet rush. He walked Ah Ma upstairs and locked her door and put the key where she could find it. He wrote it on a sticky note: KEY IN BLUE CUP. He wrote it again in bigger letters. He made her touch the key and watch her put it in the cup. He wanted to leave, because practice would be a way to keep the fear at bay, but he lingered in the doorway, one hand on the frame. “Ah Ma,” he said. “If I win, ah. If I win the whole thing.”

She looked at him, and this time she remembered his name, said it like she was pinning it to his shirt. “Liang,” she said. “You don’t need to win. You just need to go and come back. That is winning.”

He dreamed again of the stage. He dreamed of lights so bright they made his skin feel like paper. He dreamed of a hum that passed through his bones like a subway, and of judges whose faces were blank as mirrors. He dreamed of his mother in the wings, her hands folded and her face made out of the dark, and his grandmother in the front row knitting something inside her lap where nobody could see.

He woke to his phone buzzing under his pillow and a message that said: Confirm you will be at Changi on June 19 for check-in, 10 p.m. Terminal 1. He stared until the letters blurred. He typed Yes! Then he replied again, as if the first had been too small to be believed: Yes confirmed.

He posted a picture of his passport cover, but not the pages, to his Instagram story. He drew a British flag and some fireworks with his finger. He captioned it: this is happening. Ravi wrote Is it? Maya wrote You go and don’t forget us. Mr. Chua did not use Instagram. Ah Ma did not know what it was. He messaged his mother, because he kept her number saved in his phone under the name he used to call out when he was five and had lost her in NTUC: Ma where you. The last message he had sent three years ago said: I am twenty-two now. I am okay. He wrote: Going to London. Will sing. If you can see this, please wear something warm.

The day before he was supposed to go to the airport, he packed. He laid his best shirt on the bed, the one with a collar that did not flop when you breathed, and a jacket he had bought from a shop where a mannequin wore it with the sleeves cuffed and a confidence he could not find. He packed four pairs of socks in case London made you wear more socks than Singapore. He packed a photograph of him and Ah Ma at East Coast Park, the kite stretched above them like a grin. He packed a small red string that had once kept a prayer tied to its stake. He packed and unpacked, because he could not figure out if the weight in his chest was anticipation or a shadow impersonating it.

He went to work and spilled soda on his own shirt and changed to a spare. He knocked over a spoon and it clanged in the stainless steel like a gong. He told Mr. Chua about the leave again and Mr. Chua nodded as if he had already decided that Liang would be back by Sunday as if the world was reasonable. He cut his finger on a can and watched the blood bead, bright and confused. “Careful,” Maya said, taking his hand and pressing a napkin to it. “You need that for your claps.”

“For my claps?”

“When the judges clap you,” she said and then frowned. “After you sing. Not clap you. English only.”

He went to Ah Ma’s to bring her kaya buns because she liked the way the butter pooled in the jam. The door was unlocked. The TV was on a channel that played old Chinese dramas where men wore moustaches like upside-down feathers. “Ah Ma?” he said, and the room did not answer. The blue cup was turned upside down and the key was under it, an obedient child. He walked through the small rooms saying her name like it would emit a sound only she could hear. The bathroom was empty. The balcony housed a clothes rack lifting its arms to a sky that was about to rain. He called her phone and it rang somewhere in the flat: in the kitchen, in the drawer with the tape and the spare batteries and the elastic bands that had forgotten elasticity. He reached and knew before he saw it. The phone had little foil butterflies stuck to its case. “Ah Ma?” he said, to nobody. He stood very still because stillness sometimes makes the thing reveal itself.

He told himself there were a hundred places she could be. Downstairs. At Mrs. Tan’s door. At the NTUC buying coriander and then remembering she only needed scissors. He went downstairs and the void deck was empty except for the chess table and a boy in a striped shirt who was too young to be out by himself, who looked at Liang like he knew him from somewhere. He checked the noticeboard for lost cats and found four. He went to the guardian of all knowledge, the man who smoked by the staircase step where the breeze came through, and said, “Uncle, you see an aunty, small, curly hair, carrying red bag.”

The uncle shrugged as if he had just been asked why birds exist. “So many aunties,” he said. “Wait. The one who always buys the bread from the Malay man?”

“Yes. With a blue clip on the bag.”

“Haven’t see. Today must be raining lah. They all at home.”

The rain started, a fine sheet, like the sky was shaving itself. He went back upstairs. He told himself not to panic. Panic was a song you started and could not stop. He looked at the table. He looked at the fridge. The magnet that had fallen off last week lay where he had left it: a camel from Dubai with a head that bobbled. He put it back on. He called Mrs. Tan and she came in wearing her cat shirt again, or maybe she had three. “She say want to go temple this morning,” Mrs. Tan said, invoking a memory like a magic trick. “I saw her take the joss sticks and the oranges.”

“Which temple?”

Mrs. Tan pressed her lips together. “The one with the lion. Or the one with the dragon.” It was the kind of distinction that made sense in her mind.

He went to both. He kept moving because stillness had turned on him. At the lion temple the incense made his eyes smart. At the dragon temple he tried not to trip over a child asleep on a bench. He called people who didn’t know they were on his short list. He called his uncle who lived in Jurong and owed them three hundred dollars that defined their relationship. He called his own number as if a second number had been invented for emergencies. He called the number that had texted him Heathrow Terminal 3 and it rang and rang, and then there was a voicemail in a woman’s voice that said the mailbox was full. He wanted to throw his phone at the gods but he put it in his pocket like an egg he had to protect.

He found her at sunset standing at the bus stop by the market, holding a plastic bag with nothing in it, like you might carry a memory that had spilled. “Ah Ma,” he said, his heart rushing to his mouth, and her face broke open with relief that made him giddy and terrified both. “Boy,” she said, and then she started to cry. He put his arms around her and felt how light she was. “I forgot the way home,” she said into his shirt, each word a tremble. “I walked until the bus stop. I thought, the bus will bring me. But then—” She pulled away and looked at him with equal parts apology and accusation, as if his existence had not explained itself. “Why you didn’t come sooner?”

“Because you didn’t call me,” he said, and wanted to kick himself because he sounded like a mother.

They walked home slow like a procession. He did not tell her about London. He felt suddenly that if he said that word, the building would tilt. He made her soup and watched her drink it, the spoon clinking against the bowl in metronome. He wanted to ask if she had been lost all day, if she had been wandering, if she had felt the moment when the map in her brain had lifted up and blown away. He did not. He put on a comedy show and stood behind the couch, hands on the backrest, like someone keeping watch.

He went to bed that night with his bag packed and his nerves unpacked. He watched the ceiling, counted the slow spinning of the fan, and told himself that tomorrow he would leave from Changi, and that he would bring an umbrella, and that he would put the process of missing into a box until he returned. You could do that. People did that when they went to war. He fell asleep telling himself that people had done stranger things than go from a restaurant in Singapore to an English stage, and that running toward something and running away were sometimes the same motion, depending on where you placed the weight of your foot.

The next morning, as he brushed his teeth and looked at the foamy mouth of a man who would change his life at an airport, his phone vibrated again. The message said: Emergency rehearsal today at the Old Library. We need to see your act. 3 p.m. He had an image of a room with shelves and light falling in square tiles. He typed: Where is Old Library? And received a dropped pin at Stamford Road, a place he had been as a boy once, holding Ah Ma’s hand and pointing at a stone lion that looked like it knew his secrets.

He went early because he did not want to be late for the kind of thing you would only be invited to once. The building smelled like paper that remembered rain. The big white room, where books used to be, was echoing and changed into a hall that did not know if it wanted to be a truly public space. A man with a clipboard sat at a folding table. He wore a T-shirt that said CREW in letters that had started to peel. “Name?” he said, licking his thumb and turning a page as if he was discovering something that had been there all along.

“Liang. Lim Liang Jun.”

“Uhm,” the man said, dragging his finger down the page. “No— oh wait. Here. Special. Yeah. You’re later.”

“Later what?” Liang said, holding his bag in front of him like a child.

“Later you wait,” the man said without irony. “You ready your… talent?”

He nodded. He had his song in his throat like a bird that had tucked its head under its wing. He had a very small beat that he could do with his mouth that sounded like rain hitting a metal roof. He had spent three nights making something like a structure out of it. He felt his heart tip toward the idea like a plant bending toward light. He sat on a bench and watched two acrobats in unitards stretch like cats, watched a man pour milk from one container to another with a solemnity that suggested he believed it to be an art form, watched a little boy counting coins and making them vanish into his sleeves. He thought: I belong here. He thought it with such force that for a moment it was true.

His phone vibrated. Another message. Ah Ma: Where are you? I cooked fish.

He looked up, at the acrobats, the milk, the coins. At the man with the peeling CREW shirt. And then he stood. He messaged: I’m at work. Eat first. He put his phone back into his pocket, then pulled it out again and stared at his own reflection in the black glass, skewed and long. He breathed. When they called his name, he walked into the echo, his feet making soft rubber sounds on the floor, his mouth suddenly full of air, and stood where someone had taped a cross with masking tape. “We will record,” the woman told him. He nodded. “Name?” she said to the camera.

He said it and his voice sounded like somebody else’s who had borrowed his throat. The woman nodded at him to begin and he opened his mouth and the first note escaped like a thing you have carried a long time and suddenly let go of. It stumbled. He tried to catch it, and got a cough instead, but he kept going, and the cough turned into a sound that could have been a drum if you were far away and kind, and the song that had felt like a small true boat began to spin in circles. He watched the woman’s eyes flicker toward her clipboard and then back and felt a slow cold come to rest between his shoulders. He pushed on. He finished with the small beat he had practiced, and it sounded like rain hitting something. He stood after, waiting, breathing, and the listening was worse than the singing. The room held his breath and then nobody else did.

“Okay,” the woman said. “Thank you, Liang.” She did not say will call you. She did not say wow. He stepped back and bumped into a camera tripod and said sorry to it. He walked out and the acrobats went in, bodies like arguments.

He checked his phone on the steps of the Old Library, hands shaking as if he had run. There were three messages from Ah Ma, the last with no words, just an emoji she had found once and decided was what you sent when you wanted someone to be inside your house again. He put the phone to his ear to hear his own breathing. The heat rushed in. A tourist on the steps took a picture of the lion whose mouth was open and looked like it was telling a joke the building had heard before. He thought of the airport. He thought of a driver at Heathrow, holding a sign that might have his name on it in thick black marker, and of the eight people named Lim who would walk past him and maybe pretend they were him just to see the driver’s smile.

He went home.

He bought oranges on the way and held the bag so tight the net left a pattern on his wrist. He pushed the door open and called, “Ah Ma,” in a voice that sounded both too loud and too small. She came out from the room where she kept the sewing box and smiled like she had discovered his face in a drawer she hadn’t opened since last spring. He poured rice into the cooker, a practice he could do with his eyes closed, and he sang to himself, soft, so the song would not run away. He did not tell her about the room and the tape cross and the cough. She did not ask. “Tomorrow airport,” she said, as if the word were a place in the flat, like bathroom.

“Tomorrow,” he said. His voice came back to him with a small echo. It was enough. For now, it was enough.Morning arrived without ceremony, light slipping under the curtains the way a stray cat slips under a gate: already inside by the time you think to say stop. The kettle clicked and burbled. Ah Ma stood at the sink sorting beansprouts, snipping tails like she was restoring order to a small crowd. She wore a t-shirt with a cartoon durian wearing sunglasses, a gift from somebody’s cruise that had never cruised. When she turned at his footsteps, she brightened as if he was a light switch. “You wake up,” she said, unnecessarily, then held up her palm to reveal a loop of red thread. “You help me tie. My hand cannot see.”

He sat and took the thread. It had a knot already, small and decisive. He looped it around her wrist where the skin was as thin as onion, and he doubled the knot because that was what you did when you wanted something to stay. She watched his fingers with interest, as if they belonged to a stranger who was doing something delicate with her belongings. “For protection,” she said gravely, then spoiled it with a grin. “From ang moh cold air.”

He breathed a laugh and kissed the loop, because miracles needed witnesses even if they were made of string. “I will bring back more thread from London,” he said. “British thread. English aunties must sell at the market there.”

“Don’t anyhow buy,” she said. “There lousy one. Come back all the colour run.” She finished the beansprouts and stood, one foot finding the slipper that had wandered under the table. “Eat breakfast. You want egg or what.”

He cooked. He liked the small gifts of doing so, how the yolk centred itself obligingly, how butter made a noise like gossip when it met hot pan. He put kaya on toast in squares like postage stamps, measured, neat, because this was one of the few places in his life where geometry obeyed him. They ate at the table with the aircon vents clicking their old rhythm that meant the filter needed cleaning. He had not cleaned it because the stool was unsteady and because calling the service man required deciding between three numbers on a sticker that all claimed to be the correct one. He looked at Ah Ma and tried to map the day onto her in a way that made sense. “Aunty Mei come this afternoon,” he said. “She will sit with you. I already give her some shopping money. Anything you want to eat, you call me.”

She nodded, chewing, then frowned. “Today what day?”

“Tuesday.”

“Tuesday is the day the man sells mago.”

“Mango.”

“Then I buy two,” she decided, satisfied.

He did the dishes with the same thoroughness that had saved him from thinking too hard since he was twelve. He wiped the counter. He wrote another note—MANGO DAY—in block letters and stuck it on the fridge door where a ferry from Batam bared its teeth of waves. He went to his own room for the bag he had packed, opened it, looked at the shirt with the non-flopping collar and the jacket whose confidence he had borrowed even if it didn’t fit, and then closed it again. The red string at his own wrist itched, phantom sensation; he looked down and realised he had wound the spare around his own hand without noticing, a child’s reflex of hoarding comfort. He tied it around his backpack zip, knotting it tight, as if he could fasten luck like a luggage tag.

At midday, the restaurant pulsed like a heart under a glass bell. He had promised Mr. Chua he would come in for lunch to help cover, and promises were another kind of thread. The minute he pushed through the swinging door and the clatter rose up, his body slid into its known rails. Plates, breath, path. Maya had glitter star stickers at the corner of her eyes, residue from some party or just her irreverent pilgrimage to joy. “You ready or not,” she said as if he was about to try durian for the first time.

He showed his hands. They were steady, which had surprised him. “Later I will be on the plane already,” he said with an absurd confidence that felt like juggling soap bubbles and pretending they were tennis balls.

“Wah,” she said quietly, and for a second her grin folded into something like worry. Then she tugged at the hem of his apron and slipped a small plastic packet into his hand. “For you. Don’t scold me.”

He looked down. Inside was a keychain microphone, the kind you could plug into your phone to make fake announcements to nobody. It had rhinestones embedded in a pattern that tried to be symmetrical and failed in an endearing way. “I’ll announce the plane delay,” he said, and then both of them laughed because the laugh was easier to carry than the possibility that the joke would be assigned to them by someone else. “Thank you,” he said, sincerity making the words heavier, worthy of both hands.

Ravi brought him a carton of soya milk with the straw already stabbed in. “For your throat,” he said. “When you cold, drink something sweet so your body remember where it come from.”

“Thanks.” He thought of Ravi’s cousin on the plane with four movies and dream rice, of the long snake of sky between here and there. He thought of Heathrow like a coin in his pocket that he might not get to spend. He told himself not to think of the Old Library, of the sound his first note had made when it stumbled into the room and fell over.

Mr. Chua emerged from his closet of an office smelling faintly of coffee and cologne, a man who had learned to armour himself with recognisable scents. “This one takes leave, whole restaurant must adjust,” he said, tone dry, affection concealed like a coin under a napkin that you were expected not to look under. “You better bring back some British sauce.”

“Gravy?”

“Whatever the ang mohs eat,” Mr. Chua said, pretending contempt he did not fully feel. “Don’t come back with virus.”

They worked. The lunch rush rose and crested and smoothed out into the quiet of office workers shuffling back to their desks. As the day tilted toward evening, his phone buzzed in his pocket with messages that he refused to read on the floor because that way lay chaos. When he stole a minute behind the bar fridge, he pulled it out. There were three from +44: Reminder: Check-in at Terminal 1, 10 p.m. Ask for Event Travel desk. Do not approach airline counters directly. Keep confidentiality. Another said: We need to confirm your luggage weight. Another, sent an hour later, said: URGENT: Visa verification will be handled at airport. Prepare passport and $450 cash in SGD for deposit, returnable upon arrival.

He stared at that last message until the words began to hop like fleas. The number he had saved with a heart he had drawn in his head because to draw it with pixels would have been too much looked very suddenly like a hole. He scrolled up and down through the history of his own want, the sent fireworks, the Yes confirmed, as if looking again would change something in the grammar of the deception. He swallowed. The taste of the soya milk turned chalky, then brave again. He was not stupid, he told himself. He was not stupid. The airport was real. Planes were real. He looked up. Maya was tying a balloon to the back of a child’s chair because it was somebody’s birthday and because sometimes you did the thing that felt like a party even if you were working. He put the phone back in his pocket and served table four and then table eighteen and then, in an act of charity toward himself that he justified as due diligence, he texted: I can’t pay deposit. I don’t have. Is there other way? He set the phone face down on the speedwell like a gambler refusing to look at a hand he suspected he had already lost.

In his last hour, he broke two glasses. It was not the first time in his life he had done that, but it felt like an omen trying to be polite. He swept up the shards slowly, feeling the weight of each piece like a small fact. On his break he went behind the restaurant and lifted the cigarette to his lips without lighting it, because rituals are helpful even if their smoke is imagined. He sang a little under his breath, the boat song that did not belong to anybody and yet belonged to all women who had scrubbed a floor’s memory away, all men who had held an oar and pretended it wasn’t a weapon. He beatboxed a plosive under it, soft, rain on zinc, the sound he could almost do even when fear chewed a notch out of his breath. He stopped because the world did not need to hear him if he could not hear himself properly.

The evening gathered. He went to Ah Ma’s with curry puffs that were still warm, their crimped edges like the hems she had sewn for other people’s children. She ate one and said it was too spicy and then ate another and said, better. He called Aunty Mei to remind her to come. She appeared at six, wearing floral leggings like a defiant garden. She had a bag that thunked when she put it down, heavy with snacks and knitting needles and gossip. “I keep your ah ma company,” she said, as if daring him to argue that anyone should ever be alone. “You go. You go see the big wheel.”

“Ferris wheel?”

“Big wheel lah. The one at the airport, got water falling.” She made a whoosh noise to illustrate Jewel’s vortex, her hands describing a circle that would have looked childish if not for the reverence in her wrists. He wrote his phone number next to the landline with a marker that was running out of ink. He wrote 999 on a post-it in big black pen and stuck it next to the peacock magnet. He made Ah Ma repeat his number and the number of the restaurant and the number of Aunty Mei’s son, who sometimes answered, and she did with the liveliness of a game.

He left at eight with the sky the colour of old bruise, the city putting on its jewellery of lights. He took the MRT because the train’s logic comforted him. Changi was a place he loved like a relative whose letters you always read twice. He did not travel, but he had been there to send other people off, to retrieve uncles who brought back crab-flavoured chips and stories that tasted more expensive than the chips. The station spit him into Terminal 1’s wide brightness where air had been taught to behave. He walked the first ten steps slowly, as if he had to calibrate his body to a country where gravity worked a bit differently—as if in airports you were always slightly lighter or slightly heavier, depending on how the day had decided to hold you.

He looked up at the departure board and found London among names that were both maps and myths: Narita, Doha, Jeddah, Perth. The London flight that was nearest was an SQ leaving from Terminal 3 around midnight. He smiled at the irrational satisfaction of seeing proof that the thing existed. He walked to Information because he was a waiter and waiters knew the value of asking the person whose job it was to know. “Hi,” he said to the woman behind the counter, who had hair like a helmet and a brooch in the shape of a plane that was either ironic or sincere. “Where is the Event Travel desk?”

She blinked the way a cat blinks when it has to summon kindness. “We don’t have that here,” she said. “Is it a tour group check-in?”

He held up his phone with the message. She looked, and something like sympathy softened the guard in her eyebrows. “You can try the airline,” she said. “But if there’s no booking number, they cannot help. Beware of scams, okay.”

He nodded and thanked her, because gratitude cost nothing and because it was clear she had been given a script to place between people and their foolishness. He dialled +44 and listened to the ring that had a different rhythm to Singapore’s, a stammer he had always associated with cold air. It rang seven times, as if the phone was running down a corridor. The mailbox was still full. He typed: I’m here. Where are you. He received a grey tick that did not turn blue. He typed again, as if frequency could turn film to real life: I am at T1 Info. Tell me where to go to check-in.

He circled. He watched people queue and be processed, the choreography of order. A family with four children, each with a backpack shaped like a different animal, each small body containing a universe of complaint. A young couple in matching tracksuits pulling a suitcase that looked like it had been designed by a company that could not decide if it wanted to be an art movement. An old man in a suit too big for him, his wife leaning on his arm as if he was a bannister and she had always known the importance of railings. He went upstairs to the viewing deck and looked at planes like dinosaurs that had learned to behave, creatures whose gentleness might be a trick. The Jewel’s rain vortex pulsed in the distance, pouring its endless, contained waterfall, a domesticated storm. He stood at the glass and thought how strange it was that you could be inside what looked like a promise and still not be part of it.

At nine-thirty he tried again at an airline counter, even though the message had told him not to. He picked SQ because the letters felt reliable, old friends who always had spare tissues. The woman keyed in his name. She frowned in a way that was not unkind. “Sir,” she said, and he knew before she said it. “There is no reservation under your name. Do you have a booking reference?”

“They say they handle,” he said, hearing his own grammar disassemble under the pressure of hope. “They say event. They say visa verification at airport.”

She pursed her lips a little and leaned closer as if to share an intimacy with him which was, instead, a truth. “We don’t do this,” she said. “Visa must be in order before. If you make application, you will know. Beware of scam. They ask for cash.”

He nodded and smiled as if she had told him the weather. He thanked her and moved away, because the queue behind him had opinions that they did not say but that chimed in the air like a tuning fork. He looked at the chairs and chose one near an electrical outlet because choices were consoling. He plugged his phone in like a patient attaching himself to a drip. He typed: I cannot pay deposit. If real, you can pay first and I will pay back later. He hovered over send and then remembered there was nobody there who would give him the dignity of being cheated properly. He put the phone down. He waited. Waiting took the shape of a long exhale that did not quite end.

Around him, the airport did what airports do. A boy fell asleep with his face pressed to his mother’s thigh, open-mouthed and unselfconscious. A man in a jersey paced, spoke in a language that made triangles in the air. A cleaner moved her machine in patient arcs, the floor brightening under her wake. The machine hummed a note that sounded to him like the beginning of a song he could have written if he had fewer illusions and more stamina. He looked up at the high ceiling, at the lights arranged like constellations for people who did not have time to look at the sky, and something inside him loosened without his permission.

He took out Maya’s keychain and held it. He looked for someone he could make an audience, something small that he could arrange into an act. He ended up singing to the potted plant near the toilets, a tall dracaena that had been chosen for its uncomplaining nature. He stood and faced it and sang the boat song very quietly, because he was not insane, because security guards had eyes everywhere, because he did not want to be a video on somebody else’s social media captioned guy at airport gone mad. He made the oar sound and the beat of rain under it, and he allowed himself to imagine that the plant heard. When he finished, he felt like he had put a baby on the ground and it had tottered three steps and then sat down hard. He looked around and caught the cleaner watching him. She had a pin on her shirt that said Marites. For a second, the world balanced. She lifted one hand and tapped her chest twice and then pointed a thumb up. Approval, small and precise. He smiled and bowed, because even a bowed thank-you gave structure to an evening.

At ten, his phone buzzed again. New message, same number: We understand that participants from Asia may not be able to cover the visa deposit. For this time only, you can transfer to our Singapore partner through PayNow. We will refund in London. Name: Event Media Pte Ltd. UEN: 2019*****. Must do now to secure seat.

He stared at the words. He wanted to scream and he wanted to laugh. He did neither because airports disapproved of extremes. He typed: No. Then he deleted it. Then he typed nothing and put the phone face down on his thigh. The red string around the backpack zip dug into his finger where he had looped it, and he welcomed the pain because it converted some abstract thing into a physical one he could point to.

He called Ah Ma. He did not know what lie he intended to tell until she answered and breathed his name into his ear like a blessing. “I am at the airport,” he said, not lying. “Got so many people. The light very nice.”

“Got waterfall?” she said hopefully.

“Got. Big big. Tomorrow I send picture.” He held the small word tomorrow the way you hold a bird that might peck.

“Bring magnet,” she said, returning to what in her mind was the axis of all travel.

“Okay,” he said, and the syllables put a small anchor in the dark water. He did not tell her that he was not going anywhere because he did not know if that was true yet and because sometimes you had to let hope sit in the room a little longer before you asked it for identity papers. He hung up and watched the people continue to be people, their trolleys squeaking, their shoes making tiny weather systems on the polished floor. He thought of the Old Library and the tape cross. He thought of his mother, the way you think of a country you have never visited but whose language you speak badly when you are drunk. He thought of the judges and their eyebrows and buttons and felt, suddenly, an aggression toward their faces that surprised him. He had wanted them to see him. He had wanted their seeing to bounce off the surface of him and turn him into something that did not have to wipe tables anymore.

By eleven the terminal thinned, and the people who were left were either late or early. He went up to Jewel because movement was easier than sitting and because water falling in a ring promised a kind of prophecy. The rain vortex thundered into itself in disciplined ecstasy, a domesticated cyclone performing its circus trick. People stood around it in a halo holding their phones up like prayers. He stood, and after a minute he found the particular square of standing that felt like his. He closed his eyes. He listened to the water and let it reset the metronome inside him that he had allowed other people to wind too fast. When he opened his eyes, there was a small boy next to him holding a balloon that had escaped his fist and was shuddering at the end of its ribbon like an eager dog. The boy looked up at him the way children do when they want to see if you are dangerous. He raised an eyebrow at the balloon’s shimmy. The boy made a face and then laughed. Liang held the rhythm of the water in his chest and began to tap his tongue against his teeth to make a sound like droplets hitting steel, soft, precise. The boy’s eyes went round. Liang added the oar sound, very soft, and it occurred to him with a shock of something like grief that this was the closest thing he had had to an audience all day that had needed him.

Near midnight he went back to Terminal 1, because you cannot keep circling a rainstorm forever and pretend it is movement. He stood near a window where the planes were taxiing and felt like a person in a play where the stagehands had forgotten to change the set. He typed one last message because the ritual needed closure even if the content did not: I waited. You didn’t come. Then, without thinking, he added, I can also sing here. It was ridiculous and true, and sending it made a small heat burst in his throat that he chose to enjoy as if it was soup.

He packed his phone and stood up and walked to the SBS Transit night bus stop. Changi, too kind to sleep, offered him a bench of steel that cooled his palms. The bus driver looked at him with the resigned compassion of men who carried other people’s evenings for a living. He tapped his card. He sat at the back where the world was framed in giant windows. As the bus pulled out and the terminal slid away, he felt the relief of surrender wash over him and hated it a little for how good it felt. He watched the lights blur. The night outside arranged itself around his face on the glass like a picture that did not belong to this decade. He imagined lines unspooling behind him—the red thread from his bag, the invisible string that tied him to his grandmother’s kitchen, the long elastic that connected him to a stage in a country that had probably stopped making shows worth watching years ago—and he imagined them not snapping but winding themselves back onto their spools because they had discovered the end of their length.

When the bus dove into the ECP and the sea became a flat black comfort on his left like a friend you could be silent with, he took out his phone and, on a sudden gut, opened the memo app. He hit record. He sang the boat song into it, but this time he added words. He did not plan them. He let them step out of a place he had always kept swept. He sang, in English and then in Mandarin when English could not carry the weight without buckling, about the boy at the bus stop who waited for a sign with his name on it, about a woman in a flat holding a red string like a lifeline in a room that remembered children louder than it did now, about the waterfall that never reached the sea and the plane that did not turn into a bird because it had decided it was already enough, being a plane. He sang about a man with a runway in his chest that had lights he himself could switch on, and he sang about feet that knew the way home even when the brain did not. The bus turned and the recording caught a squeak of the shock absorbers as if the city was chiming along. He stopped and saved it and named it Old Library because names had to go somewhere, and because once you name something you can put it on a shelf and return to it with respect.

He got off at his stop and walked. The estate was quiet in the particular way of Singapore nights, a quiet that had neighbours and cats and a distant TV laugh track. He climbed the stairs because the lift was occupied by something that smelled like paint and because he wanted his body to tire so his mind would be forced to follow. At Ah Ma’s door he put his ear to the wood. He heard snores, soft, reliable. He let his head rest there for a beat that lasted longer than a beat and less than a prayer. He unlocked the door with the blue-cup key because he did not trust his fingers not to be clumsy in the morning. He left his bag by the shoe rack and walked barefoot to her room. He stood at the threshold and watched her breathe. He thought of how he had stood at the tape cross in the Old Library and of the sense that your body knows when it is in the right place even if your brain is arguing. He went to the couch and lay down in the posture of a man who had been saved from something and was embarrassed by the relief.

In the morning he woke to sunlight with the discipline of someone who had not actually slept. Ah Ma shuffled in with her hair standing up like grass after rain. “You came back,” she said, pleased as if she had predicted the weather. “I dream last night you catch a bird. The bird want to fly but the window is close, so you open other window and the bird say, ‘Thank you auntie.’”

He laughed because absurdity is a bridge. “Polite bird,” he said.

She nodded, serious. “Bird must be polite,” she said, then tilted her head. “You go or not?”

He could have lied and said delay, and perhaps he did lie because he said, careful, “Later.” It was true if you flexed later until it covered the next decade. He made coffee. He thought of the recording. He thought of the part-time coach videos he had watched where the women in black leggings told him to stand as if someone had hooked him on a string running from the top of his head to the sky. He googled with coffee steam curling under his chin: open mic singapore. The results came in their practical way. There was a bar on Haji Lane that had a Monday night where a man with a beard judged by clapping. There was an Esplanade concourse call for buskers that required a video and patience. There was a community centre in Bukit Timah that had a cultural night and said, in unpunctuated hope, all talents welcome.

He thought of the Old Library woman and her clipboard and how her eyes had gone to the place where she wrote things. He imagined her writing Not ready, and he wondered if he agreed. He thought of the young man he had been at two a.m., making faces at a plastic plant that had never had to judge anybody. He thought of the way his throat had closed not because he did not want to sing but because his body had flinched at the possibility of not being enough. He opened the recording again and listened. It was not brilliant. It had holes. His words tumbled over the beat like children who had been told to walk in a line and refused. But in the middle there was a shape he recognised as his. He played that part twice. He played it a third time and felt his eyes grow hot for the joy of recognising himself.

Later, at the restaurant, he put his bag in the corner without comment. Mr. Chua raised his eyebrows and did not ask questions. Maya shot him a look that had a whole conversation in it and then came up later near the cutlery tray and said, out of the side of her mouth, “London cancelled ah.”

“Postponed,” he said, and she did not point out the difference because she was merciful. He showed her the recording when the lunch rush thinned, earbud split between their ears like a vote. She listened with an attention that made him stand straighter and then, when it finished, she said, “Solid lah,” and smacked his shoulder with a towel because embarrassment needed a ritual too. “You send to Esplanade. You do proper. Don’t wait for ang moh to say can. We got our own eyes.”

He breathed in, a long inhale that felt like warm soup. He took out his phone. He opened the Esplanade application page and filled in his name and address and wrote in the box where it asked for description: Original vocal performance with beatbox elements, Singapore stories. He did not write Britain or talent or special category. He uploaded the recording called Old Library. He pressed submit. The loading bar took a while in a way that felt like travel.

After work he went to the library that was not Old because it had moved and became all glass and air, and he sat in the music section listening to voices that had taken the long route. A boy practiced a flute in the corner, his cheeks bright with effort. A girl in a school uniform whispered her physics formulas to the beat of a pop song only she could hear. He took a pencil and a notebook and wrote down the words he had sung on the bus, chiselling them into shapes that did not collapse when he looked away. He added a verse that was just the sound of the word Ah repeated with different weights until it meant five different people. He tried to write something that could be sung at a void deck and not sound ridiculous, something that could be sung at a big white stage and not be eaten by the room.

When he went home, Ah Ma was asleep with the TV murmuring at her like a loyal old relative. He went to the fridge and looked at the magnets. The New York pretender he had bought in Bugis glinted at him with its fake freedom. He wanted to throw it away and then he did not because he could not bring himself to damage a small harmless ambition. He reached for the place on the door where there was a gap shaped like an invitation and pictured a Union Jack magnet there, ridiculous and real. He smiled at the nothing and told himself he would buy the cheapest, tackiest version in Mustafa Centre and not tell anyone where it had been made. He closed the fridge gently. The red thread on his bag glowed against the dark like a tiny artery that had refused to be severed.

At dawn, just before the sky decided, his phone buzzed. An email from the Esplanade queue robot, received, thank you, we will be in touch, please note high volume, patience appreciated. And below it, a new message, not a robot. It was from a name he did not know, with a .sg address, a subject line that made his breath catch in a way that was not panic: Stamford Arts Centre Open Stage—Shortlist. He opened it and read the sentences that were plain and unadorned and contained more hope than fireworks. We heard your audition at the Old Library. One of our volunteers shared your clip. We’re putting together a small night of local voices; no judges, no buzzer. If you’re interested, we’d like you to sing three songs. Can you make July 6?

He held the phone to his forehead like a cold cloth. He laughed and then choked on it and then laughed again. He walked to his grandmother’s door and leaned on the frame and said, because words were the way you built a bridge across a room, “Ah Ma? The lion building called. They want me to sing.”

She made a small noise that could have been assent, could have been the universe clearing its throat. He thought of the tape cross. He thought of the line on the floor of a hall where a young man stands and tries. He thought of the airport and the desk that had not existed. He thought of the waterfall that sang dutifully until people drifted away and then kept going because that was the arrangement. He stood up straighter. He went to the kitchen to make breakfast. The aircon dripped its small predictable rain into a bucket the handyman had promised to remove by lunch, and he believed him. He believed in lunch. He believed in July. He believed he could bend the window open with his voice inch by inch until the bird could see another square of sky that was not exported, and say thank you auntie, and fly.By the first Monday of July, the air carried that particular ambition of heat that made even the clouds look like they were trying to be something else. Liang replied yes to the Stamford Arts Centre email before he could think of a reason to ration his courage. His thumb hovered over the keyboard as if there was a correct way to spell acceptance beyond the letters themselves. He wrote: Yes, I can. Three songs. Thank you. He added, after a breath, the names of the songs that did not yet exist in any way that could withstand the light: Old Library, Vortex, Red Thread. He hit send and then stared at the sent message like it was a door he had shut between himself and a room he would have to enter by another way.

The days arranged themselves like dominos he could tip without knocking everything down. He bought a second-hand recorder from a man in Yishun who met him under a block and produced it from a shoebox as if it was contraband fruit. It had a dent and a sticker of a cartoon bear peeling at the edges, and when Liang blew into it, it made a sound like a bird that had been convinced to sing in a new climate. He recorded his own attempts and then played them back and found, to his relief, that certain turns of his voice were not a dream he had had about somebody else.

At work, Mr. Chua carved out his approval in practical halves. “You take this slot off,” he said, circling a section on the rota with a pen that had stopped believing in its own ink. “But you come Saturday lunch. Uncle Liao’s group. They always complain not enough ice.” He added, almost conversational, “Your performance got ticket or not?”

“Free,” Liang said, because the email had been very clear about this. “Open stage.”

“Good,” Mr. Chua said, and then, with a sincerity that he fit into his manager voice like contraband, “Means more audience.”

Maya turned up to the staff alley one afternoon wearing the keychain microphone clipped to her belt like a holster. “How,” she said. “Your set?”

“Got names,” he said. “Names first, then songs will find.”

“That one is also art,” she said gravely. “You need somebody to play guitar? My cousin knows two chords and a half.”

“I try solo first,” he said. “If I die then I call him.”

Ravi offered him advice that sounded like it had been passed down across many kitchens. “Before you sing, eat one banana,” he said. “Not too much. Just to tell your stomach don’t start any nonsense.”

“What if I don’t like banana?”

“Then you suffer,” Ravi said, not unkindly. “Don’t drink cold water before. It makes the throat angry.”

The first night he tried the Haji Lane open mic, he wore the jacket that had borrowed confidence stitched into its seams and stood outside the bar pretending to read a menu that was actually a chalkboard of jokes about beer. The street was a small carnival of other people’s plans. Lights were strung like recommendations between shophouses. Perfume from a nearby Arab perfumery muscled its way into the air. He had messaged ahead and a man with a beard and a voice like a friendly sermon had replied: Five minutes per act. Two songs max. No Wonderwall, please. At the door, the man took one look at him and grinned like they were playing a game where only one of them knew the rules. “You’re Liang,” he said. “Seat you want to throw up from or seat for champions?”

“Somewhere I can see the toilet,” Liang said.

When his name was called, he felt the old cool lake inside him and the new small current running through it. He tapped the mic and the sound bounced back at him in a way that made him want to flinch. He didn’t. He kept his feet planted like the video had told him. He faced the row of faces, some looking, some looking at their phones, some not needing to look because their ears were open like windows in a storm. “Hi,” he said. “I’m Liang. This is… a song from a library that is not a library, and a bus that was not going anywhere.”

There was a laugh that agreed not to be cruel. He began. He made the oar sound and the soft percussion of rain, and found the words to Old Library coming out with more willingness than he had expected. The second verse got tangled up with a cough the way a kite gets temporarily snagged on a tree branch, but it came loose without losing its shape. When he finished, there was a clatter of applause that sounded, to his starving ear, like utensils on a table waiting for food. A woman at the bar who was wearing a dress printed with lemons shouted, “One more!”

He sang the skeleton of Vortex, the one about the waterfall that never left, and when he reached the line he had been hoarding—when water learns to fall without leaving, it learns a second talent called staying—the room quieted in a way that made him understand something about silence he had not understood at two a.m. in a hostel. Silence could be generous if you let it. After, at the bar, the bearded man clapped him on the shoulder. “Come back,” he said. “Bring more. Bring the same and make it different.”

On Tuesday, he went with Ah Ma to the polyclinic because her left knee had begun to complain in a tone that implied betrayal. The waiting room had the panicked vinyl cheer of places where people come to negotiate with their own bodies. Posters reminded you to wash your hands as if that could reverse fortune. A cartoon kidney grinned at him as if it had a discount to offer. He filled out forms for her and watched the letters of her name hitch like an old car on a hill when she tried to write them. “Last time,” she said, more to the air than to him, “I write for other people. I fill form until the pen got no ink already.”

“Now you rest,” he said.

She nodded, but the nod was at a person who had built a factory of rest already in her mind where the machines would never turn off. “You practice your song,” she said in the lift on the way back, as if she had been holding the sentence under her tongue since breakfast. “You sing the one with the boat. And the red string. Don’t sing about viruses. People now don’t like.”

“I don’t like also,” he said.

He practiced in her living room while she napped, the fan turning like a reasonable argument above his head. He stood on the tiles and did the thing with his hands that notate time when you don’t have a drummer, an invisible metronome. He tried tying the red thread around the head of the recorder, only to discover that it made a small damp sound against the wood when he moved, an unwanted tambourine. He retied it around his wrist. He wrote the chorus of Red Thread with a blunt pencil that insisted on bad handwriting, and the words looked like a child’s but they felt like somebody older had been consulted. In one verse he wrote about the way his grandmother’s wrist bones felt like prayer beads under the red, in another he wrote about the thin line in his passport photo where his mouth remembered to be serious. He kept the Mandarin to the places where the English tried to joke and failed. He left a space for a line in Hokkien he could not quite catch the rhythm of without sounding like a person impersonating his childhood. He called his uncle in Jurong and asked for a phrase. The uncle, slightly drunk on nostalgia or Tiger, said, “Jit lang jit sim.” One person, one heart. He wrote that down and then wrote it again because the second time you write something is when you decide to keep it.

There was, of course, the business of the scam trying to pester the edges of his day. The +44 number sent a last message that sounded like a teacher who had been denied the right to scold: You miss your chance. We move on. He blocked it, then unblocked it because blocking felt like slamming a door that might be needed for ventilation, then blocked it again and held the small triumph like a toy car. He went to the neighbourhood police post because the poster in the MRT had told him you could. The officer on duty had a Tupperware of biscuits on the counter and a patience that had the light weight of something he put down when he went home. “We see this one a lot,” he said, scanning Liang’s screenshots. “You’re not the only one who want to believe. It’s not stupid. It’s just… human.”

“I almost send money,” Liang admitted, and the admission removed a small stone that had been lodged somewhere in his chest.

“Almost is also a kind of skill,” the officer said. He slid a pamphlet across the counter that had a cartoon villain in a trench coat and a fedora as if the nineteen-fifties had decided to make an appearance. “Warn your friends. Tell your grandmother to beware also, but maybe don’t tell her this part.”

“I won’t,” Liang said, and the officer nodded at him like a man who knows the chain of kindness often depends on the correct decisions about who to alarm.

When July 6 arrived, it did not clear its throat. It just arrived with the punctuality of heat. He was at the restaurant for the lunch shift, because promises continued to be threads. Mr. Chua let him go at two with a boxed-up staff meal and a pointed look at the clock that was more blessing than threat. “Don’t go and eat so full you cannot sing,” Mr. Chua said, and then, almost like a joke, “If got extra ticket, sell to me.”

“At Stamford Open Stage,” Liang said, playing along. “VIP.”

Ravi pressed a small packet into his hand. “Salt. Just a bit on your tongue before,” he said. “My cousin who flies says it tricks the throat to wake up.”

Maya hugged him without announcing it, a quick wrap that was efficient and somehow devastating. “You go make the aunties cry,” she said. “Not because your pitch wrong. Because you say something they know.”

He took the train to Bugis and walked the last block to the Stamford Arts Centre because walking arranged his breath. The building was the colour of cream biscuits, with shutters that had learned the trick of being both heritage and practical. The lion statues out front had faces that were more placid than he remembered, perhaps because he had grown up and their judgement had shrunk. Volunteers in black T-shirts that said STAGE HAND had the efficient happiness of people whose joy was connected to other people’s trying. A girl with a high ponytail and a clipboard checked his name off with a flourish. “Rehearsal at four-thirty,” she said. “But we’re running on Singapore time, so maybe five. Green room is up the stairs, first door, got pandan cake.”

The green room was a former classroom full of couches that had once been other couches. A tabla leaned against a chair like a person resting. A man tuned a guzheng slowly as if each string needed to be introduced to its neighbours. A poet with hair dyed a deliberate white sat in a corner annotating a printout with such ferocity it looked like she was trying to rescue the words from a burning building. Liang took a small slice of the pandan cake because refusing would have been rude to the cake, and sugar had been recommended by at least three people he trusted. He found a corner by a cracked window where the air was less crowded and breathed. He sang under his breath to test how the room answered, and the room was kind.

At five-twenty, he stood on the stage proper for the first time. It was not large. It was a shoebox compared to the stadium stages he had watched on his phone, but it had the advantage of being real. The black floor was taped in white Xs and crosses that looked like a treasure map. A man in rimless glasses ran through the sound check with the speed of someone who had grieved over feedback and promised never to let it ruin an evening again. “Mic check,” Liang said, and his voice came back to him smoother than he had expected, like his throat had dressed up.

“You want reverb?” the man asked.

“Just a little bit, please,” Liang said, feeling like a person ordering a sauce. He sang the first bars of Old Library and the room showed him where to put the sound. He set the recorder on a chair, looked at the chair until it consented to be a person, and added the soft beat. The rimless man gave him a thumbs up without looking up from his console, which meant he meant it.

In the green room, he sat next to the guzheng lady and the tabla man and discovered they were siblings who had been made to learn different instruments by a father who believed in diversification. They told him about getai, about aunties who brought umbrellas to daytime shows to ward off either the sun or the possibility of not being seen. The poet with deliberate white hair asked him if he had a title, and when he said yes, she nodded and did not ask what, which he appreciated. He tied the red string tighter and it bit into his wrist in a way that felt like it was taking a blood sample for fortune.

He had invited exactly three people because he believed in a manageable amount of humiliation. Maya turned up early with glitter on her eyelids and a packet of sliced mango in a plastic container with a handwritten label: For champions only. Ravi sent a message that said Kitchen crisis, boss will kill me if I leave, but my heart is there. Mr. Chua did not come, but his absence came with a text of a photo of the restaurant’s empty sambal tray, captioned, in his dry fashion, You see, you save people from this misery. Ah Ma had insisted on coming until she did not. She stood at the door in her slippers and looked at him with her face arranged into resolution and then the resolution softened like butter left too near the stove. “Later I watch your video,” she said, and he kissed the top of her head because his hands were full.

The first act was a primary school choir who wore their school uniforms because rehearsal had been directly after class and logistics are often better than aesthetics. They sang a Hokkien song about the moon with the straight-backed seriousness of children who have been promised bubble tea later. The second act was the poet, who read about buses at midnight in a way that made the people in the back make a sound that was halfway between a laugh and a sigh. The audience was a patchwork: office workers who had wandered in holding tote bags, aunties who had brought their own fans, a man in gym shorts who pretended he was just sitting down to rest and then did not stand up for an hour.

When they called his name, the cool lake inside him broke into smaller lakes that decided to get to know each other. He walked to the taped cross and stood where the white met the white and set his feet like he was planting something he hoped would grow. The lights arrived, warm on his face, asking for nothing but his attention. The first song was Old Library and he let it be old, in the way that a thing you have practiced becomes an ancestor who has agreed to carry you if you don’t argue. He did not cough. The note that had stumbled in the Old Library found the stairs this time. He looked up and found the back of the hall because the videos had told him to sing to the people in the last row, not the first, because the first were already interested and the last needed convincing.

Between songs, he spoke. He said, “I am a waiter. I am a grandson. I thought I was going to London by accident. I didn’t. Turns out there are stages on this island that don’t need your passport.” The audience made the small noise that is not laughter but is not indifference either. He sang Vortex and in the middle he let himself do the drop-pattern beat with his tongue against his teeth, and a boy in the second row with a haircut that tried to be a wave mimed the movement without knowing he was doing it. He sang Red Thread and when he reached the line with Jit lang jit sim, he heard an auntie in the third row say softly, “Aiyo,” the sound that expresses recognition in a language older than grammar.

On the last chorus his voice did a small unplanned thing, a slide where he had not planned a slide. He went with it because the night had gone with him. He ended and the clapping was not thunder and it did not need to be. It was two hundred small storms making weather together. He bowed and saw in the wing the girl with the ponytail and clipboard grinning at him as if she had always known how this would go, and behind her, in the shadow, the woman from the Old Library with her same neat bun and her same clipboard, giving him a nod that was not apology and not amends, but a small honest acknowledgement that also felt like medicine.

After, outside, by the lion that had forgotten to be fierce, people told him Thank you the way you tell a hawker his char kway teow is better than other people’s because you know he cannot accept the compliment directly without damaging his superstition. Maya hugged him again, less efficient this time. “Aunties cry,” she said, triumph unhidden. “Also me.”

He pretended to wipe sweat and actually wiped his eyes. “Thanks,” he said. “For mango.”

“You see, mango day very powerful,” she said, as if she had planned it.

An old man stopped in front of him, his hand on a walking stick that had been inherited or purchased—there was no way to tell. “You sing like you got two throats,” he said, approval embedded in the odd phrasing. “One for yourself, one for us.”

“Thank you,” Liang said, because this was the kind of compliment you could not put in a CV and that made it valuable. The old man nodded towards the building. “Last time this place got drama class,” he said. “Now got you.” He moved on at the pace of someone who, even if late, could not be late for his own life.

They drifted in the way crowds do, particles losing the shape of a group as they rediscover their own orbits. He sat on the low wall by the steps and ate the last piece of pandan cake he had saved in a napkin because victory is sweeter if you can turn it into something literal. He took out his phone and opened his messages to +44. The chat bubbled up with its little grey ticks and no blue. He typed nothing because sometimes the absence of a message is the best way to speak. He scrolled instead to the thread with Ah Ma. He sent her a photo of the lion and the entrance and his own face smiling too large for the frame. He wrote: Later I show you video. She sent back a sticker of a bear clapping because the phone had taught her that bears clapped.

On the way home, he cut through the Bras Basah complex because books smelled like a cheap kind of travel. He bought a magnet from a corner stall that had decided to sell many things at once: batteries, ink, fish food. The magnet was a bad rendition of the lion’s face, its mane a series of comic squiggles. He held it between his fingers like a coin and felt its cheap weight. He didn’t care. It would go on the fridge among the places and the lies and the promises, a new small honesty.

At the void deck, the chess table had its evening court in session. Mrs. Tan waved at him from a bench, her cat shirt upgraded to one with a cat wearing sunglasses. “You sing ah!” she called, in the tone of a headline. “We can hear a bit from downstairs, got echo.”

“Later you must buy ticket,” he said, playing along.

She put a hand to her heart. “You cannot charge me,” she said. “I am investor.”

He laughed and took the stairs two at a time because the lift had become too slow on nights like this. At the door, he paused because the ritual had been paying him back. He put his ear to the wood. He heard the aircon’s drip, the kettle’s click, the TV’s murmur. He unlocked the door and stepped into his life as if it had been tuned to the key his name made when he said it aloud.

Ah Ma was awake, slippers half on, red thread shining meekly at her wrist like a promise that did not expire. “Boy,” she said, and clapped once. “How?”

“Solid,” he said, and made his hand open and close the way she did when she saw a magic trick.

“Good,” she said, relieved as if the weather had obeyed the forecast. “I boil barley soup. You drink, your throat will say thank you auntie.”

He went to the kitchen and took the magnet out and put it on the fridge door in the space he had seen earlier. It held. He pressed it with his thumb until it decided not to slide. He looked at it. The lion’s bad mane grinned back at him, shameless. Around it, the other magnets made their own quiet chorus of souvenirs and lies and intentions. He put the key back under the blue cup where it belonged. He sat at the table and drank the barley soup that tasted like the inside of certain afternoons and the end of certain songs. He breathed in the steam. He let his shoulders drop, as if someone had come up behind him and taken a bag off without him noticing.

Later, in the common room at the hostel, the plastic plant was still there being dependable. He turned on the small recorder, then turned it off, and then turned it on again because sometimes you had to be dramatic for yourself. He sang the new version of Old Library into the quiet. He sang Red Thread, careful with the Hokkien, respectful with the Mandarin, mutinous with the English. He added at the end a new tiny thing, two lines that had come at the bus stop with the night wind licking the corners of the paper: If you waited for a sign with your name on it, maybe this is cheaper. If the car doesn’t come, open your mouth. The plant said nothing, but the router blinked like a gentle metronome, and he felt, absurdly, like he had applied for something and been accepted by a committee that lived in his own chest.

The next morning, the esplanade email arrived like a sensible friend. Thank you for your submission. We'd like to schedule an audition. Please prepare two pieces, one original. He smiled at the timing and did not pretend not to feel chosen by coincidence. He texted Maya: Esplanade ask me to audition. She replied: Ang moh esplanade? He replied: Singapore only. She sent back ten fireworks and one durian. He messaged Ravi: Banana or salt? Ravi wrote back: Both, but don’t mix.

He put on his shoes and went to Ah Ma’s, because even in a city with a new stage and a new email, there were floor tiles that remembered his feet. On the way up in the lift, he looked at his reflection in the metal and tried the stage face he had invented, the one that was a little like his waiter face but allowed more weather. He stood straighter without meaning to. He turned a little in profile and practiced the nod he would give to applause he could not control. He caught himself and laughed. The lift doors parted with their small habitual sigh, and he stepped into the corridor full of plants and neighbours and gossip. He walked toward the door with the blue cup and the magnet, and the lake in him sat still enough for him to see the sky in it. He knocked once, then let himself in, because nothing that mattered asked him to wait outside.Chapter 6

The email with the audition slot looked ordinary, which was comforting. There were no exclamation marks, no emojis trying to sell him his own future. It said simply: Esplanade Concourse Audition—Wednesday, 4 p.m. Please arrive 20 minutes early for registration. He read it twice on his way to the market, the phone screen flashing in and out of shade as the void deck trees made their own slow Morse code on the ground. He tucked the phone away and bought chye sim that had the right firmness when he pressed the stems, spring onions that made his fingers smell like the beginning of certain soups, and a bunch of bananas because Ravi would ask later if he had been an obedient student in the ways that mattered to throats.

Ah Ma sat at the table sorting dried anchovies as if they were invitations, each one needing her attention to justify its presence. She had moved the blue cup from its usual place to the other side of the sink and did not notice. He noticed and did not move it back immediately because superstition had taught him that sometimes the house argued with you and needed to win small things. “You go where today?” she asked, pushing the anchovies into a jar with the slow satisfaction of a task finishing itself.

“Library,” he said, because he had plans to stop at the new one to write, and because the Esplanade was technically a kind of library too if you were generous about what you thought knowledge looked like. “I come back before dinner. You want mee sua or porridge?”

“Porridge,” she said, folding the word around her tongue like a small, soft fruit. “Today the tooth and the mouth quarrel. The tooth say don’t eat. The mouth say cannot.”

“I make the porridge the way you taught me,” he said. “Not so watery. Not so thick.”

She nodded, satisfied by the promise. He tied a spare red thread to the handle of her cupboard because she had started forgetting which one held the bowls and which one hid the biscuits, and the string was a way to make doors speak. She watched him do it with the serious interest she reserved for small domestic magic. “Later I go downstairs to buy lottery,” she announced with grandeur. “The number is lucky. I dream of a dog got three legs. Means—you know means what?”

“Means buy three,” he supplied, even though he knew her system for decoding dreams had no internal logic beyond insistence and a good story.

He took the MRT at a non-peak hour because he had earned the right to breathe between strangers. The train swayed with the lazy confidence of a thing that had been taught not to fall. When it slid into City Hall, he stayed on and watched the station name repeat itself on the map like reassurance, then got out at Esplanade because the day required a rehearsal he could perform for himself. Outside, the sun bounced off the durian domes with all the delicacy of a drum solo. The air smelled briefly of roasted chestnuts from a cart and then, as he rounded the corner, of water baked under sky. He stood under the Helix Bridge and let the bay wind tug at the hair at the back of his neck, as if checking that he was real and not a paper version of himself glued onto the scene.

He walked into the building and was immediately cooler, as if the air had learned manners inside. The concourse stretched its width like a polite host. He stood at the edge of the space and watched a group of secondary school students in choir T-shirts cluster near the stage, bodies loose with the performative boredom of teenagers. He spotted a cleaner dragging a bin, her head tilted to an invisible radio. The high glass let in a softened version of sky. Somebody’s toddler, freed temporarily from a stroller, toddled toward the stage with religious fervour and was caught gently by a man whose tiredness was not yet mean. This would be his environment, he thought, a public place pretending to be a living room and sometimes succeeding.

He did not sing then because rehearsal required witnesses and tourists were a different species. He took out his notebook and wrote instead. Old Library had a bridge now, Vortex had a better first line that meant less and suggested more, and Red Thread had a goodbye that did not bow, just stood at the door and waited. He pencilled in places to breathe because the videos had taught him that breath was not a betrayal, it was architecture. He wrote down reminders that looked like insults—don’t speed, don’t shrink your mouth, shoulders not up—and then, because he had learned not to bully himself in public, drew a small durian in the corner of the page and gave it a face that was ambitious but approachable.

On Wednesday, Mr. Chua declared the lunch shift unusually calm, which meant three tables of diplomats and one office group with a complicated allergy to fun. At two-thirty, he waved Liang toward the door with a flick that was permission disguised as impatience. “Go,” he said. “If fail, cannot come back and cry here. Got customers.”

“Okay,” Liang said, and grinned in a way that made the older man roll his eyes because relief needed disguises too. Maya slipped a small sachet of honey into his pocket like a contraband drug, told him to suck it slowly when he reached the stairs, and then threatened to withhold her friendship forever if he embarrassed her by fainting. Ravi, on dish duty, held up a banana with the gravity of a priest brandishing a relic. “Now,” he instructed. “Don’t act cool.”

He ate it, the fruit sweet and efficient, and chased it with a sip of warm water because the internet and old men had collaborated for once. On the MRT he stood and let his knees bend fractionally at every turn like a person trying to be useful to the laws of physics. He reached the Esplanade twenty minutes early as requested and was rewarded with a queue of three already forming at the registration table. A woman with a scarf tied in a way that looked like it had been copied from a good auntie at a wedding asked for his name and says, “We will take you in the second batch. Two pieces, five minutes each. There will be noise, because this is a mall pretending to be a temple. Don’t let it make you angry.”

He laughed because he had never gotten instructions for anger before. He warmed up near a pillar, making small sounds with his lips that did not scare children. A man with a guitar case opened it and revealed a guitar with the stickers of a thousand youthful plans. A girl in black looked like she had accidentally come from a ballet class into a poetry competition and decided to improvise adulthood. He saw the woman from the Stamford night in a corner, the ponytailed volunteer, now with a lanyard and the easy competence of someone who had slept five hours and drank something strong on the way. She gave him a discreet wave that immediately downgraded his fear from feral to housebroken.

The concourse had its own acoustics. Sound did not behave here the way he expected from the library and the shoebox hall. His voice, when he tested a vowel, came back to him with a sheen and a delay, as if it had gone shopping and returned with something slightly different than what he had sent it to buy. He told his body to be a metronome and not to get flirted away by the echo. When the panel called him—a panel of three, not faceless, a woman with short hair and soft eyes; a man in his thirties with a band T-shirt under a blazer; and the rimless-glasses sound man who had somehow multiplied and was now part of all stages—he went to the taped X. He stood where the light did not blind but insisted.

“Whenever you’re ready,” the short-haired woman said. “What will you sing?”

“Old Library, and Red Thread,” he said, and his voice sounded like someone had cleaned it with a good cloth. He began with the oar sound and the small rain beat, soft so the panel would lean toward him and not back away, and he let the first verse sit firmly on its haunches. Behind the panel, a cluster of tourists drifted like well-meaning ghosts and paused because pausing is free. An auntie with two shopping bags slowed and then sat on the steps with the relief of a verdict. A boy in a Spider-Man T-shirt stopped trying to climb the railing to watch. He could see all of them and he did not look at any of them directly because he had learned that to sing is to aim at the space a person makes around themselves.

The microphone did its job. His mouth sent a row of words and the hall caught them and adjusted their shoes, then put them down carefully again. On the second line of the second verse, a cleaning machine started its hum halfway across the concourse, a mechanical whale singing to its calf. He smiled because the city was insistent and because the sound now belonged to him too. He let it become part of the percussion, folded the rhythm into his tongue beat, and then stretched the bridge over it like a polite umbrella. When he reached the last chorus, he did the tiny slide again because it had started to feel like a kind of blessing.

There was no applause because this was not a show, but the woman on the panel put her pen down and that was, in certain rooms, a kind of clapping. “Thank you,” she said. “Second song.”

He drank water because he was training himself to make need a habit not a failure. He sang Red Thread. He did not preface it with a speech because the song had been built to say its own name. He watched the auntie on the steps sway a little and then stop herself as if embarrassed. He watched the boy in Spider-Man punch the air softly when the beat returned because his body approved of repetition. He put Jit lang jit sim where he had promised himself he would, and a man who had been pretending not to listen made a small noise that was the sound of a memory climbing a fence. He finished and let the silence be small and good. The panel nodded in that way that people who enjoy being careful nod. The short-haired woman said, “We’ll email you,” and he realised he did not mind the sentence as much as he once had. It had stopped meaning exile. It meant there was a path and he had stepped on the first stone.

After, he rode an escalator down and someone touched his elbow lightly. It was the auntie from the steps, her shopping bags now heavier by the look of her effort, her face arranged into brisk kindness that could pass a law. “You sing nice,” she said. “My mother last time also tie red thread. You sing that one and my heart go and come back.”

“Thank you,” he said, because language had not offered him anything better for a stranger who had just handed him proof of existence. “You take care walking, auntie.”

She did not roll her eyes at the obviousness of the instruction, which felt like affection. She nodded and departed with the dignity of a small sovereign. He stood there a minute longer to get used to being a person who had sung to a space where other people were just buying ice cream.

He wanted to tell someone, and then realised he had several someones. He messaged Maya: Done. Didn’t die. She messaged back so fast he imagined her at the bus stop with her thumb saluting duty: You better don’t die because tonight got cover. He sent Ravi a photo of the stage, and Ravi replied with a sticker of a banana flexing its arm. He messaged Mr. Chua and kept the sentence simple because the man rewarded simplicity: Audition finished, I’m coming for dinner shift. Mr. Chua replied with a single okay and then, after a pause, in a separate bubble, Don’t forget to wash rice.

On the way home, he detoured past the old Supreme Court because there was a charity booth outside with a table of old photographs in black and white. A volunteer auntie waved him over. “Last time, here got so many weddings,” she said, tapping a photo of a girl in a white dress whose eyes had not yet learned the expression of people who were always being observed. He looked and nodded because he had learned the choreography of brief encounters, and because looking at other people’s history calmed him. He bought a postcard of the Singapore River with boats that looked like they were carrying secrets and slid it into his notebook next to the durian with a face.

The void deck was a good temperature. Mrs. Tan was asleep on the bench with her hand on her bag like a warning to thieves. He slipped past and took the stairs because the lift said Out of Service with the usual apology. At the door, the blue cup was back in its proper place. He let himself in and found Ah Ma arranging biscuits on a plate as if a guest were coming. “You finish?” she asked, eyes keen.

“I finish,” he said. He poured her tea. He described the hall and the boy in the Spider-Man shirt and the auntie with the shopping bags. He acted the cleaning machine for her because comedy is nutrition. She laughed and then touched his wrist because sometimes hands wanted to confirm what ears had just ingested. “Good,” she said. “You must remember to tie your shoe before you sing. If not later you fall down. People laugh for wrong reason.”

He told her about the email that would come or not come. She nodded as if email was just another name for fate and fate worked on the timetable of people with office jobs. They ate porridge with minced pork that he had seasoned with fish sauce as if sending a letter to childhood. She said it was too salty and then said after the fourth spoon that it was perfect. After dinner, he brought her to the corridor to watch the evening break into smaller useful pieces. A man on the next block’s balcony was playing a harmonica badly and with dedication. Somewhere below, a pressure cooker did its small frantic dance. A boy practicing his sepak takraw kick against the void deck pillar hit it in a steady metronome that touched the soles of Liang’s feet.

When he went back to the hostel later, the common room had two men arguing in whispers about football because their wives were asleep. The plastic plant did its excellent impersonation of forgiveness. He recorded a new version of Red Thread with the concourse’s echo fresh in his mouth. Halfway through, his phone vibrated against the coffee table. He finished the verse before he looked because discipline now had small teeth. The email sat there. He opened it with the odd calm of a person picking up a parcel that could be either a sweater or a snake.

It was neither. It was an invitation, dates and times and a polite paragraph about payment that was not large but not insulting. He had a slot for National Day week, the concourse, early evening, come at four for sound check, two sets of twenty minutes, bring your own small courage. He was requested to avoid politics and to remember families with children, to be mindful of language, to be part of something larger than himself in ways that both flattered and constrained. He read it through once, then again. He took a picture of the screen and sent it to Maya with the caption: This time I got ticket to my own country.

She replied with a picture of her face crying fake tears drawn with eyeliner. He sent the email to himself as if it were a valuable thing that needed to be stored in multiple places. He wrote to Mr. Chua in a fit of proactivity he did not recognise in himself and asked for the dates off. Mr. Chua replied with grudging efficiency: Set your roster with Maya. Don’t forget July end got company dinner.

He lay on his back on the hostel couch and stared at the ceiling’s brown water stain shaped like a friendly map of Australia. He thought of all the stages he had made: the restaurant aisle, the Old Library, the Stamford hall, the concourse where wealth and weather walked in and out wearing similar shoes. He thought of the other stage that had almost taken his money and given him nothing but a good story. He let his eyes close and opened them again and pictured the red thread trailing from his bag, from his wrist, from Ah Ma’s cupboard handle, connected to the tape X on the floor of a concourse stage, to the sound desk, to the cleaning machine, to the auntie with shopping bags who had said her heart go and come back, to a boy in Spider-Man who already had timing.

The week filled itself, as weeks do when the city is bored. He found a man who used to busk under the bridge and asked him about stamina. The man shrugged like a tide. “You stand properly and your feet won’t scold you,” he said. “Smile at people like you know them from somewhere good. Put a ballad in the middle because by then they trust you. If a kid dances in front of you, change your set. If a drunk man tries to hug you, call security. Don’t be a hero. Heroes always late to their own funeral.”

He took Ah Ma to the market early Sunday because heat before noon had a different personality. She moved through the stalls like a small queen whose court had shrunk to a square of concrete and the fishmonger. The egg auntie gave her a discounted tray because the old negotiations still paid interest. An aunty selling thread had a drawer of colours that made Liang stop the way men stop before aquariums. He bought red, yes, and also a coil of green because he liked the way it did not announce its luck but waited. The thread aunty looked at his hands and said, “You tie for ceremony or for protection?”

“For memory,” he said, and she nodded like he had passed a test she had not told him was happening.

Two nights before his concourse set, he woke to his phone vibrating with insistence. He fumbled and saw an unknown number calling. It was local, which made his body do a little inventory of all the people whose phones might be reaching him at two a.m. He answered, and a woman’s voice said, hesitant, “Hello? Is this—this is Liang, right?”

He sat up because strangers using your name at night wakes something old. “Yes,” he said. “Who is this?”

“This is Hui Lin,” she said, as if the name were something he might have tucked in a drawer twenty years ago. He did not recognise it. She paused, made a small unreadable sound. “I got your number from the old sewing factory WhatsApp group. Your grandmother used to work with my mother. I’m sorry to call so late. I… I don’t know if this is nothing, but I thought to tell you. I saw a woman near Kampong Glam today who looks like your mother. She was carrying a plastic bag with one mango. She looked like she was reading signs like they were in other language. I followed a bit, only a bit. I’m sorry. Then I lost her. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe I should not disturb.”

The room leaned. He put a hand on the back of the couch as if it would object. He wanted to ask all the questions and none. He breathed because air still had to come in and go out. “Okay,” he said, which was a stupid word and the only one he had safe access to. “Okay. Thank you. Can… can you send me the place?”

She did. A dropped pin appeared on his screen where a hawker stall’s name was misspelled and an alley had ambitions. He looked at it until it blurred with sleep. He thanked her properly and told her not to be sorry because the word had done too much work in his life. He did not sleep again, not really. He lay there and listened to the hostel’s night orchestra—snoring, footsteps, a shower running far away—and let a picture assemble itself: his mother, but older, a different gravity in her shoulders, a plastic bag with a mango making a bruise on her wrist, a face he had not seen for a decade wearing an expression he did not yet have words for.

The next morning he did not tell Ah Ma, because to aim the hope at her chest without evidence felt like cruelty. He made porridge because eating was a way to practise control, and because the day had to be false in small ways to survive the larger maybe. He texted Hui Lin with a thank-you that contained a question mark and received a voice note of a woman speaking fast as if speed could protect her from mistakes. The sewing factory, she said, had been demolished, of course, but the WhatsApp group was full of aunties who still knew whose sons were married badly and who had died with their eyes open. She said his mother had sung sometimes when the supervisor went to smoke. She said his mother had gone quiet before she went away. She said sorry again in the way of women who handled other people’s fragility without gloves.

He took the train toward Kampong Glam when his lunch break arrived and immediately regretted the decision because he had no plan beyond anxiety. He got off anyway at Bugis and let his feet name streets. The sun threw its weight in the narrow lanes. He passed shops that sold perfume in bottles that tried to be royalty, cloth stores where the bolts unfurled like afternoons, cafés where people pretended coffee could be art and sometimes succeeded. At the indicated corner, a cat lay on its side in the square of shade with the contentment of a successful heist. He stood there and looked at faces the way a person scans a crowd for a hat in a sea of umbrellas. It was both silly and not. He walked once down the block and once back, and then a third time because three had become important since Ah Ma’s dog dream. He saw women who could have been anybody’s mother and so were, teenagers ballooning with themselves, tourists whose skin spoke of planes. He did not see his mother, unless she was the one inside his body making his palms sweat.

He bought a mango, because to go home empty-handed was rude to his grandmother and because fruit had been a way to talk around other things since he was small. He went back to work and carried plates and smiled until his face developed a muscle memory for mercy. He told Maya only that he had received a phone call that made his brain a little loud, and she put a hand briefly on his arm in a way that was both ordinary and necessary. “Later you go again,” she said. “But maybe not alone.”

That night, he dreamed that the concourse was a market and the microphones were weighing scales and he kept trying to measure his voice but it rolled away, a mango with a mind of its own. He woke at four and wrote the image down because sometimes dreams gave you their fish without asking you to pay. He added a new couplet to Red Thread about fruit that refused to be sliced because it wanted to be eaten by the right teeth.

On National Day eve, the Esplanade concourse wore its public festival face. Flags had sprouted like amused flowers. The stage was dressed modestly in red and white. Families had decided to be together in the way discipline dictates. The afternoon bled into a cooler kind of warm. He arrived early to set his mouth where it needed to be. The sound man with rimless glasses had a new haircut and a joke about microphones catching fireworks. The short-haired programmer woman looked like she had slept and credited caffeine with her faith. The roster was full of local acts with names that tried and names that didn’t care. There was a Malay band who brought their own fan and used it thoughtfully. There was a choir of civil servants who did doo-wop with brave sincerity. There was a woman who played the erhu and sang Adele and did not ask for your approval.

He texted Hui Lin and told her he would be there, and she replied with a thumbs-up and a photo of her own hands holding fabric as if to prove her lineage. He did not tell her to bring his mother if she found her because that was not how you invited someone into a life. He messaged Aunty Mei to check on Ah Ma and received a photo of Ah Ma holding a plate of cut oranges and looking like she had invented the concept of generosity. He sent the team his set list—Old Library, Vortex, Red Thread, plus a cover of a Teresa Teng song he had picked because sometimes you had to genuflect to people who had done the work before you. Maya had arrived early with a small army of cousins and occupied a corner with the conviction of a government department. Ravi came late and squeezed in next to a pillar, waved at him like a man on a ship hailing another ship and then watched quietly, folding himself into the background the way good people do.

When the programmer introduced him, it was in the modest cadence of a person who believes in content more than ceremonies. He walked to the taped X and felt the floor give him back his weight. The first set began with Old Library because beginnings demanded to be acknowledged. The space responded as it had in rehearsal, but bigger now, thrumming with a holiday’s different oxygen. Children wobbled in front and then were collected by aunties who warned them that permanent things could not be touched. A boy in an NS uniform held hands with a girl in a dress with tiny strawberries and they leaned into each other like a single thought. The sound of a jet somewhere above the bay draped itself over his second verse and he decided on the spot to be thrilled by that rather than annoyed, which felt like adulthood.

He sang Vortex with more defiance than usual because the waterfall that never learned to leave now had navy ships in the distance pretending to guard something that maybe did not need guarding. He felt the words do their small job and was glad the world allowed small jobs. Between songs he spoke and then shut up because he had learned that a joke could flatten a song if it arrived at the wrong time. He let the red thread around his wrist scratch him one notch of adrenaline and sang the song that had been named after it. The Hokkien landed where four aunties breathed in and then out in the exact same shocked affection. A small girl started dancing like a person who had invented knees, and he shifted the beat infinitesimally and watched her grin at the fact that the world could change to suit her.

During the break between sets he wandered to the side of the hall to breathe and to put some honey on his tongue because the rituals had been working. A woman hovered near the pillar with a familiar hesitancy. He looked and knew before he knew. She had eyes like a door you remembered from a house you no longer lived in. Her hair had given up a fight some years ago and settled into its own economy. She held a plastic bag with something rounded in it heavy enough to pull the handles long. Her mouth found an expression that had once been common in his life and now felt like a new fruit.

He did not move immediately because bodies need time to catch up with narrative. She opened her mouth and shut it and opened it again and then chose, admirably, to smile. “You grew up,” she said, as if this were a trick he had undertaken without supervision. “Your voice also.”

He swallowed around the comb of honey. He said, because some words had to be said in the language you had learned them, “Ma, where you.”

She laughed and the laugh had rust and sunshine. “Here,” she said, and spread her hand a little like a weather report. She lifted the plastic bag as if to show she had done some legitimate activity. “I buy mango. I remember you like.”

He nodded because yes, he had liked mango, and also because sometimes you had to start with fruit so the rest could be invited into the room without panic. Hui Lin hovered just behind her, eyes busy with a protective ambition. He lifted his chin to her in gratitude so huge it embarrassed him. She lifted her hand and let it fall in an approximation of a salute. People flowed past them with snacks and children and opinions, none of them aware of the precise miracle happening next to a pillar.

“You sing,” his mother said, and it was not a question. “I hear. I don’t know all the words but I know the way you open your mouth. Same as when you cry last time. So big.”

He breathed because anything else would be impolite to oxygen. The programmer’s hand signal arrived from the other side of the stage—two minutes. He could have chosen to leave the stage vacant and sat on the floor and held his mother’s hand and watched the night be a night. He could have chosen to run. He heard his grandmother’s voice in his head, a sentence like a thread: Don’t dream until forget to live. He took his mother’s plastic bag gently and handed it to Hui Lin because people needed their hands for other things. He said, with his body already turning back to the stage because the world had arranged itself into an appointment he was loath to break, “Stay. I sing. Then we go home.”

He walked to the taped X with his heart misbehaving and his tongue remembering to be a church. He looked into the bright and found a new shade of shadow where someone stood that did not feel like absence. The second set began and for the first time he sang Old Library as if the rooms he had built had doors. He did not ask the audience for anything except their ears. He gave them the sound of a house remembering its own layout. He sang the cover of Teresa Teng and watched men who had never sung in public mouth the words with embarrassed sincerity. He ended with Red Thread because of course he did, and when he reached the Hokkien line, a thousand iterations of home braided themselves into a rope he could hold without hurting his hands.

After, the applause was not thunder and it did not need to be. It was a conversation. He bowed because gratitude was a muscle that worked best when used. He stepped off the stage and into a doorway made by Hui Lin’s body positioning expertise, and then into the small space where his mother stood, the plastic bag now a dumb witness. Up close, she had a small scar under her eye he had not put there, and one of her teeth leaned on another like a tired friend.

They walked, because standing still felt too loud. They moved into the evening where the bay threw a little wind at people like confetti. His mother touched the railings as if confirming their temperature. She did not hurry. He did not either. Hui Lin walked behind them briefly and then, sensing dignity, orbited ahead and became a person who admired the water loudly so the scene could be quiet. The fireworks rehearsal cracked once in the distance like a polite argument.

“At the factory,” his mother said, her voice trying on careful, “I heard your voice last time when you laugh. In the corridor. You laugh and then you stop. Like you swallow the laugh because someone say don’t laugh so loud. I remember. I think, this boy will need more air than this house.”

He had no memory of this corridor. He believed her because mothers are unreliable narrators and also the only ones who can be trusted with certain lies. “Why you didn’t call,” he said, because sometimes a cliché is a scaffold.

She looked at him as if he had asked her to draw a map to a country she had left as a child. “I went,” she said simply. “Then I forgot the way back. I do work. I go other place. I start again. I sit down. I see other people’s children. I look at the phone and it is a mirror.” She paused, not dramatically, just to breathe. “Then I hear a song in the hawker, the one you sing, but not you, and I think of my own mother. I think… aiya, see how.”

He was not sure whether to be angry, and then realised anger would require a time he had not lived and a stamina he was unwilling to spend. “You can come,” he said, the sentence humble and ridiculous and true. “You can see Ah Ma. She will scold you until your ears become small.”

His mother snorted once, and the snort contained a decade of apologies he had not asked for but would accept. “Later she throw slipper,” she said. “Okay. Throw. We go.”

Hui Lin reappeared as if cued with professional skill. She had a car that had seen better upholstery and an air freshener that tried too hard. They got in and the seats asked them to commit to the journey. The drive back was a ribbon of lights and the conversation of the radio in a language that had tried to be both Mandarin and English and had given up and become Singapore. His mother held the plastic bag like it had a passport in it. He texted ahead because mercy is a group project. He wrote to Aunty Mei and got a flurry of emojis that looked like a festival. He wrote to Maya I found my mother and got back in capital letters WHAT followed by a series of unhelpful exclamation points that made him laugh more than any well-turned compliment had in months.

They went up the twelve floors in a lift that had decided to behave for this one night. In the corridor, the plants watched like old ladies at bus stops. Liang opened the door and called, “Ah Ma,” in a tone that tried to be both son and messenger. His grandmother stood in the kitchen with a ladle as if it was a sceptre. When she saw the figure behind him she did not say a word for a full three seconds, and in that time a bird might have flown across the flat and nested in the curtain.

Then she said, with the proper economy of personhood, her daughter’s name, and then an insult, and then an endearment, and then, because red threads are also ropes that you use to pull things to shore, “Come in, lah. Don’t block the wind.”Chapter 8

In the morning the flat smelled like the inside of a bamboo steamer, warm and a little sweet, as if the air had been cooked overnight. The blue cup sat where it was supposed to sit, a small victory that none of them announced. Ah Ma moved around the kitchen with the suspicious energy of someone who had prepared a speech and realised the audience had brought their own. She clanged the ladle a little too loudly, wiped the countertop twice, held and released the kettle as if testing a pulse. His mother—Ai Ling, the name he tried on inside his mouth like a forgotten song—stood by the sink peeling a mango with the shy assurance of muscle memory. The skin came off in long golden scrolls, the knife barely whispering against fruit. She cut the cheeks into generous boats and arranged them on a chipped plate with the seriousness of an offering.

“Wash hands,” Ah Ma said to both of them, as if they were children who had returned from a playground that did not deserve their joy. She stared at the mango and then at her daughter and lifted her chin in an acknowledgment that managed to be a warning and a blessing. “Sweet or not?”

“Sweet,” Ai Ling replied, the word soft with apology. “From the Arab Street aunty. She gave me one extra because I told her my son sings very loud.”

“Too loud,” Ah Ma corrected immediately, but the corner of her mouth had given up and curved.

Liang washed his hands and the water woke his skin, small shocks that helped organise his thoughts. The kitchen had acquired a new gravity overnight. The red thread on Ah Ma’s wrist looked newly red, the aircon’s drip into the bucket made a rhythm that sounded suspiciously like patience. He carried bowls to the table like bribes to a generous god. When they sat, Ah Ma turned the ladle into the porridge with a precision she usually reserved for scissors. She served them in a hierarchy of love that nobody took personally: Liang first, because his appetite was a thing she had invested in; Ai Ling next, because forgiveness fed on ritual; herself last, because she believed in economies even when nobody asked her to.

They ate. The porridge was plain and perfect in the way of things that allowed other flavours to introduce themselves without jealousy. Mango came after, as if sweetness were a reward for honesty. Ah Ma ate two pieces and said, “Not bad,” as if she had bought the fruit and arranged the weather. Ai Ling ate slowly, a piece of fruit parked indecisively on her spoon, and looked at the window with the concentration of someone rehearsing saying sorry to glass.

“You work where now?” Ah Ma asked, the word where stretching to hold twenty years of mistakes.

“Hotel laundry,” Ai Ling said. She did not look down, which Liang respected. “They call it linen room. I fold until my fingers know the smell of every kind of towel. The rich ones also got smell—like they sleep inside flower shop. Boss good to me if I don’t disappear. Last time I disappear, that’s why they cut my days. I try not to disappear.”

“Disappear go where?” Ah Ma said with aggressive neutrality.

“I go to the river,” Ai Ling replied, the confession placed on the table between the mango skins and the spoon rest. “I like to sit there. The water moves even when I cannot. Sometimes I forget to go home. Later I go wrong bus. Or the right bus but wrong direction. Then my phone battery die.” She lifted her shoulders in a small apology that had practised all night. “I don’t say to make you cry. I say to not lie.”

Ah Ma did not cry. She narrowed her eyes at the river and gave it a silent warning too. “You bring your charger,” she said. “And you write your address behind your phone like primary school. Later the bus driver can read, not like you last time always never read the notice board, end up bring your own head go wrong way.”

Ai Ling smiled with her teeth. “Okay,” she said. “I will write big big until even the lion can see.”

Liang watched them settle into a language he had not known he was fluent in—scolding as love, humour as grammar, annotation as truce. He wanted to ask a hundred questions and knew he had the right to perhaps ask five; the other ninety-five would bloom when they wanted to. He asked one that could be answered without turning anyone into a rock. “You have your IC?” he said, practical as Mr. Chua pointing at a schedule.

“My IC… lost long time,” Ai Ling admitted, cheeks dimpling with embarrassment that belonged to a girl she had once been before she had become this fugitive woman who folded linen into obedience. “I have a work permit card from last time the factory boss sign me in. Then that one also expired. I use my baptism card to borrow book. The librarian very kind.” She laughed, but it sounded like a cough that had forgotten its joke. “Aiyoh, don’t tell police. They will say I am a ghost.”

“We go ICA,” Liang said, and it surprised him how easily the plan sat in his mouth. “We queue. We take number. We explain. Bring two photos.” He did not know if the bureaucracy would be kind, but he had learned that sometimes institutions were people trying to be better than their training, and that was worth giving them a chance.

Ah Ma nodded, the nod of a general granting permission to a reconnaissance mission. “We go after lunch,” she declared. “Now you eat first. Later the government make you wait, at least your stomach got friend.”

At ICA, the air was cold in a way that made you suspect the building had been built to show weather who was boss. The queue snaked in polite curls. A screen blinked numbers that sounded like code words. Babies cried with the entitlement of citizens who had never had to fill a form. They took a ticket and sat on plastic chairs that sighed under accumulated waiting. Ai Ling smoothed her skirt with the flat of her hand, then stopped and put both hands on her lap like a child who had been told to sit nicely in church. “Last time I bring my friend here to make her passport,” she whispered to Liang in the hush of bureaucracies. “She wear her best blouse because she say the photo will follow her everywhere. But the man at the counter say no white colour, the background also white. You will become floating head only.”

Liang smiled because he appreciated any story where the rules were ridiculous and therefore comforting. He filled in the form for her because handwriting had become a country she no longer held a passport to. Name: Lim Ai Ling. He wrote it carefully, letter by letter, and watched her watch her own name appear like a boat he was pulling in on a rope. Address: He wrote Ah Ma’s. Previous address: He left it blank at first and then, at her prompting, scribbled the last place she had slept that had had a letterbox. He reached the line that asked for Reasons for Replacement and hesitated. He could have written Lost. He could have written Stupid. He wrote Misplaced and then, because honesty deserved a witness, wrote in the small space: Left home, returned home.

The woman at the counter had eyes that had seen a thousand versions of this scene. She took the form and looked at Ai Ling in a way that implied a private inventory she would not mention. “You need two Singaporeans to vouch if cannot show old IC,” she said, not unkind. “Parent or child can. You… this your mother?” She pointed at Ah Ma who had insisted on coming despite her knee, and who now nodded with the solemnity she reserved for pronouncing judgments on television shows.

“Mother,” Liang said. “I am the son.”

“Okay,” the woman said, inputting their insistence into a system that would eventually translate it into a card. “Got old photo or not? The computer wants to see your face from last time. If not, I take new one also can but the computer sometimes stubborn.”

From her bag, Ai Ling produced a small laminated rectangle that had once been bright and now looked like it had survived somebody’s wallet flood. It was the baptism card she had mentioned, adorned with a tiny, hesitant passport photo where her hair made an argument with gravity and her eyes were the eyes of a person who had not learned yet what departure did to a face. The woman looked at it and then at Ai Ling and then at Liang and adjusted her scale of possibilities. “Okay,” she said. “No eyelashes too long, no smile too big, look straight. Take photo now.”

The photo booth swallowed Ai Ling like a neat mouth and spat out a strip of pictures where she appeared to be convincing herself she had a right to be recorded. They returned to the counter and waited while the woman typed. Liang watched the shape of his mother’s name on the screen, antiseptic and automatic, and felt unreasonably comforted by its presence in a database that would not judge it.

“Collect in three to five weeks,” the woman said, handing them a receipt like a promise folded in half. “If urgent, can write appeal. But sorry ah, the appeal just means you will get it in two.” Her smile was a private rebellion. “Meanwhile, take care. Don’t lose your mother again.”

After, in the hot white of the outside, they bought soy milk in plastic bags and sucked it through straws like children on reprieve. Ah Ma announced she was too old for the government, in the same tone she used for stairs, for durian seeds, for loud motorbikes. They went home by bus because buses showed you a city’s compromises better than trains. Ai Ling pressed her cheek to the window glass like a woman measuring fever. Her hand, resting on her lap, opened and closed with a slight rhythm as if learning to count again. Liang watched her profile and catalogued details that would prove useful later when the brain did its own misplacing: the cave of her ear, the small bump on her nose bridge, the way her eyelashes made shadows like eyelashes.

That night, after he had scrubbed the wok and put the rice cooker back in its place and moved the blue cup four centimetres to the left because the world felt as if it would forgive that, he went to the hostel and sat in the common room with Maya and Ravi, who had both come after their shifts, bodies softened by grease and laughter. He told them the ICA story. Ravi shook his head and bit into a curry puff with the appreciation of a man who had met worse lines than numbers. “Government is like kitchen,” he said. “Got system. If you play with the system, you get soup. If you don’t, you go hungry.”

Maya looked at him in that sideways way of hers that indicated a gift wrapped in rudeness. “You look tired,” she said. “But good tired. The kind where your face remember how to be your face.”

“I found her,” he said, because saying it aloud gave it weight in the room. “The mango bag… it was real.”

“You better write that into a song,” Maya said immediately. “If not, the universe will give that story to the next fella with a guitar and then you will be angry.”

He had, of course, already started. In his notebook, he had drawn a mango, then crossed it out because drawings never resembled the fruit itself, then written the word in Hokkien and Mandarin and English until all three languages agreed to share custody. He had a chorus that did a small thing with the vowel in go home and an image of a plastic bag handle cutting a soft line into skin that felt like a metaphor his mouth could be trusted with. He was afraid of writing his mother as a parable and decided to write her as a person buying fruit.

In the week that followed, stages appeared like coins at the bottom of fountains: small, accessible, reflecting light if you stood at the right angle. An indie filmmaker DMed him an invitation to sing three lines over slow-motion shots of cyclists under rain; a neighbourhood festival emailed to ask if he could headline a stage that was really a tarpaulin in a carpark with a borrowed PA and a budget that bought more bottled water than applause; a school wanted him to talk to the kids about art as if art had been a dog he had trained. He took the ones he could and said no to the ones that would require a miracle of logistics and lying. He learned to carry shoelaces in his bag because stages had a way of untying your life when you weren’t looking.

At Mr. Chua’s, he found that people he did not know had begun to come in and look at him like a dessert they had seen on Instagram. They ordered sambal stingray and then asked, with the clumsy bravery of strangers, “You are the singer?” He nodded and then immediately asked if they wanted rice because maintaining one’s usefulness was a shield. Mr. Chua pretended irritation and then casually tuned the radio to a channel that played live recordings between advertisements for insurance and fried chicken. He admitted, with a grunt that was primarily throat and only secondarily language, that his daughter had been practicing a ballet to Liang’s song in the living room, and that her plié had never been more determined.

“Come watch,” Mr. Chua said, offhand, leaving a cheque stub on his desk as bait. “Saturday. Community centre showcase. Not big stage. But they do their best. You can clap loudly.”

Liang went because a debt like that was the kind you wanted to incur. The community centre stage was exactly the correct size to hold elasticity and ambition. The girls in their leotards had hair buns with a ferocity that implied insurance. Mr. Chua’s daughter had a smile that was not for effect; it was a relay of light from a source she believed in. The music was a mash of Tchaikovsky and an EDM track that had been asked politely to be classical, and the choreography had the straightforward joy of children who had discovered that bodies could be instructed. He watched and clapped loudly. Mr. Chua’s sigh next to him was a deterrent to sentimentality that failed.

“See,” the older man murmured, eyes on the stage. “Not every stage need to be London.”

“Not any stage need to be London,” Liang said, and surprised himself by meaning it.

After, he walked home with a packet of economy bee hoon balanced on his palm like treasure. He cut through the carparks the way only someone who had grown up in a place knew how to. Under the block, a getai had set up—bright, brash, its microphone a god with an appetite. The singer on stage wore a dress that could be seen from Mars and a wig that could protect a small bird from rain. Her voice was astonishing and shameless. Aunties stood or sat and fanned themselves and occasionally shouted a request into the shared night. Liang stood at the back and allowed the sound to rinse the inside of his spine. He recognised the feeling: the community that appears without being summoned, the audience that knows its rights and the performer who knows she has to earn them.

He felt someone step next to him and did not need to look to know it was Ai Ling by the way her presence did not demand. She had the smell of hotel laundry on her, crisp and anonymous, and the ghost of mango around the edges of her breath. They watched together without talking. The singer modulated into a Teresa Teng with a bravura that made Liang think of the concourse and of the night the jets had lent their own chorus. Ai Ling sniffed once, dramatics not intended, and said, “Your grandmother used to bring me to watch getai behind. Those days the auntie wear shorter skirt. Now they are respectable.”

“Respectable costume hide the same heart,” Liang said, and she hummed low in her throat in agreement.

They walked up together, and the elevator doors opened to the smell of barley soup because Ah Ma had decided to cook comfort preemptively. The three of them sat and ate and watched the drama on Channel 8 where a man pretended to be less evil than the camera had already proved him to be. Between spoonfuls, Ai Ling talked in small pieces. What had happened, and then what had almost happened, and then what she had run from and how shame had enrolled itself in her bones as a tenant that refused to move out. There had been a man with kind hands and a wallet that lied, then a room she had shared with two other women and a calendar that did not forgive, then a job, then two, then none, then the thing where you look around and realise you have somehow convinced yourself that you will be punished for showing your face in the crowd that will love you when you do.

Ah Ma listened with her head resting on one hand like a radio host who had heard stories worse and wanted still to be a receiver. She did not say I told you so, though the sentence hovered like a fly. She did not say leave again and see what happens. She did not say why you like this. She said, “Tomorrow morning I show you how to fix the sewing machine. The pedal got stuck. You clean. You remember. Your hand will remember.”

They did. In the morning, the sewing machine came out from its corner where it had been sulking and practised its forgiveness on their feet. Ai Ling unscrewed a plate and soaked it in kerosene that Ah Ma produced from behind the plant like contraband. The smell took over the kitchen and reminded the walls who had lived here. They oiled hinges and ran the thread like a small person through a maze. Liang watched their hands conversing without noise—pinch, twist, press, release—until it seemed to him that this was the first duet he had ever witnessed, and it was not his.

He wrote a new song and called it Blue Cup. It had no chorus at first because cups did not need repeats to be useful, but then he found one that did not embarrass the cup and allowed ordinary objects their sanctity. He sang it at the carpark festival under the tarpaulin to an audience composed of four children, two men with beer, three women who were not there for him, and a dog with good taste. The dog wagged on the downbeat. The women looked up at Blue Cup and then away because it was rude to stare at other people’s rituals. Afterward one of the men came up and said, “You sing so quiet but my heart want to come nearer.” Liang thanked him for the physics lesson and the compliment.

By the time National Day had exhausted itself and fireworks residue hung around the city like confetti that refused to be unemployed, the Esplanade sent him a proper contract and a request for his bank details. He filled it out with the glee of a man writing his name on a new notebook. He received, by post, a voucher for meal coupons at the staff canteen, which tasted better than some applause. He took Ah Ma to eat there on a weekday when the place was half-empty, and she marvelled at the efficiency of trays, of forks wrapped in napkins, of drinks in cups with lids. “Like hospital, but got music,” she pronounced, approving, then insisted on buying a magnet at the gift shop in the shape of the durian spikes, which they stuck on the fridge next to the lion with the bad mane and the fake Statue of Liberty. The door now held a geography of both truth and pretence that felt accurate.

The invitation from television came in a font that tried too hard. A local variety hour wanted him for a segment called Our Talents! He was to sing one and a half songs live and one to be cut for online. He was to be interviewed by a host whose smile had seen more cameras than childhood. He was to be paid a fee that was decent for how short television made your real life. He sat with the email as if it were a well-meaning uncle who had once borrowed money and now wanted to add you on Facebook. He wanted to accept; he wanted to beware. He asked Maya and Ravi, who told him, in unison, “Do lah,” and then in unison again, “But don’t let them change your words.” He asked Mr. Chua, who said, “You can show the restaurant name behind,” and then frowned as if he had made a tasteless joke. He asked Ai Ling, who said simply, “Later I watch on my neighbour’s TV because her one got more channels.” He accepted and added, in reply, that he would not sing about the government or vulgarities, but his grandmother was not negotiable.

He went on the show. The studio felt like a dental clinic that had fallen in love with theatre: bright, clean, over-insistent. The host’s smile did its job and then did not stop. The makeup artist put powder on his face until it felt like another person had rented his skin. He sang Old Library and the monitor returned his voice to him cruelly but honestly. In the interview, the host asked him, “So what is Britain to you?” with a glint, and he said, “A place where I learned I could stay,” and the audience made the complicated noise of people approving without fully understanding what they had approved of. He said Red Thread was for women who taught him that love is a job. He mentioned Mr. Chua’s sambal stingray and saw, in the corner of his eye, the producer make a small annoyed note, as if menus did not belong in art.

They aired it on a Wednesday night when laundries hummed and children stalled bedtime. The show cut off a verse he liked and kept a joke he thought was lazy, but it let his grandmother’s face into a million living rooms for three seconds when the camera panned the audience and she clapped with both hands, a bear and an auntie at once. In the morning, a woman stopped him by the escalator in the mall and said, “My mother cried, thank you,” and then bought him a kopi and did not try to sit with him, which he appreciated. The +44 number, or a cousin of it, tried to message again with a new offer for a Southeast Asia showcase and he blocked it with the briskness of a man who had developed a technique.

He received, unexpectedly and instantly, a WhatsApp from a festival organiser in Penang who had seen the clip on somebody’s cousin’s feed. The message was plain, kind, free of exclamation marks. Would he like to sing by the sea in September, a small stage under a row of angsana trees, two nights, board provided, ferrying negotiable. He did not know then why the phrase under the trees opened a window in his chest and let in wind that smelled like bikes and fish. He asked Mr. Chua for the leave and Mr. Chua stared at the rota as if it were an ancient text that required respectful translation, then nodded and said, “Bring back biscuits,” which was approval disguised as carbohydrates.

He wanted to bring both women. He imagined them on a bus together, the two faces that had made his own, framed by the low drama of Malaysian scenery. He imagined the hotel room, the three of them arguing over aircon temperature and who got the extra pillow. He imagined the stage in Penang, the sea making its own percussion, his mother in the second row learning to keep her hands still because clapping is a muscle you have to retrain. He announced the plan at dinner and Ah Ma nodded briskly because she had already packed a small bag in her mind. Ai Ling hesitated, the old fear flexing in her throat. “Passport,” she said, a small word that had grown horns over the years.

“We can do temporary pass,” Liang said, perhaps overconfident. “We can go to ICA again. We can—” He stopped because plans were sometimes insults to luck.

They went. The ICA this time had air as cold as less than yesterday. The number they drew was a little kinder. The same woman sat at the same counter with the same rim of tiredness that no powder could hide, and when she saw them she allowed herself the tiniest smile that did none of the work of friendship and all of the work of a good afternoon. “Ah,” she said, eyes flicking to the receipt in their file that proved they had returned victorious for the IC. “Got your card ready. Lucky you came. The mail sometimes take scenic route.”

The temporary passport, it turned out, required a more complicated dance, but dance they did. Forms, the same careful new picture, the question—they had prepared this time for—of reasons for urgency. He wrote: Family trip. He closed the line with a period because he liked the idea that punctuation might be a spell. The woman read it and did not smile or frown. She typed and printed and made a frown at the printer that had nothing to do with them. “Come back three days,” she said. “Don’t forget to breathe.”

On the way home, they stopped at the temple with the dragon because Ai Ling wanted to apologise to a stone animal for using its name in vain so often. Ah Ma bought joss sticks and handed them out like permit slips. Liang stood with both of them in front of a lion whose face said bureaucrat. He tried to pray and realised he did not know the words and did not have to. He thought thank you in all the languages he had found, and he thought sorry in one he had not learned, and he thought please with a serious head.

They went for char kway teow that sweated on the plate. Ai Ling took the first bite and closed her eyes as if she had been welcomed into a club. “Penang got their own,” she said, mouth full, bossy even now. “But our one got more cockles. You don’t go there and come back and talk big.”

“I will go and come back and talk small,” he promised, and she approved as if humility were a passport the world stamped without reading.

He practised for the Penang trees. He folded the boat song into something that could stand without shivering, added a new verse about the ferry that would carry a trio who had not sat on a ferry together since before handphones and aircon buckets. He wrote a small poem for the blue cup and then turned it into a chorus because poems that stayed poems in his life had a tendency to turn sullen. He packed early—shirts, throat lozenges, the red thread spares, the power bank, the packet of salt Ravi had insisted on, a thin towel his mother had folded in a way that made it smaller than physics—because packing was blessed.

The night before they were to go, he went down to the void deck to smoke a cigarette he would not light and was intercepted by Mrs. Tan, who had graduated to a blouse with a cat in a sailor hat. “You go where this time?” she asked, as if she were a border guard and he a smuggler of small joys.

“Penang,” he said. “Bring the aunties for holiday.”

“Good,” she said decisively. “Later I help to water the plant outside. Your ah ma earlier tell the plant don’t die until we come back. Very fierce. The plant sure scared.”

He thanked her because words were a currency he could afford. He looked up at the block where his flat’s lights made a square. He could see the bucket through the grill, a dark circle under duty. He went upstairs and into the kitchen and found Ai Ling polishing a spoon as if it had wronged her and Ah Ma counting biscuits into a tin as if numbers could protect hunger. He stood in the doorway and felt the stage he would carry with him, a taped X inside his chest where the red thread knotted. He lifted his hand. “Ready?” he asked, and the two women looked up, their faces doing a shared thing he had not seen in a long time, an expression that contained all the ways you left and all the ways you came home, and they said, with the sovereignty of people who had survived their own scripts, “Ready lah.”Chapter 10

They left before the sun had made up its mind, the sky a pale bruise that promised either rain or ceremony. The coach bay behind the mall yawned like a sleepy mouth. Buses idled with the resigned patience of creatures that knew their lives were measured in miles and air freshener. Liang carried a backpack that felt both lighter and heavier than necessary, its weight shifting with every step the way fear pretends to be practicality. Ah Ma came in her best walking shoes, the ones she had declared “airport shoes” even though they had only ever been to Changi to send other people away. Ai Ling held a small tote with a mango embroidered on it that made the fabric look like it had developed an ambition overnight. They had eaten buns in the kitchen standing up, mugs of kopi whitening on the table like storms deciding to be gentle. At the bus door, the driver looked at their tickets, looked at their faces, and waved them on with the authority of a man who had seen a thousand itineraries and believed none of them.

The seats were upholstered in a fabric that tried to hide its history and failed. They sat in a row because there had been a small internal war about whether to split for comfort and the peace treaty had decided on proximity. The bus slid out into the thin morning and the city revealed its hard-working arteries. At Tuas, the checkpoint lines braided and unbraided, passport booklets opening like small red mouths. Ai Ling clutched her temporary document with a reverence that made Liang want to both laugh and cry. When it was her turn, the officer glanced at the paper, at her face, at the computer that pretended to know her, and waved them through with a stamp that sounded like an end to a sentence. Ah Ma declared the stamp noise satisfying and asked, in a stage whisper that could have carried to Johor, if the officer might not consider stamping her knee with the same efficiency.

On the other side, Malaysia opened with its familiar recipe of palm trees, billboards, and the kind of bright that made your eyelids complain. The bus shrugged onto the highway and found its long-distance rhythm. At Yong Peng, they stopped for the ritual of noodles and the exercise of judging the toilets. Ah Ma bought a packet of tapioca chips with chilli flakes and declared them traitors after the first bite, then ate half the packet anyway because treachery is often delicious. Ai Ling wandered to a stall selling cheap magnets and returned with one shaped like a durian that looked less murderous than its Singapore cousins. “For your fridge,” she said, as if magnets were ova you needed to harvest.

They continued north as the landscape shifted in moderations rather than dramas. Rubber estates gave way to towns where the signage alternated between memory and aspiration. Liang watched the names slide by—Batu Pahat, Muar, Malacca—as if they were verses in a song he did not know but could hum the chorus to. He wrote in his notebook in a hand steadier than he felt, sketching a new arrangement for Vortex that might let the sea sing without swallowing him. He looked at his mother sometimes to confirm her existence and found her alternately asleep and vigilant, reflexes he recognised as his own. Ah Ma told a story about a factory bus that used to break down just before the bridge and how they would sit on the verge and knit insults about the driver into scarves. She imitated the driver’s cough with such precision that the man in the next row turned to check if he should offer lozenges.

They rolled into Penang in the late afternoon when heat acquires its right to theatrics. The bridge was an essay on ambition in white, drawn across water that pretended to be calm for the sake of cars. As they crossed, the island arranged itself like an old face composed for a photograph—George Town shingles, butter-coloured shophouses, the occasional modern affront that looked as if dropped by a giant with poor aim. The bus deposited them near Komtar with the dignity of a mission accomplished. The festival volunteer who had texted Liang a week ago—Siew Ling, straight-haired, quick-smiled—found them with the efficiency of a woman who had been given a lanyard and taken it personally. She shepherded them into a van that smelled like citrus and minor panic. As they drove toward the sea, she sketched their schedule in bullet points that understood holidays: check in, light dinner, sound check at dusk, set at eight, sleep like people who have earned it.

The guesthouse was a restored shophouse with tiles that had been saved and colours that had been negotiated with fashion and memory. The owner spoke English the way you speak to relatives who might misunderstand you on purpose, and offered them lime water that tasted like a sermon on humility. Their room had three beds that looked surprised to find themselves in the same space. Ah Ma claimed the one nearest the window with the strategic speed of an army, Ai Ling took the one in the middle like a compromise, and Liang set his bag down on the last, then stood at the threshold and took a breath that made the walls approve.

They walked to the festival grounds along a promenade that had seen more sunsets than resolutions. The angsana trees were exactly as promised—wide-armed and unembarrassed, their leaves forming a canopy that made light into polite dapple. The stage had been coaxed out of a platform and some good ideas. The sea breathed beyond the railings like a large animal that had learned manners. Food stalls were setting up, releasing the first hopeful scents of char koay teow and satay and the sweet humble confidence of cendol. Siew Ling took them to the back where a tent pretended to be a green room. Musicians had begun to accumulate—the KL guitarist with sticker narratives on his case, a drummer from Ipoh who tapped everything as if auditioning it, a poet who wrote on receipt paper because she liked to make her stanzas fiscally accountable.

The sound man was a wiry gentleman with a cap that had made some mistakes. He introduced himself as Pak Din and treated the microphones like children you had to introduce politely to each other. He checked Liang’s levels with the indifference of a man who had saved many evenings from their own hubris. “You got wind,” he said, jerking his chin toward the sea. “Sometimes the angin want to be the lead singer. You must be patient but not polite.” He slid a foam windscreen over the mic as if he were giving it a hat, and Liang, who had grown to love competent people like an adopted religion, nodded and let himself be arranged.

They ate a fast dinner from plates that sweated with gravy. Penang char koay teow spoke in a dialect of smoke that made Liang briefly disloyal to his island. Ah Ma dabbed at her lips with a tissue and announced she could taste yesterday’s prawns in today’s wok, and that this was good. Ai Ling closed her eyes over a spoon of asam laksa and declared the broth honest. They shared one bowl of cendol because three spoons in one dessert had defined their family’s economy since before Liang could reach the top of the table. Then the lights warmed and the tent filled with the metallic whisper of tuning, and Liang felt the small creature in his chest wake and stretch, not predator, not prey, just alive.

Dusk arrived like a good stagehand, shifting the scene without demanding applause. The first act was a trio with a ukulele and a defiant harmonica; they sang a Malay love song about a cat that had better lyrics than some human ones and made the kids in front hoot with an ownership that was not cruel. When it was his turn, Liang walked to the taped X that had been stuck on planks that had known other feet, set his breath where he could reach it, and looked past the first row to the horizon. He opened his mouth and let the oar sound come first, an invitation to the sea to either show off or sit down. The mic took his voice, the wind tried to flirt, and he did as Pak Din had advised, patient but not polite.

Old Library landed as if it had been here before, and perhaps it had—in the way rooms share an architecture even when built by enemies. He added a bar of silence where he usually filled, and the crowd let it be silent without filling it with coughs or phones because people near water remember they are not the loudest thing. He leaned into Hokkien at Jit lang jit sim and heard an old man somewhere to his left provide harmony under his breath, the kind that tells you he has been doing this longer than you have been alive. Vortex sang itself, the line about learning to stay at home making itself important in the presence of waves, which have never respected metaphors. He let the beatbox be lighter than usual, tin-roof rain instead of thunder, because the sky did its own percussion in the distance.

He introduced Blue Cup and a woman in the third row with a shirt printed with chillies made a small sound you only make when a stranger mentions your kitchen in public. He sang it slow, letting each domestic object show its ID card before admitting it into the verse. He closed his eyes for a line because he had to look at what he was calling, and when he opened them he found that the people in the front had leaned into each other without instruction, strangers making room for load-bearing images. He closed the set with a verse of Getai Teresa Teng because to refuse that would have been arrogant. The aunties sang, the young pretended not to and did anyway, and Liang thought, as he caught their sound and stitched it into his, that this was the job, not drowning and not baptising, just letting people hear themselves taller.

After, he came off into the blur of small praise and administrative necessity. Siew Ling extended a bottle of water as if it were applause you could drink. Pak Din nodded in a way that meant he had not had to fight the faders, which was worth two compliments. A man with a forearm full of old tattoos queued patiently to say, in Hokkien and then Malay, that sometimes the heart wants to shift chairs and his had done so. A girl with shoelaces dragging asked what the beat with the tongue was called and Liang told her it was called practise and she withdrew satisfied as if she had been handed a weapon. He scanned the crowd for Ai Ling and Ah Ma and found them under a tree with two paper fans working like small wings. Ai Ling’s eyes were bright and wet in a way that television had not yet cheapened. Ah Ma was scowling at a mosquito like it had personally insulted the performance.

They walked back along the promenade because even tired people deserve a sea. The night was one of those good ones where the wind had receipts. Streetlamps made triangles on the ground for children to step through as if skipping a game they had invented. Ai Ling didn’t say much, which was her new language for I am carrying something that deserves quiet. Ah Ma talked about the laksa with the commitment of a political speech. Liang’s limbs felt like instruments he had put away properly instead of flinging into a case. At the guesthouse, they sat on the edge of their beds and ate a packet of peanut biscuits that someone had pressed into Ah Ma’s hand backstage. “Tomorrow we go find your mother’s friend,” Ah Ma announced to the air, and the air agreed.

The friend lived in Prai, on the mainland, in a block that was so new it had not learned its neighbours’ names. Her name was Mei Chen and she had once been better at the old Singer machine than grief, which is saying something. They crossed the bridge in a bus with curtains that made the windows look like tired eyes. The lift smelled like lemon and the residue of floors. Mei Chen opened the door with the suspicion of a woman who has learned that not all knocking is a promise, then softened as if informed by a private committee. She and Ai Ling stood and did the stare that contains the minutes of all the meetings they had missed. Then they made noises at each other that were not words and not silence, and then they hugged, which is the only task certain days give you.

The flat was bright and undecorated in the way of new rooms that have not accumulated regret. The sewing machine sat folded as if pretending to be furniture and failing. They touched it. They talked about someone called Ah Boy who had been kind until the day he wasn’t, and about an evening when the girl at the gate cried, and about the supervisor who had smuggled packets of rice into their lunchboxes like a small rebellion. Mei Chen had a daughter who brought them tea and looked at Liang with the appreciating scepticism of a twenty-year-old. Liang sang Blue Cup in the kitchen because the tile asked him to, quiet enough to be polite to the neighbours, loud enough to make the spoon in the sugar jar sound like an instrument. The daughter leaned against the doorframe, thumb scrolling, head still. Halfway through, Mei Chen cried in the precise way certain women do: without snot, as if tears were an organised protest.

They stayed for too long and then just long enough. When they left, Mei Chen gave Ai Ling a spool of thread in a plastic bag without ceremony. “From the old days,” she said. “Don’t waste. Still good.” Ai Ling held it the way you hold a photograph of yourself at sixteen, careful and unconvinced. On the bus back, the air-con tried to kill them and failed. Liang watched his mother turn the spool in her hands as if it were a compass and thought about all the magnets on their fridge arguing, lying, telling the truth, and keeping the door closed.

The second night of the festival came with rain that auditioned for bigger work. The angsana leaves turned their shiny faces to the water as if saying, we’ve done this before, and the crowd rearranged itself into a generous geometry of umbrellas and resigned shoulders. Pak Din and his team put condoms on microphones with the professionalism of medics. Siew Ling produced tarps from a bag that violated physics. Liang stood under the tent line and watched puddles form their own small administration. He decided to lean into it. When he went on, he made his beat small and exact—more drip than drum—and the rain, which had intended to be rude, paused to listen to itself being flattered.

He sang Vortex with a ferocity that was not anger. It fit. People tightened their arms around themselves in ways that had nothing to do with cold and everything to do with being accounted for. On the last chorus, he let the oar sound swell and the wind behaved, then misbehaved, then laughed at itself by frying the edge of a guitar in the next act. He ended with a verse in Malay he had written on the ferry of thought between sets, rough but true, about water that leaves and water that returns, about a stage under trees where your voice could be both floor and roof. A Makcik in a purple tudung said Allah after, which he accepted with the solemn glee of a thief forgiven before the crime.

Back at the guesthouse, the three of them lay in their respective rectangles with the rain limning the windows and making the world sound like rice being washed. They did not talk, which was a conversation. Liang pulled his phone from under the pillow and opened the memo app because cadence had arrived at his door wearing its favourite shoes. He titled the file Angsana and sang into it the shape of the two nights—foam on mic, hands clapping damply, Pak Din nodding, the girl with dragging shoelaces beating in time with her heel, Ah Ma’s fan counting, Ai Ling’s eyes finding and losing and finding him again. He wrote a bridge about a spool of thread crossing a bridge in a pocket, and he watched the words become a small raft.

On the morning they were to leave, they did the thing people do in old cities—they looked for murals like pilgrims searching for the saints of the present. They found the boy on the bicycle and Liang took a picture of Ai Ling pretending to sit on the backseat, her smile obedient and then subversive. They ate nasi lemak that dared them to have opinions about rice texture. They bought tambun biscuits from a shop whose air smelled like family secrets. They walked past clan jetties where timber remembered every ankle and aunties hung laundry in a choreography of dignity. Ah Ma stopped before a shrine and scolded the offerings for mismatched fruit. Ai Ling bought a packet of dried nutmeg slices and made a face after the first taste that told them originality is not always friendly.

The bus back was a slower animal. People slept the sleep of victors and the exhausted. At a stop somewhere that could have been anywhere, Ai Ling leaned her head on Ah Ma’s shoulder, a gesture that did not ask permission from the decades. Liang watched them and did the grown-up thing of pretending to look out the window while filing the image somewhere the brain promised not to misplace. His phone buzzed once with an email that made his mouth go dry—an invitation from a festival in Manila for October, small stage, bigger chaos, could he bring the old songs and the new. He typed a reply that was a question and a yes and a request for a place to buy thread. He put the phone down. He slept, finally, in the way that the body does when it believes the door will be locked properly.

They arrived at dusk. Singapore received them with the particular courtesy of a city that thinks it is doing you a favour by letting you in. They rolled their bags home and the estate smelled like fried shallots and detergent. Mrs. Tan yelled hey from a bench and held up a watering can like a medal. Upstairs, the blue cup was exactly where it was meant to be, which felt a little like a story sorted. They unpacked the biscuits, the magnet that immediately took up residence next to the lion and the durian spikes and the false torch of Liberty, and the spool of thread that Ai Ling placed on the shelf next to the rice scoop like an heirloom that had been repaired.

After the shower and the soup and the catching-up that consisted primarily of pointing at objects (“this one, from there, so expensive”), Liang went to the hostel because he had promised himself the plant would get the first draft. He sat in the common room and recorded Angsana proper, the rain beat without rain, the sea described without collapsing into postcard. He titled it with the name of the tree because for once the metaphor had introduced itself politely and he had merely agreed. He wrote an email to Siew Ling with thanks that did not overwork themselves. He texted Pak Din a sound emoji because words would have been rude. He messaged the Penang organiser a picture of their magnet line-up and they replied with a photo of the angsana at midday, shadow like a benediction.

At the restaurant the next day, Mr. Chua pretended indifference for exactly four minutes and then demanded a blow-by-blow, which Liang provided with the appropriate sauce. Maya took the tambun biscuit from his hand like a prize and declared it too sweet and then ate another four because hypocrisy is a vitamin. Ravi listened with the professional attention he reserved for good gossip and dangerous recipes. In the lull between lunch and the small disasters of dinner, Liang opened his notebook and wrote down the itinerary not as a list but as proof, the coach, the checkpoint, Mei Chen’s tea, the sea making space, the rain testing faith. He drew a small bus and a bigger tree and then frowned at the drawing because art had to negotiate with talent. He wrote instead: Blue cup, red thread, angsana, bridge. He wrote: We went and we came back.

That night, Ai Ling stood with him at the corridor railing and watched a storm deciding what kind of city it wanted to decorate. “I was afraid,” she said, as if telling him a recipe secret. “On the bus. Like last time I go and then cannot return. But you and Ma,” she continued, the word Ma now a thing she let herself hold, “you made the road come back. You sing and the road come back. That’s your skill.”

He considered humility and rejected it politely. “You bring mango,” he said. “That is your skill. And you show up.”

She laughed quietly and leaned on the rail with the relaxation of a person who has been informed that the building has passed inspection. Inside, Ah Ma adjusted the magnets on the fridge as if arranging international relations. The blue cup sat obedient and agenda-less. The aircon dripped its pocket rain into the bucket, a beat that might yet become a song. The world, in that small perimeter, behaved. The bigger world would, inevitably, make plans. For the moment, Liang decided to be ambitious and go to bed, because the next stage would arrive as stages do, when someone tapes an X on a floor you thought was only for walking. He slept with his mouth open like a person who had earned it, and somewhere in his chest a little theatre folded its chairs and swept the floor and turned off the lights, confident that the doors would open again tomorrow at four.
