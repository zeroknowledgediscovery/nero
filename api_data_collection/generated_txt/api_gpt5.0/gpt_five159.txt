Fog lay over Markham like a handkerchief left to dry, thin and damp and a little ashamed of itself. The iron ribs of the old viaduct hunched above the river, brick abutments slow with moss. Before dawn the town belonged to those who could use it without being seen: delivery drivers, runners pacing their breath to the rhythm of their earbuds, foxes with tails like question marks, a certain door that never closed quite right on a bakery’s rear yard. And a pair of eyes that watched from underneath the second arch where the mortar had blown and nobody bothered to report it.

They were not human eyes, though they had learned how to imitate a human slow blink. They were a little too black, a little too reflective, as if made of polished coal, as if they were thinking of you and also of hunger. She had names before, in other towns with different bridges. She had been called a rat-witch in the place with the mills and a picker in the city with the rolling downs. But here, in Markham, where the viaduct’s arches could hide a person who did not want to be fully a person, she had decided on Karen as a courtesy to herself, like choosing a good coat. Karen was a word that people on the internet threw around with laughter and stress in equal measure, a sign of a certain kind of entitlement and endless return-to-manager. She liked how it tasted, all the annoyed breath in it. She was a goblin and she knew it the way a cat knows it is a cat: without shame, without wanting to be anything else. She was fuelled by the fumes that drifted up from the town—its whispering, its surprises, all the ways people defined themselves by who they didn’t want to sit next to on the bus. What burned brightest, what warmed her bones, was the low blue flame of prejudice. She inhaled it the way some plants drink night air, and it made her stronger at the edges.

She watched the young men.

They were everywhere just before light came up. They ran, they skated, they shouldered gym bags, they leaned their backs into their hats and laughed at nothing, they clattered outside kebab shops that had never seen dawn before this fashion in exercise. They wore hair like declarations: high fades and curls like signatures, ragged quiffs that pretended not to have been carefully coaxed, long strands in man-buns that made Karen flutter with a secret memory of monks she had pranked in the twelfth century. Hair that announced them as themselves. Hair is a fence, she thought whenever she saw a handsome boy’s hand go up to check the line above his ear. Hair says, not you; hair says, I am me and not you; hair says, here is the boundary.

Boundaries were the only things she respected, and therefore the only things she wanted to measure and smooth. It wasn’t only the hair. It was the little fences people put up in their minds. The way the baker said good morning with a different kind of good to the lad with an accent, the way a shopkeeper’s smile went brittle when two boys who walked hand in hand paused to look at shoes, the way the man in the van muttered about them coming over here even when nobody had come anywhere except down the road to the corner shop. The radio in the arches played talk shows at night. Karen had learned to feed off them. Callers with grievances were her kind of harvest.

She had a kit. In a cracked leather satchel she kept a pair of clippers, cordless, yellow insulation tape holding a loose panel, a sharpening stone wrapped in a tea towel, a small bottle of oil for the blades, a comb, black like a rib. She kept scissors long enough to reach into a fear. The satchel had been stolen, then found again and stolen back so long ago it no longer remembered any other owner. She had acquired the clippers last winter from a barber who’d drunk too much and fallen asleep in his chair with the mirror witness to his own mouth sagging. She had paid for them with a trick and three little coins she had made out of nothing but anger. The anger wasn’t hers. She was a conduit.

It began the way all things begin that people later call a spree: with one night where the fog and the river and a young man’s dreams aligned. He was called Ewan, or rather he was called that by his mother and friends; Karen preferred to name people by their habits, and Ewan’s habit was to chew on the inside of his lip until he could feel the tiny ridge with his tongue. He lived in a rented flat above a Chinese restaurant whose extractor fan sang sleep into the bones of the sofa. He had run late, posted a sweaty selfie with the words get it, pasted a fire emoji next to the name of the gym. He had been out for two pints. He’d locked the door. He’d fallen asleep face down with music still humming in his ears, a line about keeping his head up murmuring to the pillow.

Karen let herself in with nothing but patience. The lock was not difficult if you had the trick for such locks; all towns had at least three front doors that shared the same cheap heart. The extractor fan meant nobody outside would hear the clipper’s purr. The sleeping boy’s mouth was a little open, the ridge on his lip begging for his tongue. She was gentle. She always was at first. She ran the comb once through his hair, feeling the shiver along her wrist, then lifted the clippers and drew their mouth along the back of his head with a lover’s care. Hair came away in warm clouds. He sighed a little. She could feel the shape of his skull, the way he had grown inside his mother’s patience and his father’s absence, the way he had been comforted by the hairdresser’s hands last week, the way he would not be, for a while now. The sound was bees in a jar. A lane opened, a precise bare path of skin. She traced it with one finger before she did anything else, because she loved the moment of revelation. Not pain, not even surprise, not yet. Just difference. A boundary moved.

He woke at the second pass, his hand flying up, and the great quivering everything of a body that thinks it is safe and then finds out that it is not ran through his muscles. He rolled and the clippers hopped and Karen’s hand went flat on his chest with a pressure like a command. “Shh,” she said, because she wasn’t cruel. She was exact. “Don’t make it worse.”

“Who are you—” he said, very softly. The clipper’s buzz filled the room like bad weather. He saw not a face. He saw the reflective blank of a cheap plastic mask that might once have been held onto a schoolchild with an elastic string. It was white, too white. He saw hands. He saw, just at the edge of it, gleaming in black eyes where pupils should have had shadings, the satisfaction of a craftswoman.

He didn’t laugh then, and he would later tell the police he didn’t scream either. His voice stayed in the room with him, trembling. He stopped moving because her hand had told him to. When she had done what she had come to do, when the line she drew was clean and the second line answered it, when the barber of the arches had given him a new boundary, clean and terrible, she took the tufts of hair and wrapped them in the tea towel. She held his gaze for a heartbeat.

“You’re not who they tell you you are,” she said. “You’re where I cut.”

She left him staring. That was the first.

By morning, Markham had a story. Word like smoke, word like a burble over coffee. It reached the desk of a woman who had always hated to be the last to know.

Someone had called her Detective Inspector Reinert, though on the way back to Markham on the train that first morning there had been a text from her aunt asking if it was true that she’d given up being a proper lawyer. Reinert had laughed and not replied for twenty minutes. Her name was Mara; she was thirty-six and had a face that looked like the sort of courtroom where the windows had been painted shut a long time ago. She had been a solicitor, yes, and a good one, and if they called her DI now it was because she had decided that it was not enough to write the letters that moved people around the board. She wanted to step onto it. The lattice of the law had held for a long time, but she had noticed too many threads fraying in the same places: at the edges where people said those people and mean the ones they had decided were less than they were. She had seen a mother not get her son’s assault taken seriously because the boy who had done it had the right accent. She had seen a judge phrase a remark that wasn’t an insult and wasn’t not one. She had watched a woman of dignity shredded politely by a man in a wig. She had sat in court and felt complicit. Then she had signed forms. She had passed exams. She had changed her shoes for different shoes and told her uncle, who ran the paper shop, that she still loved paper.

She got back to Markham with a leather briefcase that was not brief, a hash of keys whose notches she ran with her thumb when she was thinking, and a determination not to tell restaurant staff that she had once represented an estate agent who had ended up selling their premises out from under them. She had a room at The Swan for the first week while she looked at rentals, the kind of room that had a faint picture of a swimming bird on the bedding and a kettle that clicked like a nervous habit. She liked The Swan’s bar because nobody looked too long at anything that reminded them of anything else; it was a pub built for pretending things were normal. The barmaid’s name was Adela, though on her name badge somebody had spelt it Adella and she had never had the heart to correct it. The landlord was one of the town’s designated friendly men, and he would happily tell you where to get a decent curry that didn’t burn your mouth off if he had also noticed you weren’t from round here. If you were from round here he would tell you the same curry was an insult to proper food, but that was just his way.

“You Mara?” said the landlord, polishing a glass that never got any shinier.

“Yes,” she said.

“You solicitor Reinert?”

“Not anymore.”

“My sister says you scared somebody with your eyes once, in a hearing. Told him without saying that he was finished.”

“My eyes aren’t that interesting,” she said, and smiled. He looked relieved; he had been worried she might be difficult.

Her sergeant was already at the station when she got there. He was called Callum Bride, which sounded like two different people and often was. He had a face that liked to make faces at itself, as if he couldn’t quite believe he had been issued with such a nose. He was younger than her by six years and wanted to agree with everyone in the room until the last possible moment, whereupon he would deliver one firm sentence and surprise them. He stood up when she came in and then sat down again quickly when he saw from her shoelaces that she did not think chairs were for trembling.

“Welcome back,” he said. “I’ve got the weirdest one on top.”

“Let me have it.”

“A series, maybe.” He flipped open a file because he was the kind of man who thought a little theatre never hurt anything that had already been hurt. “Break-ins, no property taken except… hair.” He looked up. “And it’s been going on a while. Barber shops report missing bags from their bins—clippings. Young men report waking up with, and I quote, ‘disrespectful haircuts’—”

“What does respectful look like?”

“Above the ear, neat as a school photograph?”

“God,” she said, a prayer and a joke. “Any injuries?”

“Surface. No blood. Nobody’s been knocked out; it’s like they get told to let it happen.”

“Women?”

“None reported. All men between eighteen and twenty-five. Some boys older, one or two twenty-seven if you trust the club door staff. Mixed backgrounds. Uni students. Electrician. DJ. Somebody who works at the garden centre. Picks out his own roses.”

“Time range?”

“Nights when fog lies,” he said, and she could tell that was something he’d picked up from the old man in the sandwich shop and pretended he hadn’t. “Late. Between one and four. Always a way out. Windows that stick. Cheap locks. No CCTV, or if there is, a blur that makes me think we should stop funding cameras and buy everyone better lightbulbs.”

She took the file. She read the statements. Ewan’s mother had phoned because he wouldn’t. A lad called Raf had called because he had not woken until morning and had found the bald path on his skull and had been sick quietly into the sink. A barber named Luca had reported a break-in that he’d thought was kids messing about until he found the thing left in the middle of the shop floor: a plait. Hair woven tight, tied with grit instead of ribbon. If you touched it your finger came away with a whisper on it. He had not told the police what he’d thought the whisper said. He had told the priest.

“Is this a fetish thing?” Callum said, too loud and then moderate again. “If so, do I even want to Google it.”

“Let’s not put that in a search bar,” Mara said. “If it is, it stays an assault no matter the flavouring. If it’s not, then it’s something else, and something else is often worse. Visits?”

“I went to the flats above Golden Dragon. Ewan was washing his pillowcases. He said he felt stupid and also that he felt he had done something wrong and didn’t know what. His girlfriend told him he had to see us because if he didn’t it was like admitting he wasn’t brave.”

“He should be allowed to be afraid,” Mara said. “We’re going to need to make that point organise itself. We need to talk to a barber. People trust them. We’ll ask for rumours.”

“We’ve also got this,” Callum said, pulling an evidence bag up like a conjuror finding a rabbit. Inside was a letter, cheap paper, stark sentences cut out of a newspaper and glued. It said: I AM TAKING WHAT YOU THINK IS YOU BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS. It was in that anonymous collaged voice that kids think is how you hide, and sometimes it is. The envelope had been posted in town and had a fingerprint on it that belonged to nobody in their database. It had been sent to the office of the local MP.

“Is the Member of Parliament the kind of man you’d like to have to tea?” Mara said. She already knew the answer, but she wanted to hear Callum say it because she liked to hear him balance his instinct to be pleased with people against his practice of being a policeman.

“He’s the kind of man who says, ‘I’ve got nothing against—’ followed by a category that requires neither his approval nor his permission,” Callum said after a brief fight with himself. “He’s also the kind of man who thinks hair on men means something other than hair.”

“And he posted this on his social about how free speech is under threat and then called us to demand visible action?”

“Look at you, you’re psychic as well as terrifying.”

“I’m not terrifying,” she said. “Get me Luca. And get me someone who does not think this is a prank. If I hear the word prank I will—” She didn’t finish, because somebody knocked and went away again too fast to be polite.

Luca the barber was gorgeous in that way that men who handle other men’s faces sometimes are: careful, precise, aware that eyes live in the same house as mouths. He had been in town two years and had acquired regulars by pretending to care about football teams he didn’t care about and then actually caring about the shape of their foreheads. He had been furious about the break-in and more furious about the plait. He told them in a voice that wanted to be steady that it felt like an insult that was bigger than hair.

“I cut hair,” he said. “It’s consent. They sit. They say, make me handsome and like me. I try. I’m not a—” He stopped. “Anyway. I keep my clippers in a box inside a box. I oil my blades. My floor is my floor. Someone came in and chewed. They ate my bin. They made that thing in the middle like a slug. We’re supposed to pretend it’s a joke? I know jokes. This is not one.”

“Did you hear anything from your clients?” Mara asked.

“Only whispers. They don’t want to be seen asking. They don’t want to be seen as vain or delicate, you know how you English are. Oh, sorry. Is that rude?”

“It’s true,” Callum said, and Mara smiled at him because he sometimes did the work of the town for her. “Men here think shampoo is a betrayal of some long-dead war.”

“This person,” Luca said, tapping the bag with the letter in it, “they want to tell people who they are. People who write these letters always do. They think they saw something true and nobody else did. It’s exhausting.”

Exhaustion, Mara thought, was a thread that ran through things. She read the letter again. She read the space between the uppercase words. She pictured someone cutting, gluing, laughing a little, the glue drying shiny where it squeezed out from under the edges of the words. She pictured a mask.

That afternoon there was a protest outside the council building about a proposed shelter for rough sleepers. The signs were a mixture of hearts drawn by children and a coarse marker written hand that said things like TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN FIRST, with the our doing the weighted work of a thousand years. A man with a portable speaker shouted about responsibility and rights. A woman with a clean face said the shelter would attract the wrong sort and her friend touched her elbow to shush her because the press had phones. Mara stood in the lee of the statue of a former mayor who had owned three textile mills and who wore a top hat in bronze as if his head were a carriage lamp. She listened. She did that often when she thought she needed to remember how people became possible to harm.

She felt it like a weather change. The murmur that had been discontent turned into something with teeth. It was almost nothing—a man in a flat cap used a word that made the air change—but Mara had spent years learning the occasions when a word did more than mean, when it summoned. She watched faces. She watched how people avoided looking at one woman in a red coat who had put her arm around her teenage son, who had hair that gleamed blue at the tips like a summer blackbird. People thought at him. They thought sentences that ended with because of boys like him. She saw it.

Somewhere, something drew breath.

Karen watched too, from under the lowest step of the council’s side stairs where the shadow suited her. The protest was her soup kitchen. The acrid logic warmed her. The boy’s hair was a flare in fog; it was a defiance. She didn’t want him, not yet. She kept her satchel still under one hand the way someone in love touches a pocket watch for comfort.

She went home to her arches that night with the sound of a portable speaker still in her ears and lay on the kind of blanket that collects an entire town’s grit. She turned on the radio. A presenter talked about division like it was a flavour. A caller said that in his day you knew where you stood. His day had never ended for him. The presenter agreed and disagreed in equal measure, and Karen nodded along because she appreciated the art. She got up at one-thirty, oiled the blades, slid the mask over her face because faces are for dealing with the outside and she had no interest in being outside. Her hand lingered on her hair—the thin, light pale hair that did not obey. It was brittle; it smelled faintly of peat.

She had a letter to write, but she preferred scissors to glue. Glue was a human thing; it made strong joins and messy puddles. Scissors sang if you loved them. She sharpened and listened and felt the town set itself for another night, the way a dog settles into its basket but not to sleep, not quite.

The second time she went in through a fire escape someone had propped with a chunk of wood. The boy inside was four days into a new job at a phone shop and had promised himself he would keep his head down and sell anyone anything if it meant commission. He had grown his hair long because he had been told most of his life to be quiet and long hair had been like shouting. Karen did not take all of it. She took just enough to make the mirror into a wall. She left a clean line down to the skin, a declaration made in negative. He had a poster of a footballer on his wall. In the morning he would look at the footballer’s groomed head and feel the fire in his stomach, that awful mix of shame and rage that confuses itself for power. He would say words about monsters. He would think of punching. He would copy out the part of the letter from the MP’s office that someone had posted online and he would say, this. He would say, this is about us. He would be wrong, but he would believe it with the sincerity that makes bad things happen.

Mara went to see him. She sat on his chair that had bad back support and told him she was very sorry this had happened to him. She told him he had done nothing wrong. She asked him to describe what he remembered. He remembered a mask and a smell like damp wool. He remembered a voice that had said, “You won’t bleed,” and somehow that had been comforting and terrifying at the same time, like when you tell a child the dog won’t bite while the dog is already on the sofa and everyone is pretending not to notice it has teeth. He tried to joke. He told her his mates had already started calling him the runway, and he had smiled like a chipped plate. She did not joke back. She asked him to show her the cut. He lifted his hat. The skin was not cut. It was very clean. The lines were neat enough to be violent.

“Do you know the MP?” he said suddenly, as if confessing a crime.

“I know of him,” she said.

“He says this is about discipline,” the boy said. “He says the town has to get tougher. He says the police are—” The boy looked at her and swallowed. He was eighteen and very close to giving all his loyalty to the first person who sounded like a promise.

“The police are trying,” she said. “We are also people. We also bleed if you take our skin. We also have to sleep sometimes. We live where you live. We are not your enemy.”

“Then who is?” he said, with the sincerity that her heart both loved and feared.

“I am not sure yet,” she said. “But I know her shape.”

He did not catch the pronoun. Few did at first. They always thought monsters were men because men were the ones who had taught them how to be afraid. Sometimes that was the trick; sometimes it wasn’t.

The week stretched in fog. Reports came in. Some were true, some were not. Enough were true that Mara felt the shape of something that was not just a person doing a thing. It was the way the town liked the story of it, and the way the story seemed to like them back. The letter at the MP’s office grew a twin, this one sent to the local paper. It said: IF YOU CUT PEOPLE IN LINES THEY WILL BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU SAY THERE ARE ONLY TWO SIDES. A third went to the council leader and read: I’M JUST MAKING IT NEAT. There is a kind of letter that is a game, and there is a kind that is a scoreboard. These were the second kind.

Callum hummed with the information and wrote lists because lists made him feel he had tamed the thing that was trying to run off the desk. “She’s choosing lads who are visible,” he said one morning while the kettle at The Swan clicked and clicked because Adela’s thumb was on the switch. “Lads with hair that says something. Lads who walk home alone. Lads who live within a mile of the arches.”

“Do we know it’s a she?” Adela asked from the doorway in the gentle way of a person who is capable of being a witness if you let them. She had that bartender trick of hearing her name and your story in twenty conversations at once. “Because I worked down near the riverside back in the day and there were things that moved that weren’t names you boys would think of.”

“We know it isn’t only a he,” Mara said. “That’s enough for now.”

“You fancy a look at the under-bridge?” Adela said. “My cousin did some graffiti there. He says somebody’s been tidying it.”

“Tidying graffiti?” Callum said, full of the joy of ridiculousness.

“Not painting over,” Adela said. “Tidying. Making the lines sharper. Combing it.”

The arches had always smelled of piss and romance. The wet on the bricks was ancient. Records had been set here for firsts: first cigarettes, first kisses, first someone who didn’t like you that way, first police caution, first time a boy told another boy he was beautiful and meant it. Somebody had hung fairy lights once. Their batteries had given up but the wires were still there like a necklace after a party you hadn’t really wanted to go to. On the second arch, a piece of street art had grown across the brick: a face made of lines, hair like wind. Someone had been here with black paint and a brush so fine it may have been a single hair. The lines that had been fuzzy were precise now. The eye had a glint that had not been there. The hair in the drawing had been shaved in one place, just a small line you wouldn’t see unless you were looking for it.

“Christ,” Callum whispered, and the word was the exact size of the arch.

“Her signature,” Mara said. “Or her laugh.”

“Or both,” Adela said. Her breath made the word both look like smoke. “There’s songs, you know. There’s stories. Down by the arches, comes a… thing. A woman once, a man once, a thing. She likes your edges. She nibbles at them. People say if you go down there after midnight and make a speech about how the world’s gone wrong she’ll come and shape you like a hedge.”

Mara didn’t laugh, because the page of the world she was reading had stopped being funny. “And does she shave hedges too?”

“She likes a topiary,” Adela said. “She likes neat. You can hear her at night if you’re drunk enough. Somebody said she was at the protest. I told them not to be ridiculous. But when I walked home I felt like my shadow didn’t belong to me.”

Karen sat three bricks away in a crack you couldn’t have found with your hand and swallowed the sweetness of being told as a story. Goblins love to be named. It saves them the work.

The football ground is two roads over and a field. It has floodlights like a confession. The home fans love a lad with a good haircut almost as much as they love a lad who goes in hard in the first five minutes to show he isn’t there to be decorative. That Saturday, boys with hair sprayed to improbable heights bounced on their heels; somebody had painted a flag on somebody else’s cheek and then smudged it into their jaw. The chant started and stopped. A drone, briefly, buzzed. A steward told a man to put his beer down and the man pretended not to hear, then did. A boy in a blue jacket was pushed by someone who called him a name without letters. His hair flared. Karen was there, a shadow in a shadow. She watched where the wires ran, where the metal barriers lay locked along the inner edge, where the groundkeeper kept chemical drums for the grass. She did not plan. She neither wrote nor read shopping lists. But you could see it if you stood inside her head in the place where she kept her trophies: a shape like a hand closing. She had ideas of neatness that made sets of boys kneel inside them. She thought of clippers big enough to buzz the world.

Mara had eyes on the game and on the faces. She had that old awareness from court: the way people got bold in groups, the way they thought a body was not quite a person if there were enough bodies around it. She stood near a stairwell and listened to something that had begun as a song turn into something that forgot rhyme. She saw a boy in a red scarf reach for another boy’s hair and mean it meanly, as if his fingers were a claw. She put a hand on his wrist and said, “No.” He met her gaze and decided he would live to make this woman sorry, but then he looked at the little badge at her lapel and decided he would live, full stop.

“You should cut it,” he said, because people always say the thing nearest at hand when they feel foolish. “Looks messy.”

She smiled like a court that had already risen for the day and said, “Mine’s not your business.”

“Yours neither, is it?” he said, jerking his chin at the boy whose hair had been his target, and then he caught himself and looked embarrassed, and embarrassment is the tiny cousin of remorse. He went away. He bumped his friend and said, “Leave it,” as if the idea had been his.

That night, a letter arrived at the paper again, posted early so that Monday’s edition could lay it out next to a picture of a kid—Ewan—with a beanie on and a blur over his eyebrows because the photographer had chosen a picture where he looked adorable and then felt bad about it. The letter said: IF YOU WORSHIP IMAGE I WILL STRIP IT. I WILL SHOW YOU THE SKIN OF THINGS. STOP PRETENDING YOUR HAIR IS NOT A HAT YOU WEAR TO SAY WHO IS WORTH WHAT. Mara took the letter into the incident room and pinned it. She put string. She drew a line, with her finger, between the clipping bag at Luca’s and the graffiti, between the protest and the football. Then she tried to rub the string away, because she didn’t want to give anyone the idea that this person deserved a web. They deserved a stop.

The third boy fought.

He woke and his arm flung wide and caught the clippers and they stuttered to the floor. Karen’s hand on his chest did not still him this time. He twisted like someone in a net. He put a knee up and she laughed out loud, delighted, delighted by his spine, delighted by the way he refused to be a landscape. The mask’s edge caught his cheek and left a shallow line. He threw her off and she slid, cat-fast, towards the door. She could have gone. She waited. She looked at him and saw in his eyes something that made the radio’s late-night callers sound like bedtime stories. He said, “Come on, then,” and he meant it. She admired him enough to leave him with his hair intact. She left him a plait on the bedside table, a little dish of shame, because she was not a saint. Then she ran.

He ran after.

It was raining. It made the cobbles into slick conversation. Karen darted down passages older than car ownership, turned where the steps went steep, slipped like she had learned the town from underneath as if she were rat in a library, knowing not the titles but the words nobody looked at. The boy was fitter than most. He made the turn where she had been sure he would miss it. He nearly had her at the alley where the drainage channel made a sound like someone whistling in their throat. He nearly did and then he didn’t. She went up the falling-down iron stairs at the back of the carpet shop two at a time like a spider and was gone over the roof.

The boy stopped under the stairs and stood, sweating, breathing like a man on a raft. He put his hands on his knees and swore. He laughed, and the laugh was ugly. The laugh said, I will take this out on someone. Mara had turned a corner because she had learned to listen to rain. She saw him. He looked up, rage hot under his eyes. She stepped towards him and he saw the badge on her lapel and his rage did not go out, but it rephrased itself.

“Did you see—” he began.

“No,” she said. “But I can see you.”

“It’s—” He gestured at his hair with a hand that trembled. “She—” He had seen that much. It pleased Mara’s brain in a terrible way that the pronoun was correct.

“We’ll walk you home,” she said, like he was five and had fallen off his bike, and he hated her for it. He let her. He told her his name and it was Simon. He told her he had never thought he would be a person something like this would happen to. She said, “Nobody does,” and got him through his door. She waited until she heard the lock. She leaned her forehead against the paintwork for a second longer than a person who did not want to cry.

On Monday, the MP made a speech outside a barber’s, shaking hands with old men whose hair had made peace with the absence of itself. He said something about standards. He referred to discipline again. He made the camera find his kindest angle. He had the energy of a man who had chosen to be a mirror for a public that wanted to see itself as respectable. The barber stood behind him with his arms folded and looked polite and thought of scissors.

Mara was not invited to the speech, which freed her to do her work. She met with a woman from a community group who had not had a budget rise in ten years and who had nevertheless kept more young men from doing stupid things than the MP had ever kept his own promises. The woman, whose name was Ruby, ran a tiny boxing club and a massive WhatsApp. She said, “They’re angry because they think this person is telling them they’re not men enough. If you make it a joke they’ll break a window. If you make it a test they’ll break each other.”

“So we make it neither,” Mara said. “We make it a crime and we make it an injury and we make it stop.”

“You going to do that with two detectives and a rota system that’s held together with string?” Ruby said, and her mouth did a stern thing that made Mara like her more. “Fine. I’ll help. Tell them to send the lads with hair to me. I’ll tell them I’m teaching them footwork. I’ll teach them how to let their fear go somewhere else. I’ll tell them not to go home alone.”

“Thank you,” Mara said, meaning it in the underlined way, meaning I will buy you tea and campaign for your funding and vote for you if you ever run for anything and also carry your bags.

At night, in her arches, Karen held the hair she had taken and twisted it and twisted it until it formed a cord. She had a dozen cords now, braided from the boys she had changed. She hung them along the arch like bunting. She lay beneath them and listened to the town plan for a summer fete. She had an idea that made her sit up fast enough to startle a rat. She thought of neatness and crowd and lines drawn on grass. She thought of where the long orange extension cables always ran from the generator to the stage on the green. She thought of chairs in rows. She thought of the hum of an engine, the buzz of clippers, how big could she make it. She was a goblin and she was fuelled by whatever ran underneath the smiling words people said about loving their neighbours. She liked machines. She liked levers. She would need a switch. She whispered to herself, not to the town. “Not yet,” she said. “We’re still playing.”

In the early hours of Tuesday, the fog came heavier. It made Markham into a thought you couldn’t quite recall. Footsteps turned strange. The river lost its edges. A man on the path saw, out of the corner of his eye, a small figure crouched on the parapet with its head cocked in a way that was not a human tilt. He turned back and there was nothing. He shivered and told himself ghosts were a way to say you disliked potholes. In her room at The Swan, Mara woke and did not know what had woken her until she did: her own heart, banging on her ribs. She got up. She put on her coat. She went down and out because sometimes the only way to make the thing in your chest lie down is to chase the thing outside that woke it.

Under the viaduct, the graffiti’s hair looked like it was moving. The fairy lights’ dead wires made a few weak sparks because the moisture had found a battery that wasn’t truly dead, only sleeping. A gull made a sound like a laugh. Mara stood and inhaled a smell like damp wool and oil. She was not alone. She did not call out. She had learned from court and from kitchens and from empty bedrooms waiting for someone to come home that this was the moment where you either make a noise and turn the thing into a scene or you wait and let the scene reveal itself.

“You’re too neat for here,” said a voice that was a woman’s and not a woman’s, crisp as paper and wet as the river. “Law lady.”

“Was,” Mara said, keeping her hands visible because she had learned that hands are how you speak to a frightened animal and how you speak to a person who wants to hurt you. “Now I’m something else.”

“So am I.”

Mara let the silence be, the way you let the bread rise and don’t open the oven and ruin it with curiosity. She felt the air change, as if someone had stood up out of the shadow they had been nested in.

“You’re tidying boys,” Mara said. “As if they were drawers. I want you to stop.”

“You do not,” the voice said, with a little chuckle that was as cruel as a paper cut. “You want me to explain. You want a story you can fit in your folder. I will give you better than a folder. I will give you a haircut.”

“I like mine as it is.”

“Mine too,” the voice said, and Mara could tell that there was a hand moving on hair that was more idea than thread. She tried to picture her opponent and got a child’s drawing and the shape of a rat and a woman in a cardigan rolling up her sleeves and someone’s aunt at a wedding boat with a paper plate of cake and a reasonable monster with ordinary hands. She didn’t move. She looked at the graffiti and let her eyes rest on the shaved line in paint.

“You feed on what the town says to itself when it thinks nobody’s listening,” Mara said. “You’re not the first. You won’t be the last. You’re the one who thinks neatness is kindness. It’s not. It’s just neat.”

“Oh, lawyer,” said the voice, almost affectionate. “You think words will make it stop. You think I am a word. I am a clipper.”

“I think you’re a coward,” Mara said, and heard, immediately, the intake of breath that meant she had made something in the dark lean forward. “You pick boys. Boys who will be ashamed. Boys who will fight each other before they confess. You pick fog. You break-in where the lock is cheap. You take the smallest thing that says who they are and you pretend it’s huge. I’ve met you before. When I was ten. When I was eighteen. When I was twenty-nine and divorced. When my client was told by a nice man that the way he wore his hair made juries uncomfortable. I know what you are.”

The silence that answered her was an animal pressing down on itself, deciding whether to spring. When it did not, when it instead retreated, with a soft scraping like knitwear on brick, she did not follow. You don’t chase the river into the fog.

She went back to The Swan and put the kettle on because that was what you did when you had seen a myth peer around the arch at you. Adela appeared, tying her hair back.

“You look like you’ve told somebody a truth they won’t forgive you for,” Adela said, placing two mugs next to the kettle because she had a gift for being useful that had paid for two of her mother’s teeth.

“I told myself one,” Mara said. “That this might not be a person we can arrest in a way that satisfies anyone.”

“You’ll arrest somebody,” Adela said. “You lot always do. It will help, and it will not be all.”

She warmed her hands on the mug. The fog outside pressed up against the old glass. Somewhere out there was a small woman or not-a-woman, wearing a mother’s name, with a satchel of blades and a hunger for lines. Somewhere out there was an idea of neatness big enough to make a field into a chessboard. Somewhere out there was a boy who would not go home alone tonight because Ruby had told him to sit with the other boys and learn to move his feet and breathe. That was something. Sometimes something is what you had.

Her phone vibrated. Callum: Another letter. Different address. To the festival committee. She read the attached photo.

The letter said: THE GREEN MUST BE CLEAN. THE LADS MUST LEARN. I WILL SHOW THEM.

She thought of cable runs. She thought of clippers big enough to hum like engines. She thought of chairs in rows. She put down the mug.

“Adela,” she said, “tell me you know the bloke who orders the generators for the summer fete.”

“Do I know him,” Adela said, with a delicate snort. “I’ve been pretending not to for fifteen years. Mira—sorry, Mara. Why?”

“Because someone is making a plan and I want to untidy it before anyone sits down,” she said, and the fog outside pressed its face to the window like a child without a ticket.The man who knew the generators was called Kev, because of course he was, and his surname had slipped off him somewhere around 1998 and never been replaced. He had a lanyard that looked as if it had been chewed by a dog with standards and hands that carried scars like maps to places he could tell you about if you gave him a mug of tea and didn’t rush him. He was the sort who could stand in silence with a piece of machinery and make it feel heard. When Adela called him he said he was in the yard behind his ex-wife’s cousin’s place and would swing by The Swan when he’d finished telling a stubborn compressor it wasn’t special. He arrived smelling of diesel and good intentions, took off a cap that had known more roofs than hats ought to know, and listened to Mara with his head tilted in that considerate way men sometimes learn when they have raised daughters.

“You want to make it harder for someone to do something silly with long runs of juice,” he said. “You want to shorten your snakes. I can do that. We’re supposed to, anyway. People like their cables to be the length of their laziness. I prefer mine like a neat swear: short and to the point.”

“Can they be locked?” Mara said. “In a way that isn’t ridiculous, given it’s a field and a summer and somebody always forgets a spare key.”

Kev grinned with half his mouth and rubbed at a knuckle as if it itched where a younger version of himself had skinned it carrying someone else’s sofa up steps. “Box with a shutter. Lock on the isolators. I’ll weld you covers. I’ll stick the distribution under the stage, not behind. If anyone wants to change a thing they’ll have to crawl for it, and the number of men in this town who are willing to get mud on their knees in public is small. You got a budget?”

“Technically,” Callum said, because he was past the point where jokes helped and into the point where you made them anyway. “But also, yes, if I have to dig the coins out of the sofa in the station.”

Adela put a hand briefly over Mara’s on the table because she had that barman’s sense for when the woman in the room was about to offer to pay for safety with her own money and needed to feel a hand on hers to remember she wasn’t alone. “And I’ll talk to Miranda on the committee about the layout. No rows.”

“What does no rows look like?” Kev asked, curious, not mocking.

“Circles,” Mara said, with a certainty that surprised her as it left her mouth. “Stalls in circles. Seating in circles. A bandstand that faces inwards. If they want lines, give them garlands. Make the paths curve. If you don’t give this person lines, you take away half her joy.”

Adela thought about bunting. She thought about how people received a circle differently to a lane. She thought about the old women who always sat in a row to criticise the jam judging and how easily they could be scooped into a round of chairs that made them face one another’s kind eyes. “Miranda will hate it and do it if we make it sound like tradition,” she said. “We’ll say it’s medieval. We’ll say it’s a wassail thing or a maypole thing and that it fosters community and that the Morris lot prefer it. She can’t say no to Morris.”

Miranda did hate it. She wore lipstick like a border dispute and had the authority of someone who had kept a village panto going through two floods and a flu season. She also had a precise, expensive haircut that said I’ve made peace with my grey but only if it behaves. She invited Mara to the planning meeting as if offering a truce. The meeting was held in a side room at the community centre where a laminated poster advised everyone to hydrate and a noticeboard had flyers for Pilates and for a lost budgie called Samson. The committee had been almost the same people since before anyone could remember, except now there were a few with tattoos and good trainers who had stopped arguing about whether the beer tent was ethical and had started offering to carry barrels.

Mara stood and asked them to imagine the green as a quilting frame rather than a runway. She did her lawyer voice but made it kind, made it like wool. She talked about circles and how they made help easier. She did not mention goblins. She mentioned trip hazards and a letter from someone who wanted to make the town into obedience. She asked for them to trust her enough to make little messes now so that nothing worse had to be cleaned later. Miranda pressed her lips together and looked at the floor and made peace with how the bunting would have to drape and then lifted her head and declared that it did sound like something her grandmother had said about harvest festivals. The tattooed lads cheered and the older ones pretended they had already decided that.

After, in the car park where the tarmac held heat from an afternoon that had remembered how to be June, Callum leaned on his battered hatchback and said, “Isn’t this a bit… ritual?”

“It’s a layout,” Mara said. “It’s Health and Safety. It’s taking away the tool someone thinks she’s got a right to. And maybe—” She stopped, because the part of her that was woven from case law and the part that knew about how fairy tales taught children not to walk into forests without telling someone held hands uneasily. “Maybe it keeps the temperature down. Heat moves in straight lines. People move in straight lines. If you bend them, maybe they find another rhythm.”

“You sound like Ruby,” he said, and his mouth smiled without his permission because he liked it when people surprised him by agreeing with him after the fact.

Ruby watched the lads at her gym like a shepherd with no interest in shearing. She put them into a ring and watched their feet and told them to breathe like they were not alone. She pretended a social media campaign about footwork was for the big match and not a way to keep them off the late bus home or the lanes that led to cheap locks and sleeping hair. She had a way of telling a boy he was brave that made him forget he might have been a coward, and she let them talk about the hair without calling it the hair. She had them tie their laces twice, then once, then not at all, to feel the difference between ready and raw. She gave them a song to shout on the way home that did not say anything about anyone else’s wrongness. She stood in the doorway with her arms folded and dared any night to come for them. When she needed to, she would ring Mara and say, gently, “There’s one I can’t send home alone,” and Mara or Callum would drive and talk about nothing very much until the words the boy needed to say came out of him. It wasn’t a cure. It was stitches on a wound that shouldn’t have been made.

Karen crossed under the green a dozen times in the week before the fete as if it were her particular stitching. She watched the committee put up circles and felt the annoyance in her ribs like a cat being told to move off a sun-warmed chair. She had expected lanes. She had expected aisle and altar and the sweet gather of boys in rows like wheat. She had wanted an aisle she could cut. The circles made her roll her neck, made her consider a different instrument. She had never minded improvisation, but it took more from her. She would need to harvest. She visited the sandwich shop and listened to a man who said he had always preferred his bread white and did not see why brown bread should have to exist in his space. She cradled the grumble. She went to the edge of the skate park and took in the little quips the boys threw when a lad missed a trick and how easily those quips turned into categories when the boy who missed had an accent that moved. She ate at the rough edges. She licked her fingers. She came back to her arches humming like a turbine being told a secret.

She took out her cords of hair and measured them. She had enough for what she wanted, if she braided them around wire stolen from a fence that had failed to keep anything in. She plaited very carefully, making the hair the weft and the wire the warp, and the plait grew into something stronger than it had a right to be. She made three. She liked threes; they looked like balance no matter what you put on the scales. She made them the length of arms. She remembered a smith she had once loved who believed three blows were better than two and four was an insult. She hummed the song that goes with twisting and binding, that does not need words to make fibre into intention. She oiled her blades. She stroked the mask as if it were an animal that might misbehave. She thought of the field under lights and the big generator’s engine making a cosiness like a mother’s pulse and she laughed softly at herself for thinking about mothers, for all she took a name like a mother’s for a coat.

The drunk barber she had once borrowed the clippers from had sobered up in an inconvenient way. He had thrown away the habit that had made his hands ring and had discovered his palms were very empty. He had become a backroom assistant for a friend’s mobile barbering business and spent a lot of time loading and unloading equipment he wasn’t allowed to touch. His name was Dan, and when Karen stepped into the shadow at the edge of the car park where he smoked without inhaling he did not see her as anything other than bad luck. She took his lanyard, his old habit making him slow, and she took two battery packs from the case in his boot so easily he wondered if he had misplaced them. He would blame himself, and then he would blame a boy with hungry hands, and then he would glower at that boy’s hair. All of which was fine with Karen. It was the exhaust she used to make tea.

There was a boy called Raf who had already lost one neat stripe to her clippers, and he had done something that surprised everyone who knew him, including himself: he had gone back to the barber and asked for more. He had looked in the mirror at the bare line on his head and decided he would not be defined by someone else’s neatness. He had asked Luca to make it wild. It wasn’t, not exactly; it was beautiful. Luca had given him a cut that took the line as if it had been deliberate, turned the set of it into a parting for hair that moved, into an asymmetry that made him look like himself only more so. People who didn’t know what to say to him looked at him in the street and saw not a scar but a style. It made some of them angrier. It made others secretly relieved. We are creatures who look, Karen thought, standing outside the shop watching even though she knew she should not give her attention away. We are creatures who say: I will be the fence or I will jump it. She had to admit to a vagrant stab of admiration for Luca’s hands. She liked craft wherever it lived. She almost wanted to leave a plait on his counter the way a cat brings a gardener a dead vole. She did not, because she had promised herself something more dramatic than a vole.

The MP had in mind a speech that would be delivered in front of the cake tent at the fete in front of a quilt of Essex mums who would applaud because he had made the right noises about funding for youth services while moving commas in another document in such a way that the youth services were funded for five weeks in a year with fifty-two. He had arranged a ribbon and scissors with handles like pelican beaks and a photographer who had a way with light that made older men’s eyes look like truth. He had also asked for the chairs to be in a line. Miranda had promised him something that wasn’t exactly that and had hung bunting behind to distract him. She had forbidden the photography of the generator because she had picked up something from Mara’s voice like a needle picking up thread.

On the Friday before the fete, the police found a plait pinned to the noticeboard at the rugby clubhouse with a staple that had not deigned to go in straight. The plait had grit in it again, and the paper behind it read: HAIR IS A CLAIM. I AM DISPOSSESSING. The clubhouse smelled of disinfectant and old beer and the attempt to hide both with lemons. Callum took the plait in a bag with the tenderness of a man putting a dead finch in the hedge to keep it from the cats. He came back to the station and found Mara in the small incident room that had previously been an office for a constable who had managed to make three colleagues pregnant in the space of ten years and had then asked to be transferred to a station where nobody knew him well enough to laugh. Mara had pinned a photograph of the green. She had pencilled circles over it. She had written: SALT? She had written: GLITTER? And had crossed both out because she refused to make evidence of her thinking look like superstition.

“I know an old woman who lays salt at the thresholds of hairdressers,” Adela said when called. “She says it’s for luck and not for goblins. I also know that shops that have a little line of something in the doorway have fewer bad lads sticking their boots in. Maybe it’s the line. Maybe it’s the shopkeeper. Maybe it’s the knowledge that somebody has taken the time.”

“We are taking time,” Mara said. “We are taking away lines and putting different ones in. We are making the tidy thing messy and the messy thing purposeful. If a goblin’s just a memory of the first time somebody drew a line because they could and not because they needed to, then this is the fight we know the rules for.”

“Don’t say goblin on the radio,” Callum said mildly. “I’d never get the phone to stop.”

“We’re not going on the radio,” she said. “We’re going to move the chairs so the boys who would sit at the back have to sit with someone’s aunt who will tell them about her knees until they forget they wanted to impress each other by barking.”

They did move the chairs. The morning of the fete dawned hot and sticky like a slice of cake that had been left out too long. The green filled with stalls and shade gazebos and clusters of people who had never met and would introduce themselves as if they had by talking about sausages and raffles. The Morris dancers hammered the grass into willingness. The band took a long time to tune because their new bassist had never played in the open air and the wind stole their pitch. The generator purred under the stage like a large animal that had decided it would allow today. Kev wandered around the little fences that had been set to protect the nothing that was under the trestle tables and pretended he didn’t see small boys testing the integrity of a peg with their shoes. He had built a cage out of mesh for the distribution board and he had put little locks on it and he had given the key to Miranda, who put it on a ribbon around her neck as if that key were a saint’s tooth. He had taped down every cable with a tape that said NO in black letters on yellow. He had shortened every run he could stand to shorten. He had put weight on the plugs as if convinced that electricity was weightless and this offended it.

Ruby’s lads moved through the crowd like a school of fish pretending to be separate. They had on their gym shirts because Adela had said if they wore gym shirts nobody would think their hair was a challenge, not to them, not to anyone. They paired off and then split and then found someone’s nana and carried her garden chair to the shade. They pretended not to watch each other. They were watched, inevitably, by men with opinions who mouthed them behind the rims of cups and by women who were not impressed by the word laaaads and who said to their daughters in voices that carried that the boys were trying.

Karen had never much liked daylight work, but there were days when the fog lay low along the grass even under a sun that was already chewing at forearms, and she felt almost at home walking the edge of the field in her stolen high-vis vest with a clipboard she had borrowed from someone who was so important they kept spare clipboards in a boot. Nobody looked twice at a woman with a clipboard and a vest. They only troubled to wonder what she was about if she was young and pretty and then they hoped they could help her and she found that funny in a way that made her teeth feel like they were growing. Two boys with too-new fades looked at her and did not see her. They saw safety—vest, order, lines. She loved the betrayal of that. She touched the place where the battery packs lay in her satchel and thought about the moment when, if she made it, she would pull all the threads tight and hum.

Mara walked and nodded and spoke to people she would never have met if not for this. She felt the work under the work, the way Adela did, the way Ruby did. She saw that if she had a miracle to offer the town it would not be an arrest that stopped more hair from falling. It would be this: a thousand decisions not to shape the world into knives. She breathed in the smell of sugar and suncream and frying and the sour, old smell of the generator’s animal sleep. She kept a part of her brain just for wires. She kept an eye for anything too straight.

The incident happened in the space nobody had bothered to think about because it was small and innocent and responsible for nothing in particular: the craft tent. Not the main ring or the stage or the generator or the beer; the place where a woman called Jan showed children how to make mermaids out of pipe cleaners and where a boy with a piggy bank face and a talent for origami had folded a dragon that seemed to wish the paper were flame. It was quieter here. The chairs had been in a circle, because Miranda had been faithful for once to the brief, and the mums in the habit of watching their kids take instructions from other people had stopped watching because their children had become totally absorbed in beads. It was then that Karen’s vest was a hovering neutral in the corner and then not, then in the gap between the mesh of the cage and its foot because there was a gap—a gap nobody had thought mattered because it was only wide enough for a hand. It was then that her wire-braided rope slithered like intelligence and made contact with bare copper in a way that wasn’t an accident and the hum of the generator deepened like a man deciding to have an opinion after all. It was then that every chair in the circle vibrated and half rose and fell and a blonde girl’s plait lifted up as if attracted to a magnet. A sound went through the air like something she had only ever heard in a good barber’s at the end of a day when he’d sharpened properly.

Five things happened at once. Kev launched himself from a stool like a large dog who had seen a man he loved step into the road and, with six words that would have been a prayer if he had believed in anything except torque, threw the breaker. The hum became a cough and then a silence. Jan, whose day job was nursing at a ward full of kids who had learned to endure, with steely gentleness, pain she would not like to imagine, stepped towards the circle with an authority that made grown men take a step back and say, “Yes, sister.” Ruby, who had not trained for electrical incidents but had trained for the bow wave of panic, put her body in a door frame and said, “Stay,” and people stayed because they recognised the word as the kind that keeps you living. Mara, whose eye had been on wires, had already moved towards the stage and then diverted to the craft tent as if somebody had tugged a piece of string in her chest, and Callum, who had been trying to get Miranda to stop touching the cages when she wanted to show how safe they were, yelled something that was almost certainly not within policy and ran.

The fifth thing was the smallest and the most important: the blonde girl in the chair put her hand up to hold her plait still in the air as if to say, gently, not you. Her hand was brown with grass and glitter. Her fingers were sticky. She was seven. She frowned like a judge. If Karen was a thing that fed on edges and the consent of lines, this frown was a curtain that closed. It did something to the air. It did something to Karen. For a second—small and mean, but present—she felt ridiculous.

Ridiculous was not a food she could swallow. She withdrew. Not far, because she still had harm to do and a stomach for it, but enough to make the hum die without consequence. She was quick, always quick; she had her rope back into the satchel and her fingers out of the mesh and her smile on for nobody’s benefit because nobody was looking when they ought to have, and then she was at the edge of the tent again where a woman with a habit of not seeing women in vests saw her and said, “Can you fetch the first-aid kit,” and Karen felt her skin tighten with something like laughter.

The incident didn’t make the news in the way a bomb would have, or a fall, or a fight might have. It became a rumour that was all adjectives and no nouns. The lads in the gym later would call it the buzz and slap each other’s shoulders and swear to God they’d felt chairs breathe. The old men on the bench would say they didn’t see the fuss and tell a story about the time a generator had tried to eat a tent in 1982, which made the 1982 generator into legend, which was fine with everyone except the 2020s. The photograph of the day that made the front page of the local paper was of the MP, against the circles, with his hand halfway down and a boy with a messy haircut laughing behind him and not in front of him, which spoiled the composition. The story would say nothing about wires. The story would say something about community spirit. The story would be true and would leave out the part where a woman in a high-vis vest had bent down and then stood up and the lights had cohered into a single unpleasant thought.

Mara found the scrape on the mesh where hair had caught. It was barely a whisper. It was enough. She ran her finger across and her skin came away with a strand so fine you would not have seen it if you had not been primed by fear and hope. She put it in a bag like she was putting away a piece of thread she would need later. She looked around and saw Adela speaking to two women as if she knew them well and would never see them again and loved them already, and Ruby standing solid, and Kev with both hands on the generator as if it had tried to sit up. She breathed out and felt the breath come back to her, which is a better trick than most make in tents.

That evening, “Whoever-They-Are” trended on local social media with the velocity of a rumor that wanted to be born as a grievance. The letters from the goblin had become screenshots mashed into quote-tweets. The usual men had their say. The usual women rolled their eyes in private and texted each other recipes for the week. The boys, whose hair had been a fence and a flag for months, found that their reflections looked back not with threat but with questions. Some of them softened their hair. Some went harder. Most did nothing, because doing nothing is also a decision and sometimes a reprieve.

Karen went back to the arches the way a fox goes back to a den after a dog has put its head in and snarled. She did not run. She did not pant. She walked and let the town take the taste of failure out of her mouth because everyone was willing to share their own little loss that night. It was harvest. A guitarist on a corner had played the wrong song. A woman had baked a flan that slid out as custard. A man had told a joke to a friend who hadn’t found him funny since school and had seen it land like a dead bird. She took all those small ridiculousnesses and was full again by the time the bricks changed damp under her hand.

When she slid into her place under the arch, somebody was already there. Not in the way of bodies, which she could always smell, even the clean ones; in the way of watching. The graffiti face with its hair that had been made neat by someone who loved the comb a little too much looked different in the dark. The shaved line the unknown hand had put in it had grown longer, like somebody had come back and drawn it further down. At the very end of the line was a little dot, as if a hand had slipped and made a punctuation mark. She put her fingernail to the dot and felt grit and paint. The dot made the line into something else, into a sentence that stopped being one. She hated it immediately and fiercely because it was funny. It made a joke of her language.

“You’re taking liberties,” she said aloud, because she was in the habit of convening with the air and sometimes the air convened back. “You’re making puns.”

The arch did not reply. A train went over, indifferent as ever, shuddering the water in the puddles with its thought of speed. She lay down. She made a pillow of her satchel so nobody would decide they could take it from under her with a hook on a string the way a boy had once tried because she had told him he might if he could and he had been too proud to ask what the string was for. She closed her eyes. She slept the kind of sleep that is really just sitting down inside yourself in a room where nobody can knock. She dreamed of someone combing the sky and making the stars into rows.

Mara did not sleep. She went back to her room and sat on the bed that had a noisy mattress because the hotel wanted to discourage romance without saying it out loud, and she took off her shoes and she looked at her feet and thought, unsettled, of how close everything had been to a noise nobody would have known how to write about. She texted Ruby and said, Thank you. She texted Kev and said, You are good. She texted Callum and said, Hot water in the kettles tomorrow, stop any line talk. He texted back a string of kettle emojis and then, after a pause, a comb. She almost smiled and then did, and the smile felt like letting go of something that had been stuck to her gums all day. She put the little strand of hair in an envelope and wrote on it: fair or foul. She almost picked up the phone to call her aunt and did not, because her aunt would say she had always known she liked trouble and would then tell her how to make a poultice for splinters, which would be useful another day and not this one.

On Sunday morning the town went to church, to breakfast, to hangovers, to runs that had now become a habit rather than a punishment. Ewan came into Luca’s and asked what else they could do with the line. Luca hummed and moved his hands in the air as if they were drawing lines he knew nobody could see and then cut hair like he was making a map to a better place. The MP appeared on a radio programme and said he was delighted to see the community rally and hoped the police would not be distracted by trying to understand the mind of a criminal when their time would be better spent saving law-abiding citizens from the inconvenience of antisocial behaviour. He used too many words and said nothing and then said something when he implied that boys who wore their hair a certain way invited trouble in the way windows invite stones, and in saying that he invited more trouble. Ruby turned the radio off with one finger and said to a lad stretching his hamstrings, “Breathe,” and the lad breathed.

Callum came into The Swan at lunchtime and sat at the corner of the bar that was almost private and where the pictures of swans with human arms for wings couldn’t look at you directly because the light hit them wrong. He told Adela that he hadn’t stopped looking for the place where the hand went under the mesh, and Adela told him to stop looking with just his police eyes.

“What other eyes have I got?” he said, weary but trying.

“Your rude ones,” she said without missing a beat. “The ones that see a thing the way you’d say it at home, not the way you’d file it. If you were in your kitchen making toast and you saw a line that tidy on a messy thing, what would you say it was?”

“Showing off,” he said, immediately and with conviction. “A man who sanded one bit of his shelf very smooth and pretended he wasn’t hiding the nick in the other corner.”

“Then this is a shelf,” she said. “Whoever-she-is is sanding one bit and the nick’s somewhere else.”

He didn’t tell her about the dot in the paint because he hadn’t seen it. Mara did, later that day when she took the piece of hair back like an offering and found that the line had been lengthened into comedy. She laughed out loud, which startled a pigeon into making a sound like a very small, very furious uncle. She put her fingers on the dot and thought about periods at the ends of sentences and how some people used them as weapons in messages, and she thought about puns, which were violence only to dignity and thus occasionally useful. She turned and felt in her hands the shape of something that might be a weapon and might be a conversation piece and might be the wrong thing entirely. She thought she could try to make a fence.

It occurred to her then that the thing Karen—she had not yet imagined the name that had been chosen—could not stand was improvisation that belonged to other people. Neatness is one kind of mastery, she thought. Another is jazz. If she could make the town improvise, if she could make it refuse to play the notes this creature wrote, if she could keep them from clapping on the two and the four of outrage, she could turn the music. She did not tell anyone this. She went to The Swan. She asked Adela if anyone in town still knew how to sing rounds.

“My auntie does,” Adela said promptly. “And the primary school when Ms Dente’s had enough of phonics. Why?”

“Because a round is a circle sung,” Mara said. “And if the boys sing, they’re breathing together. And if they’re breathing together they’re not holding their breath for a punch.”

“You’re a witch, aren’t you,” Adela said, not unkindly.

“I’m a civil servant with a hobby,” Mara said. “Tell your aunt I’ll buy her a pint if she comes to the green next week and bullies children into singing Frère Jacques in four parts.”

“She’ll do it for free if you let her judge the jam,” Adela said, and texted before she had finished the sentence.

Under the arches, Karen combed her satchel with a tenderness that would have been called motherly if she were the kind of thing that bred like women do. She thought about circles and about the silly, almost delicious, dot on the painting. She thought, sourly, of being made to feel funny. Goblins did not like to feel like a joke. The moment where the girl had put her hand on her own hair and had looked as if she were the mother of her own plait had got under Karen’s nails. She wanted to shake the town until it was obedient. She wanted to draw a line down the middle of its head and whisper that both sides were the same and watch them fight about it anyway.

She did not much like changing a plan, but she could. She would need to get ahead of the circles. She would need a place where even improvisation had rules. From an old habit stored in the marrow of her fingers she folded paper without thinking. It ended as a small boat. She put it on the river and watched it take a path she hadn’t given it. She watched it spin in the slow eddy under the second arch and thought, resentful and admiring, of anything that moved without her hand.

She could go to church. She could go to school. She could go to the football ground again and find the place where the chanting rounded up boys and made them a shape. Or she could go to the one place where even people who thought they were irregular had agreed to be measured: the barber’s chair. She considered Luca. He was too careful. He would smell her. He would salt his floor with an old Sicilian trick his grandmother had told him accidentally when she’d had too much amaro. The other barbers in town were either too drunk or too bored to set a stage worth her talent. She had liked stages once. Banquet tables and a corridor full of grey cloaks and men who thought they could cancel a tax if they changed the word for it. She would make a stage of her own, then. She would call it a seminar. She would say it was for the boys to become men. She would watch them queue to give up their hair to a standard and call it pride.

The first poster went up after midnight on the community boards that nobody really read unless they had lost a dog or a sense of themselves. It said: MEN’S MORNING. BE A MAN, BE RESPECTED. FREE SHARPEN UP. BRING YOUR MATES. It had a clip-art comb on it and a clip-art lion and printed at the bottom a church hall address that made Mara swear into her pillow because she knew the hall, had been in it for a late-night witness interview, knew the smell of its floor polish and the damp in its stackable chairs. She got up. She texted Callum. She texted Ruby. She texted Luca. She texted Adela without intending to. She put on her shoes. She liked a plan she could stick her hands into. She liked a room she could stand in and say, Not today.

The vicar, who had a beard that had survived four bad years and who wore his dog collar like a man who knew what work was and what it wasn’t, opened the door with a smile that stayed when he saw the police. He put a kettle on without asking. He told them, with amusement, that he suspected no booking, that he suspected a prank, that he suspected a man in a suit more than he suspected the devil. He said they could use the hall if they wanted to speak to anyone who turned up, that he would prefer they did, that he did not want his noticeboard to become a nest for any thing that wasn’t a robin.

Ruby put out cones the way dog handlers put out hurdles. Luca set a chair and adjusted its height as if that mattered, because to him it always mattered. Adela turned up with a box of biscuits she had not paid for and everyone pretended to believe her when she said they had been a donation from a regular. Mara stood with her arms crossed loosely and watched the door.

They did come. Not in a wave, with purpose, but in curious trickles like boys late for mass drifting in to sit with their mates. The poster had done something to them, tapped an old place with a stick and reminded it of a rule it had agreed to without asking which god wrote it. They came in hats, in hoodies, with hair made into statements and hair that had given up and hair that was gorgeous. They came to be told. Karen was outside listening and it was better than radio. She had brought scissors, she had brought the mask, she had brought the rope because she still loved a trick, but she did not bring them in yet, because the flavour of a room where boys waited to be neatened was delicious and she could feed a little on that before she stepped in to turn it into a meal.

Mara did not step forward to address them. She does not believe in speeches unless they are wholly necessary. She let the vicar say, with his modest ease, that any man who wanted a tidy up could get one with consent and a biscuit, and any man who wanted a talk could have one with him or with the lady with the eyes like the back of a spoon that told you if you were lying even when you were not. Luca, who had put on a shirt so white you felt sorry for it, said he wasn’t here to make anyone a marine, he was here to make them themselves but shinier. Ruby was a wall you could lean on. Callum stood in the back and smiled and did not cross his arms because the person who crossed his arms first lost.

Karen had planned an entrance. The thing that lived in her loved entrances. It loved theatre. It loved the moment where the room decided to be afraid. She had the mask ready. She had the line ready that would make the voice in their heads say Here we go. She had the batteries warm in her pocket. A small thing undid it. It wasn’t the police. It wasn’t a line of salt. It was a boy who had been quiet a very long time. He was called Simon, from the night of the rain and the iron stairs, and he had a line of not-hair in his hair that Luca had made into a reckoning you could take pride in. He had come because he was angry and he liked the taste of it and he wanted to make it do something impressive. He had come because he wanted to stand in a doorway and decide who got to be neat. He had come intending to pick a fight with whatever walked in wearing authority, because sometimes a fight felt like choosing. He stood and looked at the chair and looked at Luca and looked at the vicar and looked at the posters that were a dare and then he sat down first. He sat down not as surrender but as appointment. He said, to Luca, who could hear how a person meant a thing in the way they breathed in, “Make it mine.”

It is harder to make an entrance when someone has already decided on a scene in which you are not the centre. Karen stood at the church hall door, invisibly visible, and felt something she refused to name. She balanced the mask in her hand. She considered a scream. She considered how a roar would sound. She looked at the boy in the chair and saw that his hands were not shaking. She saw that he had put his own permission into the room, and that was the kind of boundary she didn’t like to cut because it bit back.

She could have left. That would have been sense. She never had much of that when anything offered the tiniest flavour of grand. She pulled the mask up from the satchel with the same big cat rush she had used a hundred times and stepped over the threshold because thresholds were her hobby. Adela saw her first, because Adela saw everyone first, and the way her breath stuttered would have been a scream if she had been a different woman. Mara saw her second and saw the way the boys saw the mask and how the room started to lean towards fear as if fear had gravity. She stepped forward and put up her hands as if for a hug and said, conversational and clear: “No.”

There are different kinds of no. This one was the kind you use on a dog who has the Sunday joint in its jaw and who you love too much to smack but too well to plead with. It was a command and a kindness. It was also ridiculous, and that helped. A room full of boys laughed, not because they weren’t afraid but because fear is continually hunting for the place it can escape from and sometimes laughter is the hole in the fence. Mara walked forward into the laugh. Karen felt it like stepping into rain when you weren’t ready.

“You can’t take from a room that has already given,” Mara said, and she still wasn’t doing a speech but she couldn’t help how the words came. “You can’t neaten a choice. You can hurt. That’s not the same as teaching. Go home.”

“Home,” Karen said in a voice that made the nearest lad flinch because it was needle and friend both, “is what is left when you’ve been told what you are enough times you can no longer feel the edges of anything else. I am a mercy to boys who want edges.”

Luca’s scissors made a little sound in the air, that dance they do when you open and close them without hair in them and pretend it’s practice. Ruby did not move but somehow was closer. Callum’s hand moved near his belt and then away because he knew what guns could do and what they could not in a room like this in a country where they were not for rooms like this. The vicar put a hand on his tea as if that would help the tea help him.

Then the lights went out. Not because of a trick—Kev had done his work too well, and the church hall’s wiring had been bullied into neatness by a retired electrician with a conscience—but because a cloud folded itself over the sun in a way it had been waiting to. In the moment of dark, in the cool hush, Karen laughed softly into her mask because the world was always on her side when it came to timing. She moved like water. She still had the rope. She did not need it. She needed only to put her hand where its intention was. She reached for the boy in the chair.

His hand met hers. He had been taught to move his feet and to breathe and to sit in chairs as if they were decisions. He was not a fighter, or only the kind who had rehearsed it in his head and put it away. He put his hand up where hers came, and it was a hand that had scrubbed pans and lifted boxes and written on walls in the night and been held by his mother when he was small enough that hair did not matter. He put it up and the thing he met was not skin. It was a glove as thin as a story. He held it anyway.

“Not you,” he said, and his voice was not trembling because it didn’t have to. “Not like this.”

The cloud moved. The light came back. It was ordinary and harsh and made everyone look a little bit older. The mask was there, white and cheap and hateful, and behind it were those coal-black slick eyes you could see yourself in and choose to hate the reflection or forgive it. For a second—small and mean, and a whole world—Karen was held by the fact of refusal. She could have hurt the boy. She could have hurt him so neatly it would have left him grateful for the quality of the damage. She did not. She thought of the little girl’s hand on her own hair. She thought of the dot in the paint. She hissed, because dignity had to go somewhere.

“This is not finished,” she said, because she needed the scene to have a line that took people home. “You make yourselves into lines for me and then tell me I am wicked for loving straightness.”

“You’re wicked for loving pain,” the vicar said, and he did not often speak like that. It came back to him from a decade when he had mistaken a collar for an excuse.

Karen tilted her head like a curious bird. “All right,” she said, and put the mask down and away in a movement so graceful it nearly wrote a letter in the air. “Another time. Bring your combs.”

She was gone, and not in a way that leaves a door swinging. She was gone in the way rooms forget a thought and remember it later in a worse context. The boys exhaled. Somebody did the nervous laugh that is the twin of the sob. The vicar put the kettle on again because he had learned long ago that kettles are how you tell people the world has not ended. Luca put both blades of his scissors very gently on his own wrist the way a man reassures a horse. Ruby counted quietly to four and stopped herself counting to eight, because that was for after a hit and nobody had been hit, not really.

Mara sat down suddenly on a plastic chair that had known thousands of plastic people and was still unoffended by them and pressed her fingers around the little envelope in her pocket where a hair had been shut up and a word with it. She allowed herself, for the first time, to think of the creature with a name, because names have uses. She didn’t say it aloud. She tried it in her head; it tasted like annoyance and old attacks. She thought of the woman the town imagined when someone said that name these days and how she might steal power if asked. She thought of the power that had been stolen from boys down the years by haircuts done with punishment for a hand. She thought, grim and certain, of how to untidy what was coming next without pretending the town could become a cloud.

Outside in the street the weather changed. The fog had been promised again by a radio that still loved the phrase rolling in. Under the arches, where fairy lights remembered their brief duty, the graffiti face acquired, overnight, a second dot, and this time the shaved line took a curve between them so small you might miss it. It looked—if you were fanciful and tired—like a smile, or like a stitch in a place that had torn.On Monday morning the town woke up with the self-satisfaction of a dog that had not quite stolen the roast but had come close enough to smell the gravy. Nothing catastrophic had happened in the church hall, and the story had the kind of endings people could live with: kettles, biscuits, the vicar’s specificity with mugs, a handful of lads who had not been humiliated and had in fact been rather brave in a way that didn’t require a medal. The narrative tidied itself by breakfast. It was almost irritating. The MP managed to get his face onto a radio show midmorning, all sympathies and sternness. He called the incident “concerning” in a tone that suggested he found being concerned handsome. He did not say goblin. He said menace. He said standards. He put the words “resource” and “police” into a sentence in the way a child puts green peas and mashed potato onto the same fork. He suggested that perhaps the lesson here was that people who put themselves on display would do better to consider what displays tempt.

Mara listened, because it was her job to have attention available for people who wasted it, and because she liked to catch the bits they didn’t mean to say. When he slipped into a little chortle about how at least the haircuts he used to have to endure at school were done by men who knew their craft, she heard him snip his own mask. He liked it to be known that his hair was not an accident. He liked the discipline of it. If there was a line she could lay a finger on, it went neat as lawn edges over his ears.

She went to the meeting upstairs with the superintendent, because functions require footnotes and she had become accustomed to writing them in her mind while someone else pretended a flow chart would catch rain. The superintendent was tired in a way that looked like a bespoke suit that didn’t fit anymore. He did the speech about profile. He did the bit about political realities. He did, with regret, the section about public order and how charges that looked like assault on paper played differently when boys went home crying and turned into younger brothers. He also did her the courtesy, when she had waited out the loops and hummed in the right places, of saying that he trusted her to choose which fires to let burn down on their own and which needed water. When he said, carefully, they might have to accept a named suspect even if it never made it to charge in order to keep the front pages from becoming a riot, she said no in the same way she had said it in the church hall. He sat back, relieved. He had not wanted to have to persuade her to say yes, and he had wanted, privately, to be told off by someone he believed in.

Callum took the first run at the morning press brief because he had a face the town liked to practice being reasonable at. He used all the right words with the right weights. He said ongoing. He said appeal. He said anyone with information in a way that made information sound like Christmas presents they might bring to the station and unwrap together. He did not say goblin. He did not say prank. He said, very gently, that the police would be talking to the local authority about event layout for the summer and that they were grateful to the volunteers of the fete for their calm yesterday. Somebody with a phone asked if it was true that chairs had leapt into the air. He said only in the way chairs always did when children had sugar, and didn’t blink. It worked, for the morning. It would not work by tea if there was nothing else to offer them.

Mara took her leather bag the way some people took shawls and went to see her aunt because she wanted to be told a story that had sharper edges than any press release. The aunt ran the paper shop and the shop ran the street and the street ran the gossip. The bell over the door did the old-fashioned tinkle that made people remember their school shoes. The back half of the shop smelled of damp paper and printer ink and boiled sweets. Her aunt had once been a beauty and had chosen to become a person. She sat behind the counter with a crossword, a pencil behind her ear, and a ring on her finger that had belonged to a woman who had never forgiven God for anything except the existence of marigolds.

“You look like you’ve been told to tidy the wind,” her aunt said, looking up from a clue about a bird that was also not a bird.

“It’s too organised for wind,” Mara said. “It’s a habit with a hunger. It’s got a satchel and a set of rules.”

“Ah,” said her aunt, as if she had been expecting her to say the word goblin and was pleased she had not. “Picker.”

“Somebody said that.”

“I said that,” her aunt said comfortably, and put the crossword down so it looked untidy. “Years ago we had one by the canal. She liked to pick at people’s little prides. She ate the blue smoke off bad arguments and the sting off spite. She tidied scraps nobody had asked her to. Made hedge animals out of men who’d done nothing worse than mutter. She took a boy’s laces, once, and left him in a park to decide if he wanted to hop home or sit and cry. He hopped home and then he cried and then he stopped letting his father tell him that softness was wicked. The picker hated that.”

“Did you stop her?” Mara asked, because folk tales like to be asked that, and because she needed to know which bit of the script they were on.

“We braided,” said her aunt, as if this would be obvious. “Three women. Three strands. We braided red cotton round the combs in the shop and we made the girls serve tea to the men who came in muttering and we made the men hold saucers. We told stories about the last time and the time before. She doesn’t like people doing things in threes unless she started the count. And we put salt across the thresholds where hair got swept across. We didn’t trap her. We untidied her road.”

“Do I have to believe in it for it to work?” Mara asked, and her aunt smiled with the same crooked quarter-mouth Mara had been born with.

“You have to act like you do while other people are watching,” she said. “It makes them brave. Then they do the work. Then the thing has to go. It’s not magic. It’s manners.”

Her aunt reached under the counter and produced a gold tin that once held treacle and now held treasures. Inside were buttons like little moons and a length of red thread and a comb with one tooth missing. She put the thread in Mara’s hand with the gravity of a doctor giving a prescription. She told her to tie three knots around the comb and to put it where men were deciding what faces should look like. She told her not to hold her breath while she did it. She told her to sing under it if she could manage a tune.

“I can’t sing,” Mara said.

“Then get someone who can,” said her aunt. “Get five. Get the town drunk. Goblins hate it when a chorus ignores them.”

On the constituency office carpet the cleaner had learned to remove the stains that came from cheap coffee and expensive shoes. The plant by the window did not survive July. The intern at the desk, a woman called Poppy who was good at remembering birthdays and bad at saying no to men who pressed their timelines on her, had written her name in green on a rota pinned to cork with a pushpin that had lost its head. She would be the last to leave tonight. She would lock the door and text her flatmates a picture of the poster she had designed for a constituency surgery in which the MP looked like a reliable uncle who had just replaced the brake pads on your Vauxhall. She would walk home up the road that smelled of sugar from the bakery at the bottom and diesel at the top. She would not look behind her because she had learned not to, and that was power until it wasn’t.

Karen slipped in with the evening post. She liked the way a letterbox taught you a town’s jaw. She had seldom found a room so efficient at producing the flavour she liked. The place reeked of exasperation. It carried in its carpet the grit of people who had come in ready to say that things had gone wrong in a way that was not their fault but also absolutely was everyone else’s. She fed. She tasted notes of grievance so fine they might as well have been wine. She touched the photocopier and made it jam with one finger. She did not intend to hurt the girl. She was here for the man’s line. The mask was in her satchel, but she didn’t need it for the warm-up. She took pictures of the MP off the wall with the kindness of a thief who wants you to know you had treasures. She stood in front of the digital calendar on the intern’s screen and read that Thursday morning at eight-thirty the MP would be at a barber in the next constituency for what had been listed by the special adviser with a sarcasm Salem would have applauded as “relatability.” Karen smiled. She did like when people wrote their own invitations.

The home was harder. He had locks that had been paid for out of a budget that had once been intended for a youth club. He had an alarm panel that spoke to itself like a parrot that had learned only one sentence and liked to repeat it at funerals. She liked a challenge even when she resented it; it teased her pride. She made a note of the gardener’s day because a hedge could tell you what house you’d entered by the tidiness of its rump. She went round the back and sat on the lid of the wheely bin like a visiting aunt and stared up at the bedroom window where he slept and had a little bedtime conversation with the security light until it got bored. She left him nothing but a neat line on the cricket-pitch hedge, cut right down the middle with a strip of wire and a length of patience when the gardener arrived, so when he stood at the French doors with his yoghurt and said something congratulatory about discipline to his wife he saw the hedge looking back at him like a split lip. He called the gardener. He said vandalism in a voice that disguised nothing. He went to work with his hair perfect and his boundary insulted.

At lunchtime Adela’s aunt turned up to The Swan with a bag of sheet music that looked like she’d stolen it from a church in 1968. She had a voice that could carry a canoe. She sent a message through a dozen cousins and a few strategically placed Facebook groups that there would be singing on the green shortly after six and that anyone who couldn’t hold a note could at least hold the line. The phrase delighted her. She had the good witch air older women sometimes recklessly acquire when they have survived enough marriages, deaths and student loans to feel equal to goblins. Boys came because girls came, and girls came because older women would clap if they tried, and older women came because they had been told something-monster had been at the church hall and wanted to give it the kind of telling-off that belonged in hymn books.

If you have never watched a town sing to itself without sheet music you have not seen a small, true defense against tidy violence. They sang Frère Jacques because the vowels were forgiving. They sang London’s Burning because a boy shouted it out and found it funny, and then he wasn’t laughing because the round turned into something bigger than him that didn’t require his opinion. They sang a silly song about a frog that had crossed borders to come live in their throats. The lads laughed and then didn’t. The mothers put their hands on the shoulders of sons and nephews. The air warmed. It wasn’t sacred and that was what made it work. Ruby taught a breathing pattern that matched the entry points. You could feel panic looking for a door and finding it shut because there were no straight lines to run down. You could feel whatever lived under the arches come sniffing and tilt its head and consider that circles were boring.

Karen stood on the edge of the green in a dress purloined from a charity shop that wanted to be thought of as vintage and let the sound go around her. The hunger didn’t go away. The blue flame of judgement burned elsewhere that night, quieter, but still real—on comment threads, on sofas where men didn’t like to be told that their boy was not being a credit by being brave, in kitchens where women said that at least it wasn’t knives, as if knives were the baseline. She took what she could. She stepped backwards when Kev, who had taken to walking the length of the cable runs with a torch even when the sun was up, bent to pick up a length of wire that had slackened and would have made a hazard. She had laid it. She hissed between her teeth, childishly. She didn’t see the old woman who watched her with interest and called her, in her head, girl.

Back at the station, Callum watched an ugly WhatsApp group form and name itself like someone spray-painting in a toilet. He had the screenshots because a boy with manners and a messy haircut passed them to Ruby and Ruby passed them on with her mouth set. The group had a premise that pretended to be protection and was about permission. “Clippers Out,” they called it, as if they were a football team and not a plan to put fists on faces. They said they would make patrols. They said they would sit in cars with seats that had not quite recovered from a spilled curry and watch for masks. They said they would handle it. They wanted to be men. They wanted to be heroes. They were, more to the point, bored. He went to their admin and tried to slide in with a persona that had biceps emoji and a genial racism. He did not like himself much for twenty minutes. Ruby texted him a small black heart because it mattered to have a witness. He and Mara had a conversation that was all parentheses about whether to meet the boy who was the loudest in a café or a cell. They decided to invite them to the gym, where Ruby would make them hold planks for the length of a pop song and then ask them to breathe and say what they actually feared.

It should have been a quiet night, therefore. Quiet nights are when something else decides to throw a plate. The something else this time was moustaches. The town had them still, in pockets, men who tended them like window boxes over a premise. They were hedges over words. They meant Dad in one street and Liar in another and Jack in a third. One belonged to the landlord of a pub at the far edge of Markham that sold crisps like communion and insisted on closing early on a Sunday. Another belonged to a man who sold gravestones and whose sensitivity to lettering did not extend to gay teenagers. A third lived on a face that had told a lot of girls as children that they were pretty for their colouring and had meant them to feel grateful. They went to bed with their hedges arranged. They woke with a line of skin through the hair like somebody had made a parting for their mouths. It was not blood. It was the kind of violence that bruised dignity and that worked like a charm made of shame. They came into town with their lips pursed and their wives’ mouths amused. They made appointments. They lamented. They tried not to grin at each other when they caught the look and recognised a joke of which they were the butt. It was petty. It was political. It was glorious and horrid in the same heartbeat.

The letter arrived at the paper shop midmorning and the girl who sorted the envelopes would later tell her boyfriend at three a.m. that the paper had felt cold through its sleeve. It said: MOUTH HEDGES REQUIRE CIVIC PRUNING IF YOU WILL NOT STOP TALKING WITH THEM. I WILL TRIM. The type was cut from the business section this time, posher to look at, as if somebody wanted you to notice the font. The envelope smelled of something that made Mara think of wet tweed and the inside of a drawer where somebody had kept cufflinks they thought their grandchildren would want. She took it to the incident room and put it under the one light that flattered nobody. She considered the rule Karen had drawn for herself and how she had just broken it. She felt the shape of the net change. She did not know whether this was good or bad. She did know that she would have to talk someone older than her out of making a rule about moustaches, and that the conversation was going to be awful and kind of funny.

Luca had three of the moustache men in his shop by tea. He trimmed them into coherence because he respected hair as a language even when it was saying unhelpful things. He told them gently not to make it political. He told them he would not put them on his Instagram because he did not do humiliation, but if they wanted to be examples of resilience he would consider a shot of their chins. He offered them tea. One of them took it with gratitude and then with a small shock of realisation that he was drinking tea made for him by a man he had thought he had nothing to do with and he liked it. Small shifts are still shifts. Adela, in the doorway buying cigarettes for a woman who had given up for six years and decided to be human for a week, watched with a heart as full as a parcel from a shop nobody thought still existed.

The barber visit of the MP the next morning did not go to plan. It had been scheduled in a different town with a barber who did stags on Saturdays and politicians on weekdays. The shop had mirrors that pretended to be honest and a shelf of American hair products that looked like vitamins. The MP arrived with a security man who had once been a cleaner and hadn’t lost the habit of thinking two jobs ahead, and with a smile that had been oiled. Karen had been there since dawn. She had sat behind a pile of towels like a story that didn’t quite work. She had watched the regulars come and go, touching their hair like rosaries. She had fixed the domestic ferocity of the barber’s hands in her mind. She did not try to take the scissors. She didn’t have to. The only thing that mattered was the moment when the MP shut his eyes as the clippers hummed near, that instant of trust and terror. She breathed slowly. She tasted, deep, the little unconfessed hatreds that lived under his collar, the way he had said a line about standards to a boy once in a corridor at school and liked the way it had made the boy smaller. The barber lifted the clippers with the casualness that comes from skill and habit. He did not intend to do anything except what he always did. The first pass of the blade along the neat edge above the ear went clean, and the MP smiled like a man whose face had been reaffirmed. On the second pass the clipper coughed. It coughed in the way a machine does when you have fed it grudges. The line jumped. A pale stripe appeared like a forgotten track. It wasn’t much. It was enough. Everyone saw the moment go wrong at once and pretended not to. The security man tensed. The barber steadied his hand with mortification. The MP smiled harder. Someone laughed in the back. It was involuntary and it was cruel. The laugh did not belong to Karen, though it tasted like her. She left a plait of grey hair, not his, on the till under a ten-pound note. She took nothing anyone could count. She took the dignity the way a draught takes the warmth from between plates of a meal you wanted to stay perfect.

By the afternoon the photo had been everywhere that wanted to be part of everywhere. He had a hat on in it. Men in hats are always trying to control a punchline. The hat didn’t help. The boys did not laugh in front of him because they had been taught not to. They laughed behind him in stairwells. Their laughter did not belong to anyone else and sometimes that is a victory the town wants to claim and cannot.

Mara went out to the arches with the red thread in her pocket and a comb that had belonged to her aunt’s friend and tied three knots on the handle while Adela’s aunt pretended to be one of those women who just happened to be walking by with a loaf of bread. She did not make a speech. She tucked the comb under a brick where the water ran and let the thread show because sometimes you wanted someone to know you believed in fences that weren’t meant to bite. The graffiti had another dot. Whoever was adding them—Adela’s cousin, a stranger with a careful wrist, the town itself—had turned the neat shaved line into something that could not enforce a parting anymore. There was a curve to it now that looked like mischief and like mercy. She held her breath for a second and then remembered not to. The air tasted like rain and like a promise somebody had decided she would have to keep whether she was tired or not.

In the evening she and Callum went to the gym with Ruby and waited for boys who thought they wanted to patrol to turn up and be persuaded that planks were heroism. A few older men came with them, men with moustaches fixed and hats worn lower than yesterday, and found themselves watching their sons hold themselves up and shake and not fall and felt something they did not want to name. When Ruby told them to breathe and say what they feared, one of them said, unexpectedly and without shame, that he feared becoming someone who needed to be told when to be kind. The boy next to him did not laugh. He put his hand flat on the floor and felt the mat beneath it and remembered being five.

Karen had not gone home when she went to the constituency office, and she did not go home after the barber. She walked the town as if it were a small animal she was considering keeping. She took little nibbles. She made a boy mis-key his code at the door to his block by simply being near. She made a woman tut at another woman’s tattoos so that the tut would ferment later. She made the dog at number twenty-four bark when usually he saved his voice for foxes. She left a coil of hair on the handle of a pram and knew that it would be interpreted a dozen ways that would be useful to her. She ran her hand along the railings of the primary school that would be closing because of funding and made the metal ring. She thought about lines painted in playgrounds for hopscotch and the first time a child would be told that the game was not for him. She thought about circles of singing and how you could break them by simply deciding to be funny and loud at the wrong time in a way everyone would forgive if you were beautiful. She weighed her plan for a larger act against the annoyance of a series of small defeats. She had never liked attrition as much as a single perfect cut. She wanted a path. She wanted to draw one down a place nobody would allow to be symmetrical.

The call came to the station just before midnight from a man whose accent would have made a different police officer put him on hold. Callum didn’t. He had learned to stop being proud and start being present. The man said his son had not come home. The son was twenty-two. He had been on one of the WhatsApp patrols. He had told his mother not to wait up and his father to keep his anger for when he got back with a trophy that looked like a story. He had not come back. His phone was off. He did not answer his mates. He did not answer Ruby, who had grown used to getting an answer by trying always once and half as much as necessary. His name was Oak. It was not, but that was what his mother called him, because she had grown him from a small, and she had waited in storms.

Mara stood up at the first syllable and kept standing until the man had said everything he had to say and then sat down carefully like a person who has seen a piece of glass and is considering where to put their foot. She did not call it a pattern because she knew that patterns, once named, carry men. She called it a person. She called Ruby. She called Kev because she would need lights that didn’t make you think of ambulances. She called Adela because she knew that people would need tea. She told Callum to get the last ping and the usual map and the unusual one in his head he liked to draw when he didn’t know what he was drawing. They put their coats on. You pretend to dislike the drama of preparedness and then you lean into it because it holds you up.

The pings were not a surprise and that was the wrong kind of balm. Oak’s phone had gone dark by the river where the arches hold sleep above water. They found his friends by the skate park trying not to look like boys in a cautionary tale. They found scuff marks in a place where scuff marks have the same flavour they always do, and a second set that did not match shoes because not everything that moves leaves a tread. They found a plait pinned to the litter bin with a clean plastic fork. They found two strands of glitter and a length of red thread that had been chewed through, not neatly cut.

The town held itself like a person who cannot decide whether to cry or to run. Karen sat under her arch and could not decide whether to forbid herself the indulgence of gloating. She wasn’t cruel, she had liked to think. She was exact. She was a salve that hurt and then healed. She was a comb. The boy had not looked at her like he was a decision she was allowed to make, and she had disliked that. She had given him a choice and he had made the wrong one. She had moved him. Not far. Far enough that people who loved him would have to speak to each other in a tone they resented, far enough that the town would have to choose whether to say his name tenderly or turn him into an example. She did not intend harm. She did harm because she loved lines. You cannot cut without taking something away. She had told herself this a thousand times. It sounded less like a principle than a sulk now that she had to hold a boy on the other side of a boundary and wonder if she had the appetite to keep him there.

Under the graffiti with the little dotting smile there was a new mark: three short strokes that might have been nothing and were not. They looked like the beginning of tally marks. They looked like someone deciding to count whether you wanted them to or not. They looked like a grandmother’s shorthand on paper you weren’t supposed to see. Mara saw them when she bent to smooth a hand over the damp. She put her palm flat under the paint and said hello, quietly, to the thing that had been here longer than the railway and would be here after the town had rearranged itself into a different name. Then she stood up and told the river that whatever it had been told to keep, it could let go.

They found Oak by dawn, three arches down and a foot up from the waterline on a ledge where boys had been hiding cigarettes from their fathers since the nineteenth century. He was sitting like a penitent, as if he had been asked to confess to a sin he didn’t know how to articulate. His hair had not been touched. His hands had been folded, and something had been tied across his wrists in a thin flex of wire and hair. It had been neat. It had not been tight. He had not struggled. His face had the look of someone who had been given a riddle and had decided in the end that there was no shame in only knowing part of the answer. He was not dead. He was cold in a way that would get into his bones later and make him ache for years when it rained. He could not find, right away, the words to describe the voice that had told him he was a good boy and needed to sit tidily and learn. He could not find, for a while, the courage to admit that he had been grateful when the voice hid his phone in a place his mates would not find until it was time to be found.

Mara untied his wrists and put the hair rope in a bag and wanted to put it in a fire and wanted to put it on her desk and wanted to put it around the throat of a lie. Ruby put her hands under Oak’s arms and made him stand and then made him move and then made him tell her his mother’s middle name and then made him drink, and then she said, with a softness she did not use for boys who hadn’t tried, that he had done very well and that she would tell his mother so. Callum held back the men who thought shouting was a method of affection and the women who thought sobbing in his neck would be the right pitch for forgiveness. Adela held a flask that had already warmed three hands. Kev did something off to the side with a wrench that had no function except to make a noise men recognise as care.

Karen watched them do their work and felt, for the length of a swallow, boredom. She had made a line. They had made a circle around it. The circle had held. She would have to be more interesting if she wanted to get fed. The idea disgusted her. It was vanity to be interesting. She wanted order. She wanted the neatness of the old ways where you drew a line through a boy’s hair and told him that this was history and he believed you and went home and did violence to a mirror. The town was being difficult. It would be easier to pick another one. She could go where the viaducts were older and the listeners less practiced. She could be called something nicer. She could sleep in a churchyard and make the bells ring out of tune. She did not move. She had a story here now. She had a face painted on a wall that irritated her. She had a woman who said no better than a mother says eat. She had a barmaid who kept appearing at the end of her eyesight like a conscience in eyeliner. She had a barber she begrudged admiring. She had a boy who had given his hand and not cried. She would not run. She would do the neatness she had planned. She would pick a hedge that people thought wasn’t one.

At breakfast, the MP’s wife took scissors out of the kitchen drawer and cut his eyebrows. It was a small domestic mercy and a habit they had that nobody knew about. She had done it for years because he could not bear the tickle of the hair when it overgrew its right place. She did it with a competence that had nothing to do with love. She trimmed them neatly. She did the right one and then she did the left and then she saw, as she rocked the blades, that there was a line of bare skin through the left where hair had not grown. She had not cut it. She hadn’t made that gap. She leaned in and squinted. She put her finger out and touched the line and felt the way you feel the smooth of a scar in a mouth. She said nothing because she had learned a long time ago that silence is sometimes the only tool left in a marriage that avoids breaking the furniture. He looked at himself and did not notice because he preferred to see only the lines he had drawn.

By midweek the posters for the Standards Rally had gone up because nothing stops a politician like humiliation; it doubles him. He had called it something else officially—Community Conversation—but the brand was clear in the font. There would be a stage. There would be rows of chairs unless Miranda arrived like a wrecking ball with bunting. There would be microphones. There would be men in shirts clapping at sentences that felt carved in oak and were in fact pressed out of newer material. There would be boys watching to see how their faces looked when men spoke them. There would be a chance to draw a line that would split a room clean and let something bad pour down it like water in a gutter.

Mara and Callum stood in the empty hall the afternoon before and walked the aisles as if they were inspectors of an invisible parade. They had the red thread around a comb tucked in the leg of the stage in a way that would make an old woman smile and a man sneer. They had asked the sound man for a loop of ambient noise that smoothed the frequencies that make human voices go hard, and the sound man had liked the science and pretended it was for feedback. They had Ruby in the back row with five of her lads who had learned that sitting still and breathing can be an action. They had Adela’s aunt ready with a round if the air turned ugly. They had Kev on the isolators with locks on the locks. They had backup. They did not have control because that is a thing you never have in a room full of men who think the microphone owes them something. They had a plan, which is often no more than a way of asking the world to be a partner.

Under the arches, Karen sharpened her scissors though she knew she would not need them for what she intended; the act of sharpening calmed her. She oiled the clippers though she preferred the hum to be flawless. She put her mask on and took it off and put it on and took it off the way a woman trying on furs in a mirror will practice her disdain. She whispered to the town’s opinions and promised them she would make something out of their waste product, something men would pretend not to enjoy. She rehearsed her entrance and then decided she wouldn’t make one. She would not step onto the stage. She would not touch a hair on a head. She would stand at the end of an aisle and breathe very slowly and watch the line draw itself. She would do the neatness with her hands by her side.

In the shop, Mara’s aunt looked over a crossword clue and smiled because it had finally come up: seven letters, old story, problem that sits under bridges and asks questions. She wrote GOBLIN with a flippant satisfaction that would have annoyed it. She looked up as a woman in a cardigan in her forties came in with a little boy whose fringe needed attention. The woman asked for string. The aunt gave her red and did not charge. The boy put his hand in the bowl of penny sweets and then took it out when he saw the look he got. He said sorry in the way of a child who has learned it can be a gift as well as an avoidance. The aunt reached under the counter and took out the treacle tin to put away the spare comb. She did not know that the comb had already done something useful, only that the weight of the tin felt right in her hands. Outside, the town flexed its shoulders like a boxer rolling into the ring. Inside, the kettle boiled. In the arches, the graffiti had acquired a tiny crescent line under the dots like a mouth that knew something it shouldn’t and could not wait to tell.Chapter 8

The hall had been ironed. The floor shone with that civic gleam that looks like good intentions melted and poured thin. Chairs in rows stood like obedient teeth. The stage wore a black skirt that pretended it had a waist. It was a room designed to make a sentence go in a straight line from a mouth to a clapping, and there had been decades where that seemed like enough. Mara walked the middle aisle once and then again, feeling the way the space proposed behaviour, the way a threshold proposes a bow. Her shoes made small, unforgiving sounds. The loop of ambient noise she’d begged from the sound man breathed with the patience of an aquarium; it caught the hard edges of frequencies and filed them down like a nail. The red thread around the old comb was tucked into the rib of the stage leg where a small draught gathered, and the thread lifted and settled as if it knew a tide.

Miranda had fought until she saw she would lose most of the rows if she tried to impose circles. She had compromised like a magician who agrees to use someone else’s hat. The middle was still an aisle, because aisles come with microphones the way churches come with kneeling. But she had made the rows curve at the ends so that the back corners turned in and touched one another like neighbours gossiping over bins. She had put the cake stall near the doors so nobody could storm out without squashing a sponge. She had quietly told the committee men who liked to call themselves dray horses where to sit so that their bulk would block a run.

The MP sent an aide to sniff the room. The aide wore a grin you couldn’t polish and looked down the hall as if counting heads for a cull. He sent a text that read, in the language of those who think they’ve invented civility: friendly. He hadn’t noticed Adela’s aunt, who was sitting three rows from the back with a knitting bag that contained no knitting and a voice that carried like carbonation. He hadn’t seen Ruby stand, breathe, sit, breathe, and show five lads by stealth the tempo their bodies could borrow. He hadn’t seen Kev on one knee beside a cupboard that looked like a good God had been asked to design a fuse box and refused five times before he relented and made it idiot-proof. He hadn’t seen Callum mark the exits and the men with hands itching to authority. He hadn’t seen the comb, or if he had, his eyes had done that human mercy where they turn ritual into litter.

Karen left the arches before the pigeons could look critical. She put on the coat she’d decided meant she was someone you let past. It was a council worker’s parka with a ward’s name on the breast that wasn’t this one; wearing it was like using a stranger’s nickname. She did not bring the clippers because machines sometimes boss you about with their hum. She brought the scissors for comfort and the rope because she liked to know she could ruin something honest in a heartbeat and then not bother. She did not plan an entrance. The plan was in the room itself. She would stand where the aisle pulled red through like a thread through skin. She would breathe so that the breath met other breath in the wrong places. She would say no words because the words would be supplied by the house band of men who think the microphone lives for them. She had washed her hair and pressed it flat. It lay like the lie of patience.

The first to arrive were the men who liked to sit in the front because they had learned in school that teachers reward keeners with eye contact. They placed their hats on their knees and let their gazes be stern in a way they would describe later as engaged. Then came the men who prefer to hold up the wall because a wall will not ask if they are having a nice night. They smelled of aftershave bought with nostalgia. They had moustaches that had been recently made whole. Their wives came, because wives always do when democracy is being arranged like cutlery. A handful of girls who had followed Ruby because she had told them not to leave boys alone in rooms with microphones came and sat together with arms entwined like roots. Boys peeled off the back like crows pretending they were only passing.

Mara was not going to take the microphone. She had promised herself that, and the promise felt like an act of humility that had cost her somewhere soft. She stood near enough to the stage to get there in a stride and far enough not to make the MP think she meant to share his light. She watched the end of the aisle where the door opened and closed and opened and closed with the rhythm of a mouth that needed to tell a story. When Karen came in she didn’t look at the stage. She looked at the chairs like a butcher looks at a carcass he knows bone by bone. She took the aisle and stood at the back of it and breathed. It was a calm breath, the kind you learn in cold houses where making your heart slow means your hands stay steady. The chair legs vibrated a millimetre. Nobody without the habit of noticing would have known.

The MP walked in like a curtain. He had the good suit and the tie that made him look soberly festive and the expression of a man who has been told that humility photographs beautifully. He took the stage and took the microphone and thanked everyone for coming. He did the condolences properly for the things the room carried, the petty and the mortal, because he was well-trained. He said he had been listening already, and Mara’s mouth twitched because the last thing she would accuse him of was good ears. He said standards. He said community. He said it as if those were coats already in the cupboard and he was just asking everyone to put them on. The lines in his speech ran straight and kept their feet together. He had used scissors on any clause that dared turn around.

Karen listened for the first hard consonants and found them. She breathed into them and heard them sharpen. She breathed on soft syllables and made them stick to teeth. She liked the way sound could be parted like hair. Nobody gives you credit for working with air. She smiled under her calm, because she knew that you can set a room like a pudding and all it needs to turn is a cool draught where someone else is warm. She felt the aisle behave like a spine.

At the back, Adela’s aunt raised her eyebrows and put two fingers on her throat as if checking a pulse. She heard what Mara had asked the sound man to do and approved in the ancient way of a woman who knows that surviving choirs are mostly in the preparation. She whispered in a pitch that goes like thread under noise to the girls behind her and they smiled because they were going to be naughty with permission. Ruby looked at Mara and Mara looked at Ruby and the look said: on your count.

It didn’t go wrong all at once. It usually doesn’t. It started with a question from a man who wanted to ask why we can’t say what we used to say and still be thought good. He expected the room to cheer him and condemn him for his daring simultaneously. It did both, which is the town’s knack and the thing that will complicate gods for years. Then there was the boy who had laughed at the hat on the radio and had told himself on the walk here that he was going to sit on his hands and be a citizen, a word he had never tried on. He had prepared his silence and it looked handsome on him. When he heard someone say discipline twice in quick succession the silence cracked and a bit of laughter fell out. It wasn’t kind laughter and it wasn’t unkind. It was a relief. It ran down the aisle like water and came back with a current.

Karen breathed in time with the laughter, not joining it because she does not share. She was not interested in jokes; she found them inefficient. She wanted the water to cut a channel. She wanted this to be the moment where the men in the shirts looked at the boys and the boys looked at the men and both decided they were not the same and had never been. She thought she could make that with breath and posture and the smallest tilt of a head that said choose. She felt the comb under the stage stir as if hair had met its enemy and remembered the manners that come when someone shows you a boundary that is there out of love.

Mara saw it go thin. There is a point in a meeting when the air acquires corners you can injure your fingers on. She put her hand up and made a small sign to the sound man, who thought she wanted more volume and glanced behind to ask which channel. She shook her head. She put two fingers to her own throat the way Adela’s aunt had and nodded once. The sound man, who had a daughter he loved more than his own breath and had learned since she was born to pay attention to women’s hands, slid up the loop’s gentle breaths so that they wrapped around the microphone like knit. The hard consonants fuzzed. The sibilants lost their teeth. The mic stopped behaving like a razor and acted like a spoon.

Adela’s aunt began. She did not stand, because she did not come here to be a marker. She sang the first line of London’s Burning like a joke told in a room that might forgive you, and the girls behind her sang the next and the boys who had not been children long enough ago for that song to be anything but something a teacher had used to get them to share their voices with one another joined because they remembered muscle, if not melody. The men who would have liked not to join discovered it looked churlish to stay silent when the woman next to them had a grin like cake. They joined like men who are proud of their lack of talent. The MP, skilful at arranging his face, laughed into the microphone and said into it, hands lifted in a fair play gesture, that he had always had a dreadful voice. The line where Karen stood faltered.

She hated singing for exactly this reason. It is too easy to pretend that roundness is a virtue. It makes a circle out of a club and lets those who don’t belong believe they might. It was cheap solidarity and it made her itch. She breathed counter to the beat, which is an old witch’s trick and a good one, and a few voices slipped and came back because something in their chests said no and something else said yes and they found a third way called both. The aunt took them into Frère Jacques because in English mouths it tastes like a treat, and she dragged the tempo just enough that the breath didn’t break. Ruby clapped four and two so softly you couldn’t hear it but you felt held. The vicar came late and sang badly with real forgiveness for himself and looked across the hall to where Mara stood and nodded as if they had both learned the same lesson some years apart.

At the edge of the aisle, a lad from the Clippers Out group, his phone lit in his hand like a small deliberate star, began to film because he could see likes accumulating in his future. The phone’s microphone would have picked up the sharpened words and made them viral. It picked up singing instead, which is always hard to upload without looking like your mother. He paused and frowned and found he was humming. The men by the wall forgot to look like stone. The comb under the stage did nothing other than lie where it had been put with three knots and be a promise that if anyone came to reorganise faces without consent, a small stupid bit of plastic would object with all its might.

When a room decides not to do what it was built for, it changes the wallpaper. The beige went warm. People put their bodies not quite where the architect had allocated them. Children scuttled into new places and made parents move to see. The aisle was less a line than a suggestion. Karen could have made a scene then. She could have done the old trick where she breathed and every hair on the arms of the front row lifted as if embarrassed to be there. She could have reached into a pocket of the room and flipped whatever switch makes a man become an audience for himself. She did not, because the minute had stopped being entertained by her and that, for creatures like her, is both insult and emptying. She left and nobody saw her leave because nobody had named her when she walked in, and this is a lesson she meant never to forgive them for teaching her.

The MP went on saying what he had come to say, though the shape of it had loosened. He allowed a question from a father who had almost lost a boy to neatness disguised as safety and heard in the man’s voice the wobble that says I loved him before he tidied himself for you. He answered in a way that avoided words like blame and put in words like collaborate, and it was fine in the sense that a sandwich is fine when you thought you might get soup. He ended with standards again and this time it sounded more like a request than a reprimand. People clapped. The clapping had an aftertaste of choir. Ruby let her lads go first to the doors and watched them move through the narrow, impatient spaces where elbows believe in their own rights. Adela’s aunt went to the cake table and took a slice with a cherry and ate it like somebody who had earned sugar and laughter.

Back under the viaduct the graffiti had acquired three tally scratches by morning and a small fan of pale paint that might have been a handkerchief or a wing. It was hard to tell in the half-dry. Someone had put a sticker near the eye that said in tidy print BE KIND and someone else had drawn horns on the sticker and the horns had been peeled off by a third hand with no patience for obviousness. The place smelled of wet brick and the kind of ambition that turns into schemes in young men’s pockets. Karen sat with her back to the wall and held the rope she had made as if it were a rosary and she had suffered a loss she could neither explain nor justify.

She had imagined taking on a town as making all the faces look sideways at once. She had imagined a line so good they would thank her and call the neatness clarity. She was finding instead that they were movable in the wrong places, resistant in the places where lines are supposed to glide. She had to admit, because she was vain in this one admirable way, that it interested her. Boredom had nibbled. Interest is the antidote that kills and cures slowly.

She wrote her next letter with a fountain pen she had stolen from an old man in a library in 1952 because men who love old nibs will forgive goblins anything if the ink is black and the nib does not scratch. She cut nothing out this time. She wrote her own hand, which was small and patient, and the words sat in lines like boys she would ruin tenderly if she could. She wrote: WHEN YOU MAKE A SONG I EAT THE SILENCE BETWEEN THE NOTES. WHEN YOU MAKE A LINE I DRINK THE SPACE BETWEEN YOU. WHEN YOU PRETEND THE AISLE ISN’T THERE I REMEMBER. I WILL TAKE YOUR STANDARDS BY THE HAIR AND WALK THEM INTO THE RIVER FOR A WASH. SHE SIGNED NOTHING, BECAUSE SHE HAD NO SIGNATURE THAT BELONGED IN A POSTMARK. She delivered it herself, tucking it under the shop bell so that it rang as if a small polite ghost had come for crisps.

In The Swan, the landlord took off his apron and rubbed the line around his waist where the towel lived and said to Adela, with a care he did not grant most days, that the lads had been decent tonight. He said he had heard singing through the open window of his flat with the kind of conviction you reserve for miracles. He said he had thought himself an old man and therefore exempt and had found his mouth shaping words for the laugh of it. Adela told him that his mouth was a hedge he had learned to trim. He opened a bottle of lemonade for a kid who would usually be told he was too old for lemonade and watched the bubbles with a man’s satisfaction at effervescence.

Callum dreamt of aisles. He walked up one in a courthouse in a suit that didn’t belong to him and down one in a church and then down another into a hall that kept asking him to choose left or right and he woke up with his hand in the shape of a comb and a thin line on his palm where a thread had pressed when he had held a silly piece of plastic under a very serious stage. He sent a text to Ruby that said: planks tomorrow; she sent back: singing tomorrow; he sent: both. They went to work with the ease of people who are not, in fact, easy but have agreed to pretend.

Oak sat in Ruby’s doorway until she opened it because he didn’t know what else to do. He had slept but not all the way through. He had dreamed of benches and sentences and a small voice telling him he was very good and asking him to fold his hands into a shape that meant apology even though he had nothing to be sorry for. He had a mark on his wrist where the rope had laid and it looked neat and it offended him. Ruby made him coffee that tasted like someone meant well and told him to swear a little into the steam to start the day. He did and it left his mouth cleaner. He said he had wanted to hit someone and had not. She said she would give him something heavy to pick up and put down until the itching in his bones turned back into sweat.

The MP’s office, which had never previously smelt of wet river, smelt of it when Mara opened the letter there and knew, with the equipose that comes with certain kinds of terror, that her opponent had decided to write her a poem and that this was somehow funnier than it was threatening. She let her anger live alongside her laughter without trying to tidy the one into the other. She understood that this was what the town had to learn, and she did not like what it asked of tired people to carry two truths at once. She pinned the letter in the incident room and wrote on a post-it: air, aisles, mouths, music. Callum added, under it: hedges.

She took a walk to Luca’s, because when the world asked her to file its absurdity she liked to submit the document to a pair of hands that still believed in the honesty of shears. Luca had a man in the chair whose hair was unapologetic and had been punished for it for years and who had at last decided that he would like it shaped by kindness at least once. Luca had him by the ear the way good barbers do when they are telling you, by touch, that you have nothing to be afraid of and also you will not move until I have finished doing something beautiful to you. Mara sat on the bench and let herself be uninteresting. He finished and the man in the chair looked at himself and startled like a rabbit, and then steadied like a man. He stood and said, “Cheers,” in a voice small with gratitude. Luca charged him less than he would have charged another man, and then told him not to tell anyone that, because the hairs on the back of the town’s neck would stand up and he had not the patience for an influx of men who wanted to be both customers and causes.

Karen watched them from across the street with a feeling that, if she had known the word for it, would have been jealousy. She would never say it aloud. She did not want what Luca had. She wanted power that didn’t require faces to look at themselves kindly. But there was a sting in her, sharp as a hair under a shirt, that resented how craft could turn harm into design. She went away and kicked a bin. The bin didn’t deserve it and did not mind.

In the evening, the river put silver up on its back like a dog rolling for pleasure. The arches took the lights of the passing train and laid them out on the water like a comb being tapped against a glass at a wedding. The old men who sit by habit in places where they can see boys being boys took the less-favoured bench because teenagers had claimed the favourite and made it theirs with sound. The waitress from the café next to the station chose to walk under the arches rather than round because she wanted to hear the echo of her boots, and she did and felt larger than her day. The graffiti smile got an extra curve where a child had been lifted up and had contributed a daub in pink nail varnish without asking permission. The town was not healed. It had not expelled its goblin. It had not even made up its mind. But it had given itself a new boundary in music, and that is one fence that tends to grow a hedge rather than a wall if watered.

Karen went home to the crack in the brick that was not small enough for comfort and laid her rope in her lap and thought about hairlines, coastlines, power lines and lifelines. She thought of her name and tried it in her mouth and liked the way the K sat. She told herself, sternly, that she did not care about admiration. She cared about obedience. The town would give her that yet. It always did. People in groups are more tidy than they know. They like lanes. They like someone telling them this is not for you. She would find the next place where a straight line had been drawn and improve it. She giggled, unexpectedly and against her own wishes, at the memory of the MP’s eyebrow in the mirror, the way a tiny blank in a hedge had made a story. She thought of the comb. She thought, scornfully, of knots. She slept badly and dreamed of girls with plaits holding their own hair down with small sticky hands.

Mara went to The Swan and sat in the corner where the pictures of swans with arms couldn’t quite keep their eyes on her because the light bent, and she let her shoulders drop so that the jacket knew to relax. Adela put a glass of water in front of her like a benediction and said nothing because sometimes the best thing to pour is a silence you can drink. The two women sat and watched their town do its favourite trick: remain itself and alter an inch. The whole place smelled of buns that had been marked out of ten and of rain that had decided to hold off. The news in the corner talked about London like London was a neat haircut. A man at the bar told another that he’d had the best trim of his life and the other said yes as if he had too even if he had not. A girl in a denim jacket said she’d never known you could sing those songs not to wind teachers up but to make boys nicer, and an older woman beside her said of course you can, you make the tune your own and then the lads remember who raised them.

The rally made no headlines beyond the ones it earned on people’s tongues. The letter sat under a pin. The comb stayed under the stage leg until Miranda insisted on a sweep and it fell into her palm and she tied the red thread around her wrist because she had learned, unexpectedly late in life, to accept charms from girls. The MP made a post with a photograph in which he looked as if he had always been musical and smiled at boys. Someone caught him sideways and uploaded it with a caption about partings. The comments were briefly kind and then returned to their habit of hardening. The river kept on. The arches listened with their deep bricky patience. It was not over. It was not even in the middle. But for a day the town looked like something Karen would have called messy and somebody else might have called alive, and for a few hours that was enough to keep certain monsters hungry and certain men too, and in the gap between those hungers there was tea.Chapter 10

By Tuesday the town had worn the rally like a new cardigan for a day and then shrugged it into a shape that fit its shoulders. The men who had sung were embarrassed in ways that worked for them; their mouths kept wanting to recount the song and then folding around an anecdote about the cakes instead. The boys who had sat on their hands and not heckled discovered that self-control could be traded, for a while, for little nods from older women in shops. The MP had found his angle and moved on. The arches kept their record of dots and curves. It was the sort of lull that makes people think they are safe and makes other things get hungry.

Adela heard it first, because she always did: the anxiety disguised as logistics. Two mums at the bar mid-morning told each other with powerless briskness that the secondary had sent a letter: Uniform and Appearance Day, Thursday, photographs to be taken during form time, “standards to be upheld.” The word upheld did the work of a ruler whacked on a desk. One mother made a face and said her lad had let his hair grow past his collar on purpose, he’d said it was because of a singer and she suspected it was because of delight. The other said her boy had shaved lines into his head in a way that made him look like a flock of birds in flight and a maths teacher had confiscated his freedom. They said it like jokes, because they were English, and then one of them put her hand flat on the bar as if to keep the table from tipping and looked at Adela with the kind of appeal you make to a woman who has a bouncer’s heart and a saint’s stamina.

Mara had the headteacher on her list already. She had liked Ms Dente at the primary when she’d barked rounds into children until they became a choir without telling them they were doing art. The secondary had a head called Conlan, a man who had learned his kindest voice for assemblies in front of boys who pretended not to need kindness. He kept his ties in navy and his discipline in a drawer labeled “consistency” which made his secretary want to bite the edge of her mug. He let Mara into his office because he had read the rally in the papers and decided he would be seen to be collaborating with the police. He told her he didn’t want trouble. He did not say he didn’t want boys crying in toilets because he did not allow himself that register.

“Photograph day is not compulsory,” he said, in a tone that suggested it was compulsory for anyone he imagined might become president of the universe. “But we encourage participation. There will be rules about hair. I think it’s only fair.”

“Fairness and hair make a knot,” Mara said gently. “If a boy refuses to have his hair touched, will he be allowed to stand exactly as he is?”

“Nobody is touching,” he said, and meant himself, and had forgotten teachers, and had not thought of a hand that wasn’t human.

“Cables,” she said. “Seating. Lines on the floor. Who’s your photographer?”

He looked blank in the way of a man who has come to believe that the world arrives in his spaces prearranged by someone else’s worry. He found the booking confirmation. It named a man called Guy, who took pictures of rugby teams and prefects and captured the exact moment a boy who had hated himself for three years allowed an eyebrow to lift into pride. Guy brought a chair, a grey cloth, stands like spindly deer, and a comb nobody ever saw him use, which lived in his pocket like a superstition he pretended was professional.

“Stagger them,” Mara said. “Don’t make a corridor. Put the chair on a diagonal. Make them walk in from the wrong side. Don’t write their names on lists in capital letters that they can see. If you make a machine, something will run on it. If you make a muddle that is care, it’s harder to misuse.”

Conlan disliked muddles. He disliked care that looked like mess. He liked boxes ticked. He had had a year without boxes. He looked at this woman with a tiredness he had taught himself not to show because boys can smell exhaustion and eat it. He adjusted his tie and said, “Fine. But I’ll have no theatrics. I’ll have no singing. This is not a festival.”

Mara smiled in exactly the way that made barristers fold their papers and judges send their clerks for water. “I’m not bringing a band,” she said. “I’m bringing tape.”

Callum took the practicals because it soothed him. He went with the site manager to the hall and put his palm on the floor the way Kev did to engines. He drew the chair’s line at forty degrees and watched the way doors now cut not towards it but past, as if the room had decided to be obstructive. He checked sockets. He kept a mental list of door handles that stuck, a record of thresholds that made you lift your feet. He looked at Guy’s kit when it arrived in a van whose tyres sang a little at thirty and discovered a man with the kind of hands you forgive anything because they do good work. Guy was polite in that way tradesmen have when they know their skill outranks your badge. He let Callum lay his cables like laylines and let him tape the legs of tripods as if the legs had asked to be in handcuffs.

“It will be slow,” Guy said, with regret. “They’ll get bored. They’ll take the mick.”

“If it’s slow,” Callum said, “we’re doing it right.”

Under the arches, Karen, who had once watched a portrait painter in 1783 move a boy’s ear with his thumb as if he could slide flesh along a skull to better accommodate beauty, breathed in the news of photograph day and felt the old song begin. You set a chair. You say chin. You say straighten. You say ears. You say neat. It was the liturgy of her favourite faith. In studios with glass roofs and powdered sunlight she had learned to love the precise violence of framing. She had combed boys with air when their mothers weren’t looking. She had pinned back strands with words. She had made lines with a breath. She could do this with her eyes shut. She did not plan it. She did not need to. The room itself would pull for her.

She smiled under her coat at the thought of a comb on a string. She oiled the blades she knew she wouldn’t show and polished the mask she might not use because sometimes the promise of a miracle made people behave, and sometimes letting the miracle fail was how you made them need another. She walked the town and ate its little anticipations: the head of maths straightening his tie in a reflection as he passed a darkened window, a girl licking a finger and trying to tame a fringe, a boy with hair like water telling himself out loud that he didn’t care.

The graffiti had grown the mouth further by then, a sliver under the dots that was almost a smile and almost a scar. A child had smudged it with a thumb and left a dimple you would only see if you wanted to love it. Somebody had written in a hand that might have belonged to a teacher or a murderer: NOBODY OWNS YOUR FOREHEAD. Somebody else had put a sticker of a comb with a crown. Karen hissed because she did not like to be mocked and she did not like crowns that had not been earned.

On Thursday morning the sky remembered to be grey. The hall smelled of dust that had been woken early and polish that wanted to be believed in. The chair was at a strange angle that would irritate men for whom straightness is comfort. The headteacher had not authorised singing, but Ms Dente, who had been invited by the PTA to “help with shepherding” and had turned up out of mischief, stood by the emergency exit with a box of stickers and the lungs of a forge. She was here for the little ones—the Year Sevens who were still learning which corners of their bodies belonged to them. The older ones came in in groups of two and six and ten, tried to be taller than each other and pretended not to care.

Luca had come because he had lost a fight he had not tried hard to win with his conscience. He sat on the low radiator and tore strips of tissue into flowers. If a boy flinched when Guy reached for a shoulder to rotate him to face a little left, Luca stepped forward with something idiotic. He put the tissue flower behind the boy’s ear and said, “Now you have something to remove with great contempt before your mates see,” and he removed it with theatre, and the boy laughed into his chest where nobody could hear how the laughter had nearly been a sob. Ruby moved on the edges putting boys into lines that curved and then broke like schools of fish. Callum leaned on a door frame and learned the names of three teachers whose eyes had learned the same habit as his, and he admired them and did not say so because admiration is a currency that should be spent carefully.

Karen came in wearing a lanyard that had seen better days and had not belonged to her. She had found it in a charity shop on a pinboard labelled “Office Bits” and had known it for the passport it was. She let nobody see her and saw everything. Guy’s chair at a diagonal offended her in its brilliance and she admitted it. The messy queue tasted wrong. The taped-down cables tasted like Kev. She could smell the comb under the stage, thread and all, and she rolled her shoulders against the itch of it. She moved her breath the way you move a candle in a draught and watched hairs lift and lie. She did not want to hurt. She wanted to tidy. She wanted to demonstrate how much better it would be if the world would stand still. It refused, stubborn as young.

A lad called Finn, whose hair had been called all sorts of words mostly untrue and always unkind, walked to the chair with the kind of dignity that belongs to someone who has had to build it from the floorboards. He sat the way Luca had taught a dozen boys the week before: as if the chair belonged to him and not to the man with the camera. He turned his face to the light. The breath on the back of his neck felt like damp wool with a will. He stiffened. He did not flinch. Karen leaned, invisible, and placed two fingers’ worth of will on the spot where boys are told their skinniness is a failure and their softness an invitation. He felt it. He breathed like Ruby had told him to, and it did something to Karen she did not like. His breath made a circle where she had meant a line.

Somewhere in the back, one of the Clippers Out boys had come with the plan to catch a mask and be applauded. He had snuck a pair of kitchen scissors into his hoodie because he wanted to be useful and had not learned, yet, that wanting to be useful and being helpful are such different careers. He stood near a fire door and told himself a story wherein he saved a kid and was forgiven for a dozen small idioties by one grand, ugly act. Ruby saw him because she knew the shape of boys who wanted to be more than yes. She put a hand on the back of his neck, very gently, and said, “Come here,” and he came because the part of him that was tired wanted to.

Karen breathed along the aisle again and found it did not want to act like a runway. It wanted to be a river. The loop of soundness that had wrapped the rally was absent here, but she could feel a different kind of knit, a low hum where a hundred small kindnesses were happening as if by accident. Ms Dente started humming under her breath, a line without words that might once have been a lullaby. Boys smiled for the camera because they had been told to and then they smiled because Luca made a noise with his throat that made everyone want to look handsome in their mother’s kitchen. Guy clicked and clicked and hated the diagonal and loved it because it made the noses he’d been taught to be careful about look fine.

She tried to make the lights buzz. It had always been easy in halls like this: a whisper to the filament and the little betrayals begin, a flicker that makes a child uncertain and a parent impatient. Kev’s tape did its other job and the tape’s job is always to pretend it isn’t more important than the thing it holds. The hum stayed friendly. She tried a trick her mother had taught her when candlelight was still an innovation and people dressed up to be painted: she breathed across boys’ foreheads to make them frown and prepare their faces for instruction. The frown didn’t stick because boys kept being told jokes at the edge of their ears and boys are careless with joy; they will drop their guard to pick it up.

When it came, the failure was small enough to be almost petty and therefore perfect. A teacher—Conlan himself, breaking his own rule and liking it—straightened a lad’s collar with two fingers and said, “Let’s see that head,” and the breath on the lad’s neck got greedy in Karen’s chest. The boy, who had been told since September to stop hiding behind his fringe and had told a mirror that he liked his face when he could choose where to put it, said, very clearly and with a politeness he’d been taught, “No, thank you.” It was the sort of no that would ordinarily embolden whatever was about to make it a lesson. It did not. Conlan blinked. He took his hand away. He said, “All right,” and sounded like a man apologising to a plant as he moved it to where it would get more light. It was tiny. It unhooked something. The little refusal made a map for the rest.

Karen had a rope in her satchel. She could have thrown it and jerked a cable, made a stand stumble, pulled a light off its clip, made a noise that would become a tale. She would hurt nobody. She would shame them into order. She would make a moment that would call for rules. She did not move. The room had decided to be kind and she was not yet sure how to eat that.

She left a message instead. She liked letters. She would have liked them better if they could sharpen on their own. She bought a school photo with coins taken from a man who had not deserved all of his change when he got off the bus and wrote behind it in an old hand with a fountain pen a sentence like the straightest parting: YOUR NEATNESS IS A ROUNDABOUT, AND I WILL BREAK ITS ROAD SIGNS. She tucked it between the pages of Conlan’s diary under the word detentions and underlined nothing. She walked out, passing Ms Dente’s stickers, one of which was a little comb crowned, and she pressed it down with a fingernail that had cleaned itself on river water and ruin.

Mara found the letter before lunch because Conlan had a habit of showing her everything that made him feel like a head. She did not flinch. She took it in and put it with the other sentences that had been cut and pasted, then written neatly, and now carried ink that would dry like instructions on a blueprint. She did not love the mention of roundabouts. She understood that roads with no signage become games for men who believe in tests.

“Are you going to cancel the rest?” Conlan said, already tired and willing to be told to be brave.

“No,” she said. “We’re going to feed them. Bring the Year Sevens sandwiches in the hall. Make the queue a circle and the circle a muddle. Tell them the chairs have to move because the light demands it. Make it all inconvenient and generous.”

“You make chaos sound like policy,” he said, with sour admiration.

“It is,” she said. “And it’s cheaper than repairs.”

After, outside by the bins where older teachers smoke as if they had been told they cannot die if they do it deferentially, Callum admitted it: the diagonal had worked on his own bones. He told Mara he had thought he would hate it and that he had spent an hour liking it in a way he would not mention to his father. He had, in the middle of it, delivered a single firm sentence to a man who wanted to make a boy remove a hat and had found himself saying, “That is not the harm that needs doing today,” and the man had nodded as if told to sit by a dog who may or may not bite. He pulled a sticker with a comb off his sleeve and stuck it to his notebook and pretended it was there because his niece would like it. Mara let him pretend.

Karen, denied the neatness she had wanted, went hunting for a better shape. She was not faithful to plans; she was faithful to appetites. She walked the streets looking for a corridor a town could not make into a circle. She looked at roads and they were too easy. She looked at queues and they kept knotting into conversations. She looked at the line outside the chip shop and thought about cutting a neat trench down the vinegar smell. It did not satisfy. She did not want to be petty in ways the town liked. She wanted to be the line under a sentence that makes a judge’s mouth turn down. She looked at The Swan and at the notice board where Adela had put a card with black writing: Wedding on Saturday. She put her hand on it and behaved, for a second, like an animal sniffing a boundary. Weddings were rich in straightness. You put two at the front and told the rest to face. You put the hair up and you laid it flat. You drew an aisle and you made the holiness run along it like electricity.

She sat on the step and let the word wedding go into her like bread. She closed her eyes. Once, when you called her a name with a K in it in a village where the only ribbon belonged to the squire’s daughters, all the neatness of the season had been contained in the one day when boys were told to tuck in shirts and girls were told to bind their hair because photographs would be taken by a man with smoke on a string. She had seen the power there. She had cut laces of a groom who thought he owned every knot in the village. He had stumbled in the aisle and laughed and been kinder for a year and then worse. She loved how a vow could be polished until it reflected nothing but the polisher. She would go to the wedding. She would take a tiny, exquisite thing and tweak it until the room could not pretend it had not always been a performance.

Adela had already seen to the white cloths and the fact that The Swan would need four more hands than she had, at least two of which would belong to men who could carry barrels and not make faces at cake. The bride was a woman with a pragmatic mouth and a fine neck, and the groom had hair that tried to make weather. He wore it with that innocence men have when they are handsomer than their fears. Luca was booked to tidy it Friday, which he would not call tidy so much as respect. Ruby had the groom’s younger cousins in the gym with a lecture about not making speeches inside other people’s speeches. Mara, who had promised herself not to be ridiculous, took the ridiculous step of walking through the arrangement with Adela like a stage manager. They put flowers where the aisle would try to assert itself too violently and told it, politely, to soften. They moved the chairs a little inwards at the halfway point so the air would not make a funnel. They hid a comb under the registrar’s table, tied with red thread that Adela wound as if tying off a balloon.

“Are we witches?” Adela said, tilting a chair half an inch so that the line would not run like a blade. “Because my aunt will want to know if we need cloaks. She has a cloak.”

“We’re stagehands,” Mara said. “We make it look like the show ran itself.”

The letter about the wedding came addressed to The Swan, to the bride by name, written in ink that made the postman think of signatures on deeds. It said, in that patient schoolroom hand: I LIKE VOWS. I LIKE HAIR. I WILL TIDY YOUR PROMISES FOR YOU. People who find that sort of thing flattering do not deserve to be protected from themselves; people who do not, deserve quite a lot. The bride read it and did not weep. She put it on the bar and said to Adela, “We’re having marigolds on the table. My nan liked them.” It was not an answer. It was a decision that indicated what kind of woman you were dealing with. Mara filed the letter and put a hand where a hand would not help and let it be useless for a second because sometimes a body wants to do something even when the brain knows it can’t.

Callum, who had never thought about wedding aisles other than as interesting challenges for people who couldn’t walk in new shoes, learned about the insistence of ribbons. He learned about registrars. He learned about how men he liked turned foolish when given a mic and an ale and how women he loved quietly steered them by their ribs back to decency. He learned that Kev knew how to wire fairy lights into garlands so that if you tried to pull the string you got nothing for your trouble but grace. He learned that Adela’s aunt could sing two people down an aisle without making the hairs rise in the wrong place, and that she knew a version of a song that was not religious and was entirely human.

Karen prepared in the way that would wound her to be described as tenderly. She oiled blades because it calmed the piece of her that could be lost in the pleasure of sharpening. She folded her rope and put it away because the rope was for mechanics and she wanted poetry. She took from her satchel a paper packet with a tiny silver pin in it. It was a hairpin, the kind old women use to anchor buns that look like the memory of order. She had had it since a man in a velvet coat had asked her to hold his aunt’s updo in 1849 and she had smiled and said she’d be delighted and then stolen something else instead. The pin had a twist to it that meant if you pushed at a certain angle it slid through anything with the sleekness of a needle through butter. She wouldn’t be cruel. She would be precise. She would make a line where there wasn’t one and watch it turn into a story everybody would tell as if they had approved of it at the time.

The day set itself like custard. The bunting behaved. The registrar checked his pen twice and then a third time because something about the town’s week had made him superstitious. The bride arrived early because she was that sort of woman, and then she walked around the block because she didn’t want to go in until she had the exact right amount of late to make the room notice its desire and then have it put away again. The groom stood on the step and bounced on the balls of his feet in a way that would, in twenty years, make him an excellent uncle. His hair had been cut by Luca with devotion and mischief. There was barely a line in it. It flowed. It looked like a soft invitation. Adela watched him and felt protective in the way of a woman who has watched men’s hair become a political football against their will for a month and would now cheerfully bite a goblin if it tried anything.

Mara put herself near the registrar under the pretence of befriending the pen. She had a comb under the table and the red thread around her finger like a silly ring. She had told herself to be quiet. She had told herself to let love be sufficient magic. She had told herself not to expect neatness because neatness was the wrong god. She saw the aisle in her mouth like a straight taste. She could hear the door’s hinge and counted the seconds between footsteps and found the rhythm of the pair who would walk in.

Karen did not come in with them. She did not need to. She took her place on a chair in the second row on the bride’s side where a cousin might have sat, wearing a dress that looked like she had borrowed it from a neighbour ten years older and ten inches wider. She put her hand on her lap and fingered the pin and watched the back of a head in front of her with a greed that was more like envy. She could hold out a finger and the hair would part. She could put in the neatest little gap and watch a room count it as meaning. She waited, because waiting gives your appetite that crisp edge.

The door opened. The room did the thing rooms do. It inhaled. The aunt sang something small as if inviting a bird. The groom’s mouth did a wonderful foolish twist to contain his happiness. The bride came in looking like herself and not like a magazine. Children gasped because they had been waiting for magic and here it was, being less theatrical than they had hoped and twice as real. Karen reached for the head in front of her, because sometimes you take the first thing and the first thing begins a meal.

Her fingers hit salt. It was a thin, stupid line under the chair foot where Adela had thrown a handful and forgotten to sweep. It was not a barrier. It was an inconvenience with an attitude. It didn’t stop her. It made her breathe differently. It made her finger misjudge the angle. The pin slid into hair and met not scalp but a little barrette hidden under the smooth—someone who loved the owner had tucked it in there in the kitchen when nerves had made their fingers mutiny. The pin clicked on metal. The sound was quiet. Karen heard it as a slap.

She tried again. The room had moved a millimetre. The breath in the aisle had a pulse she did not recognise because it held love in it like a drum holds a rhythm: simple, unpretentious, inevitable. She pushed the pin under the hair in front of her and instead of a neat part she made a small untidy lift: a cowlick where there had been smooth. The owner of the head reached up without looking and patted it back like an old trick. The bride, catching sight of the gesture as she came level with the chair, raised an eyebrow in exact sympathy, as if to say: always that bit. The room chuckled with its clean mouth and kept going.

Karen didn’t hiss. She didn’t sulk. She did not allow the ridiculousness to sit on her. She took the pin out and placed it back in its paper bed because objects deserve manners. She stood up because she was done here. As she stood, the child next to her, a girl of about five with hair in two small indignations and a flower in one of them, looked up at her and said, very clearly and without any malice, “You are not invited.” The sentence was not a line. It was a fence with a gate. Karen smiled and for one second it was a human smile because she could not help admiring a child who knew what doors were for. Then she left because to stay would have been to admit a defeat she had not rehearsed.

After the vows Adela wiped her eyes without admitting it and told a boy not to stack glasses so high, you’re building Babel. The registrar watched the pen behave itself and experienced joy that looked like relief. Luca, who had snuck in at the back with a plausible excuse about bringing a forgotten hair grip, watched the groom kiss the bride and let himself think for a second that some men are handsome because they are happy and not the other way around, and that made him want to cut hair in joy for a month. Mara exhaled and allowed her hand to leave the silly comb. The aunt in the second row smiled at her niece who had said “not invited” and passed her a sugared almond as if to pay the toll.

Karen returned to the arches and sat with her back against the wall under the mouth with its dots and curves and felt like a joke told badly to a room that had decided politely to laugh. She did not like that feeling. She considered the town’s trick: bending, singing, refusing aisles, putting salt under chairs and perfume on boys’ collars, laughing at the right time, making old women into bodyguards and men who fix generators into wizards. She had underestimated their appetite for improvisation. She was a line. They were willow. She could stay and be bored. She could escalate. She could go and find a place that still loved the click of a neat edge. She was not sure that place existed within walking distance. It irritated her to have to be interesting.

She took out her fountain pen and wrote a letter with ink that had been made with soot and smoothness. She wrote to Mara this time, because sometimes it is a relief to address a person rather than a town. SHE OF THE COMBS, she wrote, and she meant it as an insult and a confession. I WILL NOT CUT YOUR WEDDINGS. I WILL NOT TIDY YOUR CHILDREN. I WILL FIND A LINE YOU CANNOT CURVE. She thought for a minute and then, as an afterthought a woman would recognise as vanity, added: YOUR BOY WHO SITS NEATLY BY THE WATER IS MINE WHEN I WANT HIM. She did not mean it. It was meanness as punctuation. She put the letter under a brick on the step of The Swan because she liked that she could make Adela bend to pick something up.

Mara read it standing up because some letters require posture. She did not like the line about Oak. She called Ruby before the air could take the sting out of the ink. Ruby rolled her eyes and texted Oak with a swear and said: come lift something. He came. He lifted. He sweated. He did not sit by the water because the water would have sat him. Sometimes victory is as dull as a gym.

Callum found a man with a moustache crying in Luca’s chair and pretended he was looking at pomades until the man had stopped and gone away. Luca wiped his scissors as if he were wiping a lens and asked Callum if he had ever had his hair cut by someone who loved him. He admitted, after a second’s pause and a look at the floor, that his mother had done it once with kitchen scissors and a spoon and then again to fix it. The two men grinned at each other like boys who have met at the back of a class and exchanged contraband honesty.

Adela’s aunt collected up the sugared almonds at the end because you do not leave sweets for bar staff to sweep. She pocketed three and put one on the brick under the arches where the comb’s thread had fluttered and the water had licked. Later, a fox, the familiar orange of sin forgiven, would take the almond and bury it and not remember where. It would look like an offering made to a god who preferred bones.

Night fell in the way it always does in towns that have learned to stave off their monsters with kettles and combinations of song and tape. The trains crossed the viaduct and did not look down because they had their own destinations and were proud. The graffiti mouth under the dots acquired, around midnight, a little line that was either a wrinkle or a laugh. Nobody could tell the difference in the morning. That was appropriate. The difference had never been obvious. The tally marks stayed three. The sticker that said BE KIND lost a corner to rain and looked as if it were winking.

Karen did not sleep. She sat at the edge of the river on a low wall meant to make children hold their parents’ hands tighter and watched lamplight put a neat stripe across the water, and she stuck her pin into her own lap through cloth and thought about what would not bend. She thought of parades. She thought of the cenotaph with its straight-backed duty and poppies in rows. She thought of the football but that had already begun to curve to their rhythm. She thought of maps. She thought of the line where the town ends and the fields begin, the hedge that has been cut the same each year by men who think of themselves as careful, the ditch that runs straight as drainage and misunderstanding. She smiled, and this time it was not a human smile. She did not giggle. She did not hum. She put the pin away and folded the rope and looked at her hands and liked them, for they were neat.

In the morning, Mara woke to a text from her aunt: come mind the shop, I have a back like a fence post and customers with the manners of goats. She went and stood behind the counter and sold a newspaper to a man who had once told her she had eyes that scared and said thank you as if she had given him a sandwich. A boy bought stickers and asked if he could have the comb one. She gave him two and the red thread for free and told him, without ritual, to tie it around something he loved and he said all right in the way of children who treat instructions as stories. The bell over the door rang and a woman with a cardigan and a face like reasonable weather came in and bought string. She smiled at Mara as if she knew her and did not say so. The town did not ask for more than that. It would, later. It always does. For now it wanted pens and sweets and a hell of a lot of tea.

Under the arches the fox found the sugared almond and failed to be poetic about it. A boy on a bike rode past singing to himself, off-key and earnest. The mouth on the wall kept its counsel and its curve. The river kept its lines. The comb under the registrar’s table had been put back in the treacle tin with the red thread still tied. The MP’s eyebrows had grown in without acknowledging their new geography and then had been trimmed by a woman who loved order too much to leave him to his own devices. The town did what towns do between incidents. It practiced being defensible in ways that looked like normal life. It made straight lines where they were kind and wobbled others where they wanted to become whips. It braced. It breathed. It waited for the thing under the arches to make its next neat attempt.
