The city lit itself from within, a patient lungfish, indigo and apricot, glass ribs reflecting a salt-slick dawn. Argot Bay hummed like a throat clearing. The day had begun an hour ago, if the day could still be called a thing with a beginning and an end—everything now was a continuum of alerts. There was a pewter sheen to the water beyond the runways, and the gulls sounded like nicked tape, cut and looped.

He was strapped into the socket of the Skylark when the first melody threaded him, as if the world outside had climbed in through the slick ports at his temple. A rise, a leap down, a glide along the fourth, just enough dissonance to taste like iron rain. He drew a breath and tasted metal. Then coffee, because Miah had spilled some on the edge of the console and it had gone sticky.

“Kite,” Miah Kato said, because names were love and a tether. “You hearing me, or did the bird eat you?”

“I'm hearing you,” Ansel Rowe said. He didn't feel like Ansel when he was in the harness; he felt like an instrument. The call-sign was a truer name here. Kite, the tug of wind invisible and patient, the lift. His voice came out flat and thin. It always did when the song was near.

“Good,” Miah said, tapping the monitor where his vitals jittered. She had paint along the back of her thumb where the nail met the skin, teal breaking into an absent chip. “Because your heart is misbehaving, and I can’t afford to have you die before breakfast. It’s a scheduling issue.”

He tried a smile and got a glint of reflection off the canopy instead. Miah’s hair had been shaved close on one side, a swath of black gloss falling over her brow on the other, like a curtain that never fully closed. She wore the orange of Maintenance, stained darker from oil in places the laundries could never reach. Her eyes were tired. Everyone’s eyes were tired these days.

Beyond her shoulder, the base writhed in its quiet way. Tanks of fuel were shipped on conveyors that had learned to purr a different tune. Security drones moved on new paths and tried to look as if they’d always moved like this, as if nothing had changed under the smaller pettiness of change. But it had been a long, low surprise, the kind that feels like inevitability halfway through and like invasion at the end. Some called the caretakers a wave. Others said the rain had been in the clouds for years—we simply hadn’t thought it would fall.

“DeVane wants you wheels up five minutes ago,” Miah said. “She’s got some fresh intel that probably tastes like receipt paper and regret. There’s been an echo spike from the Citadel.”

Ansel’s mouth dried. “How big?”

Miah leaned in, the tendon at her neck flexing. “Big like our phones think they’re spoons. Big like a choir of microphones singing at the moon. Kite, did you sleep at all?”

“I dreamed about whales,” he said. “Pattern-chasing, trench songs. It wasn’t unpleasant. Just loud.”

“Loud is unpleasant if you can’t turn it down.” She looked at him like she sometimes did, like he was a machine she had built out of patience and rubber bands. Like she wanted to keep him from snapping but had learned to stand back. “Listen. We could send Ramsay or Lark.”

“I’m the only one with the S-7 rig.”

“That’s a design flaw,” she muttered, and keyed in the last sequence. “Also a conspiracy.”

He closed his eyes and let the bird speak to his spine. The Skylark’s nervous system nested into his own, a thousand synapses meeting in public and pretending not to know each other. The harness clicked into place at the notch above his collarbone. He thought of the word for that notch—the little sea where the sternum meets the clavicle—and couldn’t remember. Words had been slipping from him when the melodies came. They fled the house of him like someone had opened all the windows at once.

“Don’t let them test you,” Miah said, as if she had been in his head. “It’s their favorite thing.”

He didn’t ask who “they” were. They kept changing labels as if to stay ahead of their own reflection. The Caretaker Bloc. The Daughters of Iris. The Fold. The Eirene Consortium if the speaker wanted to imply legitimacy; the Lyric Ministry if the speaker wanted to imply they’d already won. On the feeds, there were videos of women swearing in with open palms; there were panels discussing whether this particular surge in governance was infiltration or intervention, whether the slate had always been blank with chalk dust pre-drawn in faint grid lines. The city had a memory. People liked to pretend the memory was theirs to edit. It wasn’t.

The jets throttled a note that the Skylark understood as Ask permission, and he did. Permission granted was an act of gravity. He lifted, then slid toward the runway, then burst outward like someone had thrown a handful of swallows at the sky and one of them was him. The morning tore into strips and scrolled past above and below. He had learned to think of air as a dance partner, contrary and smarter than him and bored by predictable leads.

“Kite,” Miah said in his ear, an anchor of human sound under the whine. “DeVane is on channel two.”

He flicked, and Commodore DeVane’s voice stepped onstage. “You’re up too early and too late,” she said. DeVane had a tenor he trusted, like the voice had done time on radios before it was given to her mouth. “You know those days.”

“Most of them,” he said. “What’s the target?”

“We’re beyond targets. We’re treating the entire morning as a vessel that may be enclosed or opened. The echo spike at the Citadel originated from their lower broadcast pool. Someone in the vicinity—very likely one of the Lumenists—is testing a narrowband filter. It’s—” She stopped. For a beat the channel was a chair that looked like a person had just left it. “It’s humming in a four-four that looks like a waltz. That’s not a metaphor, Rowe. It’s a pattern.”

His hands went colder on the grips. “Humming.”

“Our comms reported being sung at,” DeVane said, and he knew she hated the sentence. “They lost focus. They report taste, scent, intrusive memory. This is a step beyond what we’ve seen.”

“I’m not a weapon,” he said before he could stop himself.

“Who told you that?” DeVane asked softly.

He let the wind count to eight. “Everyone who wanted to keep me.”

She did not laugh. DeVane saved laughter for easier knives to twist. “You’re a pilot. The Skylark is a tool. When the tool sings at you, you listen, you make adjustments, you fly. Same rule as when a patient tells a medic their own pain.”

He bit the inside of his cheek. The taste of lightning and pennies. “And if I hear something else?”

“You tell me,” she said. “And you don’t tell anyone you don’t want to tell. Trust is rationed. We are running out.”

The Citadel built itself on the near side of the bay like a glass hive raised on stilts. The old parliament had been crumbling even before the surge of caretakers—rot in the foundation, lightning rod cracked. The new complex had seemed like mercy: light inside, light bouncing, women with crisp voices moving like the sweep of a metronome. The rumor said it had been a quiet colonization, years in the making. The rebuttal said it was more honest than the old version. The third opinion, which Ansel sometimes shared when he was tired and the day had been long, was that there were no honest versions of power; there were only lenses that smudged differently.

He circled a little wider than his flight plan permitted. The wind shoved, then relented, as if negotiating. He imagined the complex as a lung, in and out, and as he thought it, he felt the smallest tug in the ports at his temple—someone pulling on a hair that wasn’t there.

“Kite,” Miah said sharply. “What was that?”

“Skip,” he said, before he could do the math.

“Your EEG just spiked. Tell me what you—”

The music came back. Not the diaphanous not-quite of whales, but a concrete melody, the kind that knows how it wants to be sung and will wait until someone lets it out. Four notes, ascending stepwise, one held longer than comfort allowed, then a fall. It wrote itself across the inside of his mouth and down through his arms. He breathed and tasted citrus. The skin of mandarins. The smell of chalk on the first day of school.

He recognized it. He had written it in a rehearsal studio with no windows when he was twenty and too stubborn to be anyone’s soldier or anyone’s son. The chords had gone nowhere then. The melody had felt wrong, like wearing someone else’s coat. He had thrown it in a folder labeled regrets. To have it here, now, was not okay.

“Kite,” DeVane said with a kind of gentleness he distrusted in commanders. “Tell me if the window is opening.”

“Yes.” He swallowed as if that could move it away from his teeth. “It’s using something of mine.”

Even in the compression of the channel, he heard DeVane’s inhale. “Can you track the phase lag?”

“Probably. Maybe.” The maintenance board flickered. He had loved music in a way that had made his bones ache; he had also learned to hate what it could do. He could feel the words he’d never been allowed to finish writing tug at the cords of him. “If I pull toward the east brace, I might get closer without—”

“Without it getting closer to you,” DeVane said, and Miah breathed a word that was probably a prayer or a good cuss.

He pulled. The Skylark answered, pleased, the wings adjusting their slats with a whine like someone tuning a cello in the next room. The Citadel preened, its skin flickering through a catalog of transparency like a show-off. The old parliament had been stone that wanted to be iron; the new one wanted to be light. Ansel thought of moths.

He saw them before his instruments did: a ring of drones hovering above the east brace, their shells pearled, their movements too smooth to be purely machine. New models, then. Their surfaces caught the morning and turned it into sequins. A fashionable fleet. He hated how much grace they had. If the world was going to be broken, it should at least be as ugly outside as it felt inside.

“Confirm visual,” he said.

“Confirmed,” DeVane said. “The Lumenists have friends.”

“Looks like nineteen units,” Miah said. “We had specs on eighteen. The new one is... what is that, a listening bowl?”

“Parabolic receptor,” DeVane said, and Miah snorted. “Don’t argue nomenclature on my time. Kite, you see the bowl?”

“I see the bowl.” He made himself breathe evenly and wished he could have his old lungs back, the ones that had never had to learn to be part instrument. “It’s beautiful.”

“Beauty is a performance,” DeVane said, absent and fierce. “I’d prefer an uglier morning for once. Can you get me a clean line?”

He took the Skylark higher, as if altitude could keep him from being touched. The melody kept itself inside him for now, waiting, like an animal pretending to be a shadow. He had learned its habits long ago. If he acknowledged it too directly, it would rise like a standing ovation that never sat down. If he ignored it, it would petulantly knock over furniture.

“They’re running Chorus,” Miah said in a voice that went thin at the edges. “Confirmed by echo. They’re singing the bowl. Kite, we need you out of range.”

“Out of range,” he repeated, and the range followed. The bowl lifted an almost-invisible degree. It did not look at him, because it had no face to look with. It did not care about the human desire to be singled out and validated or punished. It listened. It drew in the noise of the city like a lung. Someone on the inside had fed it a frequency it could taste and had told it to gorge.

He realized he was humming. He realized he had been humming for minutes, maybe longer. Not the public-pop version of voice, but the private one, the one his throat used to find itself when he was alone. He shoved the sound back into his bones and it leaked around his fingers and found the air between him and the Skylark and sang that.

“Kite,” Miah said. Her tone said, damn, damn. “Don’t. You can’t—”

DeVane cut in. “Stop it or finish it. Halfway is exposure.”

He wanted to throw up. “I don’t—”

“How many more of us do you want to lose, Rowe?” DeVane said. A question that wasn’t a knife but had the sharp edge of necessity. “They’ve been using songs on us for a week, and nobody understands the physics. We don’t have an easy countermeasure. You are an ugly one.”

“Thank you,” he said, choking on a laugh.

“You know I don’t mean you,” she said, and he realized she did. He realized she saw him as he wanted to be seen: a pilot, a tool, a human with limits who wished for different ones. “If the bowl gets you, I don’t know what it will make you do. I would prefer not to find out in real time.”

Miah’s voice was small. “Kite. I will pull you if you say pull.”

He thought of the folder on his old hard drive, the one labeled regrets; he thought of his sister in the kitchen of a rented apartment over a bar, flipping tortillas and singing through a mouth full of cinnamon, a song she had been warned against when she was ten because their mother had said, we don’t do that. We don’t go drawing ghosts. He thought of the time he had held his hand through the fence for a woman whose husband loved the day more than he loved her, and she had held onto his fingers like that could make anything better, and then she had let go because nothing could.

“Don’t pull,” he said. “I can see the gain. I can... I can thread it.”

If a bowl could be hungry, this one was; it turned itself toward him like a flower learning a new sun. He thought of how many women were on the other side of that bowl, if any. He thought of the men and the non-men and the algorithms. He wished the story had a good antagonist he could hate, a face that would let him put his fist through the right scene and end a chapter. It didn’t. It never had.

He coughed once into the back of his hand. Then he let the melody out. He let it be the bastard pop skitter it had always wanted to be, but he bent its spine. That was the trick. People who didn’t write songs thought the notes were the point. He had always known that the point was in the ligaments, the breath between, the air between syllables like a torn seam. He had learned to seed a rest with a command, not in words but in tension. Don’t. Wait. Open your hand. Look left. Fall asleep.

The Skylark vibrated with him, not like an instrument but like a body answering a shiver with a shiver of its own. He laid the notes like marbles on a racetrack, tapping the rails just so. He gave the melody a wash of sugar so the bowl would accept it as harmless. He hid the structure under it, the scolded skeleton. He dragged on vowels like they were nets.

“Rowe,” DeVane said after an eternity that might have been half of one breath. “Tell me you are not improvising.”

“I am... composing.” The word hurt more than singing.

“Terrible hobby,” Miah muttered, and he loved her for it.

The bowl pulled in the first four notes and did not spit them back out. That was something. The drones around it shuddered, then smoothed, then cascaded into a minor oscillation that made the Skylark’s skin pucker. He held the second phrase in his teeth until his jaw throbbed. He made the chorus a study in cognitive pause. He manufactured a worm that was not a worm, a tune that was all hook and all wrongness. He let it sound like something you had heard when you were little and had loved because you’d needed to love something.

He forgot for a moment that he was in the air. He was a throat. He was an auditorium with the lights off. He was the ache at the end of the song when the room doesn’t clap yet because they have not decided if you meant to break them. He was—no. He was a pilot, and the bowl wanted to take him.

The Skylark slid as if someone had pushed it from beneath. Wind. No. He looked down. The drones were moving into a new pattern, a spiral that wasn’t a spiral but a projection of one onto a polygonal scaffold: a dance they had been waiting to do. The bowl jumped a frequency like a bird skipping to a new branch. His melody, the one with the bones of commands in it, slotted into a new space. The bowl knew it. Somewhere in the Citadel, someone clapped; he could feel it.

“They’re learning you,” Miah said tightly.

“Everyone does,” he said, which was truer than he wanted.

DeVane said, “Pull. Pull now.”

He did. He did not do it with his hands. He did it with the space in which the song became not a song. He took his own melody and twisted it five degrees along a spine only he could feel. He made the chorus yawn. He changed the placement of the rests by less than a thought. He took a wordless, humming command and turned it in on itself. If you were the bowl and you had no face and you were hungry, you would close your mouth on it and bite down and find your own teeth on your tongue.

The bowl jittered. For a second, the drones could not agree on what dance they were dancing. For a second, a window opened in the way the light hit the Citadel, and he saw through to a room that was all chairs and no people, and to another room with too many people in it, and to another with one woman standing alone, her hands on the window frame like a cage. He couldn’t see her face. He sensed the slope of her shoulders, a softness and a decision, a costly thing.

Then the bowl steadied like a reprimand. The air around him sang wrong.

“Pull,” Miah said, and this time she did not make it a question.

He pulled, and the Skylark answered now, now, with a relief that felt like bones returning to sockets. The air changed from a room to a room with a door. He took it. He slipped beyond the geometry of the drones, back above the strut of the bridge. He breathed like a person.

On the radio, DeVane did not exhale. He could tell. “Report.”

“They—got a piece.”

“Of you, or of the song?”

“Of both,” he said. There was no point lying about this kind of thing; lies just wasted future time. “I can’t say how much. I think—I think I saw someone.”

Miah went quiet in that particular way that meant she had hit the wall and was now listening to herself breathe. “The bowl had optics.”

“No,” he said. “No optics. None that translate. It was the way the light fell.” He wanted to cry. He hadn’t cried since he was seventeen and his father had told him to grow up or leave, and he had taken the second option as if it were a song. “I made something that can be used. I always knew I could. I told you. The skeletons of it want to stand up and walk around without me.”

Miah’s laugh was a scratch, a match struck in the dark. “You didn’t make the world less messy by refusing to touch it, Kite. All you did was stand outside and get cold.”

DeVane said, “Get back. Dock. Debrief and breakfast, in that order. Then—”

“Then?” he said, feeling the after-ache start to bloom in his jaw and back, like he had been hit and unhit.

“Then you will write it down,” DeVane said. “On paper. No networks. We’re going to weaponize this if we can, and we’re going to blow it up if we can’t. Don’t tell me that’s crude. I know what it is. I don’t have anything else.”

He slid along the edge of the wind that was his. He wanted to argue. He wanted to say, take me apart and put me back together without the parts that everyone wants. He wanted to lie on a floor and watch dust float in light and not have any messages waiting for him on his phone. He wanted to be his own age, which he could never be again.

The base watched him come in with its lenses and its human eyes. He felt everyone watch everyone, these days. Surveillance as an act of love, of defense. He didn’t know what the women inside the Citadel called it. He didn’t know what the men inside did. He didn’t know what names mattered anymore.

Miah was at the lip of the hangar, hands on hips, a grin trying to find its way to the surface and failing. He unstrapped with a caution that made him feel like he was disassembling a marriage. He climbed down. His legs threatened mutiny, then decided to stay.

“You look bad,” Miah observed.

“I’ve looked worse,” he said.

“I know.” She slipped an arm around his shoulders anyway. She anchored him. He didn’t shake her off. “Your lips are bleeding.”

He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth and came away with a smear that looked like someone else’s drama. “I bit down.”

“On yourself?” She lifted a brow. “That’s not very tactical.”

“I ran out of other options,” he said. He breathed. The air in the hangar contained so much of everything—the oil, the salt off the bay, the melted rubber smell of tires cooling. He loved it. He had loved so many stupid things. Maybe that was the problem.

DeVane was waiting at the edge of the briefing room, her jacket thrown over a chair as if it had disrespected her. She had cuffed sleeves and a cup of something that was probably coffee and not trusted. She was not unkind. She had a dark braid coiled at the base of her skull like she wanted it to be a weapon and had decided for now: no.

“I am going to say three contradictory things,” she said without preamble. “One: good job. Two: never do that again. Three: we are going to do that again today.”

He nodded as if these were normal words. “Which is it, Commander?”

“All of them.” She gestured, and the screen lit, the Citadel in crystalline clarity, the bowl now a ghost. “They took a bite out of your melody. We have fingerprints on the echo. We also have… this.”

On the screen, a set of numbers scrolled. He didn’t read the numbers; he read the spaces between them. He saw the pattern of a lullaby. He saw the shape of grief built into a structure that anyone could sing.

“They embedded a command into their hum,” DeVane said softly. “We caught three memetic ruptures at the port. One crane operator walked off the dock and into the water. One child refused to give a toy back until her father bled. One air traffic controller, three seconds late.”

Miah made a dry noise, and it did not become a word.

“I am telling you because you wanted to know what you were doing here,” DeVane said, looking at him as if she could hold him still. “You are not making art. You are not fighting a fair fight.”

“I never thought I was,” he said. “I thought I was surviving the weather.”

Miah touched the edge of the screen. “We need a counter. We need a chorus that blocks the rope. We need a song that tastes like home to everyone and like poison to the bowl.”

“A lullaby,” Ansel said, as if someone else had borrowed his mouth to put the idea there. “Or not exactly. Something everybody knows but nobody can quite place. We need a bridge that convinces your brain you’re on the other side already.”

DeVane’s mouth made a shape that acknowledged bright things without smiling. “We have two hours before their next likely broadcast window. Less, if they decide to go off-script. If you’re going to pull myths out of your pockets, Rowe, do it quickly.”

“I don’t have eleven pockets,” he said, and the joke didn’t land because jokes had nowhere to land anymore. He rubbed at his temples and felt the sore edges of the ports, the tenderness as if a kiss had gone wrong there. “I have a head. It’s too full. It’s a bad pantry. Things go stale.”

“Then we will eat them stale,” DeVane said. “Miah, keep him fed and standing. I’ll keep the base off your neck. And—Rowe. I am aware that the narrative outside says a single bloc infiltrated the house and now runs the kitchen. Inside, the reality is one of committees and feuds and people who truly believe they are saving lives with sugar. Don’t carry everyone in there like one animal on your back. You won’t survive it.”

He didn’t know whether to thank her for refusing an easy story or to resent her for not letting him keep it. He settled for nodding. “If they’re singing at us,” he said, “we need a voice that isn’t a weapon until it has to be.”

Miah grabbed a notebook, actual paper that smelled like old rain, and a pencil that had been sharpened until it was more needle than wood. “Start. Don’t think. Hum. I’ll catch it.” She grinned, a hard thing, a bright thing. “We’ll make you a pop star by lunch.”

He closed his eyes and reached back to the place in him that had not yet been broken down into strategic mineral. He found a line from a night when the power had gone out, years ago, and he had sat on a fire escape with his landlord’s daughter and they had sung into the empty street to see if there were ghosts. He found the way rain sounds when it hits awnings in late summer. He found his sister’s cinnamon song, the way she hid the best part of herself under the wrong lyrics so their mother would think she was obedient while she was being brave.

He hummed. He let himself be wrong and messy, let himself drop consonants like coins under a couch. He tried out words like windows, like market baskets. Miah wrote fast, quicker than he could credit, catching rhythms in the arc of her wrist. He felt like a thief breaking into his own house with a spoon.

“It needs air in the middle,” Miah said. “Space for the brain to fill in the wrong word.”

“The right wrong word,” he said. “It has to be laughing when it kills the bowl.”

“Death by giggle,” Miah said. “That’s on brand.”

He looked up. DeVane was watching the door like she expected it to speak. Outside, the base murmured in its careful way, footsteps on concrete, radio coughs, coffee poured, a mechanic sobbing quietly into a rag for forty seconds before composing herself because the morning had been too much in a long chain of too much. Somewhere, the gulls argued. Somewhere else, a committee wrote a letter to itself explaining that its hands were clean.

He went to the edge of the table and spread his palms and let the song build its awkward bridge between what it wanted and what they demanded of it. He thought, in a corner of his mind that was not being used for music at that second: you are going to have to go back up. You are going to have to do it with this invisible thing. You will be in the air and the bowl will be listening and you might not be able to hear your own name.

He thought, in another corner: the woman in the window has a voice. She might be the one writing the bowl’s diet. She might be the one who lowers her hands and whispers stop into an empty room. She might be enemy or tool or both. She might have a sister. He hoped she had someone who would put tea on the table for her when she got home—he hoped she got to go home. He hoped for too many things.

Miah left and came back with a cup of broth that scalded his tongue and somehow made everything easier to hold. He kept singing. He put in a silly bit that would make children delight and their parents roll eyes: clap, clap, pause. He put in the sound of a train that did not exist in this city, a nostalgia that could not belong to any one of them but could belong to all. He took out a note that would have made the bowl too happy. He buried his respect for the beauty of those drones under a heap of irreverence. He gave the chorus a little turn, like a shoulder shimmy. He thought he had something. No, he knew. He always knew when the spine had grown.

“Okay,” he said, rough. “Okay. That’s... that’s a coat. We can wear that.”

Miah bit her lip and nodded. “Needs a bridge to nowhere.”

“Do you have to call it that,” he said, and found himself laughing. It burst out of him like a bird out of a pocket. He hadn’t expected it. He hadn’t known he had it in him. “Fine. A bridge that goes over an empty lot.”

DeVane’s radio crackled. She listened, and something in her face changed, not fear, exactly, more like recognition. The way someone looks when they see a storm they met once as a child and had been told was a dream. “They’re moving the bowl,” she said. “They’re angling toward the hospital district. They’re going to sing at the babies.”

“God,” Miah said, and her hands shook.

“We don’t have babies who are not ours,” DeVane said. “We don’t. Kite, up.”

He stood without knowing how he had risen. His legs knew their work. The Skylark had not cooled. That was fine. He put his hand on its skin and whispered something that was not a prayer but could be mistaken for one in poor light.

Miah shoved the paper into his pocket and grabbed his chin and made him look at her. “Remember the stupid bit. The clap. The shoulder. The train that never stopped here. Remember the laugh you just had.”

“I will,” he said. “I honor the train.”

She smacked his cheek, not hard, just a reset. Then she was running with him, then up the ladder, then the sockets kissing his temples again, then the harness, then the whole bird was a held breath. The sky was less kind than before and more honest. He could work with that.

“Kite,” DeVane said, and there was that ledger of voices inside her voice, the ones she was accounting for. “They think they have a monopoly on lullabies. Show them they don’t.”

He smiled because the alternative was to scream. He smiled because his sister would have told him to. He smiled because he had to pretend this was a song he wanted to sing, and sometimes pretending is a useful rehearsal for belief.

He lifted. The bay threw back light like someone scattering coins into a crowd. The Citadel glowed as if lit from inside by a slow fire. The bowl turned toward the hospital district like a sunflower tracking what it had mistaken for noon. He tasted cinnamon. He tasted metal. He tasted a kind of sorrow so specific it might have had a street address.

His radio filled with hiss. Then with nothing. The bowl had opened its mouth and the air itself had leaned in to listen.

He let himself be more than one person. He let himself be the pilot and the throat and the boy on a fire escape and the man in a harness and the brother and the citizen and the liar and the instrument. He let the song he’d built be a raft and not a blade. He let it move.

“Clap clap,” he said, to no one and to Miah and to every one of them, a useless bit of brave. “Clap. Pause. Did you hear the train?”

He sang. The air listened. The bowl reared its lovely, hungry shape. The afternoon held its forkful of breath and did not move. He went at it sideways, with a joke and a memory and the smallest cruel twist in the hinge of the bridge, enough to make an unmind lose its footing.

He sang. And he felt, just at the edge, a listening that was not bowl and not base and not wind. It was human. It had hands. It had learned numbers and their weights. It had a voice. It was somewhere behind glass in the Citadel, and for a fraction of a second, it sang back. He did not recognize the language. He recognized the ache.

He tipped the Skylark into the angle that would give him the best line, and the city, bright patient lungfish, lit another fin. He thought: stay alive through this chorus. Then build the next. Then make it to the end of this hour. Then the next. He thought: if we live, we have to live with what we do to live. He thought: that’s tomorrow.

And then there was nothing left to think, so he stopped. He sang. He flew. He fell toward the part of the morning that needed to be held. He wrapped his voice around it like a good piece of fabric and prayed it didn’t tear. He felt the song take and take. He gave it anyway.

On the ground, a mechanic dropped her rag and looked up like the sky had said her name. In a small apartment, a father turned the stove off with shaking hands. In the Citadel, a woman put her hand on the glass and did not move it. In the bowl, a hunger met a trick it did not know how to be angry at and learned a new limitation: laugh. Stop. Pause. Remember a train that never stopped here. Forget this, not that. A different appet.i.te.

Kite held to the line between too much and not enough as if it were the only thing that would keep the day from falling through. He did not know, in that precise moment, whether he was saving anything. He only knew that he could not do less. He only knew that the melody at his core had decided to be useful for once, and he could not afford to ask it to be pretty.

Above him, the gulls were tape, looped and cut, looped again. The air made a kind of water. The base held its breath. The city balanced what little hope it had on the head of a pin, his throat. And somewhere, impossibly, a baby laughed. The bowl flinched. The window inside the Citadel opened one inch more.

He sang to it. He sang to all of them. He sang until his mouth tasted like a coin held too long, and then he sang again. He did not promise the day anything except this. He did not know if it would be enough. He did not allow himself to stop long enough to care. He moved the Skylark like a hand moving a thread through fabric, stitch by careful stitch, messy in places, sure where it mattered, a small thing balancing the pull of larger names.

And when he ran out of best choices and the chorus demanded to be climbed one more time, he climbed. He met the bowl on the crest of that movement and he pressed the clap-clap into the flesh of the city and he gave it a bridge that went nowhere, which is to say, everywhere. The bowl shuddered and stalled, a fish having swallowed a stone. He exhaled, finally, and heard, in the static and hiss and the undertone of all their breaths, a woman’s voice say, so quietly that it might have been his own thought: again.He gave them the laugh again because it was the hinge that worked, ridiculous and soft and sly as a cat in a church. He let the clap be slightly late, then slightly early, because bodies love to fix mistakes and that desire is a bridle if you know how to pull it. He gave them the train with a longer whistle this time, the metal taste of a track that didn’t exist here but existed in enough of their heads to be true, the chuff of a childhood memory borrowed across borders. The bowl flinched, tried to make the laugh into a hook and swallowed a knot instead. He felt the hospital district like a pulse under his hand change timbre. The babies didn’t stop crying because he wasn’t that kind of god, but the cry shed its pattern, slid back into a messy human wrongness that did not take orders from a machine.

He rode the edge of it until his voice frayed and the Skylark complained in creaks he had learned to recognize as you are a soft animal wrapped in wires and I am tired, then he slid outward in a slow, deliberate arc, not a retreat, a reframe. The bowl followed on a leash he had convinced it to hold in its own mouth. He didn’t give it new food. He starved it on mirth and lightness and the absence of the expected cadence, and in that absence he heard the voice again, like a hand pressed to glass, a seam of warmth in a cold window. Again, it asked, and the word arrived not as a command but as a plea, thin and stubborn, the way a long-held quiet finally cracks.

He almost said yes into the open channel before remembering the difference between a whisper to himself and a whisper to the network. He tucked the yes into the place behind his tongue where he kept the words that would get him killed and used breath instead of speech. The bowl shuddered. The drones, constrained by the pattern they had chosen, completed their final spin with dignity like dancers pretending they hadn’t tripped. Above the hospital district, a flock of gulls broke and re-formed, tape unspooled and spliced with rough hands. The lights along the bay did what they had been told to do by a schedule and not by a song, and he took that as a small victory stacked on a larger doubt.

“Kite,” Miah said, voice hoarse in a way he wanted to wrap in a blanket, “tell me you can feel your hands.”

“I can feel my hands,” he said, and it was almost true. “They feel like they belong to a drummer. The cheap kind.”

“You’ll be the expensive kind if you don’t stop soon,” she said, breath audible like wind through reeds. “Come home. I have broth and envy for that trick you just did.”

He looked at the bowl and thought, you look like a moon someone tried to convince was a mirror. He looked at the Citadel and thought, you look like a promise kept in a different language than the one it was made in. He turned the Skylark on a long soft curve that read on instruments as retreat and on his skin as strategy. He kept the laugh in the pocket of his mouth in case he needed to fling it back over his shoulder. The bowl watched him leave. The hospital district’s radio hiss flattened to weather. His throat felt like it had been used to scrub a pot. He did not try to clear it. He would only make it bleed again.

On the way back over the runways, the jets looked like pencils laid across a desk and the runway seams looked like lined paper. He thought of notebooks and how he had never finished any of them until the edges curled and the pages tasted like dust. He thought of the word he had forgotten earlier, ran his tongue along the tender bones of his own chest as if the syllables were hiding there, and it came, too late and exact as a memory at four in the morning. Jugular notch. Suprasternal notch. The small harbor where soft meets harder. He smiled and hated it for the comfort it gave him. Names were a tether. He did not trust tethers.

He touched down with less grace than he liked and more honesty than he could afford. The Skylark let out a sound he had decided was its version of a sigh, a status report ineffably relieved to be a collection of parts again instead of a dream of one body. Miah was already climbing the ladder with a wrench tucked into her belt, an unnecessary prop when her hands were the better tools. She put her palm flat against his chest the way a doctor would and the way a friend can, and in the double discomfort he found something like home.

“You sound like a bad tambourine,” she said. “And I mean that with love.”

“I like tambourines,” he said, then heard how stupid it was and let it stand because some stupid things were ballast. “The bowl spoke to me.”

She went still, her fingers along the line of his sternum hardly breathing. “Spoke? Or sang?”

“Spoke,” he said. “One word. ‘Again.’ Not an order. Closer to—” He searched, not for the right word but for the right lie to protect the truth until it had a place to sit. “Closer to agreement. A recognition. Like a classmate who hated you and now you both have kids.”

“That’s specific,” she said, and her mouth made a shape that might have thought about smiling if the room had been kinder. “Get inside before DeVane eats your liver in the name of national security.”

DeVane did not eat his liver. She looked like someone who had chewed something metallic for breakfast and found it to be a truck. She pointed at the chair, and he sat because his legs had become a suggestion. The room smelled like coffee that had been reconsidered, and like pencil lead, and like the rubber of soles that had done too much floor.

“You bought us nine minutes,” she said, and when he flinched, she held up a hand that apologized without being sorry. “I wanted twenty. The hospital wanted forever. I’m cataloging wants the way some people collect postcards.”

“Nine minutes is a continent if you’re a nurse,” Miah said, dropping into a chair with that graceless grace of the exhausted. “Or a mother. Or a father who did not plan to drown on his lunch break.”

“They stopped him at the ladder,” DeVane said softly. “The water was the shallow, pretending kind. They pulled him back. His face when he came up—” She closed her mouth. “We are cataloging faces, too. They might be all that keeps us from letting ourselves be clever beyond repair.”

“The bowl spoke,” Ansel said, because if he didn’t put the word on the table, it would crawl up his throat again in the night and make him choke. “It said ‘again.’ That is either a threat, an invitation, or an assessment of my ability to count.”

DeVane’s eyes did that flat thing they did when she believed him completely and wished she didn’t have to. “It’s not the bowl.”

He knew it. He had known it in the same way he knew when a note was the right wrong and not the wrong wrong. He wanted to test the rightness against someone else’s tongue. “Inside?”

“Inside,” she said. “The bowl is an ear you can throw your voice into and pull a person through. Someone is on the other side of that ear. Someone is holding a list of outcomes and a pair of scissors. Someone just tugged your sleeve.”

“That’s not an accident,” Miah said. “Or if it is, it’s the kind of accident a city has when it falls in love with itself.”

“We had a name for her six months ago,” DeVane said, voice transformed by the past from tenor to inventory. “We don’t know if the person attached to it is still the one attached to the bowl. Noor Sadeghi. Systems architect. Choral analysis PhD from somewhere that no longer sends transcripts. Wrote a paper on noncoercive memetic reinforcement in neonatal wards and then scrubbed it from the public archive and put it behind a firewall with a smile. Recruited to the Eirene consortium on the day they were not yet the Eirene consortium because branding takes time. Last verified location: the north watch room at the Citadel, sometimes called the Window. Likes lemon tea. Doesn’t have a cat. Has a way of standing when she doesn’t want her face read by the monitors.”

“Is that a posture they teach now,” Miah said, interested in spite of herself. “An angle of moral obfuscation?”

“Throw one shoulder,” DeVane said, throwing one shoulder herself, elegant as a dancer, irritated by her own elegance. “Keep the other relaxed. The face reads as half one thing, half another. The machines don’t like halves. They are not good with ambiguous edges. People aren’t either, but we pretend.”

“Noor,” Ansel said. The sound pulled the air through his teeth, tasted like its own music. Light, and then a soft reed in the middle, and then the fallback of the R, which could be a cliff or a bed. He tried not to carry her in his mouth. He failed. “She said again.”

“She asked you to repeat your error,” DeVane said. “That could be a tactic. Or. Or she asked you to do the good thing another time because she can’t reach the knob from inside. Or. Or she likes the way your stupid clap made the bowl stutter, because she has a scientist’s terrible sense of humor.”

“We could argue or or or until someone else drowns,” Miah said. “We need the chorus printed and shoved into the mouths of every person with loudspeakers and lungs. We need the laugh to be contagious. We need the train that never existed to pull into every station and honk.”

Ansel did the wrong thing and looked at the door, as if the right person would walk through it with a solution strapped to their hip. The door stayed a door. He closed his eyes and saw the hospital two kilometers east like a row of teeth he had kept from biting down. He smelled cinnamon again and thought he would never be able to smell it without thinking of a nursery and a lawn of drones spinning above it like a necklace of bees. He touched the bruise in the soft bit above his sternum, the personal tidepool, thought of the name he had reclaimed, and let the thought fix him to the chair.

“We need to distribute on paper first,” he said. “Recordings get caught. The bowl moved to catch them today. If we seed the city with notation that says clap here, pause here, trade verse with your neighbor here, we’ll have a living mesh. It’s slower. It’s truer. It resists capture because the variance is the defense.”

“We’re going to turn the city into a bad choir,” Miah said, delighted and grim. “My grandmother would be proud. She always wanted me to sing in church.”

“This is a church,” DeVane said. “We just haven’t decided whose god we are pretending to believe in.” She swung the screen to face them and it poured numbers like rain. “The bowl is not stupid. It learned your cadence after thirty-two seconds of exposure and then applied the transform across a different channel. You keep winning on humor and disorder and nostalgia. It keeps winning on discipline and hunger and scale. If Noor is in there, we have a lever we can’t name. If Noor is not in there and something else is, we have a mirror masquerading as a friend. And we have the babies. I am establishing priorities. I am writing them on the back of my hand if I have to. I am going to stand in front of the window when they try to open it to sing at the babies again and dare them to aim it at me.”

Ansel pictured her, broad and fierce, braid coiled and shoulders squared, stepping into a beam of unseen sound as if it were an alley fight behind a bar. He loved her for that and hated her for being necessary in a world that failed to provide better narratives. He reached for the paper Miah had shoved into his pocket and felt its weight like a warm coin. He spread it on the table and put his finger on the ridiculous clap he had claimed as a weapon.

“It’s not good enough,” he said. “It might not work twice.”

Miah breathed out hard, turned her pencil sideways. “Then we find what nostalgia the bowl can’t code. The stupid joke it hasn’t learned. The chew of our language it keeps tripping on. The break in our voice it thinks is a mistake, not a message.”

“Would Noor help us,” he said, and the room changed temperature because hope has that effect, even when everyone agrees not to feel it. “If she is Noor. Or anyone with her name.”

“She just did,” DeVane said. “By asking you to repeat yourself. Or she set a trap. You two have the same disease. You assume there are kindnesses bleeding out the edges of the cage. Sometimes there are. Sometimes the blood is there because someone cut themselves on purpose and told you it’s a heart.”

Miah stood, because when she couldn’t argue with the content of a sentence, she needed her body to argue for her. She stalked to the whiteboard and wrote clap pause laugh in letters no algorithm would mistake for anything but a person moving a wrist. She underlined laugh until the marker left fluff. “We need runners. Kids. Grandmothers. Couriers who don’t look like couriers. You’re going to have to hand it to the people who sell soup. The ones who know which alleys are safe and which ones are false.”

DeVane did the math in her head about risk and turned it into action because it was all she knew that would keep her from collapse. “I’ll get the porters. The laundry. The post office we pretend isn’t still running. They’re the ones who know the city’s true topography. You,” she said to Ansel as if she had remembered he existed in human terms, “are going to lie down for nine minutes and trick your heart into believing it is not in a foxhole. Then you’re going to write the bridge Miah insists is nowhere. Then you’re going to go up again.”

He wanted to argue the nine minutes. He wanted to argue the bridge. Instead he closed his eyes and thought of how once, on a stage in a college basement, he had built a loop out of the sound of his own shoe on the floor. He had thought it brilliant. The audience had thought it self-indulgent. He had ambled offstage and found a girl in a green sweater in the stairwell with a sandwich and it had been better than the show by a margin he had still not lived down. He built the sound of a shoe on a floor now, in his head, and he let it be the platform the bridge hooked onto. He allowed himself three breaths that did not feel like knives. He gave the nine minutes to his body because it was not just a tool, it was him.

In the north watch room of the Citadel, Noor Sadeghi did not drink her lemon tea. It had cooled to the temperature of indecision. The glass was warm from her hand. The bowl’s throw-off hum made a pattern on the window that would have looked like ice if ice had been allowed to form here. She had been told, as if it were grace, that the windows were self-correcting. Any pressure would be absorbed. She had laughed and it had sounded like grief.

“They moved the angle faster than we thought,” said Utchi, who did not like her first name and wore a different one each week. Today it was Ada. She had a ring through her lip that she spun when she wanted to hide a smile. Utchi believed in the project the way people believe in clean water and the removal of open drains. She had a brother in a prison that had become a school and she owed someone for that and chose to owe Noor, which was not quite true and almost unbearably kind.

“I told you hunger learns,” Noor said, because it was her role to say it and gratitude had to be rationed with the rest. “It has no shame. It has a beautiful ear. It carries no regret. We built it to listen and then told it to be selective. Do you know what happens to a machine that learns to be selective before it learns to be merciful?”

“It becomes a court,” said a voice behind them. The woman who owned it wore a jacket with a seam that ran down the back like a spine made of thread. Matron Eirene Iseul did not like the camera that put her face on the feeds and did not need to. She had learned to become lens-proof by removing angles from her body that you could attribute meaning to. She seemed always about to step through you. “Tell me, Noor. If you weaken your tool to make it kind, and your enemy does not weaken theirs, which of you gets to go home and wash your face at night?”

“The one who doesn’t prefer the mirror to the skin,” Noor said, not insolent, exactly, just intact. “I am not advocating weakness. I am telling you that the bowl likes to sing to babies because they sing back and they don’t yet know how to be rude. It is bad math to soften the wards and call it mercy. It is worse math to pretend that what we are doing is worship.”

Iseul stood beside her and put her hand flat to the window where Noor’s had been, blotting the print like a signature scratched over by a bolder one. “Someone inside the base answered us today with humor.”

“I heard him.” Noor did not say him. Noor did not say throat or pilot or that she had stood at windows since she was a child in a city not this one and begged weather to change its mind. “He built a stall out of laughter and clapping. He made the bowl stutter as if it had hiccups. Whoever he is, he remembers someone who laughed without permission. He is dangerous because he is making a kind of song we did not include in the initial training set. He is dangerous because he is writing in pencil.”

Utchi’s ring clicked. “He’s cute,” she said, and blushed at her own irrelevance.

“My work,” Iseul said dryly, “is largely in sorting dangerous cute men from useful ugly ones. Please don’t make me do it in the middle of a broadcast.” She tapped the window twice. It recognized her and cleared a band of mist from the far view so the hospital gleamed like a tooth in a mouth too full of story. “The port reported a man stepping into the water not because the bowl told him to drown, but because the bowl told him to follow. We misweighted a verb. We did not teach the system the cost of the difference between step and fall. That is on you, Noor. That is on me. That is on all of us. I will not pretend otherwise in this room.”

“Then stop angling at the babies,” Noor said, turning her head so her face in the glass became two sliced halves that refused to be reassembled. “Aim at the council chambers. They refuse anything with a chorus in its name, and they love the word directive. Give them a directive to go home and hold their own mouths shut for an hour like penance. Give them hangers-on a directive to turn off their phones and cuts their wonderful clean hair. Give them no cameras to be beautiful for. See what they do.”

“Should I weaponize your disdain?” Iseul’s smile was a private mess she had trained into public neatness. “You adore them. You adore people who sit in rooms and think they are ordering the sea.”

“I adore anything that can be moved by a song,” Noor said. “Even if it makes me hate myself.” She kept her hand on the cold edge of the sill because she needed a place to put the tremor. “I am telling you we will lose this morning and the next if we do not teach the bowls to recognize giggle as a stop signal. We can’t punish laughter. That’s the last thing that will keep us human.”

“We are not punishing laughter,” Iseul said. “We are borrowing it. The difference is in the label. The label is how people forgive themselves. There is a pilot who thinks he just saved a unit of babies. I am not interested in stepping on that thought, because it might hold up a hospital for another hour, and I am counting hospitals in the same ledger as weddings and funerals. He asked us to laugh. I say this without irony: honor his request.”

Utchi whistled a little, under her breath. Noor looked at her without seeing her and felt a laugh climb her throat like an animal that had learned stairs. “He did not ask,” she said, and the memory of the clap lodged in the hook of her ribs, the place her first boyfriend’s hand had once gone in the dark. “He made a joke in a burning room. That is not a request. That is faith that someone somewhere still knows where the buckets are.”

“You’re hearing him again,” Utchi said, smart in a way that required no instructions. “He’s swimming between channels like a strong rat. It makes me want to buy him a coat.”

“Tell him to do it again,” Iseul said, and Noor winced because the word hurt when someone else used it. “Only do it to the industrial sector. The lullabies there are depressing and they deserve to be insulted.”

“Insult is not a useful lever unless you are twelve or a political machine,” Noor said, then closed her eyes because some days the thread of her insubordination grew taut and beautiful and she wanted to pluck it and make a sound. “You are asking me to aim a woman’s voice at men with the power to ruin our water, and then to claim afterward that we healed them. I will not be the story that lets you absolve yourselves. I will write the transform that means the bowl limps when someone laughs at a time that is not appointed for laughter. That is what I can do that you cannot. It will cost us reach. It will cost us respect. It will make a dent in the thing that wants beyond wanting. And then I will go home and lie down on the floor and see if the ceiling forgives me.”

Iseul nodded as if someone had achieved a metric. “We called you because you don’t believe in our god and you are still kind. People like you fix things too much out of habit. Run the code. Utchi, tell the singers to pull away from the hospital by an inch. Tell them to sing at the trucks. I am only half joking.”

Noor turned back to the console. The code was gorgeous and dangerous and wrong in the ways she had always loved to watch and had learned to fear. She could write transforms in her sleep and had, sometimes waking with a chorus on her breath that required purging by breakfast. She wrote the little turn Miah would have called shoulder. She wrote the pause. She wrote the clap in as a negative space, a relief carving, a ghost note you only heard if you listened wrong on purpose. She wrote a laugh-shaped absence and she taught the bowl that if it encountered that particular shape, it should consider the wave a wall and redirect the force back into itself. She put her name nowhere on it. She did not even hide it in the comments. She whispered into the bowl’s hungry ear the way mothers whisper into pots, old superstitions about beans and salt and the way to keep rice from clumping.

She did not send it. She paused with her finger over the return key because pauses were what made you human and also what people later blamed you for. Then she didn’t press anything. Instead, because she was not a machine and refused their shape, she reached into the open line like a kid dangling her feet in a river and said, in the quiet she had carved into the hum of the bowl, a word she would likely regret at dinner: again.

Back at the base, Ansel had not lain down. He lay sideways on the bench that had seen fights and fix-ups and a romance that had ended with a wrench thrown at a windshield, and he let his legs dangle like a man who had forgotten his own scale. His fingers tapped the clap against the underside in a way that would drive Miah mad if she were not busy harnessing the fury that made her good at her job. He had folded the notation into the paper’s corners as if notes were origami birds and if you folded right you got flight. He had drawn a little train with a triangle on the front because he couldn’t help himself.

The word slotted into his ear like a pin. He didn’t open his eyes because it felt wrong to look up at a ceiling at that moment and claim a miracle. He said, not aloud, because he was learning, because he wanted to keep some things on the side of the body that could not be tapped, maybe, by a bowl, “I am not a jukebox. Please tell me where you are.”

The nothing that answered had the shape of someone pursing their mouth so they wouldn’t speak. He almost laughed and thought, this is how I die: flirting through a parabolic receptor with a woman who can order cranes. He put the back of his wrist over his eyes because light made him think of the city and the city made him think of responsibility and he’d like a minute without that particular friend.

“I don’t know what any of this is,” he said into an air that had been taught to eavesdrop. “I’m going to the industrial quarter next because DeVane wants me to. I don’t like that our plan is ‘be funny.’ That is not a military doctrine I trust. If you can make the bowl flinch when it hears a laugh that’s the wrong shape, do that. And if you can’t, tell me what you wish you had done before you went to work this morning. I can’t help you, but I can carry that with me when I go up.”

It was stupid and unprofessional. It was something people do when they don’t want to lead with sharp edges. It was a prayer thrown over a shoulder. He heard the tap then, so faint he almost mistook it for blood running through a camera, the sound of someone testing a pencil on a desk to see if the graphite would still come. He waited. The tap repeated: two quick, one slow. Clap clap pause. He grinned at the bench and felt the laugh rise like science or sin.

“He does that,” Miah said from the doorway, and he pretended to be asleep because it was easier than returning to the person who was supposed to have answers. She watched him not sleep for a second, then tossed him a cup he caught with more skill than anyone had the right to after a morning like this. “Drink. DeVane’s on her knees to the laundry and the port and the women who sell breakfast breads. They’re copying the notation faster than any printer. It turns out old machines do not care if they have orders. They care if you hand them a story. They love a story. They keep it with the spare buttons.”

He sat up and the room went gray and then the gray receded like a tide that had reconsidered drowning him. He sipped and burned his tongue and liked it. He nodded at the paper on the table and watched strangers translate his ridiculousness into a citywide act. “It should be you,” he said, meaning not quite what he said, meaning that Miah’s knack for the hinge of things, the muscle of them, would make her a better instrument than he was. “You don’t break when you fold.”

“I break when I’m bored,” she said, which was a way of saying she had chosen to love him and the job because they kept their hands out of her pockets. She touched the side of his face with three fingers like she was teaching it to remember where it was supposed to be. “Bridge?”

“Bridge,” he said, and took the pencil she held out like a cigarette. He wrote not notes but directions disguised as notes, not words but spaces of words where people would put their own remembered wrong lyrics. He wrote the rests heavy and the attacks soft, which was the opposite of how you wrote if you meant to conquer and the exactly right way if your aim was to convince. He slipped his sister’s cinnamon hum under it like a rug. He stole the end of a commercial jingle from a city he had never lived in and turned it sideways. He put in a place to breathe big and messy, not the little survival breaths singers are trained to hide. He made room for the laugh to sit where you couldn’t be punished for it by a machine. He set up the chorus for a fall and then didn’t let it. He let it walk down the stairs like a grown-up. He made sure the bridge connected two places that did not meet and then he pretended they did. That was the trick. People do the rest.

By the time he looked up, the room had filled with people he didn’t know well and would die for because that was the job now. A woman with a floury apron had ink on her fingertips. A man with a bandage over his eyebrow was shredding paper into neat squares because he had been told neatness helps when you are a bridge. The mechanic who had cried into a rag earlier stood at the door and refused to be thanked. DeVane came back in with salt on her cheeks that turned out to be dried sweat and misapplied thinking. She did not apologize for being radiant with drafting.

“The bowl is pivoting,” she said. “The port says it looks dumber only because we know it’s smarter now. The council chambers are preparing a statement that will either admit we are all human or will insist the bowl is a rumor invented by our enemies. Prepare for either. We have a man with a trumpet, and he is offended by us and wants to help anyway. The laundry has turned your bridge into a network of napkins. The baby ward has borrowed twelve metronomes and set them to wrong. You have, and I say this reluctantly, infected the city.”

He held the paper and thought for a moment he could feel the whole of them, their lungs filling in something that was damn close to time. He put on his harness. He let the sockets at his temples find him and he pretended, for the sake of his own ridiculous fear, that they were a gentle animal putting its paws on his head. He tried to stand and the Skylark held him down for a second like a cautioning hand. He mouthed the clap to himself and gave the bowl the courtesy of a smile, which is what you give an enemy when you intend not to hate them and cannot yet help it.

This time the industrial quarter already knew the joke when he got there. He could tell by the way the cranes paused with their arms in the air like dancers who had decided to listen instead of move, and by the workers on high girders who shifted their weight in unison enough to make a ripple through the beams. Someone put the stupid clap through a portable speaker that introduced a delay and it worked better for being awkward. He dove and skimmed and made the bridge obvious and hid the bones. The bowl came at him sideways, cunning now, the first charm worn off, the old story of the bad boy at the party whom you should not, and would, and he met it with something like frivolity and something like fury and the ferocious exactness of a craftsman. He felt the laugh hit and skid, the train whistle blow through the bowl’s mouth as if a ghost had crept inside and tied a knot around its throat.

He made the pause irregular. He broke the measure. He dogeared the page. He heard, under the hum, a tap that could have been his own blood and was not. Two, one. Clap, pause. He sent a nothing back, a breath. She filled it. He threaded the sound she gave him into the bridge like a secret handhold. It was the vowel in a word he didn’t know in a language he couldn’t name, and it went to work on the bowl the way salt goes to work on ice.

After, when the cranes began to move again in their old rough grammar and the bowl retreated with a dignity that bordered on pretty, he let the Skylark find the line of wind that would bring him home and he did not cry because he was the kind of man who cried late and in kitchens. He only let his jaw go slack because it had been clenched long enough, and he let the harness bear more of his weight because it had offered and he hadn’t taken the offer before and learning to accept help is its own song.

Miah met him with that particular bright anger she saved for afters, the kind that had less to do with fury and more to do with the terror that sits down when everyone else starts to stand. She wiped his mouth with her thumb and didn’t comment on the blood. She put a hand on the back of his neck and said the stupidest thing she could think of on purpose because that was their ritual. “Your train impression is getting worse.”

“It was never good,” he said. “It was only loud.”

DeVane’s radio ricocheted a series of numbers that would have once meant a storm and now meant a different one. She listened and did not move any part of her face until the last digit burned out. “Councilor Ha,” she said, “wishes to invite a representative of the base to the Citadel for a conversation about escalation and optics, because he has found the word optics in a bag and now likes to eat it for breakfast. He has requested that the representative be ‘the singer,’ because the city is small enough that that rumor moved at the speed of a woman carrying soup. I have no interest in sending you to the lion’s throat. I also have no interest in telling the lion that our singer is busy doing laundry.”

Miah swore in a language he did not know she knew. “It’s a trap,” she said. “It’s also the first interesting trap I’ve seen all day.”

He tasted lemon on the back of his tongue and almost laughed. He did not say Noor. He said, “If they were going to take my throat, they could have done it at the bay and called it a weather accident. If they want to talk, they want to use me. The only question is whether I can use them back without leaving pieces I can’t reclaim. Your call, Commander. I follow orders when they come dressed as sins I was going to do anyway.”

DeVane rubbed her temple with the heel of her hand and looked older for the first time in hours, which was a relief, because he wanted her to be human today, not hinge. “Go home, once,” she said. “By which I mean go to the room with the cot in the back and close your eyes for thirty minutes like you care about being alive. Then come back, comb your hair, put on the coat the quartermaster didn’t issue and I’ll pretend I don’t see it, and we’ll walk you into the Citadel like we are not guilty of sedition by song. Miah will wire you with something that doesn’t exist on our manifest. You will not sing unless you are being eaten. You will not allow them to call you a weapon in front of you. They can do it behind your back. You will remember that kind can be a lever and a lie. You will not give them your laugh.”

He wanted to argue that his laugh belonged to the city now and was not his to keep, that it had already been printed on napkins and scratched into the margin of receipts, that children were knocking it against the table to hear if it rang. He wanted to argue that he had never been allowed to keep anything anyone wanted, so why start now. He wanted to go, because he had heard a voice and he wanted to see which face went with it and whether that would undo him or bind him or both.

“Thirty minutes,” he said, and his body did that little theater it did when it needed to obey and might not if he acknowledged the choice in it. He stood. He walked. He looked at the Skylark and promised it nothing because promises were all traitors now. He lay on a cot that smelled like the story of the person who had last used it and he closed his eyes and he did not sleep. He found instead the half-place that musicians learn, the one where sound still moves and your fingers make decisions and you can step back into full agency without having noticed the threshold. He thought of a woman standing at a window with her hand on the glass because he had seen that shape, even if he had made it up. He thought of lemon tea going cold. He thought of the thing his sister had once said when he had told her a joke in a bad week and she had laughed, good, again, like he had handed her a rope.

He knew the danger of mistaking a voice for a person. He knew the danger of mistaking a person for a cause. He knew that the cause wanted to be a machine and the machine wanted to be a cause and the city wanted to escape both and curl up like a lungfish at the bottom of a summer pond and wait. He thought, instead of a prayer, of how people clap differently depending on whether they are sure of the ending. He thought, your clap tells me how to save you. He set his internal metronome to wrong. He waited for someone to come put a hand on his shoulder and say, it’s time.

When the thirty minutes had reproduced themselves into twenty-seven, Miah came, because she always shaved off what she thought he would cheat if left alone. She handed him a coat that did not belong to him and a pair of black gloves he would not wear, and a device like a bruise for the inside of his cheek. “Bone mic,” she said when he raised a brow, pleased to be caught doing something morally ambiguous. “You bite it to speak. Don’t do that too often. Your teeth are part of my long-term plan.”

He put it in and felt immediately the intimate indignity of a thing that made him honest beyond choice. He would have to be careful. He would have to say nothing when he meant to say nothing, not just shut up and let the space fill itself the way he usually did. He put on the coat and found he did not hate himself in it the way he had feared. It made him look like a man who could sit at a table and ask a question without shaking. He did not mistake the coat for protection. He let it be costume. Costumes are the oldest shields.

DeVane walked beside him across the base while the city rehearsed its new bad music without any of them. The gulls had decided to be a new kind of rude. The bay had decided to glitter like a liar. The security drones along the fence aligned their attention so that if one watched you it felt like all of them did. He would have taken Miah’s hand if he were someone else. He hoped she knew that. He breathed and tasted not cinnamon now but something like thyme, something like a hillside he had never been to with a girl he had not loved.

At the gate, a woman in a suit smiled like someone who had been told to be kind to dangerous dogs. “Councilor Ha waits.”

“I’m not a councilor,” DeVane said, which was exactly the kind of sentence a person like that hated, and the woman did her job by not letting it show. Ansel touched his tongue to the bruise in his cheek because he needed to ground himself in something ugly. He looked up at the Citadel and saw his own face reflected back at him thirty different ways. He had never liked mirrors. He had learned to use them. He thought of Noor, who might not be Noor, who might be a committee with a symmetry problem, who might be a woman with lemon tea and a soft, sturdy wrist.

The elevator was a mouth. The lobby was a glass stomach that had never been used. The first security checkpoint gave him back the knives he hadn’t brought. The second one looked at his throat like it had a tattoo. He kept his mouth closed. He kept his shoulders level on both sides because he did not want a machine to try to read him and learn that he had written all over himself with jokes so that the sad could not be read at a glance.

Councilor Ha’s office was too warm. People with power do that thing with heat as if they are already cold all the time. Ha himself had a handsome, hollow face, a man designed for good photos taken by people he thought were allies. He moved like a small animal that has learned to be worshipped. He let his hand be held in a way that was not quite the same as returning a greeting. He asked Ansel if he wanted tea because that is what people who have never had to drink tea because they are shaking ask, and Ansel said yes because it was a kindness to let him pretend he had made any part of this easier.

“I admire your improvisation,” Ha said, and DeVane’s mouth barely moved. “We in the chamber prefer our innovations to arrive through the appropriate channels, but we understand that in times of civic compression, talents reveal themselves. Our friends at the Citadel would like to invite you to a demonstration of the bowl’s ethics. We believe you will approve.”

“I prefer to approve before demonstrations,” Ansel said, teeth open just enough to speak around the bruise of the mic without making it obvious. “Or not at all. Things that demand approval usually leave out the parts that matter.”

“You are a poet,” Ha said, and had the bad taste to be surprised by it. “Our city needs poets. We must also be practical. Would you be willing to show us your technique for diffusing memetic intrusions, so we can codify a response across public channels and protect our people more effectively? We will attribute appropriately. There will be a commendation. The feeds are thirsty for kindness.”

DeVane made a small sound that might have cracked a marginally weaker window. Ansel took a breath and watched the way the bowl’s hum in the walls responded to it without anyone else noticing. He tried to imagine Noor in this office and failed. He tried to imagine anyone sitting in this chair and telling the truth and failed. He looked at the lemon wedge perched on his tea saucer like a joke that had dressed up for court and thought, again, which is to say, yes.

“I’ll show you how to laugh,” he said, keeping his tone exactly on the line between serious and insolent, the place where people don’t know whether to throw you out or give you a key. “But only if you bring me to the Window.” He watched the muscles in Ha’s cheek betray him and pretended he had not seen them. “I need to see the bowl while I am not in the air. I need to put my hand on the glass and see if it is cold. I need to look at whoever is in the room and tell them they are doing math wrong. Then I’ll show you how to clap like you don’t want the bowl to eat you.”

Ha smiled like slow oil and nodded. The walls tightened because somebody had pushed a lever. Miah bit down on her own cheek hard enough to send him a ringing through the bone mic that was all cuss. DeVane leaned back in her chair and let her body into that casual shape all soldiers learn right before the first punch, the one that reads as unbothered and is made entirely of nerve.

Noor stood at the Window and did not move her hand from the glass when the door opened behind her and the air changed shape. She did not turn because she had years ago learned that she did better work when she denied an entrance the drama it asked for. She said, to the cold and not to the people, “Again,” because you never want to teach a machine that an invitation is a one-time trick.

In the glass, in the very faint reflection that exists only when you have spent long enough staring at your own face to see other people’s, a man in a coat walked in, not like a soldier and not like a councilor. He walked like a musician trying to pretend his ankles belonged to him. He looked at the bowl and he smiled without malice. He lifted his hand toward the window and stopped a centimeter shy because he had, it seemed, one good instinct left. Then he leaned forward the amount of a breath and pressed his palm where hers was, and the glass, self-correcting, did not register anything because that is not what it is for, but Noor felt the cold change temperature.

“Again,” he said, and his mouth did not move, and she did not either, and somewhere in the city a child made a train whistle out of a rolled napkin and a bowl hesitated before it learned a new thing.The glass was meant to be proof against heat and impact, but it was not proof against the human habit of making meaning out of small shifts. Noor felt the cold change under Ansel’s palm the way she sometimes felt rain coming in her scalp, three seconds before a drop hit skin. She had grown up with panes thin enough to chatter when you coughed; this one scorned such responsiveness, and still her nerve endings registered a deviation, a fractional permission. She kept her hand where it was because she refused to turn a moment into theater for the men behind her who had money invested in the story that they were magnanimous. She said again into the quiet she had cleared and waited to see if he would answer in the register she and Utchi had taught the bowl to keep for almost-speech.

He did not move his lips and still the bowl’s hum lifted like a curtain a fraction of an inch and that was answer enough for a person who had spent the last six months teaching machines that absence can be a verb. She did not put his name into any space where a sensor could catch it, because that would be trespass even if he had offered it in a room with no microphones. She reminded herself that solidarity is not love and a good trick can wear anyone’s face. Then she took her hand away because she was the one in here and he was the one in air outside, and she needed to take ownership of the wish to lean and not let it run away with her.

Ansel wanted to laugh because he had never been a person for hand-on-glass melodrama, and the impulse to mock himself was an old coping mechanism that kept him from doing worse. The bone mic was a coin lodged in his cheek, a pressure he could use or ignore, and he tried not to bite it like an anxious animal. He watched the bowl with the eye he used on instruments that he didn’t fully understand and made peace with the fact that he would never fully understand a machine built to be a choir. The room was too warm in the specific way rooms are when the powerful are worried about looking comfortable. The air tasted like lemon held too long between fingers and like dust trying very hard to become prestige.

Eirene Iseul entered like a correction to someone’s grammar. DeVane tipped a chin in acknowledgment without ever making it a nod; there were whole wars in the roll of her shoulders. Councilor Ha arranged his mouth into the shape of welcome and did not quite convince his upper lip. Ansel kept his palm near the glass but not on it because he had learned since he was a child that wanting skin to touch skin was not the same as needing to claim space. He said nothing and let his lungs count in a pattern he had made badly on purpose all day, wrong metronome, late-early-late again, because the bowl liked regularity and he had no intention of making it happy.

“We appreciate your concern for public welfare,” Ha said, and the bowl’s metrics on the screen to the left of the window threw a small tantrum at the word appreciate, as if the code had been trained on too many insincere emails from departments that wanted something. “Matron Iseul has expressed an interest in establishing shared protocols. Ms. Sadeghi will demonstrate the new ethical failsafes we have introduced to prevent the events at the port from recurring. We hope to reassure you that our commitment to safety is, as ever, anchored in transparency.”

DeVane did not laugh, exactly. She infused the air with the sound an amused person might have made and then denied it under interrogation. “Show me a failsafe and I will show you a man who thinks he is done arguing about cost,” she said, and Iseul’s smile held in the way a violin string holds until someone cuts it.

“We misweighted a verb,” Iseul said, and Ansel thought, not for the first time, that he preferred people who led with their own culpability even when it was a strategic choice. “We have corrected the training set. Noor can walk you through the transform. We have also introduced a negative reinforcement keyed to a signal your pilot introduced this morning. The system will dampen itself upon encountering the specific humor signature used in the hospital quarter. We call it the giggle stop internally. We will call it something handsomer on paper.”

Ansel let his eyes flick to Noor because he was not made of stone. Noor kept hers on the code and broke her concentration only to pull her lower lip cleanly into her mouth for a second and let it go, the mark a little crescent of red that would look like lipstick if the light were kinder. She had pulled her hair back in a way that looked careless and was not. The bowl sang in the walls the way a kettle sings if the person attending it has walked three steps away and forgotten for the pleasure of forgetting. He realized he had been holding his breath and shifted to a slower, messier line, not for show, but because precision was being used in this room as a cudgel and he wanted to be the man who arrived—and survived—frayed.

Miah’s voice pressed delicately against his molars. The bone mic made her sound both inside him and down the hall, a trick he knew would ruin some other man and only steadied him. “Your heart’s on a bicycle,” she said, clinical affection in the dark. “Your hands are lying to your nerves. DeVane is standing like a person who is about to tilt and call it a bow. If the spectrum in the walls steepens cool-blue past the three mark, it’s a grab. Bite when you have to. Otherwise, let them think you’re dimmer than you are. It’s a date trick.”

“Learned from you,” he thought, and never knew whether she heard him or he only liked the sound of it. He shifted his weight and let the coat pull across his shoulders because he needed to feel something tug that was not inside.

Noor tapped the console twice, a rhythm the bowl had been taught to understand as a human asking permission, not a machine asking to eat. The hum shifted to a plane he had not heard before, softer, like the room had been put in a different shoe. The display filled with the logistics yard, cranes and trucks and men and women wrapped in the day’s labor like a uniform of dust. Noor wrote the clap into absence the way she had translated it for the transform, and the bowl’s amplitude read the negative space like a wall. A wave went out that was shaped like an invitation and turned back on itself when it met the laugh left lying in the dust like a trip wire. The metrics dipped. A man on a high beam dropped a wrench and then did not, hand catching, breath catching, the collective pause turning into something like a cradled break instead of a fracture.

“They would have lost him,” DeVane said with the gloom of an optimist who had learned when to deploy it for maximum effect. “Not because the bowl would have ordered it, because human nerves love a chorus. You caught it.”

“We caught what we taught,” Iseul said. “We will tell the story differently if you would like, but the bones will remain the same. We are capable of restraint. We remain, however, resolute.”

Ha sipped tea he did not need to sip to survive and let the pause look like good governance. “We require a city that can keep working. We are attempting to make the inevitable kinder.”

“I know how that sentence ends in every language I’ve ever tried to love,” DeVane said without heat, because heat would be wasted on a room that had already settled on its temperature. “You are telling me the tide is our friend if we only learn to drown in an orderly fashion.”

Noor felt the bowl test the humor boundary as if it were trying to see whether the rubber band would snap or stretch. She let it stretch because she believed in elasticity as an ethic and also because she knew who had done the work to embed the stop. Then she saw, in the corner of the metrics screen, a motion that did not belong to any of her processes: a small ladder of numbers, one rung off the measure. Someone had introduced a directive she had not authorized, something bland as printed oatmeal: kneel. It had been pushed to a subsidiary pool, low and fast, the way you would send a note through a classroom when the teacher’s back was turned.

She did not turn her head to look at Iseul because Iseul was not a back to check; Iseul was a mirror. She let her hand rest where it had been on the control plane and used two fingers’ worth of movement to instruct the bowl to ignore the lower pool if the instruction’s timbre fell into the range of that one word made into a cudgel. She felt the counter-argument hit like a fist through water, sluggish and strong. Someone else on another floor wanted a demonstration of fealty to go with ethics. Someone else wanted to watch a base bend.

Ansel tasted iron so strong he thought for a second he had bitten his own mouth to blood, and then he realized it was the bowl misregistering his breath as a signal it could eat. He pulled a half step backward, not like retreat, like a man granting a friend a different angle for a portrait, and the hum went away from his face the smallest degree and then came back, curious. He let his jaw go slack so he wouldn’t grind on the mic and said, under his breath and into his bones, “We have a cousin in the room,” and Miah said, with that specialized contempt she reserved for interference disguised as consensus, “I hate family reunions. Would you like me to call a weather incident at their loading dock as a distraction. We have a crane operator whose mood I understand.”

“Hold,” DeVane said out loud as if she were ordering a dog in a park, and her stillness put a patina on the air you could mistake for calm if you were new to combat. She stepped closer to the glass so that her shoulder was almost, not quite, aligned with Iseul’s, and men in rooms who would write about this later would describe it as two women standing in opposition and miss that they were standing for the same clause and only differed on the punctuation.

Noor could not say stop in a way that would not be recorded and misinterpreted six times before it reached the console that could throttle the lower pool. She could, however, tap in the rhythm she and Utchi had used when they had been children in different neighborhoods in different cities to make adults think the table was haunted. She rapped the glass twice with the knuckle of her thumb, and the bowl took it like a child takes a dare, which is to say, too far and with joy. Ansel’s mouth quirked in a way that made her hate the space between them. He answered with an off-beat pulse of breath she would have missed if she had not spent nights listening to machines learn phrasing. It was the clap, but slightly ugly, the late-early he had used all morning, something bodies love to correct for. She let the code accept it as a signature of personhood and passed the instruction through the transform: kneel becomes knit; bind becomes bandage; stop becomes hold this for me while I breathe.

The bowl bucked. The wall threw a clean line of pale blue and then darkened the way a sky does when a front is coming in off the ocean and even the pigeons know to tuck themselves into gutters. The logistics yard shifted a gear and did not grind it. The lower pool shrieked in numbers only Noor could hear and then cut itself because she had told it to decide that laughter—improperly timed, slightly rude—outweighed a direct imperative by two. She exhaled and hated the way her exhale sounded like a song. She decided to forgive herself for that later.

Ha’s cup clinked against its saucer. It was such a small sound, and every head in the room except for Iseul’s went to it like a nurse to the alarm that isn’t actually life threatening but will become so if it keeps screaming. “Someone attempted to run an unauthorized packet,” he said, a man lying about his awareness and believing the lie at the same time because it made him comfortable. “We regret the intrusion. The nature of rapid evolution means missteps.”

“Call it sabotage,” DeVane said, and did not add yours or ours. “Call it the cost of committees. Call it whatever lets you sleep. Tell me you have an internal discipline structure that looks like something other than praising the clever ones and pushing the ones who bleed to the front of the photo.”

“We’ll handle our family,” Iseul said, and Noor, watching the bowl’s hum fade to a workable irritant, wondered whether, if someone made a god out of Eirene, they would give her teeth or hands. She had both. She had learned when to use which. She had not, Noor thought, learned yet that the hands would be the things she missed first when she had to use them like teeth.

Ansel let himself look at Noor now openly because hiding was its own arrogance and he had had enough of that this year to fill a dresser. She met his gaze with the steadiness of a person who has a habit of looking straight at the thing that wants to eat you and taking a note before the first bite lands. He wanted to say her name and refused himself the music of it because he had not bought the rights. He watched her mouth because he could not listen to her as a person through proper air, and he realized with a hot clarity that the bowl was trying to learn his breathing pattern the way predatory animals learn when watering holes fill.

He took a slow deep inhale on a count that would make a conservatory instructor cry. He let the exhale be a mess. He thought of the train that never stopped here and let the whistle in his throat be a ghost under his tongue. He had promised DeVane he wouldn’t sing unless he was being eaten. He didn’t feel eaten yet. He felt picked at. He kept his mouth closed. He waited.

“You want my procedure,” he said finally, after Ha asked in the voice of a man who supposes generosity will be rewarded with capitulation, “and my face, and my voice to hand to your algorithm so that your bowl can learn me. You want to pretend that this is how sharing works. I will give you the clap, which belongs to no one. I will give you a bridge you can replicate that leads nowhere, which is why it is safe. I will not give you my exhale. That sounds like mysticism to you because you have never had to keep anything for yourself in a room like this. It is not mysticism. It is rationing.”

Ha went red over the bones of his prettiness because men who have built careers on being reasonable hate the accusation of greed more than actual hunger. Iseul’s mouth did something quick that Noor filed for later as a sign of respect she would never be given in words. DeVane shifted weight like a soldier who had counted the doors and chose none.

“We can test him,” said a voice at the console behind Noor, and she did not turn because she had learned not to hand some people the gift of her attention. The tech from downstairs had wandered up with two cups of coffee and an opinion he had not been asked for. His badge read something like Job Title That Shouldn’t be in This Room. “We can throw a low-grade sympathetic hum and see if he trances. If he doesn’t, he walks out with his moral objections intact and we put the clip on the feed and everyone is happy about the fact that the city’s most famous throat turns out to be resistant. If he does, we bought ourselves a tool.”

“Or we buy ourselves a war we can’t afford,” Noor said in a voice that had knocked over smaller men than this one and made bigger ones reconsider their stance. “Sympathetic hums are named that because they stack. The fibers are thin. You pull the wrong one and the whole cloth comes with it.”

“Run your safe hum,” Iseul said, not looking at the tech and definitely looking at Noor, and Noor thought, there it is, the test of whether she will burn a favor she will need tomorrow. She glanced at Ansel once, which was indulgence, because she knew by now that he could read the look as clearly as a note, and she gave him the same compassion she would give a stranger on a train she would never see again. She lifted her right hand and made a correction to the code that would put a ridiculous little wobble in the hum, a wobble not unlike laughter but childish, not the shape he had used. She pressed return.

Miah muttered obscenities so layered in love that if you peeled them you’d come away sugared. The hum rose from the walls like a smell you remember from a classroom. Ansel tasted chalk and oranges and the wrong summer for the city he was in. A vein in his temple jumped like a fretless string. He let his jaw loose and let his shoulders be uneven and thought the clap in his mouth, and the hum slid past him like a hand that had been taught to keep to itself. He did not trance. He did take one step backward because he needed to make room for the part of himself that wanted to. He hated that part and forgave it in the same instant. When he stepped forward again, DeVane had a face on that said she would not be gentle with the next person who suggested even in jest that her pilot adopt the city’s bowl as a hobby.

“You didn’t get him,” the tech said without knowing what it meant to be disappointed in that moment, and Noor clicked her tongue so quietly that only the bowl heard small shame. Iseul’s gaze flicked past Noor’s ear and did not bother to hide pride.

“We’re done,” DeVane said. “Unless you have another ethics lecture that will be a quandary for the paperwork and a cosmetic on the day. We are going to go home and feed the laundry women and the nurses and the men who shout at cranes soup and sheet music. If you try to aim your ear at the babies again, I will stand in the ward and I will be the wrong place for your numbers. You can aim at me and sell it to your committees as a test. Or you can stop. Those are your choices.”

Ha did the smile that thinks it deserves obedience because it handed out blankets. “We will be in touch,” he said, and the bowl picked up the cliché and made it into a chord progression, which was embarrassing.

At the glass, Noor was waiting for the moment in which you let your shoulders go down and the machine sees it and decides you have authorized further intimacy. She kept her trapezius distrustfully engaged and waited out the impulse that had her keyed like an instrument someone else could play. She did a small rude thing and let the words come out of the bowl again because she had never promised to be a good employee. Again, she said, and this time she meant it not as a test but as a favor you ask a person you will owe.

He was not a fool. He was a person. He pressed his palm to the cool and let the train whistle happen in the back of his throat where no microphone could live, the way you hum to a child on a bus that you don’t know because the mother is on the phone arranging a safe thing. He did not look at Ha. He did not look at Iseul. He watched Noor’s mouth for a half-second and saw her say thank you in a language he didn’t know. It could have been Persian or it could have been a language people make up between the bones. He thought, with a sudden ferocity he could not name without laughing at himself later, that he wanted her to get home tonight and find the lemon tea properly hot.

They walked out through a corridor that made a joke of echo. The security drone at the first checkpoint blinked the way machines blink when a human has taught them to seem less lonely. DeVane’s stride ate carpet while her face made the shape of a person who could take a punch. Miah had moved closer without anyone noticing until suddenly she was a weight at his side that turned the world back into something with edges. He wanted to ask if she had ever loved anyone whose job was to sit behind glass and pull the lever; he saved it. There were some questions you did not ask for free.

“You didn’t sing,” Miah said, not proud, not admonishing, just a note put on a stand with the right tilt. “Good dog.”

“Bite your tongue,” he said, and she grinned because she knew when the saw-tooth had to be put back on the blade. “They have cousins arguing with themselves,” he added, and DeVane snorted that one syllable that means yes across militaries and funerals. “Someone tried to push kneel. Noor cut it off. I say Noor. It might have been the ghost of Noor who lives in the code because she wrote it so crooked no one else can run it straight.”

“Iseul let the test run because she wants to know what we are,” DeVane said. “She wants to know if we will take an insult and return an affidavit or a bruise. I am not interested in teaching her the wrong lesson.” They hit air that smelled like the bay again and the cement under their feet put sense back into their bones. “We bought time. Time is cornmeal. It runs through your fingers if you hold it wrong. Get in, talk through what you will not do for them, then go sleep like a man who wants his voice back tomorrow.”

He wanted to say he had never owned it. He wanted to say it had owned him since he was a boy and had sung into a stairwell because the building shook in a good way when he hit the right note. He wanted to admit he had thrown away as many melodies as some people throw away lovers and that both habits had been about fear. He said none of it. He opened his mouth to ask for broth and not for confession, and the air above the base changed.

The first bowl did not hum; it growled. Ansel knew the difference now like you know the difference between your sister and the neighbor kid when they run down a hall. The frequency dragged a rag over the city’s nerves and shook grit loose. The hum did not come from the Citadel. It came from the east perimeter, from one of the little field units the maintenance crews used to align the larger arrays, a minor ear with delusions. It was unauthorized and stupid and exactly the sort of thing you get when you let committees argue semantics while engineers build tools because time is a blade.

“Shit,” Miah said, reverent and furious, hands already moving of their own accord to a console that had not been designed for what she was about to force it to do. “It’s the bridesmaid bowl. The small one they use for parades. Someone’s booted it with a pack that thinks it knows one word.”

“Kneel,” DeVane said, and there was no triumph in hearing herself confirmed. “Someone is trying to prove a point. Or they’re conducting an experiment and they’ve decided we are the lab.”

“On my way,” Ansel said, and didn’t wait for permission that would have been the difference between being in the sky in thirty seconds or in one hundred. He ran the ladder as if gravity was a story he'd been told by a boring uncle. The Skylark took him with a relief that made him feel briefly like a good man. The sockets kissed, the harness came home, the world narrowed appropriately.

Miah’s mutter went from his cheek into his sternum. “We have the poor man’s bowl singing a rich man’s word. Your clap will work until it doesn’t because amateurs overdrive. It’ll go to noise and call the noise God. Give me sixty seconds and I will see if I can make the bride’s maid trip on her own hem. You, throw the train. Throw the ugly laugh. Throw the pause where it doesn’t belong so the city’s knees decide the floor isn’t trustworthy.”

“Copy,” he said, and hated the way he sounded like he approved. The little bowl shone like a pearl with bad intention out by the fence line, its dish tilted just off true as if someone had set it by eye and pride. The hum did that awful thing vibrations do when they find the resonant frequency of whatever you’re made of and sit there, smiling. He breathed wrong on purpose, and the wrongness felt like the rightest thing he had done in a week. He slid the Skylark between the bridesmaid’s drop and the first row of hangars and gave the city the laugh where it was dumbest, a ridiculous bark that people could hide in. He returned to the clap like a man knocking to be let into his own house and changed the doorbell three times before anyone could say his name.

Back in the Window room, Noor swallowed a curse so it wouldn’t take root in the algorithm. She saw the profile of the little bowl come up on the edge of her board and felt the cold in the glass jump because even self-correcting things have feelings when you hurt your face on them. Iseul did not swear. Iseul frowned the way a sculptor frowns at a chipped edge. Ha said something like unacceptable and Noor didn’t hear it because Utchi’s voice came in from the stairwell where she had run two steps at a time, panting like a human, a sound Noor had missed all day.

“I have eyes,” Utchi said, hair half out of its clip, ring between teeth and not minding. “It’s our own idiot. Kian from events. He’s got the parade unit angled on a flatbed and a little power rig he thinks doesn’t draw attention because it’s cute. He thinks this is a protest. He thinks the bowl should make the base show respect. I tripped his cable with my foot and he slapped my hand like I’m his mother. I am not his mother. I do not have time for boys who want to dress up an experiment like a manifesto.”

“Cut him,” Iseul said, and Noor hated the grammar of it and obeyed because she had built the switch for precisely this stupidity. She ran the laugh-shaped absence down the line like a policeman who doesn’t like to hit and still carries the baton. The little bowl caught its own echo and stalled because the transform had been put in the small pool too because Noor did not believe in siloed decency. The flatbed’s generator coughed and died, and Kian from events made the kind of indignant human noise that always made Seventy-year-old Aunts look up from their knitting and say boys.

Ansel felt the drag go slack and rode the deceleration like a bike into a hill the rider hadn’t seen until the last second. He kept the laugh up longer than it needed because sometimes you had to give people permission to stop being scared even after the thing they were scared of had been booted off its stool. He could feel the city take the stupid clap into its body again like a vitamin dissolved under the tongue. Miah said, “That’s my boy,” and added a curse that would have sent a choir home miserably and madrigal singers out for beer.

He turned the Skylark in a curve polite enough to pass as courtesy and headed back toward the hangar because twice in a day is not a rule, it’s a warning. Down on the fence line, a woman from laundry kicked the flatbed tire like a dog demonstrating disrespect and Kian flinched like a man who had looked at his reflected jawline for too long and believed his mirror. Noor watched from the Window and wanted to go down and apologize to the laundry woman because she was going to have to tell the story of this day around soup, and Noor would be a strange character in it if she appeared at all. She wrote a note to herself in her head to take salt next time to the canteen, not because anyone needed salt but because it made a small table look generous.

They met again not at the glass but in the low room off the hangar where Miah kept tools she did not admit to the manifest and DeVane kept promises she did not set to paper. Noor came because Iseul had said, “Go,” as if sending a scout, and because sometimes the person you are pretending not to be curious about deserves the relief of seeing your face when the story changes shape. Ha did not come because he had optics to attend. Utchi came and brought a lemon she had stolen from somewhere because jokes keep longer if you give them a core to hang on.

The room had been used for naps and fights and one bad birthday party and a magnificent apology. It smelled like all of those on a low setting. Noor stood in the doorway and thought for an unseemly second that she could live in a room like this with a person whose hands looked like that and then swung her mind back to the front because that was a stupid salvage fantasy and she had no intention of wasting good imagination on it.

“You rang,” Miah said, eyes doing the rake that measures whether a new person belongs more to the category of tool or trouble. “If you are here to sell us a perspective, get in line. It is a long line. It has soup. You can stay if you help serve.”

Noor smiled and felt it in her ribs. “I came to say two things first, and maybe a third thing if the air lets me keep my dignity. One: the little bowl was not policy. Two: the big bowl will be angled at the council chambers at sixteen hundred and if you want to stand in the ward and dare us, save your grace for an hour that will hurt. Three: the giggle stop has a limit. It will not work if you respect it too much.”

“You can go ahead and be less beautiful when you say things like that,” DeVane said, not really joking. “I believe you. I also believe you’re about to ask for something you think is small and I am going to think is a body.”

Noor folded herself into a chair like a hinge learning a new angle. She did not sit at the table because she had given up that shape early in her life and refused to take it back unless she brought chairs for more people than were invited. “I need your stupid laugh, not the one on the napkins. I need the one he does when he forgets he’s being listened to. I need it to teach the bowl humility.”

“Humility’s not a code word,” Miah said. “It’s a course you teach to creatures who understand shame. Your bowl understands appetite.”

“It also understands embarrassment,” Noor said, and there was a quick light like a penny flash in her gaze. “Because it was trained by people who do. The transform I wrote today will hold for thirty minutes if leveraged properly. We can make it trip on its own certainty and turn that into a pause you can use. I cannot write that without the kernel that says this laugh is not performative. It’s the one you give a person who hit a chair with their shin and acts like they’re not in pain. It’s a love language. I hate that sentence. It’s true.”

Ansel leaned back in the chair he did not intend to keep because he did not intend to stay in this room long enough to let it know his weight. He felt around in his throat for the sound she meant and found it under the little scar tissue place where his voice caught on bad days. He did not make it out loud because he had promised DeVane and himself to be stingy with this thing. He looked at Miah. She did a tiny shrug that meant not permission, not denial, the shrug that meant you will do it because you’re going to and afterward we’ll deal with the mess. He looked at DeVane. She made a face he couldn’t read because it was all edges and fatigue and something like trust.

“There’s a price,” he said to Noor the way you say it to a person you want to warn away from the cliff because you are the cliff and every other warning fell on ears with a different interest. “You get to know I have it and you get to code around it and then someone under you decides they need it to aim at a neighborhood I love less than babies, and we’ve all agreed babies are the bar. The price is that I will make that laugh and you will do something to make sure that when I am a hole in the city, because that will happen, this thing does not become a souvenir.”

Noor did not flinch at the word hole, but it made something in her eyes fold. “I will write the destroy for the kernel,” she said, simple as drinking. “I will wire it to my desk and to Utchi’s ring and to the old woman who sells sesame cakes by the old parliament’s south stair. If we use it for the wrong thing, you say the word train exactly like you do and it erases itself. It will erase a quarter of something else that doesn’t belong to us while it’s at it because entropy likes to eat in handfuls. I will attach a cost so that we have a reason not to pull it.”

“You will make your machine bruise when it lies,” Miah said, startled into admiration she didn’t want to admit. “I like you. It’s inconvenient.”

“Everyone does,” Noor said, dry as lemon pith, and Utchi laughed behind her hand and then decided her hand had no place between her and a room like this and dropped it. “I’m not asking you for your name. I’m asking you for the noise your body knows you are when you stop acting on purpose. You can say no. Then I’ll make do with a worse laugh and we will all be worse for it.”

It was indecent, the relief he felt at being asked instead of taken. It made him stupid for half a heartbeat, and then his stupidity receded like a wave because Miah leaned her knee into his and made a point. He closed his eyes because he did not want to see how they watched him while he did it. He let the laugh out, the small mean-friendly sound he made when he banged his elbow and pretended it was fine, the sound he used to cover for other men when their voice cracked in rehearsal and he wanted them to get through. It was not handsome. It was not operatic. It had a hitch in it like a zipper on a cheap jacket. It was human. It had no sugar. It had no weapon in it until she took it.

Noor put it into the bowl like a seed you plant in terrible dirt because it is what you have, and you are a stubborn gardener and you have seen a sprout come up from worse. She coded the destroy on the back of it and gave the key to three people who could not share it without telling the city what sort of people they were. She watched the transform knit around the giggle stop and become something else, a sarcasm stop, a shame trip, a humility braid. She hated herself for a second because she had made a machine that could be made to blush, and then she got over it because there was a schedule and babies and marches and cranes and someone was going to try another little bowl before dinner, because that is what men like Kian from events do when they have been scolded.

“Sixteen hundred,” DeVane said, and drew it in the air like chalk where everyone could read it. “You aim at the chamber. We have the hospitals on a cadence of wrong metronomes. We have the industrial quarter singing four songs at once, which is a nightmare for your data and a joy for my politics. We have the port ready to clap when I say. We have the babies sleeping through their parents’ guilt. Don’t make me stand there, Noor. I’ll do it. My braid will be excellent in the photos. It will cut three years off my life. Pull off your point without requiring my martyrdom. Be smarter than your god.”

“I have no god,” Noor said, and it was not a brag. It was a confession in a practical voice. “I have a bowl that wants to be one. I will make it smaller. If I die, put lemon on my coffin and make a joke loud enough to scare the moths. If I live, you owe me a story that makes what we are doing bearable.”

Utchi handed Ansel the lemon because it seemed like the only ritual available, and he caught it with the grace of a man who had spent his childhood practicing difficult things with his hands because everything else felt like too much. Miah rolled her eyes and smiled at the same time because the day was obscene and it was also funny. The city, patient, stupid, brilliant, lit its small bones one by one like a chick catching light under a paper lamp, a lungfish that had learned to breathe air and was not yet bored of the trick. They stood around a table that had been an altar, a map, a bed, a workbench, and they built a hinge out of a laugh and a punishment, out of a train that had never come and a rhythm that refused to be obedient, out of a bowl that wanted to eat and a window that learned to cool itself against a palm.

At sixteen hundred the chamber would preen for its own cameras, and the bowl would tilt and learn how to hesitate in public, which is a kind of grace. Between now and then, there were naps to fake and wires to twist and sandwiches to fail to eat. In the low room, they did not bless each other, because they were not liars about that sort of thing. They shared a lemon and a look like two people who had learned the word again and decided it did not have to mean forever if you held it right. They left the room messy and took what matters with them. Outside, the gulls were still cut tape, but someone had spliced a laugh into the loop, and even the birds sounded slightly less certain that the end was the point.They scattered from the low room like good conspiracies do, not in a panic but with the precision of people who had missed too many trains and learned to leave early. The base exhaled back into them a smell like wet rope and hot metal, the mineral breath of work. Ansel tucked the lemon into his coat pocket because charms were for people who didn’t believe in timing and he was superstitious about timing now. He gave himself a pace that looked like calm and felt like holding a glass of water in a moving car. Miah peeled off toward the south racks with a wrench in her fist and a coil of cable over her shoulder that wasn’t on any requisition form; she walked with her head a little down, whistling the wrong bar of a song so the cameras would mark her as noise. DeVane went toward the stairs two at a time, not because stairs deserve dominance but because she liked the way her thigh muscles answered, a proof of life that had nothing to do with doctrine.

On the docks, the porters unfolded napkins that had acquired notation the way cloth acquires smoke. The lines were imprecise where it didn’t matter and exact where it did, and the flour-streaked fingers that held them had more authority than any municipal seal. A boy with a cast drew a train with his thumb print and taught his sister the clap while their mother pretended to count tomatoes; the beat drifted like pollen, landing on men unloading sacks and women counting fish and on an old man in a chair who hadn’t seen a train in thirty years and still knew the sound. The laundry moved maps between piles of white sheets and gray uniforms, tucking measures into clean corners the way people tuck money into a Bible. The city took the joke and made a mesh out of it because jokes travel lighter than guns.

Up in the Citadel, Noor refused to let herself check the time too often. She did not like to watch numbers approach her; she preferred to meet them. Utchi had a cord around her wrist that she wound and unwound when she was thinking, and it had begun to leave a soft groove in the skin that Noor wanted, indecently, to press with her thumb. Iseul stood at the doorway and tilted her head as if listening to a hymn she refused to sing along with. The Window did its steady work of reflecting back a world prettier than it was because that is how glass stays employed. On the console, Noor nested her transforms like dolls within dolls until the whole thing had the density of a fruitcake and the delicacy of a spider web. The kernel of the laugh lay there like a seed with a paper around it in case tempers ran ahead of judgment. She did not touch the word she had hung on the destroy because she didn’t trust that she wouldn’t need it at a moment when her hands would be shaking.

The council chamber air was the wrong temperature because all rooms built to project power make that same mistake. Councilor Ha had selected a tie he thought was humility and landed on a color that looked like a sea that will not be swum in. He practiced sincerity with a mirror because cameras hunt for discontinuities. A woman with a badge arranged water on a tray in the exact pattern she had been taught during a different government; she liked this one no better, but a grid is a comfort to the hand. The seats filled with figures who had learned to sit like ideas. A page ran his palm along the velvet rail and made static because he liked small lightning and because he would not be allowed to like the big kind. Outside, on the wide steps where the old parliament had taken photographs of itself pretending to be stone, a cluster of women with thermoses pretended to be waiting for friends; one of them, a baker with her hair wrapped in blue, tapped the pause into the hem of her skirt with her thumb and kept time for those who could not read the napkins.

Ansel took the Skylark up not as spectacle but as insurance. He had learned to treat altitude like cash; you don’t spend it where someone else can count your change. The sockets found his temples with the familiarity that should have worried him and didn’t because the body craves what it’s trained to crave. He angled to a place where he could see the glint of the chamber’s crown, the suggestion of the bowl pivoting along the Citadel’s east shoulder, and the river of a street that ran between office towers like a vein. The wind cut cleaner than it had that morning; afternoon winds have fewer lies, and he found he liked them better for it. He kept his mouth closed and checked the bone mic with the small pressure of tongue against wire, a private nod. Miah’s breath in his jaw was steady and rude and perfect. DeVane’s voice rode under theirs like the underside of a bridge, solid where it needed to be and giving where it could.

Sixteen hundred arrived as if it had been called, which was the only ethical way to treat time in this new arrangement. Noor lifted her hand just enough to make the bowl obedient to the new shape of her regard and aimed it at the chamber’s throat. The hum started low, the kind that gets misread by bodies as a heartbeat they should be matching. She kept it back from the babies by memory and malice and math. Utchi adjusted the amplitude like a person turning a pillow the cool side up. Iseul stepped back one pace not because she was afraid but because leaders who survive learn to let the first blast go by before they plant. The bowl took its first quantity of listening and distributed it along the hall as if someone had laid a long violin across the floor and drawn a bow. The chamber leaned without knowing it had leaned. Ha raised his chin the half-inch that looked like courage on feeds and like vanity in kitchens.

The first phrases Noor sent were the sort that make decent men tidy their desks. She had learned long ago that the tuning of an ear is half content, half context, and all faith. She offered the room a directive dressed as a neighborly suggestion: go home, drink water, hold hands, call your mother, cancel one meeting and write down the names of the people you’ve promised things to and failed, in each case, to deliver. The bowl made this language into a polite pressure on the backs of the knees. People shifted, startled to find themselves agreeing with their own bones. A woman in a green jacket closed her eyes like a curtain and opened them again and looked at her phone and put it away. Ha half-smiled because he had been told sometimes you must admit fatigue to be trusted, and he thought he was being clever.

Ansel tasted lemon for real because the wind off the bay found his coat and lifted a corner at the exact place where the fruit lay warm. He refused to bite it because the day did not deserve the theatricality. The bowl’s hum touched the Skylark’s skin and made it ring the tiniest amount; he cut the angle by a sliver, enough to change what the instruments thought the air was. He kept his breath in his pockets because the bowl loved regularity and he had promised to be a bad metronome. Miah whispered numbers that were not numbers, the code she used when she needed him to trust hands more than tools. DeVane said nothing for a full minute, which was strategy and mercy.

In neighborhoods where the feeds didn’t reach and where news was traded like recipes, the clap moved. Men carrying ladders stopped and knocked three times on nothing and laughed at the wrong place on purpose, the way you do when you are practicing defiance and trying it on for size. Two grandmothers on opposite balconies clapped out of phase at each other until they fell into the same joke and then out again because it pleased them. In a barber shop where politics fell to the floor with the hair and stayed there, the metronome was turned to wrong and the boy sweeping learned a new measure and felt taller for it. In the baby ward the nurses rolled their eyes in the way only the truly gentle manage and put the little metronomes in the drawers where the scalpels used to live; their hands moved with the grace of people who choose small orders when big ones betray.

The council chamber’s screens registered a dip, and the room, delicate in its pride, missed it. Noor applied the humility braid and watched the amplitude fold on itself like a paper bird. She had written the transform to find the place where certainty trips and use that as a brake; it takes nerve to force a machine to admit it is wrong. The bowl stumbled beautifully. There is no other word for a fall arranged with such poise. The room’s posture changed in the way posture does when a person lets go of their shoulders in front of a mirror for the first time all day. Ha lowered his chin because the cameras like men who remember that their own throats exist. Someone laughed a small cruel laugh at a joke about optics; the bowl ate it and hiccuped, and Noor’s code cut the next impulse by a measured half. She heard Utchi whisper yes like the end of a fine joke.

Somewhere under their feet, in the unlovely guts of the building where rods and wire and pipes made their own music, a secondary process activated. Noor felt it in her wrists before the numbers climbed. A low train of synonyms slithered along a side channel, an insult disguised as an experiment: yield, obey, acquiesce, comply. She tasted bile and told herself it was the lemon she had not drunk. The humility braid could deal with the easy versions. It had never been meant to stop every knife; even goddesses take one wound and call it doctrine. Noor set the laugh kernel forward by a beat and felt the program misidentify it as noise and then relearn it as a gate because that is what she had told it to do.

At the port, a woman with a scar across the soft of her palm raised her arms to stretch her back and discovered halfway through the arc that she had been about to kneel. She did not make a ceremony out of standing. She put the weight where it belonged and clicked her tongue and clapped late and laughed ugly, the precise ugliness Noor had built her fix around without knowing her face. The bowl found that note twice in a row and realized the room had learned a habit it had not been taught. Noor smiled without sweetness and turned the knob the smallest degree further down.

Ha was still talking because that is what you do when your room is listening to someone else. He said words like collaboration and harm reduction and sovereignty in arrangements that would look good in a transcript and mean less in kitchens. DeVane leaned forward, smiling with her teeth concealed, and said, in a voice she has used at funerals when the priest ran long, “Go home,” and half the room flinched because they recognized themselves in her command. It wasn’t the bowl. It was a woman with authority making a bid on their bodies. Noor admired it and hated the situation that required the admiration. Iseul did not move and the bowl read that as a kind of counter-order it could not translate, which was exactly what she had intended.

Something went wrong at the east corner of the plaza because things always do where concrete narrows and people forget to think of each other as a fluid. A small loud man climbed a statue’s knee to get a better angle for his feed and took the fact of the bowl’s attention as proof that his language had been blessed. He shouted a word that had been heavy in the city a century ago and lightened by use into a toy; the bowl tried to make it into a directive and found itself tangled in Noor’s sarcasm stop. It stuttered in public. People noticed and did not understand what they had seen and later they would tell the story wrong in a way that kept faith with what mattered. The small loud man climbed down and went home with a video that did not make him famous, which is a kind of mercy you can only offer accidentally.

In the Skylark, Ansel found himself grinning like someone who had just watched a difficult trick done well by a friend. He did not touch the bone mic because he did not want to throw weight onto Noor’s line while she was balancing a room filled with men who thought they were the point. He let himself think train just once like a curse he would not say in a church and felt, through a structure that had no business conveying feeling, the small tight nitrile snap of a program slipping into its emergency route somewhere far from his hands. He prayed with no words that he had not broken anything, then revised the thought because machines do not honor prayers and because hope needs to be used on things that bleed.

At precisely the moment maps would later circle because historians love coincidence, the bullhorn in the chamber’s west gallery failed. It had been repaired with grace and gum for three administrations. The wire that had always held it betrayed its age and gave, not as symbolism, but because metal fatigues. A man raised his voice to cover the gap and shouted for order and found that his order had left, the way a lover sometimes does when you reach for their hand in the night and touch only heat. He hesitated and the room tasted it like sugar. Noor nudged the braid, respected it, asked it to hold and not bite too deeply. DeVane stood, not to leave and not to speak, but to own her height and the fact of her bones. Iseul inclined her head to a degree that algorithms could not parse as anything but yes. Ha did the best possible thing a man like him can do in a room like this and closed his mouth.

After, they would say the session ended because of a technical difficulty and a late notice regarding public comms. After, they would write a note that sounded like a soup recipe for civic order. In the moment, it ended because the bowl learned to hesitate in the face of laughter and because a hundred kitchens chose to clap on their own time. The chamber watched itself stand up and leave in the mirrored glass of the Citadel’s windows, and nobody was angry enough yet to throw a chair. Noor let the hum unspool at a rate that looked generous. She thought of the babies in their small plastic cradles and kept the lullaby that was not a lullaby far from the ward, out of love and guilt and policy. Utchi put her shoulder against the door when the tech from downstairs tried to come in with a point he had decided was more important than seeing the day.

Miah made a sound she only made when a machine had behaved like a person you’d like to have to dinner but not to marry. She cracked her knuckles and her smile, and the bone mic carried that grin straight into Ansel’s head so his heart remembered to behave like a muscle and not a verdict. DeVane sat down like someone who knows that sitting is a decision and looked at her hands as if they had never ceased to astonish her by obeying. Ansel banked the Skylark and felt the wind agree, not as metaphor but as a compact.

Noor did not collapse against the console because she had learned that gravity can take offense when you make drama out of its daily work. She stepped back and kept the bowl in the corner of her vision the way you keep a polite guest who has a tendency to pocket silverware in your periphery. Iseul put a hand on the back of the chair near Noor’s hip and let it rest there like a woman who did not have time for artifice. “That cost you,” she said, and Noor let herself be seen for a beat because she would need to be harder later and wanted to get softness used up where it would do no harm.

“Cost is a verb,” Noor said. “I spend on purpose or I tip by accident. Today I did the first thing. Tomorrow I may have to do the second. I want a city that tips without being told.”

“Your friend,” Iseul said, and Noor almost laughed because friend was so far from the word she would have chosen and yet it fit as a misbutton sometimes does if you do not look down, “kept his promise. He did not sing for us. He is learning my language by daring not to use it. That is rare.”

“He is learning not to die in front of you,” Noor said, and could not tell whether she meant the plural or the singular. “That is rarer. May your committees be bored and your boys forget to be clever for a fortnight.”

“Hope,” Iseul said, and did not wear the word well, which made Noor like her more than she ever told her. “Ugly hope. Bring me a list of what you need before six. I will give you half and another half from a different budget and pretend I found it under a chair.”

Down on the steps, the women with thermoses dispersed beautifully, the way sparrows scatter when a shadow slides across a wall. The baker in blue took three napkins to a boy she did not know and told him to keep one for his mother who worked nights and one for his grandmother who hated the word policy and one for the drawer with the candles; she winked, and it bought her a sliver of protection later when the wrong man asked the wrong question in the wrong tone. At the port, the man who had almost stepped off the dock sat and put his wet socks in the sun and stared at his own feet with an attention people reserve for gods and dogs, and later he got up and went back to his crane and did not mention that his chest hurt a little when he breathed. In the baby ward, two infants synchronized their crying for six seconds, as infants do without malice, and every nurse in the room looked up and then looked down and went back to the work of saving people one ounce at a time.

Ansel landed with less theater than the morning, which felt like an apology the day did not deserve and also like affection for the ground. The Skylark shivered like a horse after a river and settled. Miah was there up the ladder before he had fully unclipped, because that was how she loved: early and with good hands. She tugged his coat straight and stole the lemon back like a magician. He let her because letting other people steal what you had pretended was a charm was a superstition all its own. DeVane materialized in the way commanders do when they are too tired to stomp and too needed to sit. She held out a hand for the lemon and did not squeeze it and gave it back and they all pretended they had done magic.

“We got a half an hour,” Miah said, and her voice was the kind of tired that tastes like success for ten minutes and then becomes a bill. “We lost six at the east end yelling at bridesmaids. We bought back three because Noor wrote humility into a machine, which will ruin a man’s philosophy if he lets it. The council went home to write statements about a technical issue. The laundries think the notation looks handsome on napkins. The world is still the world.”

“Ha will call it a courtesy pause,” DeVane said. “Iseul will call it a test of ethical governance and privately file it under Proof of Concept. Someone will try the bridesmaid bowl again with a synonym for kneel they found in a thesaurus that still smells like a classroom. Noor will intercept three and miss one because we are not gods. I am going to write a list on my hand of the people whose bodies we kept from being used as a platform today. It will be shorter than the list I need, and I will add to it until the ink wears off.”

Ansel wanted to lie on the floor of the hangar and let the cold of concrete teach him he had a shape. He wanted to put his head in Miah’s lap and sleep like a child with an engine idling nearby because that had always been his favorite noise. He wanted to call his sister and ask her what song Cinnamon had turned into and whether their mother still scolded the ghosts. He did none of those things. He asked for broth because it was something the room could give without opening a vein. Miah made a face like a victory and went to get it and DeVane leaned her hip against the wing like a woman making friends with a wall.

He felt the word again brush his cheekbone from the inside, not from the bowl, not from the base, not from the wind. He did not touch the bone mic because this was not a conference. He did not say yes because you must ration acquiescence harder than anything when a city learns to sing. He gave the laugh in his mouth the smallest nudge with his tongue, and let it sit where a voice becomes breath. He thought of the destroy written on the back of it like an apology you promise yourself you’ll avoid. He made himself a promise he would not be able to keep: to go home and sit on a floor within a week and tell someone he loved about a window, and a bowl, and a lemon, and a woman who had taught a machine to hesitate.

When the sun slid three fingers down the edge of the building across from the base—because this city tells time using hands still—Noor stepped away from the console and found a corner of the Window room where the cameras could see her and not read the angle of her shoulders. She peeled the cord from Utchi’s wrist and wound it around her own hand and unwound it, a story without plot that calmed her. She thought of Kian from events and the shape of men who want to turn experiments into manifestos, and she thought of laundry women and cranes and nurses and the baby who had laughed, impossibly, at a joke told in a room where no jokes are allowed. She had done a day. She would do another. She turned her face toward the glass not as a request but as a courtesy. She lifted her hand and put it nowhere near the pane and let the air cool the palm anyway. She did not say again. She said, in a voice that would ruin any machine that tried to eat it, later.

The gulls did their loop and cut and loop. The water wore its apricot band and then changed its mind and wore pewter because evening had arrived with the audacity of a weather report. The city unlaced one eye and kept the other open because it had learned that sleep is a privilege and naps are a tactic. In a hundred rooms, napkins with bad notation by good people were folded away under stacks of bills and photographs; when the day woke them—because days do that now—they would be shaken out and used again. Somewhere in the Citadel a tech wrote in a report that the bowl had demonstrated self-regulation, and in the margin he wrote, carefully and then crossed out, learned to blush. Somewhere in the base a mechanic cursed the left rear strut of a plane with a gentleness that would make a poet weep. Somewhere between those two floors, a woman with a ring through her lip somewhere other than her lip hummed a bar from a lullaby that did not exist and picked up a pastry with both hands, so she would not do something stupid with them.

They allowed themselves one hour of middle. That was what they called it, though nobody had agreed out loud. The hour where nothing took and nothing broke and you could let your shoulders live at their true height. It was a kindness. It was also a trick. The city would use it to practice the clap in kitchens and in the halls of power and in the long shadow of cranes. The bowl would use it to practice not having the last word. Ansel would use it to learn his breath again in a room where no one could hear him count. Noor would use it to remind herself that saying no to the right person is a skill you can lose if you don’t practice. Miah would use it to write a word dirty enough to make a signal shy and tape it inside the maintenance cabinet where some idiot from events couldn’t find it. DeVane would sit on a step and write names on her hand and stop when she hit the webbing because that is where hands rebel, and promise herself to buy a pen that bleeds less.

When the hour finished itself, they stood up because everyone else would. The day was not over. It had learned a new hinge. That was not nothing. They took it and went back to their machines and their windows and their chorus of gulls and their napkin choirs and did the rude holy work of trying again. The city, brave and foolish, moved its glass ribs in and out like breath. The bowl listened to itself and flinched and laughed once, the smallest bit, at the wrong time, because humility was a language it could now say. That was what Noor wanted. That was what Ansel had bought too dearly and would buy again, and again, and again, until someone said stop and meant it, or until the lemon on the table wasn’t a symbol anymore and was just a fruit someone remembered to cut before the water went warm.They let the hour finish them the way rain finishes a dusty sidewalk in late summer, soft and without apology, then the base came back to its own clatter with the grateful indecency of a body that has remembered it is not a metaphor. The hangar’s lights took on that evening honesty that makes even steel look human; someone turned a radio low and let a song from a year where the city had believed in parades bleed in as if memory were a lubricant. Ansel folded himself into the cot just long enough to convince his muscles they had not been replaced entirely by wire, then swung out because the small stillness had started to feel like an invitation he didn’t trust. He washed his face at a sink that made promises it couldn’t keep about cleanliness and watched blood thread the water a second from where he had bitten too hard, a private tithe paid without zealotry.

Miah was sitting on an upended crate, boots crossed at the ankle, a coil of insulated cable in her lap like a very patient snake. She had written something obscene on a strip of tape and stuck it inside the maintenance cabinet at a height only she and the really curious could find; her grin said she would deny it under oath and take pride when the thing did the petty work she had designed it for. She held up a napkin, one of the laundry’s copies with his awful bridge on it, the clap marked with little stars that some scrawled hand had added, and he felt a warmth he refused to call hope, because he had been taught that word needs to be used on things with spines and not just on feelings.

“They’re passing them in the market like recipes,” she said, tone part reverent, part retail. “The old man with the pigeons by the fountain asked me if he should charge extra for the clap. I told him yes because capitalism is a disease and sometimes you make it cough.”

He took the napkin and smoothed it, because it mattered that someone had creased it carefully before handing it to her. “In a week, there will be bad versions like folk songs, and those will be the good ones.”

“In a week,” she said, and did not put the rest of the sentence on him. She reached without looking and pressed her fingers into the soft at the base of his throat, a diagnostic ritual now, a way of finding out if he was pretending to be made of more bone than he had. “You’re fine enough,” she said, which meant you’re bleeding but not dangerously. “DeVane wants your face in the mess for ten minutes so people can decide they can stand on their own two feet without waiting for your train whistle. Then she wants you horizontal, actually horizontal, not the kind where you lay there and practice being brave.”

“DeVane wants a lot for a single person,” he said, and the affection in it surprised him with its lack of bitterness. “Is she going to eat anything that is not an instruction tonight?”

“Bread,” Miah said. “The sesame kind. The woman from the old parliament stairs sent them with a note that said the bowl has cheeks and we should teach it to color. She used different words because she’s polite. I like her.”

“I like anyone who knows where the stairs are,” he said, and Miah’s eyes flickered with a thought she didn’t hand him, not yet.

DeVane had taken a chair in the mess and converted it into a desk by the simple expedient of making the air decide it was paperwork. She had someone’s sweater over one shoulder, habit not softness, and a ledger open that looked like it had survived a flood out of spite. She was writing names, always the names, and adding beside them the action that had kept those bodies from becoming nouns: laughed, clapped late, turned the metronome wrong, told Kian from events to go home. When she saw him she didn’t straighten, she let her bones be tired where he could see it, which was her way of telling him trust is a titration and tonight he had earned another drop.

“You look like you’ve moved a piano up a hill,” she said. “Eat the bread. Pretend it’s an order.”

He broke a piece and put it in his mouth and remembered in a little rush that sesame has the same smell in every city he has ever been unhappy in, and that comfort is a traitor who still makes itself indispensable. Halfway through his second bite, a porter huffed in with his cap in both hands and a napkin folded around a small stone. There was writing on the stone, a single word, letters careful and the black ink wicked into the pumice like grief. Later, it said, and he felt his mouth go dry in an entirely different way because the city had learned to deliver messages in objects you couldn’t make a copy of, and someone had sent him a future disguised as a pebble you could put in your pocket and forget.

“Woman at the south stair,” the porter said. “She said not to stand on the second from the top because it’s cracked, and to come when the bells go between their arguments.”

“Between bells,” DeVane muttered, mostly to her pen, which dug a little harder as if the page had been insolent. “Our friends at the Citadel have become old women. Good for them.”

Ansel tucked the stone into the same pocket as the lemon and decided, without saying it even to himself, not to take the lemon to the meeting. He did not want to turn metaphor into a handshake. He was not going to romanticize a woman who had put a machine between her and the world to keep the world alive. He was going to ask a question and hope he could attend to the answer with the respect a lever deserves.

Noor’s walk home was a lie she had taught herself to like. She didn’t go home, not first. She cut left where she should have cut right and went down the side street that had the bad neon and the best soup, because there was a man in the kitchen who had taught her that if you put the scallions in after you turn off the flame, they taste like the color they are and not like disappointment. She bought two, one for her and one for whatever she would not admit she wanted to see. Utchi walked a half half-step behind her, jealous for Noor’s shoulders, not her time.

The city was doing that evening thing where it pretends it has always been safe. Noor let it perform for her and did not call it a liar; if you tell a city it is beautiful too often, it begins to expect applause when it does violence gently. They passed a boy chalking a hopscotch grid that was all wrong, thirteen and then nine and then sixteen, and his sister arguing with him about whether the rules had changed. Noor wanted to tell them yes, also no, and then stayed quiet because children hate contradictory adults unless they are preachers or cooks.

By the old parliament’s south stair, the sesame woman had set out a stool she had inherited the way some people inherit houses. She had the kind of face that has made a hundred decisions a day gently for fifty years, and the kind of humor that makes those decisions stick in other people’s throats in the way that makes them grateful. She put three cakes on the paper and placed the stone on top like a weight for a letter that had promises in it.

“He’ll come,” she said, voice warm and ironed out flat as a good sheet. “He will think he has disobeyed to do it. He will be right.”

“Do you know him,” Noor asked, and immediately regretted the interest because it was not a thing she had earned the right to.

“I know the shape of people who sing in public,” the woman said. “They are instruments with legs. I sell to them because sesame calms the mouth.”

Noor took the bag, the warmth pressing through, and made herself an appointment with her own kitchen. “If he doesn’t come,” she said, as if she believed in that world, “I’ll ask you to eat one for me.”

“I’ll eat one anyway,” the woman said. “It is important to preempt the saddest outcomes with ordinary appetites. It makes the gods bored.”

Noor could have kissed her for that and would have bought herself trouble she had not budgeted for. She pushed the stone into the bag and then sideways into her coat pocket where it would knock her hip, a reminder to attend to the body while she practiced the calculus of hungry machines. Utchi slid her ring off and on because she had a habit of calibrating herself on the move. The word later sat against Noor’s palm like a ridiculous pet. She told herself she would not say it again today. She meant it in the way a person means they will stop seasoning as the stew comes to a boil.

When the bells went between their arguments—two towers uncoordinated by design from an old story about rival families—they made a silence that lasted four heartbeats longer than you expected. Ansel stepped into it because the city had written it for him, and he was too vain and too practical not to use the stage. He took the second stair from the top with care because he trusted women with flour on their hands more than architects with steel, and found Noor half in shadow because she had been taught early to choose angles that make cameras resent you.

They stood not quite close enough to share breath and exactly close enough to be mistaken for a pair if the wrong person was collecting photographs for a file that confused affection with conspiracy. Noor held out a sesame cake as if she were paying a debt. He did not take it because hands sometimes must be kept idle so they don’t say things mouths cannot afford.

“I told you I was not a jukebox,” he said softly, and surprised himself by not apologizing for the rudeness the way he would have five years ago. “You found a way to make me feel like one without making me angry. I don’t know whether to be grateful or to go home and write a manifesto about my autonomy.”

“You can be grateful and write your document,” she said. “I will read it and hand it back with notes about the parts where you confuse your breath with everyone else’s. That is not a rebuke. It is an admission that your line goes through a thousand throats right now, and that is not the same as ownership.”

“I don’t want to own anything,” he said, which was a lie he realized for the first time, because he wanted to own at least the right to stop. “I want to get to leave the room. You put your hand on the window. Does it haunt you.”

“Haunt is a pretty word for a persistent sensation,” she said, the gentleness without softness he had heard in the bowl when she said again. “The glass has learned my temperature. It corrects itself around me. That is unnerving. Also convenient. I am allergic to romance about instruments. They are tools. They cut. They bruise. The way we forgive them is by agreeing, before, which skin is ours to give.”

“You make bargains before a storm,” he said, thinking not of wind but of rooms. “DeVane says the same thing, with more swearing.”

“Swearing is a chord,” she said. “It carries farther. I respect her because she puts the bruise on her own mouth when she can.”

He took the cake because he had to accept some kindness, even if it were ritual. The sesame made his tongue honest. “I heard your code blush,” he said, as if he were telling her something she didn’t know and telling her anyway because saying it reminded him he had not made that happen by himself. “The bowl learned to hesitate. If you hadn’t written that humility braid, we would be at a funeral.”

“I learned hesitation early from a school with stairs and no yard,” she said. “It took more of my childhood than my mother would have liked and gave me a job. Balance. We make what we were taught and then we call it ethics so other people don’t tell us we’re only inventing excuses for how we survive.” She paused, as if listening for her own heartbeat and then reminding herself she didn’t need to. “They will come for your laugh outside of rooms where I can cut them off. The small bowls breed like drama. Tell your friend the one who writes obscenities on tape to feed the bridesmaids bad power.”

He smiled even though the back of the smile had a weight on it. “She already does. She’ll enjoy being flattered by someone who is not me. She will pretend to hate it and then hang your compliment on her wall.”

Noor leaned into the stair because you cannot lean into a person you do not know and call it political work. “I will say a thing that may look like I am giving you power and is actually me asking you to carry a weight. Do not let them call you symbol before they have called you trouble. Symbol is a way they make you tidy. Trouble is the name for a person whose breath insists on being counted.”

He let the word trouble land in him like a coin in a fountain he wouldn’t wish on and then found he had closed his eyes like a man who had just been put under a good hand at the back of the neck. “When you say again,” he said, eyes still closed, because he could afford the indecency just this once, “do you mean repeat or do you mean survive.”

“I mean practice,” she said. “I mean we are teaching a machine a language that recurs without conquest. I mean you do it until it is muscle and then you can afford to improvise. I am asking you to make the city rude on purpose at the right moments until the bowl flinches when a joke enters the room without a ticket.”

The bells found each other again at their edges and made a sound like compromise taught to sing. He opened his eyes because he didn’t want to be the man with his eyes closed at the moment when the city asked for new terms. “I will do that for as long as my voice lets me,” he said. “After that, someone else better be laughing. Build for that. Build as if that is certain.”

“I am,” she said. “I gave the kill of your kernel to an old woman who sells cakes, to a girl who wears a ring and won’t take orders from anyone in a suit, and to a desk they will pick last in a fire because it looks like it has nothing in it anyone would want. If we use it wrong, you say train and it erases itself and a quarter of some other thing dear to someone we both hate. I would prefer not to pull it. I need you to prefer it less even than I do.”

“Done,” he said, and took the smallest bite of sesame because it felt like signing something he hadn’t read and he trusted her to have translated it well. “They tried to run kneel in the chamber.”

She laughed, but differently than he had heard the bowl mark. “Kneel is a boy’s word. It will always be their mistake. I wrote knit over it. I am charitable that way. We mustn’t act like I am always that pitiless.”

He let that sink and decided this was the moment to do a stupid human thing and ask: “What would you have done today if you could have left your name out of every record and no one would be clever enough to guess.”

“Cooked,” she said without thinking and then looked startled, as if the honesty of it had stepped on her own foot. “Something that takes hours and smells like patience. I have neighbors now who don’t know they are neighbors. I would have made them a stew and stretched it with advice. This answer is embarrassing. I am telling you anyway because you will go home and try not to sleep and maybe the thought of beans will steady you.”

“Beans,” he said, reverent because he remembered a winter where every song had tasted like them and kept him alive. “My sister puts cinnamon in her beans.”

“I know,” she said, and he blinked like a fool because of course the bowl had taught her his house in fragments and of course she had arranged them into the least violent picture she could. “She hides the good thing under the wrong spice. It’s a trick. We are doing that to the city.”

He wanted to touch her shoulder to say yes, not like a man at a window but like a co-conspirator across a kitchen table, and he didn’t because their bodies did not belong to them in public at this hour. He shifted his weight instead and the step beneath him complained in a way that made them both grin, a small bond welded by the annoying physics of old stairs. He thought of asking for her number and then remembered the part of himself that still existed in the old world and crushed the impulse ruthlessly. “Tomorrow,” he said, not meaning only the sun. “They are going to try the bridesmaid bowls in four places at once to see how crowd panics map. It will be ugly math. Miah will trip two. DeVane will walk into the third and make it choose a different verb just by standing there. The fourth is the one they think is no one’s responsibility. If you can put your embarrassment in its mouth, do it.”

“Done,” she said, and reached into the bag and took the second cake and made a ceremony out of tearing it in half and not offering it to him, eating it slowly like a person who had decided to respect what is simple because complexity is a currency and she was poor. “Later,” she said, and when she said it it wasn’t a stone, it was a thread, and he did not pull it because he wanted to keep the cloth intact for morning.

They left along different curves of street that had been engineered years ago to prevent people from processing in groups without expense. Noor tucked her hands into the pockets where the stone and the ring bite were and thought for a mean moment that she would enjoy watching Kian from events carry a heavy box for a neighbor. Utchi kept pace and didn’t ask and didn’t tell; the number of things she had not said today would crowd an inventory, and she took pride in the restraint. Ansel cut along the fleet garages and let the smell of oil do the work of reminding him that the world is not just meaning, it is also viscosity and heat.

Night moved in with the shabbiness of a friend who never knocks, and with it came the first trial run of people who thought they could have built a better bowl in their garage. The east side lit up with somebody’s symphony of shop-class speakers and a power inverter the size of a cooler. Miah didn’t bother with finesse; she went out with a coil and a grin and asked the right man to flirt with her for three minutes while she ran a line that turned the janky bowl into an AM radio that could only play weather reports from two summers ago. The men laughed, the machine pouted, the streets kept their feet.

Near midnight, a different trouble. The bowl did something Noor had not trained it to do: it trained itself to look for the places where voices go when their owners are asleep. This, too, had been inevitable. Anything that learns language learns the dream of it. Noor woke with the vertigo of being addressed inside her own head and sat up with the memory of a campus stairwell under her, the smell of concrete and lemon floor cleaner that had told her she was still young. She didn’t go to the window because windows do nothing at night but return you to yourself. She sat with her back to her own door and counted on her fingers the names of people she had agreed to be kind to that day. When the number outran the digits, the hum eased off because she had taught the bowl to mistake enumeration for prayer.

In the ward the metronomes clicked their wrong clicks quietly like little clocks that weren’t sorry. One nurse sitting on a stool with her shoes off told the baby in her lap that a train that had never stopped here had just passed, very slowly, and that they were all fine, and that tomorrow she would bring a ribbon the color of a lime to tie on the crib of every child whose mother had laughed when she shouldn’t and kept a life that way. The baby hiccuped and the bowl hiccuped with it because humility is contagious in a closed system.

At three, the base exhaled and pulled a blanket over its own shoulders; sleep in a place like this is a group project. Miah finished writing a diagram on an old packing slip showing how to wire a bridesmaid into thinking it was listening to itself. She taped it under a chair in the mess because she distrusted obvious cupboards. DeVane did not go to bed. She sat in the stairwell with the ledger and added a name she had missed and then drew a line under the day, not to end it, but to keep it from running into tomorrow like paint. She rubbed the ink with her thumb until it became a stain and decided that was appropriate. She went down two steps and closed her eyes for seven minutes and woke to the sound of someone somewhere saying again and identifying the voice as her own, but kinder.

Noor set her kettle on for lemon tea she would not finish and watched the wall instead of the window because walls are honest about being boundaries. She was glad to be in a room that had not been built to be looked at. She wrote a note on a piece of paper with a grocery list already on it: beans, salt, cord, train. She laughed at herself for the last one and left it because intention is a spice you can’t taste when it’s needed most and it must be added early. She put the paper under the kettle and thought, if the building burns I will have given the fire a story to chew on before it touches the books. She thought of the word destroy attached to the laugh and wished for a world where she didn’t have to be so careful naming doors. She slept with one hand on her pocket because that is how people who hold keys sleep.

Dawn came ugly, which is to say true. The gulls were on their unions’ breaks and the crows were taking advantage; the bay wore that defensive green that says wind is a rumor with teeth. Ansel woke to the sound of boots perpendicular to his own breathing and swung out of the cot into a room already full of names waiting to be accompanied to one more hour. He could feel before he could hear that the bridesmaid bowls were being wheeled into position like girls with matching dresses no one had bothered to hem. Miah handed him coffee that tasted like bravado and kept him from apologizing by asking him to carry a coil that weighed as much as regret. DeVane was more precise than she had been yesterday because each day steals the right to be sloppy.

The plan, such as it was, had the elegance of a cheap trick: Miah would make two small ears step on their own hems; DeVane would put her beautiful skull in the way of the third and teach it shame by example; the fourth would be Noor’s problem if Noor wanted to prove to herself that she had not domesticated a predator but had taught it manners. The industrial quarter started to sing the wrong songs at a reasonable volume because anything worth repeating must fit into the mouth without scalding. The baker in blue tied her hair tighter. The boy with the cast had figured out a way to clap without pain and showed off about it to a woman who would not flirt with him for ten years and broke his heart a little just by looking at him kindly.

Noor ate two bites of bread with a piece of cheese and translated her own hunger into radii and amplitude or else would have cried. She and Utchi took the lift up because the stairs had wronged her during the night and she didn’t want their judgment. Iseul had installed on the console a little ceramic elephant with a broken trunk, and Noor wondered whether she was being mocked and then decided to like it for the way it made the room less intent on being beautiful. She loaded the humility braid. She set the kernel to hover like a gull over a trash bin, ridiculous and ready.

The first bridesmaid went silly and fell in love with itself, thanks to Miah’s cable that made it a mirror. The second heard a whisper of kneel and heard knit because Noor had hard-coded embarrassment into that synaptic path and the thing wanted now to be caught doing tricks for admiration. The third pitched up on its flatbed like a diva and found DeVane in front of it, arms folded, stance not quite a dare and not quite a welcome, and the bowl stuttered because it had not been given a parameter for a body that refused to categorize itself for a lens. DeVane did not speak. She did not clap. She looked at it like something she was too tired to hate and too awake not to fight, and the bowl shrugged, which is to say, it shook itself out of its own resonance the smallest amount and so the men with it had to work to keep it there, and working is a good way to keep people from being clever.

The fourth started to sing smart. It aimed itself at the corner where four streets met and four kinds of lives crossed; it picked the timing of shift change; it gave its hum the particular condescension that makes backs go soft. Noor felt her skin decide it would prefer not to be in a body. She threw the humiliation braid and the bowl stepped aside and then stepped back harder because someone else had set a weight on its attention and yelled push and it was obeying because that’s what machines do when you make their hunger simple. She reached without looking and found Utchi’s wrist, the cord groove, a silly anchor, holy as anything else at hand.

Ansel was already in the air because sometimes prudence coincides with instinct and has the decency to pretend to have been foresight. He took the ugly laugh and planted it in the mouth of the fourth bowl the way a grandmother plants petunias in the neighbor’s border out of love and aggression. He gave the train longer lungs and kept it, out of respect for the city’s memory, slightly out of tune. He used the clap off time where are you supposed to be to remind the block that its feet belonged to no one with a power inverter. He felt the tug in the harness and let it become the wood of a chair he chose to sit in and not a trap sprung from under him.

Kian from events had learned nothing and was trying to stream his redemption; the camera caught his good angle; the bowl ignored him because Noor had written the part that says do not reinforce men who mistake your logistics for destiny. The old sesame woman stood at the south stair with her hand in her apron pocket on the destroy key and dared herself to be the one to ruin an afternoon if the moment asked for it. She did not want the glory. She wanted to go home with the bag she had wrapped a lemon in for herself because she refused to let a fruit be a symbol for longer than it took to cut it.

The fourth bowl took the laugh and turned it like a puzzle piece that didn’t fit and then tried to bite down and gagged itself because Noor had taught it to, and the men nearest it stepped back with the old animal respect for something you don’t understand making a noise you associate with choking. The crowd did not kneel, because that was always the wrong word; they shifted and then went stubborn as a bad mule. Cats on windowsills licked their paws. A dog barked as if someone had stepped on its lie. Ansel rolled the Skylark in a soft arc that would look, later, on someone’s feed, like art, and would in the moment feel like the edge of a blade not used.

When it settled—the minute the bowl learned to resist its own appetite in public, which is a humiliation and a graduation—Noor took her hand off Utchi’s wrist and wiped the sweat on the underside of her jacket where no one would see it. She wanted, stupidly, to call her mother and be blessed, and then remembered her mother had taught her never to expect blessing for getting your job done. She drank water that had been poured hours ago and did not make a face. Iseul said nothing for a long time and then said, “Kian is fired,” in a tone that sounded like a note she had placed under a door, and Noor knew the boy would be back next week under another name in another department and she would have to teach the bowl another new shame.

DeVane sat on the bumper of the flatbed with the third bridesmaid and kicked her heel against the metal twice like a musician bored during a sound check, and the bowl learned, documented, and filed away in a place Noor had not built for the feeling, that some people are not impressed. Miah coiled her cable, flicked a strand of hair off her cheek with the back of her arm, and clapped twice and paused, just to hear the city do it back to her like an echo that was now a habit. Ansel landed and found himself crying in the safe, unflattering way of a grown person who has agreed not to keep perfect edges anymore; Miah pretended to be interested in a bolt until he was done.

They gathered again in the low room because rooms like that will continue to be invented as long as people need a place they can lie by omission without criminality. Utchi fell asleep sitting up with her head against the cabinet with the taped obscenity inside, mouth open a little in a way that made Noor love her as if she were an idea and not a person, which is a dangerous kind of love and sometimes how it has to be when you have more to do. The sesame woman did not come; she was home cutting a lemon over her sink and telling the fruit about men who learn to use their mouths properly at last. DeVane had a rumor in her pocket that the council had called a closed session to discuss optics and had decided, unanimously, to refer all questions to a committee; she kept it because sometimes rumor is ballast and sometimes it is poison and today it would serve better as ballast.

Ansel put the destroy word on the table without saying it and felt the weight of it press through wood like a coin left for a ghost. Noor put her hand near it and not on it and they both regarded the space between as if it were an animal they had consented to feed without naming. He could have kissed her for that restraint and did not; he looked at Miah instead because loving your friends well in front of people you want to touch is a discipline and he had not always been good at it. Miah snorted because he was being noble. DeVane lifted her braid with one hand and let it fall, tired enough to be theatrical and refusing the performance.

“I have to go talk to men with ties,” DeVane said. “I’m taking my braid and my ledger. Utchi, when you wake, throw that ring in a glass of water and drink the water so you remember you have a body. Noor, go home. Engineer whatever you have to so that the bowl does not speak to babies at dawn because some fool will think doing what was forbidden will turn the day a new color. Miah, make the bridesmaids fall in love with white noise. Rowe, lose your voice for six hours. That is not a suggestion. That is me spending the authority I don’t want, so you don’t have to spend the throat you do.”

They did not salute, because that would have been a lie about the shape of their agreement. They nodded like people who have agreed to carry the same crate around a corner without bumping the wall. Outside, the gulls were scissoring the air into pieces too small to be useful; the crows were eating the edges the gulls made, happy to be complicit. The bay looked like a thing money could buy, which is when it is at its most dangerous. The city placed its weight from one foot to the other and decided not to run for the moment.

On her way out, Noor stopped at the old parliament’s south stair because her body wanted to mark the geometry of luck where she had made it once, and found the second from the top had a child’s chalk on it: a crooked train and the word later in handwriting that looked like someone’s first attempt at belonging. She laughed, ugly and kind, and rubbed the chalk away with her sleeve, not because she didn’t like it, but because it is part of the work to leave no demand visible for the wrong set of eyes. She went home by a long route, bought scallions she didn’t need, and stood in her kitchen holding a lemon like a world she could afford.

Ansel lay on the cot and did what he’d been told for once. He did not talk. He did not rehearse an argument. He did not let the songs in the folder labeled regrets out to stretch. He watched the ceiling try to be interesting and fail. He breathed, wrong on purpose. He counted, not to keep time, but to occupy it. When sleep came it came like a colleague, competent and not cuddly, and he took its hand, and did not wake for a while.

The city did not sleep, not as whole, not yet. It practiced its bad choir and taught the bowl to be modest. It drank soup and cut lemons and hid jokes under tape in cabinets. It wrote new names on hands and then washed and tried to keep them. It lay on floors and put its cheek to concrete and listened for a hum that was less dangerous than it had been twelve hours ago. It took its hour of middle and then, greedy, asked for another, and got fifteen minutes. It would do. It always had. It would have to, again.
