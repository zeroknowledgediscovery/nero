Nobody noticed when the monkeys stopped taking the bananas. They just sat on the damp railings and the girdered edges of roofs with their slick hands curling and uncurling, looking at the fruit and then looking past it. A city’s monkeys should have been noise and teeth and fingers. Should have been mischief. Instead, you could lay a ribbon of plantain across a whole stone step and watch thirty pairs of eyes track, not the yellow, but a point above your shoulder where fog could not settle and the bones of the air were brighter.

By the time anyone thought to call it a crisis, winter had already curdled in the alleys. The brine sellers put their barrels on their sides and kept the lids closed. Children went without laughter because they were making monkey-traps out of string and bowl. Not to catch. To check if they could. They could not. The monkeys wouldn’t move, wouldn’t fight. Their fur grew dull. Ribs showed. And on the edge of every flat face a resemblance sharpened, something not-quite-like us and yet close enough to make a throat ache from trying not to name it.

Liora walked among them, her feet bare inside borrowed boots, the skin around her ankles so clean the slush shied away. She wore a coat of old cord, banded tight to hide the arch of her shoulder blades. Nobody looked twice at a thin woman with too-long hair drawn into a knot and a crimson ribbon hiding the fold in her left ear. Angels, when they come down, must look like something else. They have to—if they wish to work.

A small capuchin with a bald ring above its brow stared at her as she passed. Liora had salted crust in a paper pouch. She’d bought it, as people do, because you cannot feed a starving city and yet you can feed something, a single something. She broke the crust and the smell rose. Every monkey on the railing inhaled as one.

They did not take the offered piece.

Beyond the railing, the statue of the Third Prefect, Sir Calen Orro, threw a rust-red sheen into the pale noon light. In relief, his half-lion coat-of-arms looked almost alive. People had begun to tuck notes into the seam where his boot met the pedestal. Please, Sir. Please stop the levy. My cousin can’t find work at the brine house. Please make the monkeys go away. How to tell a bronze they are finished? Liora had heard the way the city used Calen’s name like yeasty dough—something to be stretched to fill the gaps. They made him into a prayer because he was a man who did what he said he would, and the idea of that was warmer than wool.

If Liora closed her eyes she could remember the weight of the Word: the way her bones had hummed when it entered, the phosphor shiver under her skin. She had taken this body because she had to hold it without destroying the alley she’d been standing in. If she had not put herself behind ribs and meat and the coarseness of hair, she would have burned all the letters in all the cracks, and the city would have become nothing but the gleam of cooled glass.

The Word did not sound. It formed. A lattice. A command. The Covenant strikes only at what it calls necessary; there is no softness in the name. She had tried to say no, and the Word had sat in her like a thrown stone sits in a river, changing the pattern of the current, a center of refusal around which everything else must flow.

Under the eaves of the ironmongery, she unfolded the slip of paper she had hidden in her sleeve. Human ways mattered. Human names are tied to doors and questions. The paper read:

Calen Orro, Prefect of the Watches, Master of Ash, Guardian of the Ninth Gate, Lord of the Midfells.

Below it, a line was scored with a knife, then another, then a sentence written very carefully in a hand that had learned letters late:

He made the Old Vow. He speaks for us and ages go forward because his word is his.

She’d copied the facts from a broadsheet and the sentence from a wall. On the back side she had written a smaller name, even more carefully, the pencil thunder-thin between her fingers:

Tavi.

She held the paper in both hands and felt it from both sides: a man who carried an impossible weight without groaning, a boy who slept with his mouth open and his fingers twitching with the exhaustion of play. He would be nine in two weeks. He kept a round stone in his pocket for luck. He’d shown it to her out behind the coal-shed where her sister had made her stand in the sun and promised not to die of illness while Liora was near. Not that Liora had told her anything true. Not yet.

He was as much her own as a spark to tinder. He had climbed her, once, the way children will climb. He’d told her a secret about a cat with a split ear who stole a sausage from the baker’s and took it gently, gently, back to a nest of red kittens under the steps. He had eaten his bread with his left hand; he’d held her with his right.

The Word in her told her to kill him.

Do what you must.

No. She said it in a breath, and the fog took it and set it on the river.

She had argued in the place where angels can argue. With the voice that measures mountains and calls them pebbles, they had told her: one life to unlatch the right door before the wrong door opens. A lever, Liora. You have your hands around a metal rod. Do not pretend you do not.

Why him.

Because Calen Orro made a promise. He made it in a vaulted room with cut stone in the floor the color of bruised fruit. We sealed it.

Vows can be cheap. Vows can be broken. The long ones are not. This one was stitched to the city’s law and to the old texts the law grew from like a vine from a cairn. Calen had put his brilliant, foolish honor into a ring he wore on his third finger and the ring had burned a mark around his skin. The vow said: while the Prefect speaks, while he walks and holds the Ninth Gate in his coat of arms, no blood of the household of Orro shall be spilled within the city walls. The vow had an end-clause. Every vow does, because language is not an iron padlock. The end said: if blood is dropped by hand and not by accident, the weight of that blood will fall back. On the speaker. At once. Straight, without wandering.

“‘Blood shall be weighed,’” Liora whispered, tongue sluggish on the vowels of the old tongue in which the vow actually lay. The words tasted like copper and elderberry.

Orro had taken his sister’s son as ward, as a means of saying: I am held to you as to my work. He had taken three others too, as honorable men do when the war season sweeps through and leaves children briefly alone. So long as the ring sat on his finger, so long as he was the Prefect, his heart walked where those children walked. The vow’s magic is not metaphor. It has teeth.

There were lines between accidents and hands. She could feel them. Threads you could tug if you were careful, if you were cruel.

The Old Vow could break the city if it broke the wrong way.

We have seen the door that opens when the Prefect signs his name in spring, the voice had told her. He does not know. He is as he is; he is honorable even when he should be cunning. He holds too much. So we set this path. The least ruin.

“Least,” she said then, in the alley, after she left her sister’s stoop, and her mouth felt full of ashes.

She was not the only one watching the monkeys. A girl with a hat shaped like a garden gourd sat on the steps, scratching dried-out scabs on the backs of her hands with a glint of nail. She had a stick across her knees. Every time a monkey twitched she made a little whistle. And somewhere above, in the crooked eaves, men with long coats whispered in a litany, bets on which gate would be closed next, which alley she would turn down, whether there would be another riot by evening.

Liora stuffed the paper into the crack of her coat’s cuff. She had not seen Calen Orro except on a balcony once, a figure in blue cloth with black fur at the collar and a voice that reached down and touched the crowd as if it were a single face. He had said: this will not last forever. We are not the first to starve nor the last to eat again. He had not promised what he could not keep. He had not let the guard shove the woman who shouted he was a liar, he had turned and listened until she ran out of words and then he had asked her name. The night after, someone painted his door with pitch and a sun in the center. He washed the sun off himself, with lye, leaving faint stains on the grain.

“Listen,” the girl with the gourd hat said when Liora’s shadow fell over her knee. She held up the stick. “I can make them look. I can make them look with the sound. But only sometimes. I think the sound has to bounce.”

“Vents,” Liora said without thinking. “Ducts. You sit just there, the pressure shifts.”

The girl chewed her lip, eyes bright. “I could fix a thing,” she said. “If I knew what was broke. Uncle says it’s the weather. I don’t think weather can make all the monkeys wrong.”

“Perhaps they are not wrong,” Liora said and smiled and hate bit at the smile’s root because she heard her own voice the way her sister heard it, that smile that could tell a child the storm would spare the roof when she knew it would not. “Perhaps they are paying attention to something we are not.”

“Like an earthquake?”

“Like a sound we cannot hear.”

“But it makes them not eat,” the girl said, stubborn. She stabbed at a banana with the stick harder than the banana deserved. “Mama said if I ever sit and look while food is there she’ll smack me so hard my bones forget how to hold me up. That’s what she said. So I eat. They could eat. They just aren’t. And I think—” She broke off, because one of the monkeys turned its head and looked at her and looked at Liora and then made a noise like a word said poorly, a word caught in a throat.

Liora put the crust down. She did not watch to see if any hand reached from the railing to take it. Sometimes kindness does best unobserved.

She found her sister at the basin, sleeves rolled, hair braided in a hurry. The room smelled of soap and onions and the faint camphor they rubbed onto Tavi’s chest when he came back from the fens with a cough. Tavi had outgrown the cough; the camphor sat on the shelf with only the corner of its wrapper left.

“You’re back,” Maren said, a false edge in her voice to keep from showing she’d hoped. “You didn’t say you were going out. He missed you. I told him you had to work. That’s one of those words I’m always telling him about, right, duty? It’s a good word. A hard one. He ought to get used to the sound.”

“I brought him burnt sugar,” Liora said. She held up a small twist of paper. There was nothing in it. She had forgotten to put the sugar in because she had bought the crust for a monkey. “I thought I did,” she amended, choking on the inconvenience of it.

Maren laughed without humor and flicked water at her. It ran off Liora’s cheek as if her skin thought it was stone. She made too much of wiping it. “He’s at his lessons,” Maren said. “He’s sulking because words are not the shapes he wants. He’s clever but he’s sideways. Like you.”

“I’m not—” Liora began, and did not finish because being sideways was the best description she had heard of herself in a long time.

Maren set her hands in the water and stared down into the way the soap collected at the edges. “Did you hear? Sir Prefect—” She did not say Calen’s name. Names are for people you think you might meet on a corner, and Maren moved in circles much too low for that. “He said he would keep the north roads open. I told Tavi that meant Aunt would have to go off sometimes to mark the wagons so the bandits don’t steal the wrong ones. I noticed your coat was damp. Am I clever? Should I get a prize?”

“You may have my share of pride,” Liora said lightly. “It tastes like iron. I would spit if I were you.”

“Hmm,” Maren said. Then the sound wavered. She dried her hands on her skirt and pulled strands of hair back behind her ear as if smoothing the world. “You came to tell me something.” Her face did the thing faces do when they become brave before they have to. Every muscle picked up its own piece of the courage and held it in the right direction.

“No,” Liora said truthfully and then went on anyway. “I should not be here.”

“You should always be here,” Maren said. “You should only be here. I know what we are to you. A project. A cap on fire. A thing you hold between forefinger and thumb.”

“Maren—”

“Don’t. If you hurt him, I won’t forgive you.” She said it with her voice slow to make it gentler, but the words could not be made gentle and she knew it and Liora knew it and they both looked for the sugar packet’s imaginary sparkle because it was easier than looking at each other.

Liora would have given any coin she had to be able to say, I am leaving because it’s safer for you. It would have been true. It would also have been less than all the truth and she had been born—or made—to scorn lies by omission. But braver minds than hers had been ruined by telling too much truth to the wrong set of ears just to absolve a heart. She kept her mouth still and her head bent and her hands folded to hide where the skin was too durable and too thin and a shade too luminous, like milk from a different animal.

Tavi came in like a rumor, listening to see if the kitchen would make of him something. When it did not at once, he threw himself at Liora with all the ease of his body’s trust. She caught him and held him even though every feather she had hidden under shoulder-blade and cloth ached with the closeness.

“Aunt! Aunt! I wrote a word. He wouldn’t tell me how to spell it. I did it myself. I guessed. I think I got it almost. Do you want to see? I used two lines. Like a river.” He made the shape in the air with his finger.

“Say it,” Liora said.

He whispered, very seriously, into her ear: “Honor.”

Her knees bent. She did not let them go. “That’s a good word,” she said.

“Ink looks like bruises,” Tavi said, proud of the observation. “I like it.”

“My little man,” Maren said and put her hand in his hair. “Go get your coat. We have to buy onions. We have to buy two onions because your aunt ate the burnt sugar on the way.”

“I knew it,” Tavi said, eyes bright with the joy of catching her in a story. “You owe me three burnt sugars now. A tally.” He marched to the corner where his coat hung and got one arm into it, then the other, then hopped on one foot because the second sleeve was tangled and somehow this all was hilarious to him. He spilled laughter onto the floor and it seeped into the boards.

It was a flood. Liora swallowed air hard enough to hurt. She had once set a river back in its bed after an earthquake tried to teach it another path. That had been so stupidly easy. This—

“You can at least walk with us,” Maren said. “You can at least be ordinary for a block.”

“Of course,” Liora said. Of course. She could be anything for a block.

They went to the market where all the stalls were double-thick to shut out wind. The onion-seller had knitted gloves with the fingers cut off and a smile that turned down. He had a son with two missing front teeth and a whistle that hurt if you stood too close and didn’t smile back. Men with their hats pulled low leaned together and shared salt from a common pouch. A woman with a basket full of leather scraps made a braid for Tavi so he could hang it on the door and keep whatever needed keeping out. A dog with one eye sat next to the crate of carrots and pretended not to hope.

On the upper edge of the market, patrols went by in files, heads turned toward one another in a way that meant either trust or fear. The city wore its winter livery: everything gray with a hint of something else. Liora found a quiet corner, which means in this city a place nobody thought to claim with a piece of rope or a crate. She stood there and listened.

You learn cities by their noises. The first day she had counted bells. The third, she had counted how many times the sound of the river turned to the sound of tires. The fifth, she learned that every alley had its own argument going on, long-term, words drawn over the years like chalk lines. And she learned the monkeys’ quiet. Quiet has a shape. It is not one thing. These monkeys did not make the sort of silence animals make when they are hiding from hawks. They made the silence of listening for something not yet landed. The silence of a pause between the breath in and the breath out.

She heard someone say Calen’s name. Three men, back of a stall, making the word into a question. “He will do what the law says,” one said, matter-of-fact. “Because that’s who he is. He would lock his own door if the law told him to.” The second sneered. The third said: “Better a man who locks doors with his name on them than one who locks doors at random.” The second: “We’re starving, Damy.” The third: “If you want law to bend, it has to be an arm and not a piece of wire. He is an arm. Be glad.”

Liora looked up and found a blue coat at the far end of the square. He had come without fanfare. He had no one at his elbow. He carried his hat in his hands like a man attending to a funeral. His hair was not the good kind for the weather. It wanted to be mischief all the time and could not sit down. Calen Orro had a face like a map. Spots where streets met behind his eyes. Places where you could lose yourself neatly.

He didn’t look like a man she could kill. He looked like a man who, if he put his palm down on your forearm when you were about to do something rash, would stop you. He didn’t even need to speak. The hand would do it. The warmth of the hand. The quiet within that warmth.

The Word inside her moved. Not like a snake. Like a lodestone finding iron.

“Sir,” someone said, and the square made a space around the word.

Calen nodded the way men nod when they have no idea what the right thing to say is and have decided to use their body instead. His eyes passed over the onions and the monkeys on the roof and stopped where the statue at the far corner had been painted with chalk in an arc like a bowl. He saw everything he could fix and everything he could not. He lifted his head and smiled with the left side of his mouth. Lions do that, when they smell rain. It is not happiness. It is a kind of relief.

Tavi tugged Liora’s hand. “Is that him?” he whispered. “Is that the man? The one with the watches? That’s what my teacher said. He keeps the watches. Does he keep our kitchen clock too? Or only the big clocks?”

“Only the big ones,” Liora said. She did not mean to meet Calen’s eye. She had meant to be the kind of woman nobody sees twice. But destiny, if that’s what you call it, has a taste for theater. He looked up. He looked directly where she was. He looked at Tavi’s small hand clenched in hers. He looked at her face and saw in it—what? Salt? Something that did not belong to the market and the onions and the leather scraps.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t make anything of it. He kept walking until the space the men had made for the word “Sir” closed behind him.

He would not live much longer if she did as she was told.

If she did not, something else would die. The Word had given her a vision, brief as a match struck in wind. She had seen—in the place where the river narrowed past the Ninth Gate, and beyond, where the monkeys gathered on the dry hump of rock—she had seen a crack in the air like a blink that did not open. She had seen people standing up from dinner and turning toward any noise because the air had forgotten how to hold sound. She had seen children run and the ground not hold. The Word had said: if he makes the spring decree that closes the east roads, the ones that lead into the long salt flats, the pressure shifts, and the thing that is not here because it is bound by the equal weight of another oath will be here. And it will eat the city. The Old Vow and the road decree tugged on each other. Something had wound those threads together. Liora did not know when, or whose fingers.

She breathed. She counted how many times the angle of Calen’s jaw twitched as he answered a question about rope. She counted the monkeys who turned their faces toward him and then away. Numbers helped. The universe is made of numbers even when it pretends otherwise. The problem was simple like ladders. Remove weight from one place, it falls on another. It is never the one you think you can spare. The solution was simple like knives. Touch one spot. The rest flips.

She bought onions and a string of burnt sugar beads to make good on a debt. Tavi wore the beads like a prince. He would eat them one by one over a week because that is the way you think when you are nine and understand the price of sweetness.

On the way home they passed the old clock shop with the cracked window and the sign that said, on one line, Edda Watches, and on the next, We Wait So You Don’t Have To. Tavi made a story about the sign. Liora listened and laughed where he wanted her to. She thought about the Ninth Gate.

That night, when Maren fell asleep with her cheek on her forearm at the table and Tavi sprawled in a narrow truce with his blanket, Liora went out onto the scullery step and let the cold cauterize the place where fear would have been if fear were something she had. Her feet and the step made a little cup of quiet. The monkeys on the fence top three houses down made the sounds they made when the air vibrated differently, almost too high to hear.

“You are late,” said a voice above her.

Liora didn’t look up. It was dangerous to look at one of her own. They make you homesick and home for angels is a place that unravels you gently if you try to go back before your work is done.

“Sered,” she said, because to pretend ignorance is to make angels angry.

A shadow fell without making a shape. “Your time runs,” Sered said. “The door we showed you is close to opening. The Prefect thinks he can fix what is broken if he just keeps doing what he has always done. He is wrong.”

“He is right, too,” Liora said. “That’s the trouble. He is almost right.”

“Almost does not save cities. Almost is a word that belongs to lovers and thieves. I am neither.”

“If I cut him—”

“You cannot. Not with any knife on earth. The Old Vow will spit it out. The man is surrounded by law he wrote himself and law he did not know was coiling around his throat. He put the ring on his own finger. He might as well have wrapped a thread around his own neck. He did not mean to. He meant to be good.”

“The cost,” Liora said. “We call this least.”

“It is not.” Sered sighed. The sigh sounded like wind moving quickly down a glass corridor. “It is what is. This place is a tangle of human speech and old oaths. It is rotted cloth, wet with salt. You pull, the weave comes apart. You pull elsewhere, it holds. Liora. The word you carry will destroy you if you keep pushing it away.”

“I know.” She said it because it was, at last, true. The Word had already begun to hollow her out. In birds, this is a mercy. Birds must be light to rise. In people, it looks like grief.

Sered came closer. She did not see feet, or a face, only the sense of a bulk leaning against the night. “You love them,” Sered said, not cruelly. “You wish you did not. Do you remember the day you first saw one of them? With no skin on your eyes. You said: they are made of threads. Every one a bundle, tied messy. I want to put my fingers in and straighten.”

“I failed at that,” she said. “You were right to keep me away so long.”

“You did not fail,” Sered said, impatient. “They are not meant to be straight lines. That is our vanity. Go. Do your work. The stone is already in your hand.”

“The stone,” she repeated, hating how the word felt in her mouth. Tavi’s luck-stone. He’d left it on the window sill, because that is what you do with luck when you are nine and don’t think it can run away.

“And look,” Sered said, and pointed at the line of monkeys, “your borrowed little city is growing ears to hear things it should not. They are listening to a call that is not for them. It will come wrong when it comes. It is not for any of you. It has a different sky mixed into it. Be done, Liora, before it arrives.”

She wanted to ask what the call was. She wanted to ask if it had stars in it, because when the monkeys looked at her, their eyes showed very small points of light that were not entirely reflected. But Sered was narrowing, a shadow going back through itself. You do not ask too many questions at once. Not if you want your answers to make any sense. And she was tired of too many answers.

After Sered left, Liora went back into the kitchen. The camphor was just where it had been. The braid of leather the woman had made was hanging on a nail. The onion smell under the soap smell under the damp smell made a sandwich of air and she took a bite out of it with her lungs because it was human and thus good. She wanted to be full of human things until there was no room left for the Word.

She stood at the window and looked at the small, round thing on the sill. Tavi’s luck. It was nothing. It was a piece of river, hardened. It had a notch on one side where it had, once, knocked against a cousin stone. She could close her hand around it and feel the cool leak out onto her palm and the heat go in.

It was absurdly simple, the way through. The Old Vow had been written, carefully, old tongue, words pinned to ribs the way fishermen pin lures to the walls of their huts for luck. It didn’t say it had to be steel. It didn’t say it had to be blood. It said hand. It said drop. It said within the city walls.

She closed her hand. The stone went from cool to cool with a memory of someone’s warmth. She put it in her pocket and did not think too hard, not yet, about walking out past the last house into the small strip of common ground where the wall fell and the gate was less than a gate with a hinge that stuck unless you swore at it. The city walls meant something even where they were only a polite idea.

“Tomorrow,” she told herself in a voice that sounded like someone else’s. “Not tonight. You have a day yet. The city will not burn this hour. You can have one more morning.”

She put the stone back. She found a piece of string and tied it to the stone because Tavi kept losing things. She did it because not doing it would feel too much like practice for what came later.

Maren stirred, half-waking. “Aren’t you ever tired,” she murmured. “Aren’t you ever just a girl with sore feet. Sit. Eat. Stop worrying stones with your fingers.”

“I’ll sleep,” Liora said. “When I am less sideways.”

“You’ll always be sideways,” Maren said, and her voice softened around the word. “That’s why we love you and that’s why you’ll leave.”

Tavi turned over and groaned like a small animal. He sat up, hair toward the moon, and blinked. “Aunt? Are you very awake? I dreamed about a big monkey with a hat. He was making maps on the walls with chalk. He drew a circle and put something else inside it and then he put a dot outside and he said: here. And then he cried and cried. I told him he could have my bread. But he wouldn’t eat it.”

“Dreams are stupid,” Maren said, kind.

“Sometimes they are messages,” Liora said, and Maren looked at her sharply and then away. “Sometimes your head needs to tell you a thing and so it dresses it up in animals because animals are useful for that.”

“What’s the thing?” Tavi asked, instantly hooked.

“That you are good,” Liora said promptly. “And your bread is as good as your hands.” She hoped the half-answer nested inside the whole answer would be enough of a meal to take into sleep.

He lay down with his fingers curled around the string and the stone hit him in the cheek. He laughed once, softly. “Ow,” he said. “My luck hurts.”

She would have taken the hurt for him if it would have helped. It would not.

Morning came like a slapped face. The city did its best to pretend it was a different city than the one of the night. Men in aprons dragged new barrels out as if they were old barrels. The frost grew lace on the railings. The monkeys tried, for a little while, to groom one another. They gave up. They sat.

Liora went to the Ninth Gate. She had to see it. The words of the vow carried its name the way a story carries a refrain. The gate was nothing special if you had no taste for names. It was a slice of road where the bricks had been replaced three times more often than elsewhere. A carved lintel with a fox. A ridge of mildew where moss dared not grow. A line drawn here by someone you had never met and held by everyone you had. The gate didn’t open. It simply insisted. It compressed the idea of going past into a shape that felt like going through.

She stood in the middle of it and closed her eyes and for a moment she heard the city. The law’s voice is not audible if you are ordinary. It is not even audible if you are a clever woman with a knack for listening. It is audible if you are made of listening in the way Liora was made. She heard the strands of vow and decree strummed together to make a low note that made your stomach shift. She heard the silence beyond it. And underneath the silence—the thing Sered had warned of. It kept, irritably, trying to push through. It had a voice like a kettle that never quite boils, just shakes on the ring until the lid clatters.

Across the river, on the dry hump where the monkeys gathered, the bald-crowned capuchin lifted its chin and stared at the sky. It began to make a small sound. One of the market men said later it sounded like a kettle. Another said like a woman trying not to cry. Liora thought it sounded like a word forgetting how to say itself.

She turned, suddenly sure of being watched. Calen Orro stood at the end of the gate with the expression of a man who had come looking for something he had misplaced. The city made a little pause, as cities do when the right two people stand where they can see each other even if it makes no sense yet.

He came toward her, hands visible, palms forward. He had learned that trick from shepherds. People are sheep in one specific way: they spook if they cannot see what a hand carries. He smiled. The left side. As if he and she had an agreement she had forgotten.

“You were in the market,” he said. “With a boy who ate his sugar one bead at a time.”

“My nephew,” Liora said because she wanted to say it once more the ordinary way. Because words make doors. Because doors can be anything.

“He looked—” Calen stopped, because finishing would make him sentimental. “Well,” he said instead.

“He is,” Liora said and watched his face as if she could see the place inside his chest where the vow tugged and tugged and had not yet frayed the thread. She could not. She only saw a tired man who stood under the weight of being good as if it were a pack he had no pocket to put down into.

“Do you live near the gate?” he asked conversationally, as if he were not what he was, as if he were a man with time.

“No,” she said.

“You came to listen,” he said, and his eyes sharpened. “Some can. Not many. The old women who know how to set bones sometimes. A few boys who throw stones at the wrong things. I can’t. Not the right way.” He looked up. “I can feel it when it changes.”

“Does it scare you,” Liora asked, low, as if asking matters. “The weight of the words you made.”

“It is not fear,” he said slowly. “It is—it is like promising a child you will lift him and not knowing if your back will hold this time.” He laughed at himself. “That sounds foolish.”

“It sounds like your back hurts,” Liora said. She wanted to reach and put her palm just above the center of his spine and see if something would ease. She kept her hands on the railing.

“The roads,” he said, not to her particularly, as if saying it out loud made it more real. “The roads are where my heart lives. I can’t close them. But I can’t leave them open. I have pledged to both facts. I cannot please both facts.”

“If you wait,” Liora said, “does something become clear.”

“Possibly,” he said, and laughed again. “But decisions do not always have the grace to wait with you.”

Before she knew she would, Liora said: “You made a ring of your word.”

“I did,” he said simply. He held up his hand. The ring was plain, gold, no jewels, worn so thin on one side you could have told a story about how the years had leaned. “My father taught me not to make vows to gods,” he said. “Men have a way of bending gods into the shapes they need. They forget gods do not like being bent. He told me to make vows to human things. To the gate. To the law. To any boy who needs it who I could reach. To breath. It seemed wise.” He shook his head. “I am not wise now. I am only what I am.”

He turned his head. For a moment his gaze went past her shoulder to the hump of rock across the water where the monkeys sat. His mouth flattened. It was not pity. He did not believe in pity. It was the expression a man wears when looking at something that refuses help with dignity. “Do you see them,” he asked. “They were not like that five years ago. They ate our apples and tore the tavern-signs to tatters and even stole a puppy once. Brought it back. I cannot say what is worse. I was used to mischief. This quiet makes the hair on my arms stand up.”

“They hear something,” Liora said, because telling this truth did not crack any other. “It is not for them.”

“It is not for us?” The left side of his mouth lifted again, reflex. “You speak like a woman who has seen a map I have not.”

“I have seen nothing,” Liora said. “I am only sideways.”

“I like sideways,” he said, as if to his own surprise. He reached into his coat pocket and brought out a small piece of paper folded twice and twice again. “There will be a gathering in three days,” he said. “Not political. Nobody will be counting hands. We will talk about the river’s winter behaviors. About rope. About fever. And also about this, the way they sit and listen to the wrong thing. Will you come. Bring your sister. Bring your nephew with the sugar. The hall is warm. There will be bread.”

Bread, Liora thought and wanted to laugh. There is always bread at the center of everything. “I will,” she said, though she would do nothing of the sort because in three days there would be no gatherings and no hall because in two days she would kill the vow through a child, because in one day she would break one of the only things the universe admires in itself.

When she looked up from the paper, Calen had already gone. He did not wait for agreements because agreements do not need witnesses. They need keepers.

The monkeys swayed on the rock across, as if a breeze had come and left. One of them opened its mouth and closed it as if practicing saying a word. Liora shuttered her eyes and saw the star the capuchin’s pupil had held. It wasn’t a reflection. Stars in daylight are not true. Unless they are not our stars.

She thought: there is something wrong with the number of them. Not the number of monkeys; the sound had been counting. She had good ears for numbers. Something was missing. A skip, the way a song skips when you have kept it too long. She could not hear it again. The city laid another noise over it. Coffin-lids. The sound of an onion hitting a board. Tavi laughing because the string had tangled in his shoelaces.

She took the paper Calen had given and tucked it into her coat on the other side from the Word. You do things like that when you have two pieces of truth that will not speak to one another and you have to carry both.

Evening stretched itself along the river like a cat. Sered did not return. The angels have a sense for moments that will hurt too much. Liora wished they did not. She would have liked to be told again that this was least. She would have liked to be assured of it and then say yes, and then go, and do, and be no longer a hollow thing. But the city would not give her that. It gave her instead the smell of cabbage from the pot on their stove, the feel of Maren’s hand brushing her sleeve without knowing it, the weight of Tavi’s head when he went to sleep on the floor on purpose because it was cold and the boards kept secrets in their knots.

She kissed the place on his forehead where the hair grew in a swirl. She counted to ten. She did not count again. When the middle of the night shook itself and the quiet sat up and turned toward the wrong thing and the monkeys turned their faces toward the river and did not blink, Liora went out. She took nothing. She made her hands empty. She held them up. She could not have made a smaller thing out of herself if she tried. She went down to the gate and up on the wall and out, parentheses around breath, and put her feet where the city ceased and the not-city began.

The stone in Tavi’s hand warmed his fingers. He dreamed about maps. He dreamed about circles and dots. He said one word in his sleep, and it sounded like a monkey’s noise and like something else. He said: here. Then he said: aunt.

Liora stood in the margin of all her vows and the city’s and the Prefect’s and hers, and felt for the thread that would pull easiest and not unravel everything, and felt only the Word, and took a step into tomorrow, because words mean nothing until they meet time, and time had arrived.By morning the wall had forgotten her, which is the way of walls. It remembered only its own height and the frost in its pores and the way boys had climbed it one summer with knotted ropes and hands so black with pitch they left fingerprints you could still see in the right light. Liora would have liked to be like that, a surface that reflected nothing but the changes of the day. Instead, she had the night under her skin, a bruise where the Word had pressed.

She walked back with her shoulders set as if the cold asked something of her and she did not yet know if she would give it. In the first lean of light there were women sweeping their doorstones with brooms gone to nubs. There were men arguing softly about a bolt of cloth, not because cloth mattered but because speaking without shouting had become a proof of being alive. The monkeys did what they had taken to doing: they arranged themselves along the parapets and the shed roofs in a pattern nobody could map and stared at places in the air where the fog did not dare to settle. The bald-crowned capuchin, the one with the scholar’s ring of skin above its eyes, chewed nothing and shifted its weight and lifted its chin by degrees as if listening up a staircase.

Maren saw her the moment she touched the kitchen sill. There are ways to move quietly, but women who have shared childhoods hear each other in the turn of an ankle, in the small impatiences of breath. “You look like you told the moon a thing and it didn’t answer,” Maren said, not unkindly. She had a damp cloth knotted around one hand and was binding it with a strip torn from an underskirt. “The onion fought back.”

Liora reached without thinking and touched the knotted cloth. It cooled at her fingers. The wound’s edges cinched as if someone had pursed them. Maren didn’t start. She had long ago learned not to start, but she watched Liora as you watch a splinter working its way out: curious, fascinated, a little afraid of what else it might pull.

“You should not have to be magic to be useful,” Maren said. The anger in it was old enough to be gentle, like a knife that has been sharpened so often it can only make your finger smarter about where not to touch. “Tavi’s upstairs. He drew on the wall with chalk. He says it wasn’t him.”

“It was a large monkey with a hat,” Liora said, and they smiled because they knew the plays children make to keep from being scolded and because the story, in its foolishness, comforted.

On the stair, the light broke itself into small bars. Tavi had made a picture that wanted to be a map when it grew up. He had used three bits of chalk: white, blue, and an ugly yellow that looked like old teeth. He had drawn a circle so perfect she put her palm over her throat because some shapes, when made well, call to the part of you that likes to be caught. Inside the circle he had smudged a field of color. Outside it, on the upper right, he had put a dot. He had added a line from the dot to the circle, then erased it so hard the plaster showed.

“That wasn’t me,” he said, solemn, and then grinned. “It was me. But the monkey told me how. Also I think the dot is you.”

Liora could not bring herself to ask what he meant. She knelt on the floorboards because the floorboards knew her weight the way rivers know stones. “Tell me why you made that.”

He swung his legs, heels kicking the wood in a rhythm that made the room into a drum. “Because last night the words were too loud. I wanted to put them in a place. If you draw around a thing it doesn’t run so much.”

“Wise,” Liora said, and meant it. He thought for a while. She let him. Children fill silence better than adults; they pour it full of sense from angles we forget we have.

“Also,” he added, with the pleased air of someone dropping a secret into the air as if the air would know where to set it, “the dot has to be outside or else the circle isn’t a circle. Teacher says a circle is not a bowl. It is a border.”

“Your teacher is an artist disguised as a tyrant,” Liora murmured, half to herself. She lifted the chalk and put it back; her fingers were ringed with exactness that came not from chalk but from the morning’s decisions arranging themselves in her. “Tavi,” she said, because it is better to use a boy’s name when you are about to ask him to help you do a thing you have no right to ask, “do you remember the brine house? The smell like a dock and the men who wear their hats as if the sky is stingy?”

He wrinkled his nose. “They have barrels like ribs. And the man with the glove that has only one finger.”

“I need to borrow something from there,” she said. “Not for long. A handful would do.”

“We can’t afford brine,” he said at once, practical as bread. He took this as an adventure and a duty simultaneously and, for a brief moment, Liora had to put her teeth together to keep from making a noise that would have been too broken to fix.

“It won’t cost anything,” she said. “I think they will let us have the dregs from a lid. For luck.”

“For luck,” he said and touched his stone in his pocket as if the word might notice and lean closer.

They went because children like errands more than adults do and because the winter light had itself tied in a knot on the river and was shining hard wherever it could bend. The brine house was a belly of a place, dark and warm and slick with a salt that had climbed the wood in pale ladders. The man with the single-finger glove squinted at them and then over the top of them at the doorway, inventorying exits as people who keep valuable liquids do.

“Please,” Liora said, and did not bother with a pretense. “A pinch. From the edge where it crusts. For a charm.”

He put his tongue in his cheek. He knew the city’s laws when it came to paying, and he knew the city’s other laws, which were the older ones, the ones that said sometimes you handed a woman a thing because the story of it had already started and you did not want to be the fool who stood in its way and got the ending wrong. He pushed a lid toward them with his good hand. The brine had dried where air struck it, chalked itself into little plates shaped like broken wishes.

Tavi stood on his toes, carefully, and scraped a bit of salt-crust into Liora’s palm. He did it slowly, the way secrets are unwrapped in books. The light caught on it. She felt the old word for blood stir behind her teeth, like a fish flicking its tail in a bowl. She lifted her hand and saw there, in the cupped skin, the whiteness that had been water made more itself. It wasn’t blood. It was close to it, in the way a cousin is not you but knows your laugh.

“Thank you,” she told the brine man, and he shrugged and looked away and hummed five notes in a row with no tune, the human equivalent of sweeping a magic out of a room you had not meant to invite in.

When they came out into the light, the bald capuchin lifted its head and made a sound that was almost not a sound. It was a pressure. Tavi put his free hand flat against his chest and breathed in a surprised little cough. “I can feel it in my buttons,” he said, eyes very round. “Does that mean I am clever or in trouble.”

“Both,” Liora said. She looked up, to where the monkeys were making their not-noise, to the places in the vapor where the fog refused to lie down, to the bones of air. If the law had ears, they would be there. If words have to be caught and kept, the city would make itself organs to do it. She walked under one of those bright bones as if walking under a bridge. The hair along her arms prickled.

“Here,” she said to Tavi, “tie your stone to this.” She took a filament of twine from her coat—the sort string-sellers coil in their sleeves for poor days—and made a loop around the stone’s notch. Tavi looked doubtful but he trusted her hands almost as much as he trusted his own luck. He wound the twine in and out through his fingers, made of it a game, and at the end of that invented play his stone floated a finger’s breadth beneath her fist like a little moon on a leash.

She held the brine in her other palm, and felt the old vow’s syllables coil themselves, interested. The Ninth Gate was four streets away. The law that bound it was not. She could hear it the way a child hears thunder in a room three doors down. Words are not wires but sometimes they might as well be. She went to the alley’s mouth where the wind always went sideways and stood there because standing in the right place is half of listening.

She opened her hand. The brine was dry. She breathed on it until it became a paste. She pinched what she could pinch, a grain, a little more, and then—very deliberately, because the old text had used a word that meant hand in the way hands are hands when they bless and when they take and when they take apart—she tipped her palm. The brine fell. It broke in the air and the bright bone over their heads rang once, like a spoon against a glass.

Far off, in a room with lots of paper and no fire and a coat hanging on the back of a chair because the owner did not know how else to put himself away, Calen Orro took one swift breath as if someone had tipped him toward stairs. The ring bit the finger it sat on. His heart did not fail. His chest simply learned the measure of something it had not been asked to hold since he was thirteen and saw a boy with a cut across the back of his head slide down a slate roof because roofing was a job and jobs did not wait for the sky to warm. He sat, awkwardly, because his knees had been told to be chairs and not doors. He pressed his palm to the desk. The wood had the smell of sap. His mouth tasted like iron and berries.

“Sir?” said a voice in the doorway, because a secretary knows a man’s posture the way a wife knows his footsteps. “Is it the decree. Do you need—”

“Fetch me Edda,” Calen said, when his breath could find words again. “The watchmaker. And—no, never mind the physician. This is not an ailment. It is one of our other problems.”

In the alley, Liora closed her hand on nothing and felt everything. The law had answered. It had not answered fully. It had twanged, as a bridge string does when a cart goes over and leaves a little echo. The monkeys cocked their heads and, for three heartbeats, looked at her instead of past her. Tavi was staring up as if he could see music. He said in a very small voice, “Aunt.”

“I know,” she said. She smiled at him to teach his body that small does not have to mean afraid. “That sound was not for you. It is for the things that sit in stone.”

“Am I a thing that sits in stone,” he asked, suspicious, because he did not like having been left out of a category.

“You are a thing that travels,” she said. She took his bracelet of sugar beads between finger and thumb and lifted one bead free and put it on his tongue and felt, absurdly, as if she had bought them a minute. He chewed austerely, honoring the bargain he had made with himself and sweetness.

She dropped a second pinch. The air’s bone did not ring this time. It made a softer sound, like breath through a pane. The brine, being salt, caught light and made a tiny star as it fell. Liora had the sense of currents adjusting. Not large. Not more than taking a plate and sliding it three finger-widths to the left. Enough to change whether the edge of it catches a tablecloth if you pull too hard. She thought, with the part of her that counted and measured and weighted: if blood must be weighed then perhaps the scales can be set. The Old Vow had lace around it. The lace was law, woven with intention and accident and a city’s taste in righteousness. Lace takes a set. Steam it, dry it pinned, it will hold itself in a different curve.

“Come,” she said to Tavi and he came, because he wanted to see if the brine did the same thing at the corner where the shoemaker had put up a sign that said, badly, TO NAIL TODAY, and then the word NOPE.

They found the girl with the hat like a gourd on the third step of the building with the iron balcony. She was still whistling, still making the sound bounce, but now instead of a stick she had a length of pipe and had discovered that if she put one end on a railing and hummed, she could feel arguments in the bones of the city through the pipe. “You again,” she said, pleased, and then more pleased when she saw the boy. Children prefer to make friends with other children. Adults interfere.

“Your pipe,” Liora said. “May I.” The girl hesitated and then handed over the pipe as if handing over a pet she did not entirely trust not to bite. Liora put the pipe’s end against the brick and hummed without moving her mouth. The sound went in. The brick threw back a memory of how the old law had been glued to it two prefects ago by a man with hands so chapped the skin had lifted and made little tags like labels. The brick said, clear as a coinseller: here. The here was not a point; it was a volume. It was a place in the air above where fog could not be. It was wider in winter and narrow in the heat, because air is a creature too. It had edges you could push and not have them move and edges you could talk into shifting if you were patient and if you praised them when they did it, the way you praise a mule for taking one more step than you asked for.

“What an odd face,” the girl said. “You look like you tasted a lemon and then discovered it was bread.”

“Have you ever fixed a thing by not touching it,” Liora asked her, as if they were old friends who had been remembering the same childhood.

“Every day,” the girl said promptly. “You stand here and listen and then you throw a rock over there and the noise shakes the stupid bolt loose. Uncle says this city is made of strings. You just have to know where to pull.”

“You have an uncle who is not an uncle,” Liora said.

“I have six,” the girl said, puzzled only if adults were as silly as they seemed. “Do you want to see what happens if we hum all together.”

“Very much,” Liora said. She handed back the pipe and the girl did the thing children have in their pockets like marbles: she gave the pipe to Tavi and showed him with gestures how to set his lips and where to set his teeth and how the sound should be made round or flat. Tavi made a noise that was not a note and then another, better. The monkeys listed toward them. Across the river, the bald-crowned capuchin lifted both hands and placed them on nothing as if blessing bread.

Liora took the grain of brine between her fingers again and felt its edges and the way it held together because of what had been taken from it. She thought of promises you make to the air and to the law and to a boy. She thought of the Word sitting in her like a hinge. She opened her hand and this time did not drop the brine. She drew the edge of it along the brick and the pipe sang in her teeth. The note went along the bright bones the monkeys watched and came back to her clean. The city’s listening had turned its head one finger-width. She felt the other listening behind it stir, the thing behind the silence, the kettle that wanted to boil and could not. It had noticed. It was not pleased.

In the room with the papers, Calen’s secretary fixed his eyes on his prefect until he was certain he was not about to die and then left very quietly because there are moments when you arrange furniture with your breath. Calen sat alone with his ring and the taste of old oaths in his mouth and thought of a stone floor the color of bruised fruit, and a boy with flour on his eyelashes because he had lain down under the baker’s table to listen to the undersides of loaves. He saw the boy’s face when he said, gravely, that he was going to be a geographer because the world was messy and someone had to provide the lines. He put his hand over his ring as if to dull it.

When Edda came she came at a pace that made his heart hurt for how many years it had taken to smooth herself down into a walk like that. She had hands like sentence endings: firm, neat, sometimes final. She brought with her a pair of spectacles she never wore, because the need for objects to be used for their names is a habit of men and she liked to confound it. She looked at him and at the ring and at the papers and then at the window.

“It twanged,” she said. “Something pulled at the semantic. You were present.”

“I was simply sitting,” he said. “Does presence count as complicity.”

“It always has,” Edda said, amused without warmth. “You cannot hide from the words you tie yourself to. They are not snakes, to be charmed by a tune and then put in a basket. They are dogs. They lift their heads when you walk by and they smile and sometimes they bite you by mistake because you smell like a thief. Sit. No, you are sitting. Good. Tell me what moved.”

He told her, not because he was given to confiding but because she was older than the gates and he had made a habit of trusting things that survived. He told her about the taste, and the ring, and the way the room had tilted to one side then righted itself like a boat that had seen a wave. Edda listened like the city listens if you know where to stand. She put a finger on the ring and hissed under her breath when the gold warmed.

“This is not Orro blood,” she said. “If it were, you would not be using your mouth so easily. This is equivalence. Some clever someone is plucking at the lace.” She tapped the rim of the ring with a fingernail. “You should put this in your pocket for a day.”

“I can’t,” he said, and then laughed and added, because if you tell a watchmaker a truth you must not leave it half wound, “I won’t. It would be pretending to take down a sign and leave the shop open.”

“Pretend has rescued more souls than it has ruined,” Edda said tartly. “But I accept your piety. Listen to me. The old text uses the root dam. It means blood, yes, but only because blood is the thing that lets a body be community to itself. It means life-salt. It means the liquid you grieve and the liquid you flavor with and the liquid that keeps your bones from being glass. It means brine. It means tears. It means the water in a birch if you cut it at the right time, because the old men were poets and could not help themselves. This is what is being played with. Do you see. If you must weigh blood you can weigh salt. If you must drop blood by hand you can drop a grain of it and it learns the lesson.”

“Will it kill me,” Calen asked, not in fear, simply caring to have the answer tidy.

“If someone uses it as a needle and not a hammer,” Edda said, “it will not. If someone uses it as a way to move the set of the law a hair, then perhaps they can keep you from—” She waved her hand at the east wall where the flattening notes of spring lived in a calendar nobody could yet read. “We have made the words so hard we forgot they are not stone. We forgot we made them and can comb them. This is a combing. It is not graceful. But it is better than some boy bleeding on cobbles.”

He thought of Tavi without having to reach for the thought, and he wanted to sit on the floor. He did not. He folded his hands, because a man is permitted three gestures in a crisis and fewer if he wishes not to borrow dignity. “If someone is doing this,” he said, carefully, “and I make the roads decree anyway. Does it hold.”

“It will hold if you do it with both your mouth and your spine,” Edda said. “Do not let them pry your words from your hand. At the same time—” She smiled. It made her look like a person. “If someone is combing, do not slap their fingers. Look out the window. See how the monkeys are behaving. We have been given a hum we do not deserve. Let the hum do some work. You like to carry everything yourself, Calen Orro. You are a mule with a crown. Sit. Let the city help.”

He did sit. He did not know if he had let anything help. But he put his ringed hand on the desk and made a small circle with his little finger in a habit he had had since he was a boy and wanted to know if the world had edges and if he could discover them by drawing.

On the roofline, the gourd-hat girl had discovered that if you and a boy hum into a pipe at the same time you can make a tone that is not quite either of you but is stronger than both. Tavi flushed with joy at the trick of it. The monkeys went very still. Liora, with a grain of brine, drew a line in the air that was only a finger long and felt the old vow’s attention tilt toward her the way a person turns their ear when the sound is too quiet to be polite about hearing. It was working. She did not know if it would save anything. She only knew the thing within the silence did not like it and the part of her that was made a long time ago and called itself angel liked that very much.

“You’re making something happen,” the girl said, fierce with delight and jealousy because the delight was not entirely hers. “What is it. Tell me or I will bite you.”

“You may bite me,” Liora said absently, “but I will bite back,” and the girl laughed and accepted terms as fair. “This city has old words stitched into it,” Liora added, more gently. “They are a good stitching. They hold. They make a shape. But someone tugged the threads together wrong at a corner and now the lace wants to pucker. We are steaming it.”

“What is steaming,” Tavi asked, eager to know everything because knowledge made him bigger inside.

“When you make a thing remember it did not have to be the way it is,” Liora said, and then she wished she had not said that in quite that way because promises sometimes hide in definitions and she did not want to promise more than she could stand up under.

Sered came when the light had leaned a quarter toward noon and shadows had become opinions. He came in the way of a cloud deciding to turn into a sheep briefly for the joy of it and then deciding not to bother. Liora did not look at him. She held the twine with the stone and the grain of brine as if she had borrowed both from a future moment and was tending them until their owner arrived.

“You are wasting time,” Sered said without sound. “You have hours. You are combing fringe while the cloth burns.”

“Sometimes combing keeps fire from jumping,” she said, and because she was angry, she added, “You could help.”

“We are helping,” Sered said, and there was a rare wryness to it that told her he had been in this city long enough to pick up some of its cadences. “We are not very good at it. The Word is not a comb, Liora. It is a stone. Put it in a sling.”

She thought of boys on a hill with their pockets full of pebbles and one in the mouth and one under the tongue to taste the river while you talked. “Not yet,” she said, with a steadiness she had to walk around the block to find. “You told me least. I am trying to make least smaller.”

“Least is a pit you throw yourself in,” Sered said. “Your way is a path that never arrives. Words decay. You will lose your chance, and the thing that is pressing will learn the habit of pressing.”

“Then let me teach it the habit of backing up,” she said. She drew another line in the air. Felt it catch. Felt it hold. Her shoulders ached as if she had been carrying water. The capuchin across the river put one hand over its eye and then the other, as if light hurt.

She did not see Calen’s face when the ring warmed again. She did not see Edda put two fingertips on his wrist. She did not see the secretary stand in the hall with a cup of water and not drink it because it seemed impertinent. She did not see Maren come to the kitchen door and lean against the jamb and close her eyes and whisper to whatever would listen, which is what women do when there are no gods in the room but the kettle still boils.

She did see Tavi’s mouth go a little slack and the sugar bead between his teeth go soft, and she put her hand on the back of his neck because you must ground a child when sounds bigger than any room go through him. “You may stop,” she said to him and to the girl and to herself. “We have moved it as far as we can without tearing.”

The girl stopped at once. Tavi tried to hum one last time because that is what children do when you tell them to stop and they have not had the last word yet. The pipe burred. It was funny and everyone laughed and the laughter sat down and stayed.

“I want to see the Ninth Gate,” the girl announced, as if it had been her idea all along. “I think it has teeth, and I am not afraid of teeth. My name is Tsum. I didn’t tell you because I wanted to see if you would ask without me having to tell. You did not. So I told you.”

“Tsum,” Liora said, tasting the name. “It flips over nicely.” She could not bring the children to the gate and do what she had to do. She could not leave them and do it either. The paradox was so neat it could win prizes. “Later,” she told Tsum, and to Tavi she said, “Go home and show your mother the chalk. Tell her I went to buy string thicker than my sense.” He came close to argue. She put a hand on his cheek and the stone tapped his fingers where he had knotted the twine around it. “Go,” she said, the Word under her voice for a moment, not as command but as the weight that makes a word land and not bounce. He went, grudging, and then magnificently, because he would not let anyone see his shoulders slumping.

Liora walked to the Ninth Gate because sometimes walking is prayer and also plan. The law hummed like a man practicing scales. The city had noticed, in a thousand small ways—the way laundresses shook out clothes, the way men spat, the way the wind chose which alley to enter. She set her back against the lintel with the fox carved into it and closed her eyes. The fox was slightly cross. There are craftsman’s moods in stone, if you know where to taste. She pressed her palm to the place where the old text’s sense gathered like water in a bowl. She held a grain of brine. She thought of all the harms. She thought of Tavi’s pulse when he had fallen asleep on his arm and had not known he was crushing his own wrist. She thought of Maren’s braid, and the way she put it over her shoulder when she was going to tell a truth, as if the hair needed to watch her face for cues. She thought of Calen in his blue coat with the left side of his mouth doing a small stubborn thing. She thought, briefly and not kindly, of the angels, and then, because she is what she is, she thought of them kindly. She let the grain fall.

It was different. Here, at the limit of the city’s insistence, the law heard itself hearing. The sound went out and came back with notes added, overtones that made her thighs tremble. Across the river, the kettle-not-yet sounded, not louder, but with teeth set. The capuchin rocked, once, as if a wave had lapped it.

Calen put his hand on the desk and the desk pushed back. He stood and did not fall and this, in a man who had been bending his knees properly for forty years, took courage. Edda said, conversationally, “It will not kill you today,” and he answered, “I would prefer it chose an afternoon when I am less busy,” and then felt ridiculous, and then felt better, which is the way of ridiculousness when you do not fear it.

“Who is doing it,” he asked. “Do you know.”

Edda smiled again, the small smile of a person who builds time for others and sometimes forgets to wrap any around herself. “Someone who holds two truths in one coat,” she said. “Someone who buys sugar and brine on the same day. Someone who is sideways in a way the city can use.”

He would have had a name in his mouth if he had allowed himself the vanity. He did not. He said, instead, “If I called an assembly. If I asked people not to make decisions—they will make them anyway—but to bring them to a room and let them sit and not talk to each other. Does that help.”

“It does if the room is under a bright bone,” Edda said. “Put it in the Ninth Hall and not the Fourth. The Fourth eats words. The Ninth keeps them in jars for later. Bring bread, and not too much salt. Salt is a kind of speech and you have enough of that.”

He nodded. He reached for his pen. His hand shook and he was so grateful to his body for telling the truth without shame that he rested the pen for a moment and put his palm to the paper until the tremor ceased. Then he wrote, in his own strong hand, letters that would be posted on walls and carried under jackets and stuffed into pockets, saying Come. We will speak of rope and river and fever and monkeys. There will be bread. He did not put his name at the bottom because he did not need to. The fact of it had his name in its spine.

Liora stayed at the gate until she could tell the vow’s hum from her own breath. She did not exhaust herself. She did not pour. She tapped and moved and tapped again and stopped while she felt the set take, the way a weaver will pat and push and then leave a cloth to remember how to lie. When at last she straightened her back, the fox had stopped being cross and had become sardonic, which is another kind of hope.

On her way back she stopped at Edda’s place because she had to. The cracked window glinted; the sign kept making the same joke without ever tiring of itself. Inside, the watches were not only watches; they were small temples to time in all its behavior. Edda glanced up and then returned to her tiny hammer and then put down the hammer as one puts down a truth that needs a companion. She waited.

“I moved it,” Liora said, because there was no point in not saying it. “I did not break it.”

“You never will,” Edda said dryly. “You do not have the right kind of hands. You can unmake a tide, perhaps, with a sigh, but a law, no. Not unless you take your head off and put it in a basin and wash your hair in something unnameable and I do not recommend it. Show me your palm.”

Liora did. Edda did not touch it. She looked in the way stone masons look at a wall to see if it has leaned. “You are carrying something with sharp edges,” she said. “You must have invented old to have made the Word fit there. If you are going to do what you are going to do, consider a thing. The clause about within the walls? It is not about stone. It is about witness. A drop that falls with no witness is not a drop as far as law is concerned. A thing done in a place nobody is can be as loud as a bell and still be silence to the ear you fear. That is a small door. It opens for nobody. If you find the outside dot your boy drew, you can stand there and make a thing happen in sight of God and monkeys and still be outside the part of the city that knows what to tell itself it is.”

Liora had to sit. The chair she chose wobbled on one leg, for which she loved it more than she expected. “If I make a drop there,” she said. “Does the weight fall.”

“The weight always falls,” Edda said. “But it might fall on the part of the vow that can bear it. You can exhaust a spring. You can make the rope fray in your hand instead of in your neck. You cannot have it all, Liora. This is not a story where the girl keeps every apple and the wolf becomes a friend and also nobody ever dies. But you can take off a corner. Sometimes that is all a city needs to learn to stand on one less leg. They are clever, cities. They are always looking for excuses to teach themselves how to survive.”

Liora closed her eyes. The bright bone above Edda’s doorway thrummed and then settled. She thought of the dot. She thought of the monkey’s chalk and of the way Tavi had erased the line connecting dot to circle because he had wanted to be precise and because his teacher had told him border is not tether. She thought: outside-of-witness. She thought: the wall where fog won’t settle is not where the city looks at itself; it is where it listens. The outside would be a dead patch, a place where a shout becomes weather. She could find it. She had been standing under it, half the mornings of her life here, handing the girl with a gourd hat back her pipe.

She stood. Edda watched her as a woman watches her own child pretend not to run toward the river. “If you fail,” Edda said, as if ordering thread, “do it tidily. I am old and do not want to sweep more than I must. Come back for a watch when you are finished. It will not tick; it will tell jokes at you. That is what you need more than minutes.”

“I need a small, clean death,” Liora said, and then put her hand to her mouth in shock at herself, because she had meant to be braver than that.

“All deaths are dirty,” Edda said, almost kind. “The ones that are not are lies we tell our remembering. Go.”

In the afternoon the sky thought about snow and then, being contrary, did not. People went about in coats with their chins high as if they could convince the air to land somewhere else. Calen went to the statue of himself in bronze at the corner and looked at the notes tucked into the seam where his boot met the pedestal and tried, as he always did and always failed to, to read all of them without letting his face tell anyone which cut and which did not. He found one that said simply, in a hand that held itself like a piece of string, Keep the north roads open. My mother walks them and my mother is a road. He put that one into his coat. It was theft of a sort. He would be a thief if it kept a woman warm.

The monkeys had been writing, someone said. Children had found chalk marks on the brick near the brine house, circles and dots and lines like mistakes. Someone had told them to stop defacing property. They had stopped, because obedience is not always a choice. One had waited until the man who had said stop went to piss in the alley and had looked him in the face and had drawn, carefully, a circle on the air with her finger. He had not told her to stop because sometimes it is right to be entirely ridiculous and sometimes it is holy.

Near dusk, Liora went with the sugar beads from Tavi’s neck in her pocket and his stone on its string around her wrist and a pinch of brine wrapped in paper the way women wrap jewelry they wear once a year to remember someone. She walked to the place where the bright bone weakened, not because the law wasn’t there but because another law had been there once, older, the sort that grows from a rock and not a book. The fog lay perfectly, a sheet. The monkeys had made their line along a neighboring wall as if to say we will watch even if we do not see. She lifted her hand. She put her foot on a crack between cobbles that had become, through nobody’s intention, a border.

“Tsum,” said a voice behind her, affronted and delighted, “followed you. I am an expert at following and at not falling off things because I am not dumb. Uncle says never follow people who walk like they are counting. You are not counting. You are doing a song.”

Liora did not curse because it was pointless. She took a breath and let it out as if telling the air how to behave. “You must not stand in the circle,” she said and watched Tsum’s body do the quick arithmetic of wanting very much to be in the circle and settling for being a hair outside and still satisfying the rule because it had been stated and rules are beautiful to children when they are freshly stated.

“What is that,” Tsum whispered, not in fear, just reverence, because the place felt like the inside of a bell. “If I jump will my bones go out of tune.”

“If you jump your uncle will be sad,” Liora said.

“He will say a lot of words that have the good parts taken out,” Tsum said, satisfied.

Liora did not tell her to go home. She understood witness enough to know that sometimes you need someone to look at you and then at the air and then back at you and have it be a human looking and not a law. She lifted her hand. She made herself very quiet without being still. She felt the dot. She put the brine on her tongue and made it a tear. She wiped that tear on her palm. She pinched. She dropped it by hand.

The city did not hear. The law did, but only the part of it that remembered being a poem and not a cudgel. The bright bones neither rang nor shook. The other listening, the kettle with patience, lifted its lid and then put it down very slowly. Across the river, the capuchin made a sound like a gate unhinging. Calen, in his room, lifted his head and did not bow and his ring cooled.

Liora did not fall apart or burst into light or die of relief. She tasted salt. She put her hands on the air and felt where the lace had shifted. The tug toward spring was not gone. It would not go. But the string she had been shown as a door found a different loop to push through. It might scrape. It might not close. It might not be enough. It was the only thing that did not ask for a boy’s blood, and that was an argument strong enough to hold for a day.

Tsum took two small steps in and one out and asked, very calmly because she could be calm when needed, “Am I going to die.”

“Not today,” Liora said. She had learned to put her lies in future tenses when she had to use any. “Not because of anything I am doing, which is what you are really asking.”

“Was any of that for the monkeys,” Tsum said, with jealousy that had no meanness in it at all. “Or was it for us and you and a man with a ring.”

“Some days,” Liora said, “we cannot pick one.” She knelt because kneeling brings the air down to where you can taste it. “You have good ears,” she told Tsum. “If the sound grows again—if it grows so big it makes your teeth ache—do not sit and make music at it. Take your pipe and go home and put it under the bed and tell your uncles that women said to shut all the lids. Then you sit with the lids and make sure they do not open. Can you do that.”

“Lids are my enemy,” Tsum said, bristling with exultant purpose. “I will sit on the lids. I will be a lid.”

“Good,” Liora said, honestly. “We will need lids. We will also need bread. And eyes. And a fox that has remembered how to laugh.”

She walked away before Tsum could make her say more. She walked toward Maren and the onion and the camphor and the braid on the nail and the boy who slept hard because living takes more from you when you are nine than it does when you are already used to the taking. She passed, without seeing, the girl’s uncle at the corner with a bundle of pipe lengths on his back and a look on his face like a man counting not money but sounds. She passed Calen’s letter pasted on a wall and didn’t stop because she could not promise to keep any future to itself and reading the word Come has ruined wiser people than her. She passed Sered, who had become an ordinary man for the space of a doorway in order to lean on it like anyone else with sore feet, and did not see him because you must not see the thing that might forgive you too soon.

In the kitchen, the sugar beads were three fewer. Tavi had counted wrong on purpose and looked at her to see if she would scold the error. She did not. He showed her his chalk and his circle and made her into the dot with a smudge of yellow on the back of her hand. Maren had eyes like knives left in snow to temper. She did not ask. Liora did not tell. When night set its cup over the city again, the monkeys raised their faces and listened, as they had been doing, as if a word were being spoken somewhere and none of them had learned it yet. Liora lay down on the floor because beds are too polite for some work and put her palms up because sometimes prayer is a tool, and thought, in a voice meant for ears that were not the city’s: I am trying a thinner wire. If you wanted a sling, you should not have made me love sugar or boys or a fox or the sound of a pipe in the mouth of a child. You should have put me in a wind and told me to push a mountain. You did not. That is on you.

The kettle held its breath. The ring slept. Edda set another watch on the counter and wound it without looking. Calen, at his desk, folded a note twice and twice again that had the words Keep the north roads open and put it near his heart as if paper could be armor. Tsum sat on a lid like a queen sits on a throne and dared it to twitch. The capuchin dreamt of a chalk circle and woke with its hand in the air, as if the right word were catching.

Morning would come. The spring would still be coming like a man from a long way off who has thought about how to walk the whole time and has finally learned nothing. Liora would go to the Ninth Hall because there would be bread. She would go to the dot once more, because now that she had found it, it would not leave her be. She would carry the Word until it cut her or decided it could be shaped by love into something it had not thought to be. The city would wait. It would count bells. It would make jokes because Edda was right, it needed them more than minutes. The air would have bones. The bones would be bright where the monkeys pointed. And somewhere, under the old text’s hum, a kettle would be moving toward boil, and everybody who knew anything about kitchens would be getting their hands ready to pull it aside at exactly the right moment so nothing spilled.By the time the notices had settled on the walls in their neat grid of paste and promise, the city had decided to act as if a meeting could be a kind of meal. Women threaded bread knives through their belts as if they were going to war and men polished their shoes with the remnant of a rag that had once been a child’s shirt. Tavi woke with chalk under his nails and a plan in his mouth. He told it to the first listening thing, which happened to be the pot with the lid wedged half-on. He would sit in the Ninth Hall like a lord and he would not fidget. He would only fidget with his toes and his toes did not count, because they were below the table of his body and thus their mischief didn’t spill. Maren nodded at him and pulled his shirt straight at the hem as if the line of cloth could teach him to be a line himself. Liora tied his stone to its twine again because knots made her feel competent and competence was a kind of courage.

The hall had been built when men thought arches would prove that numbers were godly. There were ribs along the ceiling that made everyone who stepped under them straighten as a courtesy. It sat where the street held the bright bone as if to lend it a spine when days like this asked too much of it. Calen had chosen it with care and with the help of a woman who had made a study of places where words sat down and did not slide. Edda had told him that chairs mattered. If you made people stand they would reach for their voices like weapons. If you gave them a place to arrange their knees they might remember that sitting confesses to a future.

Liora and Maren took a bench near the left pillar with the nick in it that looked like a boy’s grin. Tavi folded himself and unfolded and folded again, practicing his new doctrine of toe-fidgets. Tsum found them without being found and slid in like a second thought into the space between Liora and the aisle, her pipe tucked under her arm and her hat cocked forward so her eyes looked like conspiracies. She had a lid somewhere. You could tell by the way her walk had a new weight to it, a sovereignty that belonged to people who had found the thing they were meant to put their body on top of.

The bread they handed round was good bread, the sort you cut with a sound and make yourself believe is as fine as sugar because it has the right smell. Calen stood without platform and the mercury of the room rose to meet him. He did not speak at once. He made the mistake good men make: he counted faces and added infants and subtracting enemies. When he began, his words reached out as they had in the market but this time they took with them an apology for their own length. He spoke of rope that cracked in frost and rope that swelled with moisture and rope that seemed alive when it tugged in the hands of men who did not deserve surprise. He spoke of river and all its five moods and how winter gave it a sixth and how the Fifth Watch had been hauled along its banks by boys not tall enough to see over the coat they were meant to hold. He spoke of fever and how it liked to ride in the backs of throats that had been scoured by salt. He spoke of the monkeys and asked, humbly, if any among them had learned a better word than wrong.

“The bright,” Tsum muttered, affronted that she had not been asked her opinion and giving it anyway. “They’re looking at the bright bones. They are being not-stupid. I would like everyone to notice I said that in a hall.”

“If you say it louder,” Liora said softly, “the bones will show off. They are vain that way.”

“Good,” Tsum said, and then remembered to tuck her chin because there were forms and the parading of defiance should be rationed as sugar was rationed or else it lost its savor and its point.

Edda spoke when men who made rope and women who burned fever had finished their piece. She had a way of making her mouth hold the room without opening it. She spoke of the hum and of places to put a foot when hums make your bones misbehave. She spoke of salt as speech and of how to listen to law the way you listen to a mourner who is about to say the useful part between two repetitions of the same name. When she finished the benches creaked with people remembering how to hold their own weight. Calen thanked her with a look that had the right angle to it and then put his hand flat on the pillar where the fox had been taught to watch.

Liora felt the Word look up under her ribs as if someone had tapped the table with a spoon in the kitchen where it slept. She had brought brine again, wrapped in the twist of paper she had used for Tavi’s sugar the day before, because a body that could be at once foolish and careful was one that had a chance. She had small beads of salt in a fold of cloth in case she needed to draw along stone without being seen to draw. The outside-of-witness place had shifted with the morning; they do that, those dot places, the way boys do when you are trying to make them sit in one corner. But the hall itself made a pocket of not-quite-inside at the wicket where the door used to be before men decided doors should swing differently. Liora had mapped that with her tongue on her teeth before she sat.

The first wave came while a woman at the back was telling everyone how many people she could name who had been hungry in that room and how it made the benches into a church even if none of them believed in anything but clean soup. The sound went away for a single breath and the absence of it made every chest in the room remember that sound is also weight. People paused to see if they had gone deaf or if this was another kind of tide. Then the sound came back as if it had been doing laps.

Calen did not move his hand from the pillar. He did not look up. He said, very gently, the name of the hall as if hew was telling it to be itself. Edda put both hands on her knees as if bracing her own name against the room’s sill. Tsum quietly slid off the bench and took the lid from under her coat and put it on the nearest barrel, which had had the sense to be near. She sat on it and folded her heels up under her. Tavi found his pipe not in his pocket and Tsum clucked and handed him one and they did not put their mouths to it yet but they held it like a plan.

When the second wave came, it looked like a wave because it had shadows at its edges. It rolled along the ceiling ribs and made a line where the bright bone was, not visible, only the way a line is when you can tell a memory still holds a shape because the shape reminds it. The babies made a sound that could have become a cry and then did not because the mothers had all in the same instant put fingers to lips and showed their children by example that quiet could be a game instead of a punishment.

Liora rose and moved without trying to be invisible. She stepped into the wedge by the old hinge place and breathed on her pinch of brine and made of it something the old text would accept. The drop fell at the same time as the wave’s low reached the back row. The bright bone did not ring so much as recognize itself. Tsum made a small note with her pipe, a tuning sound you make when you care about what is going to be music and you want to announce to the room that music deserves attention. Tavi matched her with an earnestness that made the bolt on the side door correct its opinion of doors.

Across the river, the monkeys all lifted their left hands together and then, almost sheepishly, put them down. The capuchin brought her finger to her mouth and touched her teeth the way a woman counting years in a mirror does. The kettled thing pressed and then pulled back the way a man does when he sees a table where he thinks the chair is and a chair where he thinks the table is and does the math and chooses not to trip.

On the far bench, a boy stood to see better, because seeing is standing when you are eleven. He was not one of Calen’s wards, not the flour-lashed geographer, but a shorter thing with a neck built to be turned often because people told him his name from all different directions all day. He leaned to point at the place where the sound had thinned so prettily and his foot went wrong on the bench’s lip and he fell before anyone could be sensible. His fall was not high but his head had been built with no give and he was going to learn about bleeding in an unfriendly way. Men reached. Hands were not enough because hands are slow when a sound has already won.

Liora did not think. She stepped into the wedge again and pulled the edge of the place across itself like the corner of a blanket and the boy landed in that not-quite-inside, not-quite-outside mouth of space and his blood did what blood does when the air is not paying attention. It soaked into his own skin as if it had been embarrassed. His head would ache as if it had been used as a drum and he would learn to love slow stairs, but he would not break. Calen’s ring flared, apprised itself of the murders done within its jurisdiction, decided none applied, and cooled as if a cloud had sat on it for a brief nap. Edda blew all the air out of her cheeks quietly as if putting out a tiny candle without admitting it had been a candle.

“Sit,” the boy’s mother said to him with the voice of women who are going to count a thing as a warning and a miracle. “Do not be that tall for a week.”

Calen turned his head and his eyes found Liora the way a hawk finds a snake in a field by the way the field tries not to move. He did not point. He did not ask. He took his hand off the pillar for the first time and walked three steps only so he would be ordinary. When he spoke again, he did not climb on the back of the room’s awe. He went on about rope. He made a poor joke about monkey-proof sacks. He listed, briefly, the names of men who had died three winters ago in the ice season so that grief could remember its own recitations, because grief likes to be polished. When at last he came back to the roads he stopped telling and asked.

“I have written three forms of the spring decree,” he said, and there was no vanity in confessing to more than one attempt. “One closes the east roads entirely for six weeks and opens the north for four. One leaves the east open to those who carry bread or cloth but not brine. One calls the roads by a new word and asks them to sit down until the river remembers where it should be. I prefer the third for its arrogance. It is dishonest, of course. Roads cannot sit, but I like the picture. I am tempted to do it for the sake of seeing if a metaphor ever saved a boy. But I suspect the law will not accept pictures it did not draw itself.” He looked toward Edda, then toward the window, then toward where Liora had made the air thin. “If any of you know a way to keep our breath and not tell lies with it, I would like to borrow it.”

Edda laughed, which made everyone else dare to. “Use the older root,” she said. “Call it bearing. It means roads in the old tongue. It also means direction. It means what a woman has to do when she chooses not to break the chair by sitting as if she weighed more than she does. Tell the east roads they are to bear for six weeks. Tell the north they will keep their bearing for four. Promise bread to those who carry brine and salt to those who carry bread. Promise it aloud. Say, ‘We will weigh what we carry and apportion it and we will not spill.’ Say, ‘I keep my word with my hand open.’ It is not new law. It is old speech which the law envies and so will approximate. You will not lie. You will also not please everyone. You have made a life of that.”

Calen’s pen had already found his hand when she said “bearing,” because he had thought of it in the night and had refused it for being too pretty. Now he wrote it because he did not need it to be pretty; he needed it to anchor the other words. While he wrote, he said out loud what he wrote because saying is binding and also because men who are not poets must be taught to hear their own rhythm for once. The bright bone approved the choice with a very small tightening, like a band being tuned on a drum.

Liora felt the Word ease its hip against her heart. It was not content. It would not be. But it recognized the movement of a door and the hand that would rather knock than break it. It asked of her, with that same implacable tone that did not know itself to be cruel, if she was going to finish the work or leave the room before it caught her in the doorway and asked what was in her pockets. She set the brine down on her knee like jewelry and did not answer yet because she was busy trying to find the places where the decree’s sound would tend to catch. She saw two. One in the “we,” which could be made too elastic by clever men who wanted their god to be their guild and not the city. One in the “apportion,” which had a back stair it would gladly lead thieves to. She would have to stand in those words with her heels planted and a grain on each heel and teach them to grow new corners.

Tsum slid her hand into Liora’s coat and took out the sugar beads and bit one in half and then remembered she had to ration defiance and wiped the other half back on the string as if that made it whole. “Your man is using the right stupidness,” she said, not asking to be told anything she had not been told already. “The stupidness that says please to the right roofs. If the monkeys could write, they would write bearing. They would write it on the bright line and ask it to hold.”

“They can write,” Tavi said, defending them, loyalty shifting like quicksilver to whatever needed guarding. “They use one finger. They only do it in their heads because chalk makes their nails itch. The bald one knows all the letters because she has a ribbon already there.”

“I have a ribbon in my head,” Tsum said bitterly, and then made her bitterness into humor because that was one of her arts. “It is my enemy.”

Calen closed his mouth on the last word and the room told him he had done enough. People stood because bodies will always decide when thought has taken too much of the air. Rope men talked to river women in voices that would have made no sense two hours ago. Babies slept because they had spent their anger early and now had better work to do. The monkeys outside had crept down onto the sill to see if the smell of bread would still hurt. The capuchin’s hands had stopped doing the prayer they did when light was wrong. She put both palms on the stone and felt it tell her something like a joke.

Liora took Tavi’s head in her hand and pressed her lips to the place she had learned the nights before where his pulse kept his name. He yelped with mock outrage because he had stepped cleanly into the person who would pretend to be wounded by affection in order to require more of it. She told Maren that she would be a half-hour and Maren said that she was not the king and did not have to say anything to a person who would come and go as she pleased. Edda touched Liora’s sleeve and did not hold on and did not let go either and Liora grinned at her and walked.

Sered waited where the light made a scaffolding out of dust. He held his human shape just enough to be mistaken for a man you would not turn your back on in an alley because you would not turn your back on the alley either. His face, such as it was, had learned to be kind without meaning it. He dropped the kindness because kindness would make what he had to say taste worse and he did not want that to be on him.

“You will have to lose something,” he said, which is what angels say when they have been told to be honest and think honesty looks noble on them. “When you tip the last weight, you will have to pay in a coin that is yours and not the city’s.”

“I brought my purse,” Liora said, and then kept her face straight because lying to an old friend is fun but lying to one of her own made a noise in the air she disliked being the author of. “I found a place to tip where the ear that makes a list does not listen. I can drop from my hand and not make the promise you were counting on. Do not tell me that will not count. The law counted it and answered and I saw all of your heads lean toward mine with surprise, which, I admit, I liked.”

“You were always vain,” Sered said, not in rebuke. “That is why you make a good machine for our work. You like to polish the same part over and over until the world wishes you would stop and then give you a medal because you kept us alive.” He tilted his head toward the river where the bright bone wore a thinness now like a scarf. “It presses still. It will keep pressing. He will sign. The word will be good and it will not be enough because enough is a word that dies on the table between men and women who are trying to feed a child.”

“I know,” she said. She looked back over her shoulder at the door she had left open and pictured Tsum sitting on a lid in a hall where people were learning how to speak plainly and how not to fight with their hands when their tongues could bleed for them. “Do you think—” and then stopped, because asking an angel for comfort is like asking the wind to write to you. It will answer, but its script is not one your eyes have learned.

“Least got smaller,” Sered said, and it was the best benediction he could find. “Do not try to be a saint. You are not. I do not say that to wound you. Saints are knives and their work leaves everything sharp. We did not choose you for that because knives forget to love. You will hurt yourself in order to spare a boy. That is foolish and I will stand here and be proud of you while you do it.”

She did not tell him to go back to the place where words were born and ask it to make itself into something else for her sake. She put her palm against the wall at the bend where the alley made a different alley out of itself and felt for the dot which now was not on the ground but had attached itself to the jamb like a barnacle to a ship. She took her brine and her breath and what she had learned of bearing and stepped into the place where witness could not make a tally. The monkeys came down, some of them, behind her, and arranged themselves in a curve that matched the curve of her shoulder, their hands open and their faces lifted because this was how you watch when you decide that if a word does come, you will try to catch it and if you miss, you will make it anyway by repeating it until it becomes yours.

She had thought to be clever about the tears. You can wet your fingers a hundred ways and claim sincerity if your voice is sweet enough. She found that her body had no interest in feints. The drop came when she thought of Tavi not at nine but at eighteen and the way he would not let his mother pretend he was going to be a small thing forever, and the shape of Maren’s shoulder under a shawl like the shoulder of a hill you have walked all your life. The drop came when she thought of Calen and his back under the pack that was his honor, and how he still stood straight because bending would have made the pack heavier and not lighter. The drop came when she thought of Edda winding a watch that told jokes and not minutes because minutes can be lies and jokes know better.

She tipped her palm and the drop fell as if it had been waiting all its life to be a demonstration.

The law turned its head and decided not to watch. The city closed one ear and opened the other. The bright bone drew itself a fraction back into the brick, like a hand under cloth when you tell it the cold wind will behave if you give it no purchase. The kettled thing pushed as if it had been invited into a room and had found the chairs upside down on the tables and was trying to decide if that was hospitality or insult. It did not go away. It did not arrive. It stayed where it had been: in a patience that belonged to rocks and to older vows you only noticed when your foot didn’t meet ground where it thought it should.

Liora felt the Word look at the place where she had put a new corner in a clause and saw it form around her a shape that could be armor or cage, depending on whether she moved too quickly. She stood for a long time because the trick with new corners is not to lean on them. You must let them be themselves for a while or they will bend toward the closest old meaning just to be spoken to. She kept her hands open until she felt the skin of her palms cool again and when she closed them, she closed them gently as if you can hurt the air by clenching.

On the way back to the hall, the city gave her something like a prize. A monkey dropped from a sill and stole a crust of bread from a boy who had not been paying attention. It ran five steps and stopped and turned, and put half the crust on the stone where the boy could see it and made a motion with its mouth that looked like a word spelled badly. The boy laughed and forgot himself and laughed more, and in that moment the air bore him as if it had wanted to all day and had not had permission.

Inside, Calen had put his pen away and was doing the thing that undid him: he was listening to people individually. He listened to a man with hands like rope ends tell him a fretful thing about his daughter’s fever that had nothing to do with rope and he nodded as if rope were fever and fever rope because in a city you cannot be respectable if you do not mix metaphors. He listened to a woman with salt under her nails tell him a true thing about how men who carry decrees always think the paper will keep their hands from burning when they take a piece of another person’s day. He told her she was right in a tone that did not make the room punish him for it. He saw Liora at the edge of the door and did not look at her long because looking at anything with a name you had not said out loud is one of the fastest ways to lose your name.

Edda had produced cups from nobody knew where and was passing water around as if it were wine and as if they were all friends already old enough to be careless about that. Tsum had become a lid in three households by word of mouth and was receiving small coins in her hat with embarrassed magnificence. Tavi showed a man with a hat shaped like a gull’s back how to make the pipe say a note that would convince the latch to take a vacation and come back better rested. Maren said to Liora in a voice that spoke of a shared childhood and of anger saved against future weather, “You are not bleeding,” and Liora said, “I am not finished,” and Maren said, “We never are,” and they both let that be the conversation.

There was a moment, in the letting-out, where the hall’s door and the street’s light and Calen’s ring and the bright bone’s patience and Liora’s breath and Edda’s diagnosis and Tsum’s stubbornness and Tavi’s joy lined up and made a picture so tidy some god, if one had been available, would have said yes to it just for the warm of it. The city did not have a god. It had the place where a god would have stood if it had been given a hat and a job. It had the river. It had laws that had been written onto it as if it were skin, and skin that had been written on as if it were paper. It had women sweeping thresholds with brooms that had weathered more than the men who owned them. It had men folding notes and putting them by their hearts as if paper were a knife and could keep death away out of respect. It had monkeys practicing the first syllable of a word that could be a place or a command. It had a gate that remembered foxes.

That night, Liora did not sleep. She lay with her shoulder blades flat against the floor and her hands open and the Word turned itself over in her like a good stone does when it knows the river is not done with it. Sered watched from the place where night goes when it is tired of pretending it is not day in another part of the sky. He did not speak because there is a kind of quiet you cannot speak into without being rude. The kettle-not-yet hissed and eased and hissed again, learning, Liora hoped, the difference between a boil that kills and a simmer that flavors.

Near dawn, the capuchin stood on the parapet and drew a circle on the air with her finger the way Tavi had on the kitchen wall. She put a dot, deliberately, outside it. She added a line from the dot to the circle. She lifted her hand to erase the line and did not. She left it as if to say: sometimes the border is a tether and you must break your teacher’s rule because the river is quick. The men in coats who had bet on gates leaned together to say it had to be a trick. Children saw it and made a noise that made one old woman remember what her husband’s laugh had been when he was kind.

Liora rose and washed her face and tasted salt and did not pretend it came from the basin. She buttoned her coat and put her own ribbon on under her hair and fixed it with a pin that had a fox on its head. She took Tavi’s stone on its twine and put it around her own wrist because for an hour she had to be a boy with luck. She went to Edda to borrow a joke. Edda gave her two and a piece of red thread, because thread is the only thing cleverer than salt when it comes to law. She went to the Ninth Gate because it had kept its corner where she had set it, and she did not ask to see Calen because looking at his mouth with that left-side insistence would make her gentler than she could afford. She stood under the bright bone and she felt it lift a fraction in greeting like a landlord who has learned not to hate his tenants.

When she was ready, she went to the dot that had moved and was now on a step in the alley behind the brine house where no witnesses took their coffee. She took the brine she had saved and made of it the smallest drop. She held it until she was sure she could let it go without reaching as we do for crumbs when we have re-learned the price of sweetness. She thought of self-erasure and decided to forget that courage wears different dresses on different days and that some days the clever thing looks like a coward. She tipped the drop.

The city looked away again as if it had promised privacy to the wrong things once and had learned to be careful. The law shifted. The kettle put down its lid because curiosity is patient when it is also proud. Calen, in his room, woke and sat up and stayed sitting and did not reach for his ring because he did not need to be told what his own name felt like when the world had decided not to kill him yet. Edda wound a watch that did not tick and said first, “What do you call a hasty angel,” and then, “Pressured,” which was not good and made her laugh anyway because you laugh when you can. Tsum lay on a lid and slept because transport is work. Tavi dreamed that his chalk circle had made itself into a wheel and that he had put a dot on the wheel and that the wheel had rolled and that his aunt had stood on the wheel on the dot and had not fallen because she had looked at his mother and his mother had looked at her and they had each lent the other an inch of their backs.

When the sun came the city practiced being itself with a precision that would have put angels to shame. It threw bones into air and made them bright. It made boys make pipes say rude and pious things. It glued notes to walls and untied knots. It fed bread to those who had been listening for something that would not feed them and it took, for a moment, a crust from a child and turned it into the kind of joke that does not leave a scar. And under it all ran a set of words old enough to be kind and new enough to learn, and a woman who had been entrusted with the part that hurt most walked where witnesses did not count and did the kind of arithmetic you do when you have decided to love a thing without asking it to deserve it.By noon the notices about bearing had been scraped thin by fingertips and read to people who could not read and folded into pockets to be found later when men were looking for coins. Calen signed in the presence of nobody and then in the presence of everyone, because a signature on a wall makes a sound that lives longer than pen on paper. He put the ringed hand down flat as if steadying a plank and he said the words as he wrote them, his mouth careful, his breath steady as if each syllable were a bowl he could not afford to break. He said bearing twice, not for emphasis, but because it pleased him to say a word that held weight and direction at once, and some in the hall, hearing the second saying, rolled it under their tongues to decide if it should be theirs. A boy in the doorway, too young to have an apprenticeship and too old to be allowed to put his hands on every new thing, murmured the word once and then again, as if it were a song he meant to catch and whistle badly until it consented to live in his lungs.

The decree did not change the river. It arranged the room in which the river would be discussed. Men who would have banged their cups on tables and women who would have put their knives in their belts for show found themselves sitting on steps and talking soft. The brine house put lids on barrels and tied them with rope that had been cursed at properly. The cheap bakers who sold yesterday’s bread at a price that made insults turn to law cut their loaves into even pieces under the eyes of Tsum, who had taken to standing where cutting happened and counting the number of strokes with the wicked satisfaction of a queen. The monkeys climbed down to the height of heads and then up again, a tide of reluctance. Even the bright bones changed by a hair; if you stared long enough, and most people did not, you could see they had lifted, an almost-shiver in the air where the fog would not sit, as if they too had been told to bear and were willing, for an afternoon, to be an example.

Maren steadied a pot with her elbow and watched Liora the way you watch a man who has taken out a coin you know he means to give away. There was tenderness in the watching and annoyance too, because Maren had known since she was nine and Liora stood on a fence and told the wind it would have to bargain with her, that this was the sort of day Liora was always walking toward, one where a person could be lost by deciding correctly. She dished cabbage onto a plate and put a hunk of bread next to it and did not push it toward Liora because Liora always ate when you did not make her, and always forgot if you told her to. “Are you going to come home after,” she asked without looking at Liora’s face. “Will you bring a joke with you. Edda says you owe us one and I am short of jokes tonight.”

“I have two,” Liora said, because it was true and because saying it made a space in the room for laughter even if the laughter did not come. “One is about angels and it is terrible. One is about a watch that is always wrong and thus correct twice a day, which is not a joke when you are the watch or the day.”

“Bring me the terrible one,” Maren said, and to cover the soft edge under the word terrible, she added, “We should wash the walls before the frost makes itself at home. Tavi drew a circle and I do not think it will come off.”

Tavi had drawn three more dots on the wall, a triangle outside the circle as if, having learned that some borders are tethers, he wanted to learn how many tethers made a net and whether nets were for catching or for saving. He had pinched his cheeks red with cold and pride and had the look boys have when they are about to propose a plan you will not like and be right about it. He saw Liora’s coat already buttoned and his mouth rioted briefly through three expressions before settling on careful. “Are we going to hunt,” he asked, whispering because whispering makes any plan seem better. “I found a place where the sound forgets to be itself. I can sit in it and it will not find me and then I can jump out and do a noise and scare it.”

“We are not hunting,” Liora said, and then her mouth betrayed her and added, “We are combing,” because she had never been good at not rewarding someone who had noticed a thing. “You are to sit on your mother’s apron and do arithmetic on your toes and keep your stone in your hand and if the sound goes wrong, you are to hold your breath and count to seven and then take a slow breath and count to seven and then look at your mother’s face and not the door.”

Tavi made a heroic scowl, the kind that requires teeth. “I am good at arithmetic on toes,” he said. “I can multiply sevens. Uncle Roff says only the saints can do that. He says it makes them cry.”

“Saints cry because they are knives,” Liora said, stroking his hair as if smoothing a cat who wanted to fight. “You are a roof. Roofs do not cry. They creak, and people under them are grateful to have a sound to call home. If you hear the creak, it is because you are doing your work.”

He rolled the stone in his palm and checked the knot in its twine and nodded, because he liked the thought of being wood and nail and noise. He liked anything that made him useful and did not require him to stay small. He looked at her face and saw the part of it that made the monkeys watch. “When you come back,” he said, not asking because asking would make refusal sit in the room like a guest, “I will show you the triangle trick. It makes three dots feel like they are holding hands even though they are just dots. It is like the way we sit at the table and are one person until we get up and then we are three again. I think you will like it.”

“I will like it,” she said, and then he did the most dangerous thing children do: he believed her so thoroughly the belief entered her bones and had to be carried with everything else.

Edda tied the red thread around Liora’s wrist as if she were fastening a thought. “You should have taken this years ago,” she said, not unkindly, because the thread was a joke in one part of the city and a sacrament in another, and if you wore it you were declaring that you did not care which part people chose to see. “It holds better than gold, if what you are holding is your mind. It is not proof against angels, but angels are carving knives. Things slip when they touch us. There is nothing to be done about that.”

“You say us,” Liora said, because it was easier to tease than to stand still under Edda’s hands. “Have you been an angel all this time, selling watches in a dungy street.”

“I have been a woman longer than you have been a thought,” Edda said, with a smile that made Calen straighten in his office without knowing why. “That is the same thing some years. Take the thread. Tie your name to it and then do not speak your name. If you must bind something with a word, use one nobody knows belongs to you. Bind it with a song.”

Liora wanted to ask what song and then remembered she had known the song since the night she had slept on the floor and the boards had hummed under her shoulder blades. It was a kitchen sound, a knotting of vowels around breath, the song women sing when their hands are in dough and their heads are elsewhere and the work is the bridge between the places. She tucked the thread into the cuff of her coat and held it with the same fingers that had let drop the brine. “What do I owe you,” she asked, because owing makes the mind clear, and Edda said, “Two jokes and a watch that refuses to tell the truth,” and Liora promised without promising, and they both were satisfied because promises between women are sometimes the only laws worth writing.

Tsum met her at the corner where the fog forgot itself and the bright bone had grown shy. The girl’s hat had been mended with a patch of blue that made it look like a map of a place that wanted to pretend it had sea. She had the pipe under her arm and a lid in her hand and her mouth set as if the world had dared her to be ordinary and she had declined. “I found three new bounces,” she said at once, not wasting time with hello because hello is for days when sound behaves. “One is no use because it gets in a brick and stays there like a drunk uncle. One goes along the ground and makes your ankles itch. One goes up to the bright and back. I marked them with chalk and no one has scrubbed them yet because men are busy being poetic.”

“You are building me a net,” Liora said, measuring the girl not with praise but with truth, because truth fed Tsum in a way bread only borrowed. “We will need the up and back. We will need the ankles, too. People forget they have them.”

“I do not forget anything between head and toes,” Tsum said primly, and then spoilt it with a grin. “I also told the brine man I would bite him if he flicked his glove at me again. He had a friend with him and I did not want him being showy at me. He said I should be careful, men will not like me if I bite. I said that is a relief, because I have lids to sit on and no time for liking.”

Liora handed her a bead of sugar because audacity requires feeding and sugar buys quiet from bodies that carry too many sparks. “If I call,” she said, slow, because the man at the end of an alley listening to nothing could have been a shadow or a cousin of Sered or a rope seller, “you will put the lid where the divergence makes a mouth. You will sit. You will tell anyone with a coat and a knife that you are not moving for kings or cats. If the bright hurts, you will close one eye and then the other and you will hum the note that makes the pipe forget its name. If you see me do a foolish thing to save a clever one, you will forgive me later and bite me if I do it again.”

Tsum looked past Liora’s shoulder to the place where the capuchin sat as if carved and nodded gravely because being entrusted with duty is a drug in a city like this. “I will be a lid,” she said. “I will be a ridiculous lid. I will be the kind of lid that makes a pot blush. I will be the best lid you have ever seen, and this in a town full of lids.”

Sered found her at the bright bone, because of course he did, because if you stand where listening has been fixed to the air with old words, anything that calls itself watchful can find you. He carried himself without wings, a man whose coat had learned to make a different sound when he moved because it had gotten wet and then dried too many times. There was compassion in the way he did not stand close enough to make her want to lean, and impatience in the way he breathed as if time were something he had laid out on a bench and could see the end of. “You are late,” he said again, because angels repeat themselves when speech is new to them. “The door we did not want has remembered it is a door. It is tasting the latch. Your combing has made it curious. You have hours if you call a whole hour sixty minutes and a minute sixty seconds. If you call them as the city calls them, in breads and coughs and men falling, you do not have much.”

“I do not think in seconds,” Liora said, because being human had ruined her for clocks in the ordinary way. “I think in knuckles and bowls and the time it takes for tea to stop being too hot to drink when a child can see it sitting and knows it is not for him yet. Tell the Word that if it wants a machine it should have fallen into iron. It fell into me and I have ears and a sister and an idiot love of lids.”

Sered tilted his head in acknowledgment, which for him was a bow. He glanced at the fox on the lintel, mild and sardonic, and at the red thread at Liora’s wrist hiding under corduroy like a river under leaves. “What coin will you pay,” he asked, not from cruelty now but from the need to know whether he should take off his shoes. “We are not allowed to help you count. We can only hold the bowl and tell you if it tips.”

“My name,” she said, before she could caress the thought and hide it from herself. “Not the one I wear here. The one you won’t say even to wake a drowned. If I stitch it into the law, it will pull weight through me and not through a boy. It will mean I live and do not belong to you. It will mean I belong to a wall and a fox and to salt and to a man who cannot stop making his mouth say yes to things that turn his bones to baskets.”

Sered closed his eyes, which meant he was looking at a distance humans could not see even when they were dying. When he opened them his face was bruised with honesty. “You will not be able to hear us,” he said. “We will be speaking and you will think the wind is rude. You will remember you had a home the way a woman remembers she nearly drowned and was saved by someone who does not wish to be thanked. You will become superstition in a city that feeds on them. Do not do this and then ask to come back.”

“I will not ask,” she said. “I have learned a different impoliteness. You will see me sometimes in a window when you are not trying to and you will remember bread and will leave me alone. That is the coin I can pay. I will not give them Tavi, and I will not give you a clean story. You may tell it however you like when I am not there to contradict you.”

He looked at her a long time, which for him meant a breath. “It is unpleasant,” he said, because angels cannot make blessings soft. “And marvellous. If you were mine, I would be proud. You were never mine, which is why we sent you.” He put his hand out as if to touch her shoulder and then put it back in his coat because touching would burn. “Sing,” he told her. “Tie the knot on the last line. Do not tie it on a name. Tie it on a breath.”

She stepped under the brightest seam in the air and set her feet the way rope men set them when hauling a cart out of a rut. She took the red thread in her teeth and tasted the dye and the hands that had turned it and the river where it had been washed when the woman who made it needed to cool her temper. She made a loop in the air because the law can be stitched if you can find the weave and the loop is the easiest shape to ask to be obedient. She hummed, not the angelic constant that shakes rocks into admiration, but the kitchen song that women hum when their hands are in dough and they cannot keep anything but their breath even and so they make it count things for them.

The bright bones above her bent. They did not like to. They were old and proud. The fox on the lintel was less cross and more interested, which in foxes is as good as a promise. The capuchin made a sound like someone remembering the middle of a word and the middle telling them the end was near if only they would not be fussy about it. The kettle-not-yet pressed and then, insulted by the hum as a woman is insulted by a door that sticks in a house she keeps clean, pressed harder.

Calen, two streets away with his hand on a piece of rope as he spoke to a man about moving barrels without spilling, flinched as the ring bit him and then warmed as if regret itself could be comforting if it meant there would be fewer names to put in a book. He tasted elderberry and iron and the inventory of a brine house and he smiled without lifting the corners of his mouth because the city had done what he had asked and what he had not dared to ask. He put his palm on the barrel’s rim and understood in that small moment why the old vows had liked hands best. They are the most honest part of us when used like this.

Edda leaned in her doorway and counted silently, because if you did not number a thing, it could trick you into thinking it did not need numbers and then scale would eat you whole. She saw Liora under the bright bone and she saw the thread glow against skin that refused to be ordinary and she saw the monkey’s hands opening like flowers that had thought they were rocks. She allowed herself one curse, delicately chosen, because even saints are given one when they are not being knives.

Tsum slapped the lid down where the mouth of sound would open if it were going to be rude, and then sat on it with her weight and her arrogance and her pipe tucked into the crook of her elbow like a promise. She felt the surge in her thighs and made herself broader, the way cats do on furniture they have annexed. She began to hum into her sleeve so that only the cloth heard, because you can teach cloth to carry tune if you love it properly, and she loved her sleeve in the way people love anything that has kept them from having to be naked in public.

Liora put the loop through itself and pulled and felt it catch on the edge of a word she would not say, not even inside where angels do not have to pretend they do not listen. She took a breath when every muscle in her back said do not breathe or the knot will slide, and she sang on the exhale into the space where witness is rude and law is shy. She could feel the place where her name would go, the small hook in the air that had been carved by her own choices over days and bread and lies. She did not hang her name there. She hung the breath she had just used and tied, fast and neat and not vicious, the way you tie a baby’s blanket to the edge of a cart so the baby will sleep even over bad cobbles.

The bright bone made a noise like a laugh swallowed quickly in a room where laughter would be taken for disloyalty. The kettle hit the space where the lid should have been and found a lid. It did not understand lids, which are inventions that do not translate. It drew itself together and tried again and found, with astonishment peculiar to old things that think themselves rude-proof, that the place it had believed to be invitation had become a courtyard with no doors. It pressed long enough to make Tsum’s eyes water and then drew back with all the dignity of a general told that the gate he has brought his army to opens inwards when he had counted on it to open out.

Liora’s ears tore with quiet and then sealed. She had known it would not be blood, not if the law could be coaxed to read tears as cousins and salt as kin. She did not know it would be sound, because she had never been good at thinking about herself as a cost. The thread at her wrist burned a little and went cool. The humming of kitchens went away like a street you are sure is still there when you turn the corner and is gone because men have knocked the houses down and have not yet put up anything to call them to account. She stood, gasped because her body insisted on not learning grace quickly, and put her hand out to the fox to steady herself as if the fox had grown fur under stone and thought it courteous to let her pretend.

The city breathed in the relieved way of things that have discovered they will not be on fire immediately. The monkeys shook themselves like wet paper and moved, all at once, three hands-widths, which is not a run but is the first time in weeks they had consented to be bodies instead of ears. Tavi, in the kitchen, sat up very straight and said to his mother, in a tone of optimism that could have been a punishment in other rooms, that his toes had done the multiplication without him and that made him a roof and a saint. Maren put her head down on her folded arms and cried, not because she had heard something but because the part of her that greets storms had been let off duty for an hour and did not know what to do with its hands.

Calen did the most difficult thing, which was nothing. He did not send men to the Ninth Gate. He did not call Edda back to tell him again what she had already arranged with her hands and her eyes and the city’s habit of making itself useful when someone who is not a fool asks. He stood, feeling his ring be only a ring for a moment, and then he picked up his pen and finished making bearing into a promise because documents are rude when left half-done.

Sered, having watched her tie her breath into a law, turned away and did not go up or down, because there are directions angels are not permitted when a person has just torn a listening from their body. He leaned his head back against air until it threw back at him the feeling of being held and then let himself be annoyed, because annoyance was what he had available. He did not feel loss; he did not crave sadness; he did not have that luxury. He felt admiration the way thieves feel locked doors.

Liora found that the world was still in its proper places and that she simply could not bring anything to her ears to make the distances resolve. It was like being underwater with her eyes open and not being able to make the pressure a friend. She touched the thread again. The knot was neat. She had not broken anything she had not meant to, and this counted as triumph in a town where the sum of intendings and doings had so often been negative. She turned her head and found Tsum by looking, not by listening, and Tsum’s face told her the girl had learned a new craft, which was the moving of your mouth and not making sound a weapon.

“You did a thing even I could not have thought of,” Tsum said without insult. “I will bite you if you look like you regret it, because I cannot guard your ears as well as lids. If you need hearing, you can have mine a while. I can be your pipe. I am tired of being just a lid.”

“I will need you,” Liora said, and the words came to her mouth in a different shape than they would have yesterday. They came slow and round, as if they had to pass through her hands on the way. “I will need your pipe and your irreverence and your sting. I will need you to tell me when the air is rude again. I will need you to keep boys from drawing circles in the wrong places and to keep men from using bearing as if it were a stick and not a coat. Can you do that.”

“I can,” Tsum said, and then, flustered at the size of the things, did a thing only children can do without knocking the world out of joint. She took Liora’s hand and bit the heel of it hard, the way puppies bite for love and communication and scent, and then put her mouth against the bite like an apology. “Now you feel me even if you do not hear. It is science. It is stupid. It will work.”

They walked to Edda’s together, a path made visually rather than aurally, as if mapping had been put back in its proper place as a craft. Edda raised her eyebrows at the sight of the thread and then at the particular stillness of Liora’s head and then at Tsum’s expression of having gotten away with three things and not being sorry. She handed Liora a watch that ticked loudly and then smiled as Liora did not startle. “Good,” she said, and then, more serious, “You will have to learn who you are without being able to count men by their boots. It will make you kinder. It will make you make mistakes. Come here when you are tired. The chairs are wrong and the tea is stronger than anyone with sense likes.”

“What is the angel joke,” Liora asked, remembering debt and finding herself stubborn about paying it even now. “I promised one would be terrible.”

Edda folded her hands on the counter and pretended to consider, because this made the poor thing more handsome. “What do you call an angel who forgets how to listen,” she asked, and then did not wait for the answer because she did not want to be unkind. “Human,” she said. “And then, later, door.” She grimaced at herself and poured tea as if it were atonement. “I told you it was terrible. Drink. It will put salt back in you. That has to be replaced, in all of us, always.”

Calen, finishing the last stroke and sanding the wet ink with patience as if patience itself were a sport he understood, went to the window and saw the capuchin draw a circle on nothing and leave the line between dot and border in defiance of every teacher that had ever hoped to see a point behaving. He put his forehead against the cold glass and could almost hear the noise the glass made when his breath kissed it, and then he remembered he was not a boy and straightened and called for his secretary without raising his voice and said the word bearing three more times until he believed he had earned it as a sound.

Maren felt the shift with the same sense she had for the weather refusing to keep its promises to the laundry. She went to the wall and put her palm flat where Tavi had drawn and left warm handprints because warmth is also law if you do it often enough. She did not call this a miracle because she knew better than to hand miracles out to things she could have done with patience and raw knuckles. She called it luck and she called it a woman’s work and she called it Liora’s idiocy in the vocabulary of families and then she took her braid down and redid it with precision and resolve. She had three friends to tell to shut their windows at night and two girls to teach to wash their hands between chores and an ill-tempered cat to evict from the basket where the bread was trying to become not-stale. When people asked her later how the city saved itself she would tell them it learned proper housekeeping, and if they laughed she would let them and then make them wash a dish.

When evening came it found the Ninth Gate waiting and not pretending not to be waiting. The fox’s mouth had an extra line in it now that was not a smile and not not-a-smile, the way a scar on a face can make the person look more like themselves than they did before. Liora stood under the bright bone without needing to test it and felt, in the quiet that had become her noisy, the way time made itself heavier at this hour and then lighter as if the city were a hand scooping and smoothing flour. The kettle-not-yet did not push, which was worse and better, because patience in a thing like that meant a day had been bought with blood that did not seem like blood until you touched your ears and found them full of cotton.

She began to map her new edges in the way anyone maps a changed room. She walked the length of the street and counted with her heel, not her head. She touched brick and catalogued the way each one had a history of being persuaded, stroked, humiliated, washed, burned, cooled, ignored. She listened with her eyes and found that they had been waiting to be called ears all along, the treacherous beautiful fools. She tied the red thread to the pipe that ran along the alley and hummed the kitchen song into her throat bone and felt the loop hold, and this, in a day of costs, felt like a small repayment she did not deserve.

On the parapet the monkeys gossiped without changing their poses, which is a skill most people never learn because they insist on waggling their eyebrows and their hands. The capuchin made the chalk motion again and then, looking directly at Liora, tapped the place where a human ear would be, then her own bald ring of skin, then her mouth. Liora did not know what the capuchin meant. It could mean she was sorry; it could mean thank you; it could mean she understood now what the word for here was and that her mouth had been doing it wrong all this time.

It was almost dark when Tavi reeled into the alley with a scarf like an insult and his stone thumping his wrist and his mouth ready with a plan. He saw the thread and his eyes rounded and he reached out and did not touch, because he had learned at last the discipline of leaving certain things for the morning. “I put dots under the table,” he said, whispering as a habit and a joke, because whispering was for other people now. “Only where it is safe. I made one outside the circle and left the line on, because the monkey did. I think the line is a promise. I think it is a good lie.”

“It is,” Liora said, feeling her own smile adjust to this new tuning. “It is the best kind of lie. It is a rope you put on a word so it does not wander into traffic. If you ever make it into a law, warn me so I can move my chair.”

He looked around them as if hearing had moved from being a set of holes to a skill. He was clever enough to be proud of his aunt and sideways enough to be frightened at the right things. “You don’t hear me now,” he said, solemn but not sad. “You see me. That is almost better. You always saw me.”

“I will always see you,” she said, because this was a promise she could keep and it did not ask for a god to stand behind it holding a tray. “Go home, roof. They need your creak.”

He went with a skip because dignity is traditionally borrowed and spends easily, and because boys who have learned the word bearing and been allowed to use it walk differently in their houses. He turned once to make sure she was still there and then did not look again because he trusted her not to go while he was looking away, which is the other kind of love besides the kind that bites.

When the lamplighters came and turned the city from gray to a softer color that pretends to be kind but is really just another sort of acquaintance, Liora stood under the fox and knew she would have to teach herself to sleep in a new silence. She would have to teach herself to hear the river with her hands and the law with her toes and the angels with nothing at all. She would have to teach the city how to be an organ it had not known it was missing, and she would have to do it without asking it to love her, which is rude and reasonable. She would fail and it would forgive her and then it would ask for more because that is what cities do to the ones who choose them over the music of their own names.Morning arrived with its pockets turned out, as if the night had taken all the loose change and left only lint and a single button. Liora woke before the kettle could do its performance and lay still to let the new kind of quiet settle into the corners. It was not emptiness; it had taste, like water with iron in it. Without the law’s hum, without the old cords of vow and decree singing at the edges of her hearing, the world looked larger. It did not shout; it held still and displayed itself with the patience of a shopkeeper who knows you will come back if you need what she has. The boards beneath her shoulder blades were a sensible kind of orchestra. She could tell by the way the grain changed direction where a boy had dragged a chair with nails that had not learned to behave. She could tell by the way dust lay that Tavi had danced two steps and then remembered to be solemn because his mother had been watching. It was a map without legend, and she had always been the sort of creature who liked to draw the legend herself after she had walked the terrain twice.

At the window the fog had learned the day’s manners and was doing a respectable job of staying out of trouble. The monkeys on the parapet were awake in their fashion; they had made a compromise with sleep lately, taking it in small debts and paying it back in scraps. The bald-crowned capuchin tucked her chin and checked the bright bones with a surgeon’s courtesy. When she looked down she saw Liora and touched the air where an ear would be with the delicacy of a friend who refuses pity. Liora touched her temple and her mouth, a triangle of acknowledgment they could both be proud of. When she went down the stairs she felt the red thread tap against her wrist under her cuff and thought, because she couldn’t help herself, that Edda had been right to call it better than gold. Gold knows what it is. Thread learns.

Calen had not slept much. He had the look men get who have been carrying a table alone, not because there was no one to help but because the table had needed to be where it was and asking would have taken more time than lifting. He wrote and rewrote bearing until the quill knew the curve of it and could have signed in his absence if asked. When he stopped to rub the place between his brows where law sits when it is trying to be polite, he found himself staring at a map of the city he had drawn as a boy. It had been made with charcoal on brown paper and had rivers where there ought to be streets and streets where there ought to be gossip. The Ninth Gate had a fox next to it, drawn in three lines without any grace at all. He had written near the brine house, in a hand that did not yet know how to be ashamed of itself: Do not run here. It is slippery. He left the map where it was instead of rolling it away, because some days men are allowed to be sentimental about the versions of themselves that did not know other kinds of weight yet.

The men with long coats came earlier than anyone expected to the brine house corner, because malice is a morning creature when it thinks it has been clever. They had manners like string: used when needed, snarled when not. They were the sort of men whose voices have false bottoms built in so that if you stand on them you fall a little and cannot decide whether to laugh or be angry. One of them carried a coil of copper that had not come from any shop Liora knew. It had been braided with something darker than pitch. They set it against the brick where fog refused to lie and where bright bone sometimes loosened its shoulders. They hummed under their breath to see if the metal would quiver and smiled when it did, because there are people who smile at the wrong things and make it a habit. “The gate will be a throat,” one said, not able to keep the admiration out of his voice for the craft, at least. “You put a hand here, and the city swallows itself.”

“Not swallows,” said the tallest, whose hat had learned to be patient in rain. “Chokes. Swallowing is an art and this place has only manners left. We are lending it efficiency.” He looked up at the parapet and marked the monkeys and made a note on his cuff as if counting would keep them civilized. “Which of his kin is nearest,” he added without turning.

“The flour boy is with his aunt’s sister, and he doesn’t count to anyone but himself,” said the third, who had a voice that always sounded as if he had been eating pepper and regretted nothing. “The tall one with the scar at his nose is at the Ninth Hall counting ropes for the Prefect because that man cannot do anything without putting his hand on it. The smallest is in school learning to hold chalk like a pen. You stab a quill into a boy’s fingers early, he’ll never set his hand to stone.” He grinned because he liked the taste of his own wit. “We do this the copper way. Safer for profits.”

“Safer for you until somebody decides to break your kind of law,” the tall one said mildly, and the man with pepper in his throat laughed like a door.

Tsum did not like them. Not because of what they carried or the way their coats fell wrong, but because their mouths made a sound even when they were not speaking, a small cicada buzz of attention aimed always outward, ready to catch anything that tried to cross a street without paying a toll. She had been thinking of her lids and of the pipe’s new trick when she turned the corner and saw them. She took one step back because not every fight starts with teeth, and then another forward because some of them do. “You can’t put that there,” she said, cheerful and outraged in the way only a girl with good uncles and a city behind her can be. “That is where we keep our quiet. Go hang it somewhere dumb where nobody knows the difference.”

They looked at her and had to decide whether to dismiss or to be afraid. Men like that do not like to have to decide beside barrels. The pepper-throat smiled because smiling is a way of being cruel without having to be clever. “We bought this corner,” he said. “Two brine-lids. A length of rope. A watch that tells the right time for once. We have paper if you are impressed by ink.”

“I am impressed by lids,” Tsum said, honest as a cat. “But we do not sell corners. They are attached to the city and the city bites.” She stepped nearer and put her hand on the copper coil as if blessing. She felt it hum under her palm. It was not the same hum as the bright bone. It reminded her of a man who keeps tapping the table with one finger to make the room match his rhythm. She removed her hand and grinned toothily. “That’s rude,” she told the coil. “You don’t even live here.”

“Fetch your aunt,” pepper-throat said. “If she is the sort of woman I think she is, she will tell you to be sweet and let men do their work. Or else she will be interesting, and I admire interesting. I am a progressive.”

“I will fetch somebody,” Tsum said. “He will be shorter than you and more useful.” She said it with a heart that had slid neatly into its hinged place because she had, without being told, understood that this was one of the moments when a city tests itself by a child’s ability to carry a message without being underestimated. She went at a walk because running is a bell, and she needed a pipe.

Liora learned of the copper not by sound but by echo. The alley at the back of Edda’s shop had a small place where chalk tastes different on brick. She held a stick of ugly yellow between her fingers and drew a line where the air had been listening the day before. The line did not sit; it folded itself as if lazy. When she stepped out of the shadow the fold stayed, a crease in the day. Someone had laid a net over the bright bones and asked them to call by different names. She had to put her hands on the wall to keep from swaying with the elegant wrongness of it. She would have liked to admire the craft without owing it anything. She owed it attention. She took breath the way you drink when someone else has paid.

Edda did not need telling. When Liora opened the door the watchmaker was already wrapping three things in cloth and tucking them into a basket that had carried bread and coins and once a rabbit with a broken leg. She had a tuning fork, a piece of red thread like Liora’s with a knot tied by a hand that did not forgive itself easily, and a small jar of lye the color of bad ideas. “They will have anchored it where the brick lies to law without pride,” she said, brisk as snow. “Here and here and there where the fox looks by accident. They will have used copper because copper is easy and listens to any fool. They will have told themselves they are not malicious. Bring your girl. Bring the boy. Do not bring the angel; I am not in the mood for chaperones.”

“Sered will come if the kettle presses,” Liora said, because honesty between old women saves time.

“Sered will hover like a thought and be good for nothing but regret,” Edda said. “We will do better by hand. I would like you to put your hand on the lintel and do the breathing again. It will not change what you hear, which is to say it will change nothing. But it will please me.”

Liora pleased her. She touched the fox and felt in the stone the place where some‑someone had once put their knuckles too hard and chipped the edge. The city’s law did not answer. It regarded her politely from a distance, the way cats regard well‑fed children. The bright bone did not lower. It complicated itself, which is a sort of courtesy. “They are making a throat,” she said, remembering Tsum’s choice of words around the lids. “They want to catch the decree in it and make it say another thing.” She looked toward the brine house and saw, not the men, not the copper, but the manner of the corner. It had been teaching itself boldness. “If they succeed, he signs and the word sits wrong and the kettle thinks it has been invited,” she added, and the fox made an amused face at the notion of kettles with manners.

Calen did not have the luxury of learning about the copper slowly. Tsum went past his shoulder like a gust and made his guard put a hand up and then down again without quite knowing why the hand had risen. She put the pipe on his desk as if it were a summons and then, better sense catching up, put it on a chair because tables are for paper and chairs are for plans. “They are hanging wrong music on your bones,” she said, panting a little because the Ninth Hall stairs had been built by men who liked to make people earn their breath. “Two lids at the brine house. Three copper snakes. One man with pepper in his throat. One tall one who thinks he is polite. They say they bought the corner and I told them we are not a butcher shop.”

He looked at her and decided in one fast gust that this was the sort of messenger who should be turned into a drum and carried everywhere just in case the world decided to be dramatic. “Who told them they could?” he asked, to buy the second he needed to pick up his coat without the ring sliding. “No,” he added before she could answer, “do not tell me; I know already. Men who think they are clever. Men who like language not for its truth but for how it makes other men feel stupid. Come,” he said, and made the mistake of going himself because there are days when you must and they were always his trouble.

They went together, Edda and Liora and Tsum by one alley and Calen and two guards by another, because a city is richest when it makes convergences without sending invitations. The men with long coats had done a neat job. The copper lattice lay against the bricks like a spider that had learned trigonometry and decided to be a mason. It cupped the place where fog refused to lie and asked it to vacate. It would have made an admirable instrument if you wanted to play the law like a string and make it name a different god. Liora’s palm itched. Edda touched the net and hissed, then smiled like a person who has been properly introduced to a rival. “Bad work,” she said with relish. “Elegant. Moronic.” She took the jar of lye and dabbed the smallest drop at a joint. The copper did not like having its polish scolded and creaked. The tall man lifted a hand as if he could talk to women from that distance with it. “Friend,” he began, and Edda almost laughed herself off her feet.

“You are no friend,” she said with terrible courtesy. “My friends bring bread and insults and go home with fewer hats than they came with. You have brought an instrument you do not know how to play. You are going to make yourselves deaf.”

“We have bought this corner,” pepper-throat said, irritated finally because his smile had not done its proper work. “There is paper.”

“There is name,” Edda said, and tapped the brick. “This place is called ‘listen here’ and you are putting a sign that says ‘shout’ over it. We have not invited you to rename our house. That is a habit we do not admire even when it comes from men with crowns.”

Calen leaned his shoulder into the wall opposite, the way you lean into a thing that is trying to be petty. He kept his hands where everyone could see them because he knew Tsum was in the corner of his eye and he wished to protect her by being watched. He looked at the copper, at the way its coils wound into an almost-nice logic, and he took the measure of the men. He recognized one from the long coat meetings near the rope yard. He recognized another from a dinner where someone had used too much salt and then lied about it. “You cannot bind that here,” he said in a tone he would have used at a harvest table telling a boy to pass the bread without tipping the stew. “If you bind it here, you make the hall a throat, and the river is too ready to eat already. Take it down. Come inside and we will find an edge where your cleverness does not cut the city’s lip.”

“We don’t negotiate with men who think language belongs to them,” pepper-throat said, and the tall one looked unhappy because he had hoped to negotiate and go home and tell a story about how he made friends with wolves. “We will make the decree sing a different note. It will be a pretty song. Your ring will not burn your finger if it hears a better key.”

The ring warmed as if to disagree that keys were better than notes. Calen felt the sting and did not move his mouth. “You are not listening,” he said, and that, from a man who knew he failed at listening when his hands were hungry, was rare and so had weight. “This city hears itself now. It will not let you borrow its ears for your chorus.”

They could have stood there all morning trading dullness. Tsum made sure they didn’t. She slid the lid from under her coat and slapped it onto the nearest barrel and sat. The sound of lid on wood changed the alley’s shape. Lids are gates. They close and open. They do it without the pretense of hinges. The bright bone above took notice. It is a vain thing; it likes applause. It tilted, a hair, to see why a child had decided to be a roof, and in that tilt the copper lost its bite. Liora stepped into the wedge between bone and net and raised her hand. She did not hum. She made her breath into a line and drew it along the nearest joint the way a mother draws a finger along a measuring cup to make sure the flour doesn’t go proud. The lye bubbled like bad jokes and the copper bent, not much, just enough to forget its purpose for one ridiculous, holy moment.

Pepper-throat moved like a man who had realized a joke had been told and not to him. He snatched for the joint and shouted a word Liora could not hear and would not have liked. The monkeys on the parapet flinched and picked at the air with their fingers as if the syllable had been fleas. The tall one reached toward Tsum’s hat and Tsum bared her teeth in a way that made him reconsider calling himself progressive to her face. “Don’t gnaw your fingers off,” she advised sweetly. “You’ll need them to count the times you were wrong.”

For a second everything became balances. The copper asked the bright bone to be an accomplice. The bright bone preened and pretended to be persuaded because flattery deserves that much. The lid drew its circle around the barrel and named it safe. Edda struck the tuning fork and the alley learned a juster pitch. Calen put his palm flat on the brick as if saying here in a language he had been taught by sheep. Liora pulled the knot she had tied the day before tight by the slightest breath and felt it catch. The net slipped with a sound that did not travel to ears and made a flash in the brick any child could see. It was enough to make the coil sulk. And the moment a machine sulks, it is no longer useful to men who like to believe themselves indispensable.

The tallest man gestured once and the pepper-throat kicked the bottom of the copper, a lover’s last insult. They took an end each and tried to lever; Edda put her hand on the joint and told it, quietly, to be stubborn. The joint obeyed, because a well‑made thing will listen to anyone who loves craft more than victory. When the men tried again, guards stepped in without theater, because theater could have torn the lace. The copper’s loop came away like a tooth that had wanted to stay but had been given arguments it could not forget. In the scuffle someone’s hand nicked against brick. A drop fell. Liora felt the law glance over its shoulder and then look pointedly back at its book. Witness was rude; the dot had moved an inch; the drop fell between grammar and pride; the ring cooled as if a thought had gone by with its shoes off.

They would not keep all of them. Cities are bad at catching every rat that runs the wrong way. Pepper-throat wriggled with the splendid dishonesty of a man who has learned to move without moving. He went under a bucket and out a door and up and vanished into a hat. The tall one stayed not because he was brave but because he believed in conversation to a fault. He stood looking at Calen with his lips doing a thing they did when he did not trust himself to be elegant. “If the city starves,” he said conversationally, “do you eat your ring.”

“If the city starves,” Calen said, “I eat with it. If it eats, I eat after. This is the contract. You should have made a different one if you wanted to be comfortable.” He nodded toward the copper. “Pay Edda for the mess. Pay the brine man for his patience. Pay the girl for her lid because she is the reason you still have your nose, and noses are expensive in this quarter. Then go home and decide whether your cleverness brings you happiness or merely the habit of being difficult.”

The man took his hat off because he had been taught to. He put coins on the barrel. He put too many for Tsum and she counted them slow because counting is a way to politely rob someone of dignity when dignity has been behaving badly. He tucked his coil into an insulting neatness and left. The alley let out the breath it had been saving since dawn.

Edda touched the brick again and grimaced at the stickiness of lye. “We will see this again,” she said, and not in despair. “Men who discover they can bend sound will keep bending it until it snaps back and takes an ear. We will need lids perched along the bones. We will need to teach women with soup to hum. We will need boys who can make a mouth on a pipe and not blow indiscriminately.” She looked at Tsum. “You are prematurely old,” she said, admiring as if that were a pearl. “Do not waste that on men who think paper makes corners. Waste it on girls who think lids are unimportant. They are not. Most salvation, in my experience, looks like housekeeping.”

Tsum glowed as if someone had called her a species she had hoped to be and had not wanted to admit. She wrapped the coins in a scarf inside her hat as if they might choose to be honorable if they slept with her hair. She was still sitting when the ring tugged at Calen and he caught himself on the wall with the grace of a man who had decided he would lie about falling. Liora put her hand out and did not quite touch his sleeve because she had given enough pieces of herself to law for the morning and did not dare kindness that might ask for a piece she could not name. He nodded as if she had, and that was enough to keep him from spending his breath on humor that would have cracked when it should have rung.

It was later that the more delicate malice arrived, the kind that does not wear a coat. That afternoon a boy with flour on his eyelashes went out to piss in an alley he should not have chosen because boys choose alleys by the sound of their names and his name had been called there too often lately by accident. He leaned his hand on a brick and someone touched his shoulder with the sympathy men reserve for animals and children and asked him to hold a packet for a minute while they tied a shoe. He took the packet because he had been taught to be courteous and because politeness is a trap too kind to refuse. The packet had brine in it, glued up with something so sweet the air around it trembled. The boy’s hand warmed it. The man tipped it so that a drop fell and not in a place Liora had pulled. It was deft. It would have been enough to make the ring wake if the boy had been what he was counted as by men with coats rather than what he was counted as by men with vows. But wards are knotted to household in five different ways and the man had used only one. When the drop fell the law looked at its foot and decided to be pedantic. It counted blood as household and water as cousin and sweetness as a lie. It set the weight dancing for a heartbeat and then put it back down where weight prefers to be: in rooms with chairs and weather.

The man ran because he was not a fool; the boy put his hand against his chest because the sweetness had gone into the skin and made him ache as if he had been laughed at. Liora found him leaning as if listening, and she did listen with her eyes and the new ears her hands had become. She saw that one thread tied from ring to boy had been tugged until it frayed. She could follow the tug like any tailor. She could put her fingers in and make the knot hold. She did, not with words because words were busy being law; not with hum because hum was for lids; but with the way her palm lay flat on his rail of a shoulder and refused to believe it belonged to anyone but him. He sobbed once, not because of sadness but because something in him had been made to defer to a shape outside him and he did not like it. “I don’t care about his ring,” he said, and then, because he was honest and nine parts foolish and one part impossible, “I do,” and she laughed because she could not help it and because laughter when you cannot hear it is like feeling a cat purr in a closet.

When the day’s edge came and the decree had been said in three halls and a dozen kitchens and at one gate where a fox paid attention, the city began to do what it is worst at and best: obey and disobey simultaneously. Men at the east road, told to bear, set their hands like saints on ladders. Women at the north road, told to keep their bearing, stood with their backs to the wind and their faces toward each other and invented a new joke about ropes that did not make Edda smile but made everyone else laugh. Shopkeepers who had been taught to count as if counting would save them began to count differently, tallying lids and pipes and girls by name. The bright bones stayed in their skins. The monkeys came down and took the bread that had been offered by hands that had not been pretended into being generous.

Liora, tired and steadied and a little wild around the edges with the loss of the way she had been listening since she had been made, walked with Maren to the corner where the notices had been pasted straight. Maren read aloud because habit made her say the words with her voice even when she was not telling them to a child. Men paused to hear because a woman reading makes a sound that tells you whether you can afford to lie in a room. Tavi interrupted with toe arithmetic, proud of his roof noises. He held his stone in his palm as if testing it for loyalty. When Liora looked at him he did the dangerous thing again and believed her into the shape that would carry him through the next bad afternoon. She took that belief and tucked it into the thread at her wrist and told it to give her patience when she decided to be a knife.

Sered watched from where men become shadow if they stand too still. He did not say again that she was late. He did not say least. He had learned, which for him counted as transformation. “You are bound now,” he said without sound because he could not help the itch of the words. “Not to me. Not to the Word. To a place and a fox and a girl who thinks lids are crowns.”

“I always was,” Liora said inside the quiet that had become home. “I did not know the name of it. I know now. It is bearing.” She tested the word and felt it lift her chest the way good grammar does. “Spring will come,” she said, because it always does, “and we will ask it to be reasonable. If it isn’t we will sit on it and hum.”

“You will sit,” Sered said, almost laughing for once. “I will hover and take the memo. The kettle will sulk and look for a kitchen with fewer women. The men with coats will buy longer copper. The boy will draw better triangles. The ring will gnaw his finger and he will let it because he likes the taste of consequence. Edda will make a watch that tells time by jokes and no one will buy it and everyone will come to listen to it after hours because laughter is cheaper than bread and does as much good. You will forget the sound of me. It will be all right.”

“Do not be generous,” Liora said, and he was silent, which was generous and neither of them would admit it.

That night, when the last lid-hum had found its way into sleep and the bones of the air had put down their vanity and rested, Liora went to the Ninth Gate to see how the fox wore the new line at its mouth. The fox had the expression of a creature who has been found handsome at last by someone he respects. She set her palm against the stone and waited for the quiet to arrange itself around her. She closed her eyes because she could, because closing them no longer made the world smaller. She tasted salt. She tasted copper. She tasted the sweetness boys put in their mouths when they want to pretend they can afford to share and then discover they prefer to be loved more than to be rich. She whispered, not to law and not to gods and not to angels, but to the floor where flour had fallen and been swept and fallen again. “Hold,” she said. “Not forever. That is a rude word. Hold until morning. Hold until bread. Hold until Tsum is taller. Hold until Edda’s joke is better. Hold until I figure out how to map without ears.” The fox took no offense. The gate did what gates do when asked politely by someone who has learned their name. It held. The bones shone. Across the river the capuchin, who had not forgiven herself for months for not being the right kind of creature to receive the call, slept with her hand open, as if in her dream she had been holding a rope and had decided to be generous.
