They called him Stud because it made the lads at the bar laugh, and because he worked mornings at Milton Meadows where the horses breathed fog into the cold air and hammered the mud with their glossy hooves. The nickname stuck once a hen party from Wolverton wandered into the pub on a Thursday and the bride-to-be dared him to tango amid a tangle of stools and a jukebox with a stuck volume dial. He obliged with an exaggerated rose clenched in his teeth—the rose was a napkin, the teeth were imperfect—and he dipped the bride until her veil touched the floor. Someone clapped. Someone wolf-whistled. Tariq, who cut hair and liked to narrate whatever Nate Ellison did, shouted, “Stud’s in the building, ladies,” and that was that. Not Nate, not Nathan, but Stud, a word meant to tease that sounded like a badge if he squinted at it.

Morning light was thin, chalked across a sky that still had bruises of night when Nate, boots clumped and stiff with dried clay, crossed the yard to the tack room. The smell met him first—oil, leather, old straw, and that ammonia tang the winter cold couldn’t cut. He liked it. The smell meant work, meant rhythm, meant something to wrangle. He set the muck fork against the wall and paused to listen. Horses shift differently from one another, he'd learned. You could tell which one was stamping in the far stall by the impatience in the thump. Dynamo, big bay with a neck like a proud crane? He stamped in measured, angry thuds. Lovey, the skewbald mare, trilled her lips when she was annoyed and pawed delicate at the straw as if trying to tidy it into an apology.

“Hold your horses,” he told them, because he knew they rolled their eyes when humans used that one. He felt the day gather and lean on him. He leaned back. Habit.

In the second stall from the tack room door, Dynamo tossed his head when Nate appeared, the whites of his eyes thin and bright. “Easy,” Nate murmured, slow in his hands and quick in his thoughts. He’d seen the way Dynamo took to new things—ears pinpricked, muscles coiled. The first week the horse had come in, a kid had carried a rainbow umbrella across the yard, and Dynamo had lifted on two legs like the sky had punched him.

“Angry man,” Tariq liked to joke, slinging an arm over Nate’s shoulders when he stopped by after the morning shift. “You get one word wrong with him, he’ll write a letter to the editor.” Dynamo didn’t need words to file complaints. He had hooves. He had weight.

Nate mucked, fed, watered. He let the rhythm take him. He counted two measures for scoop, one for toss, one for rake, the pattern that had entered him years ago in a gymnasium with a too-shiny floor. He didn’t talk about that part much. In Milton, you were a fighter or a footballer or someone always just about to be okay. A man who danced made people recalibrate their jokes. So Nate danced in the early, when horses took his beat as a friendly thing, and he danced past closing in the slow stretch of his kitchen when the kettle cooled and his tea thought about skinning over.

He kept it mostly to himself. Not entirely because of the jokes. There was also the way the music reached under his ribs and flicked the switch in him that said move, and he felt private about that, the climate under the ribs. If it were a landscape on a map, it would be labelled Here be dragons in red, and a little sea serpent would be writhing there, everything muscular and glossy.

That morning he finished just before eight. He checked on Lovey—who sneezed into his shoulder and left a wet smudge—and he let his fingers rest beneath the velvet bone of Dynamo's jaw, where the pulse galloped even when the horse stood statue-still. “It ain’t all bad,” he told him. “Some things don’t want to eat you.”

Outside, the frost had decided to be decorative and laced the fence-rails with a look of expensive cake. The pond had a thin white skin. Nate’s breath went out and came back as a ghost that didn’t know where else to haunt. He adjusted his scarf, a present from his sister Lyla that was far too bright for the sober fields—acid green, would prompt cows to file formal complaints—and walked toward the lane.

His phone buzzed in his pocket with a feeling like a bee trapped under a glass. He fished it out with his thick gloves between his teeth because he’d learned that leaving messages unread made his chest fill with moths. On the screen, a notification sunrise: Congratulations Nate! You’ve been shortlisted for the finalists’ showcase of Dance/Drive: City Edition.

He stopped walking. He didn’t even feel the cold, for five heartbeats. Then the cold came back with interest, a tax on surprise. He read it again and again, the words refusing to believe they’d been sent to someone like him. Dance/Drive had started out niche, late-night on very early cable. An all-styles competition without the glitter or sob stories, the kind that takes place in repurposed car parks and above abandoned hardware shops. It had gotten bigger, then bigger still, until it finally landed on a streaming platform with a logo everyone knew. And now this season the City Edition was coming to Milton Keynes, a chance at the massive stage in the Centre:MK with lighting rigs like alien skeletons and seats like the curved teeth of a smile.

“Stud?” Tariq’s voice drifted from the barber shop doorway across the lane. Tariq was sweeping hair into a tactical mountain he’d later conquer with a dustpan. He wore his apron and his look for customers, which was glossy and leaned back. “What’s that face?”

“Spam,” Nate lied, then failed at it immediately. He crossed the road, boots loud. “Nah. It’s—Tariq. They’re going to put me in the finals showcase. The finals, mate.”

The broom froze. “Don’t wind me up, I’m too delicate in the mornings.”

“Come here, I’ll show you.” He held the phone out. He needed somebody else’s eyes to confirm the words, in case his had been faulty all these years. Tariq read. He tried to give the phone back and missed Nate’s palm twice. “Boy,” he said finally, a brand of joy that sounded like a warning. “Boy. Boy.”

Nate laughed. It came out of him like he’d swallowed something fizzy and was now a bottle with a bad idea. “You’re going to overboy yourself and fall over,” he said.

Tariq put the broom against the wall like it tired him to look at it. “I’m going to tell two people. That’s all. Just two.” He lifted his hand. “No, three. Four. Five would be vulgar.”

“Don’t tell anyone yet,” Nate said, with a reflex that came from years of not wanting to wave at possible joy in case it turned around and vanished into a lane of fog. “They might change their minds. Get my name wrong. Mix me up with someone else. They’ll be like, we meant to say ‘Matey Ellie-something who can’t dance,’ apologies for the confusion.”

“They spelt your name right,” Tariq said. “You’re famous now, Stud. I’m going to charge you more for a fade.”

Nate grinned to show he didn’t mind the razzing, and to hide how his hands had started shaking. He tucked the phone into his pocket, like a rabbit he hoped would not wriggle free.

When he got home, his mother was at the table with a pen cap behind her teeth and the Morning Citizen spread in front of her. Janine Ellison was small and endless, the kind of person who had a voice that knew how to reach its own echoes and bring them back. “You’re late,” she said, without looking up. “Make tea.”

He brushed her hair, out of habit more than necessity. “I smell like a damp accident,” he warned her. “Tea will be contaminated.”

“Tea is one of nature’s disinfectants,” she said. “So is a biscuit. I read this somewhere and I refuse to check if it’s true.”

“You read it in your heartbeat.”

“In my what?”

“It’s nothing.” He put the kettle on and stared at the old streaks of lime down its side like the rings of a tree. He had promised himself he’d tell her after tea, when the handle of the mug was warm against his palm and the kitchen had earned its easier mood.

“Lyla’s at school?” he asked.

“Unless they changed the date while we weren’t looking.” Janine circled something in the paper with such precision you’d think it was an exam answer that would earn a scholarship. “What is Park View Gardens? Is that the one with the murder hedges? Who murdered whom?”

“The hedges murdered the gardener,” Nate said, obeying the ritual. He waited. He felt the words a little queue inside him. She looked up, no pen cap now, her gaze steady.

“What has happened,” she said in the tone she reserved for when she knew something had happened. “Good or bad?”

He poured the tea a little too quickly. “I… I got an email. Dance/Drive. You know, that dance thing. They watched my clip. They want me for the finals showcase. The one at Centre.”

There was a short silence that felt like the house inhaled. Janine’s chair scraped. She stood and her face did a thing that only a few faces can do, the thing where you’re trying to appear measured because you are the mother, and your child is watching, so you must be the horizon. It lasted a second. Then she was laughing and her hand was over her mouth and there were tears in her eyes that she had chosen to classify as morning allergies. “Oh, my boy,” she said. “My love. Look at you.”

He looked at himself; he was muddy and he’d nicked his knuckle on Dynamo’s stall latch and there was straw in his hair like confetti from a cheap wedding. “I need a wash,” he said, because sometimes you say trivial things when the room swims. Your mouth needs somewhere to put the air.

“You need a crown,” Janine said. “You’ve needed a crown for a long time.” Her eyes went somewhere he couldn’t follow, the past where his father stood with his hand on the door and the car idling and a suitcase in the back that weighed more than any suitcase should. She reached towards him, then put her hand back down, then reached again. She never was sure with him. He wasn’t sure either. “When is it?”

“They say three weeks. Rehearsals next week. They pair us up with partners this afternoon at registration. It all moves fast, I think. Like a blender.”

“Will you be all right? Your knees.”

“My knees love me very much,” he said, because he didn’t tell her about the nights when ice packs became his small gods. He drank his tea too quickly. He wished the kitchen window were a television and it could show him the future, even just the opening credits.

He washed and changed. The stained mirror above the sink did its best; it had a generous soul. He looked like what he was: twenty-four, tall, not as handsome as the nickname suggested but not far off either, with a face that had a habit of being open even when he consciously drew shutters down. He had shoulders that had carried hay bales and his mother’s grief in equal measures, and arms that remembered choreography the way some arms remember bruises. He put on the clean jeans, the better jacket with the elbow patches, the trainers that made him quick. He examined the scarf and decided it could retire for the day.

On the bus into the centre, he sat by the window and let Milton roll out as if someone were unscrolling it from a high shelf. The big shopping centre hummed in the distance, the mirrored glass like a promise that a person could be more than three streets and a habit. The bus passed the indoor ski slopes, the boxy offices with their sensible blinds, the little parks with benches named after people whose families missed them publicly. He felt the machine of the city under him, not just cars but something slower and more complicated: ambition out for a walk. He got off at the stop where everyone got off or on, near the artificial lake that had ideas above its station.

The registration hall had been a conference room and would be again. For now it was all black fabric and cables disguised as snakes, a low stage, propped lights, a table with a line. Nate took a breath and got in line. The room smelled of coffee and hairspray and nerves. A poster with a logo told him he belonged here if he could read. He read it slowly. Belonging is a word that moves its own furniture.

“Name?” the girl at the table asked him when it was his turn. She had cheeks that made dimples when she concentrated, a pencil behind her ear like a cartoonist.

“Nate Ellison,” he said. His voice tried to be casual and overshot. “I sent the clip. It was the warehouse one with the… with the yellow ladder.”

“Ah, ladder guy,” she said, consulting a list. “We gave you bonus points for not falling off and suing us. Okay, Nate. Your partner assignment is in here.” She slid an envelope across the table. He wanted to tell her that her hands were steady in a generous way, but he didn’t. “Rehearsal schedule’s in the envelope too. Tech will make you sign seventeen forms about electrocution.”

“Electrocution and being electrocuted,” Nate said. “Different brands.”

“Huh.” She smiled the dimples again. “There’s a vending machine outside with the good crisps. Everyone will tell you it's broken. It's not. It just needs to be slapped with the left hand.”

When he stepped away, the envelope in his hand weighed more than it could. He put his thumb under the flap and hesitated. He wanted to remember this second—the one where something unknown was still perfectly shaped by its mystery. He told himself to move. He tore. He spilled paper.

He read the name. Maya Choudhury. He said it under his breath to taste it. He recognized it. He had seen her on screens, the local hip-hop phenom with a way of making gravity jealous. She danced like electricity learned to be a person. He’d seen a clip months ago of her in a car park near the hospital, stomping and slicing through music that sounded like an alarm softened in velvet. Seventeen years old then, maybe eighteen now. He felt both relief and the tickle of intimidation.

“She’s good,” someone said over his shoulder, a voice like shoelaces being tied. He turned. The speaker was a woman maybe fifty, hair pulled back in a stern bun that didn’t believe in whimsy, eyes that had measured many stages and found them wanting. “Maya.”

“Yeah,” he said. He didn’t know why he felt compelled to explain himself. “I don’t usually do—well—I do some styles, and I’m fine with hip-hop, not fine like fine fines, but.” He ran out of words and stood in the bright jungle of his own hands.

“I’m Anya,” the woman said. Not a smile. Not a frown. Something like the pause in between. “I teach Maya sometimes. I also tell her off. Are you the boy from the warehouse?”

“Ladder guy,” he said. “I’ve been told.”

“You looked better with the ladder,” she said, not unkindly. “You will have to keep up. She can be a little storm.”

“I’m good in weather,” he said. She tipped her head, considering him as if he were a piece of furniture someone had dragged in and she wasn’t yet sure where it should go.

“Maya is late,” Anya said. “She has school. Or she is pretending to have school. Both can be true. If she makes a joke about detention, you must laugh.”

“Is it funny?”

“No.” She waited. “That was a joke.” She turned as someone called her name.

Nate found a chair along the wall and sat. Dancers stretched in the middle of the floor, bodies performing math. A boy in a silver hoodie leapt, touched his toes midair, landed. A woman in a red dress that defied the usual rules of physics did a slow hip isolation that could move tides. The air in the room had bits of anxiety in it, like glitter you never quite clean up. He found himself scanning for her. He had only seen her through pixels, the way a child in a small town watches the news and wonders how cities are lit. When she arrived, he knew before anyone said. Her hair was in two long plaits down her back, her backpack was one of those with patches and pride. She had a pen behind her ear, like the girl at the table, but hers had leaked a little, in a way that looked like a signature.

“Nate,” she said, crossing to him as if the room were a field she owned. “I watched your clip. You did that thing with the chair.”

“The chair was tired,” he said. “I helped it sit down.” It came out easier than he’d expected. Her grin was quick, a slanted line that looked like handwriting. “Maya?”

“Maya,” she agreed, and stuck out her hand. “Sorry I’m late. I got hijacked by physics. It wanted to fight today.”

“Did you win?”

“Partial victory. The teacher says I don’t show my working. Which is true of many parts of my life.” She dropped her bag and the pen followed, skittering under a row of folding chairs like a mouse. “Anya is watching, as usual. She’ll pretend she’s not. She’ll tell me to stretch my feet and my mind. She’s right. It’s annoying.”

They bent over the form together, sleeves nearly touching, shoulders learning each other’s slope. The form asked them to list injuries, allergies, fears. Maya wrote hay on a line and looked up at him. “Are you hay?”

“I am at least twenty percent hay at any given time,” he said. “You’re allergic?”

“Not properly. Just enough that I sneeze when I pretend to be a horse. It’s useful socially.” She squinted at him. “Are you the Stud?”

He waited a second too long. “I’m—some people call me that.”

“Okay, Stud,” she said, her grin again. “Sorry. I like calling people things they’re not entirely sure they want to be called. It’s a hobby.”

“Some people like tennis,” he said. “You like identity crisis.”

“Exactly.” She pushed her hair back. “Look, I can do the fast stuff. That’s my thing. You can do the—what did you call it in your clip? The roll?”

“The Cuban roll,” he said. “And the fan. And that thing where your feet don’t tell you they’re moving but then they are, and it’s too late to ask to be slowed down.”

“We’re going to be good,” she said with a conviction that made the air change shape. He believed her before he allowed himself to agree. “We’ll mix. Make new soup.”

“You shouldn’t mix all soups,” he said. “Tomato and vegetable is fine. Minestrone and lemon chicken is a warcrime.”

“Arrest me.” She bounced on her toes, a small bright chime of joy in motion. “Show me your basic.”

He stood. He didn’t warm up properly because nerves are warm by themselves. He took a breath that went down where it needed to. He took the first weight on the ball of his foot, the way he’d been taught in that old gymnasium by a woman with a sharp eye like a needle and a hand that could correct your posture and your soul. He moved against the idea of a drum. He felt the room settle its watchful eyes on him and then he stopped noticing. Music didn’t have to be audible. He carried it, a private radio.

When he looked up, Maya was watching him with her head tipped and her mouth small and thoughtful. “Okay,” she said quietly. “Okay, you can stay.”

“I was going to anyway,” he said, and she laughed. Across the room, Anya pretended to frown at something else. The boy in the silver hoodie clapped lightly. Nate’s hands stopped shaking. It happened slowly, like weather changing.

They rehearsed for an hour. They learned the way they would argue—Maya quick, a stack of ideas and arms; Nate methodical, stubborn, a tendency to repeat until he felt the idea settle into the bones. She teased him and he let her. He corrected her weight transfer and she let him. When they had a rough eight counts that didn’t offend either of them, they looked at it like it was a child they’d made in a science experiment.

“That bit,” Maya said, pointing to where her shoulder sat under his hand like a bird under a roof. “Do we want it to be romantic? Or—what’s the opposite of romantic? Practical?”

“Hydraulic,” he offered. “We’ll make it hydraulic. People like romance until it leaks.”

“You’re weird,” she said with approval. “I like it.” She fished in her backpack and brought up a bottle of water with stickers on it—No bad vibes—but all the bad vibes were, in fact, invited. “How old are you?”

“Twenty-four.”

“Grandad,” she said, and avoided his wrist when he went to flick at her plait. “Kidding. Only a bit. You’re tall. That’s good. People think tall is better until tall falls over. Then everyone laughs, and you can’t be angry because you deserve it.”

“You’ve fallen?”

:She looked away, quick. “Once, at a battle. Not a big one. My foot did a thing and then my face did a thing and then my pride did a thing. It was educational.”

“Education is overrated,” he said.

“Don’t say that. I have an exam tomorrow. If you jinx me I will choreograph my revenge.” Her phone buzzed. She glanced. “My mother will want pictures of you to cross-reference with her danger database.”

“Am I dangerous?”

She considered him. “Your elbows are a menace. Other than that, we’ll see.”

They spilled out of the rehearsal hall at the end of the hour into a corridor that had been decorated by someone with a tight budget and a fondness for maroon. People were talking in that special way people talk when they’ve survived something small together—louder than necessary, words bumping into each other and apologizing. “Tea?” Nate asked, because afterwards you drink something. He’d learned to build rituals out of whatever he could hold.

“I have to be at school,” Maya said, which he suspected was the truth, but she held his gaze and added, “But that sounds like an invitation. Raincheck.”

“Raincheck,” he said, a word that made less sense the more he thought it. He watched her go until she turned at the end of the corridor and did a little ridiculous bow he wasn’t supposed to see.

When he got outside, the afternoon had arranged itself into a thin and bright shape. He breathed and the breath had new width. He texted Tariq: Partner is Maya. He added a fire emoji because he had recently learned to use emojis for punctuation, something Lyla had mocked him for with a kindness that still stung. Tariq texted back sixteen faces with hearts for eyes and one eggplant that was probably an accident and then of course, not an accident at all.

On the bus home, he took the long way, the one that skirted the leisure plaza and then cut past the old Fishermead houses with their straight lines and persistent laundry. He got off two stops early because the sky was doing something and he wanted to be under it. He cut down by the allotments where the old men grew things bigger than science suggests, passed the fence with the painted dragons his sister had helped do with the youth club, and reached the meadow where the path narrows and the river does its own choosing. He could have been religious sometimes. Not about God, necessarily, but about the river, and the way the horses stood on the far side with their heads low and their ribs moving, and the way winter sunlight makes a promise it keeps in a small way.

He found Jessa by the gate, bundled in a coat that went down to her shins like a second, tougher skin. She was a friend from childhood, the kind that could tell him to stop without making him stop liking her. She smoked, always, as if she owed herself that small fire. She worked nights at the printing depot and had the schedule of a bat. “You’re radiant,” she said when she saw him, smoke curling like punctuation. “Why is that? Did you fight a man and win?”

“I—” he started, and didn’t have to finish. Jessa squinted, then exhaled hard enough to put out a candle.

“Oh, you got it,” she said, affection and exasperation and something else. She did not say boy. She did not hug him, because that wasn’t who she was, but she tilted her head in a way that made him feel pushed into the light anyhow. “About time, Stud. Everybody knows you were going to. Even me. Which is difficult, because I barely know anything before half three.”

“It’s not… it’s just a showcase,” he said, because the part in him that was prepared for disappointment carried a sponge. “Not like I’m on the telly. Not yet.”

“A small thing,” she said. “A big small thing. Does your mum know?”

“She knows. She told me I need a crown.”

“She’s not wrong.” Jessa flicked ash and watched it tumble. “You took your time, didn’t you? Dancing. Like you had to ask permission from the weather.”

“I think I took my time because I was busy with other things,” he said, and it was true, but not all of it. “Also, there’s Dynamo, who might decide one day that I deserve to be a ghost.”

“You and that ruddy horse,” she said. “One day he’s going to end up on the news and you’ll be on the news by proximity. Move away from proximity, Stud. It’s contagious.” She stamped her boot, then tapped her cigarette out and tucked the stub neatly into a little silver case. She was always organized in the ways people didn’t expect. “I’m coming to watch,” she said.

“You’ll hate it,” he said. “Too many people. Too much—everything.”

“I can hate things and still attend them,” she said. “It’s one of my few talents.”

He wanted to tell her about Maya’s shoulder under his hand, the precise math of it. He wanted to tell her about how the room had watched and then the room had gone away. Instead he said, “You remember when we were in Year Nine and we did that thing at the community centre? The one where we had to pretend to be trees?”

“I was the best tree,” she said, bristling. "I swayed. I threw shade.”

“You were an award-winning tree,” he said. “I knew, then. I didn’t know what to do with it. But I knew.”

She looked at him the way she did when the cigarette case was out and she had no props. “You’ve always known,” she said. “You’ve been pretending you didn’t know because pretending is easier to do when you’re tired.” She touched two fingers to the air between them, not his hand but the idea of his hand. “Go on then. Be the thing.”

At home, Lyla burst through the door with her hood up and her cheeks reddened by the kind of cold that makes every laugh sound like glass. She threw her schoolbag at the sofa and missed. “You’re famous,” she announced, because anything that happened to one of them happened to both. “Ellison, you are trending, I’m telling you. I posted your warehouse clip under a hashtag and two people I don’t even know liked it.”

“Imagine,” he said. “Two.”

“We are building brand,” she said, dead serious. “We are building empire. We’ll start with Milton. We can probably conquer Wolverton by Tuesday and after that—Buckingham? Maybe not. They are stubborn. We can bribe them with… with something from Greggs.”

He picked up her bag and put it on the sofa and she grabbed it in one motion and sat on it as if it were a living thing that might run. “Maya,” she said, with the relish of someone who enjoys proper nouns. “She’s sick.”

“Don’t call people sick,” Janine said from the kitchen. “Not in my house.”

“Sick like good, Mum. Keep up. She’s eight thousand followers good. She did that thing on top of the car that one time? Remember?”

“Whose car?” Janine asked, as if it mattered for legal reasons.

“Anya’s,” Lyla said. “Nobody died. She’s famous. You’re going to dance with a famous person. Which will make you famous by osmosis, which is like chemistry but better hair.” She bounced on the sofa bag-chair-throne. “Are you nervous?”

“I’m fine,” he said. He looked at his mother, at the tea that had become the day’s idol, and he admitted, “Yes. I am. I feel like my heart took up jogging without me.”

“Save your jogging for the dance,” Janine said. “No running in the house. It gets the rain in.” She set plates down with the care she reserved for food, the thing that had to be made into enough. “What time do you have to be where tomorrow?”

“Nine at the stage,” Nate said. “Ten with Maya. An hour with the choreographer after that. Then a break. Then camera blocking, which sounds—violent.”

“It’s not violent,” Lyla said. “It’s sexy. Everybody says it. It’s, like, sexy camera time. The camera is learning how to love you.”

“Good,” Janine said. “Somebody should.” She said it offhand, like a joke to keep the air appropriate for children. He felt the weight of it anyway, a plate placed gently and felt anyway. “Sleep,” she added, pointing at him with a spoon like a general. “Don’t pace. You get the rug tired.”

He tried to sleep early. He lay on his back and watched the slow machine of his ceiling fan turn his room into a calm geography. He had never been much for prayer, but he made a list of things he wanted and asked the ceiling fan as if it were something else. He wanted music he could survive. Partners who didn’t give up on him. Knees that remembered their promises. A show that didn’t insist he be someone else for the benefit of the screens. He wanted, more than anything, to get to the moment where he was on stage and the light found him when he wanted to be found.

He slept. It was the kind of sleep that felt like a very brief tunnel.

The second day in the rehearsal hall, Maya arrived on time and very nearly fell over a boom mic. “Second day,” she said, breathless for no reason, then made jazz hands. “I’ve decided to rebrand as reliable. It’s going to be short-lived but glorious.”

“Welcome,” he said, and they went back to work. The choreographer they’d been assigned was a woman called Madi who wore black and smiled like a blade. “I want joy,” Madi told them, “but joy that knows pain. I want the edges of you. Where is the place you’re not comfortable going? Go there all morning and then tell me when you get back.” Maya bowed. Nate swallowed. They went there. They found a move that felt like a confession disguised as a lift. They fought over a count and then loved the way it landed. They learned each other’s hands. They learned, too, the small resistances. Maya could not abide it when he pulled without warning; Nate could not abide it when they skipped a drill before he felt safe inside it. They got a little angry and then realized their anger was a cloud passing. They did not pretend clouds weren't clouds. They let the light be different for a while and then said something stupid, like the words for soup, and the cloud wandered off.

Anya watched them and took notes with a pen that looked like it clicked, and didn’t. “Maya,” she said, at one point, without looking up, “your left foot has turned into a liability. Don’t encourage it.” When Maya rolled her eyes, she added, “He’s good for you. You should tell him.”

“I am right here,” Nate said, and Anya looked at him full on for the first time that morning.

“Yes,” she said. “You are. Don’t go anywhere.” Then she put her eyes back on the pen that didn’t click. Being seen and dismissed in the same breath was reassuring, somehow. It meant you had arrived in the place where work, not label, mattered.

They spilled sweat on the floor. They wiped it up. They drank too little water and argued about it. They laughed because their stupid lift looked like two teenagers trying to move a sofa through a door that hated them. Madi clapped the tiny sharp claps of approval that didn’t pretend not to be proud. Around them, other pairs did their own versions of success and its ugly cousin. The room was a bowl full of yes trying to be said in six different languages.

After lunch—a sandwich that had ambitions above the bread it came on—Madi handed them a sheet. “Tomorrow,” she said, “media day. Interviews. Photos. Wear whatever says you and your grandma. They like grandmas.”

“What if I say my grandma is dead?” Maya asked.

“They like that too,” Madi said, not unkind. “Don’t get swallowed by stories. We dance first. We dance best. Then they can ask which is your good side and how you got here.” She turned to Nate. “Have you got your answer ready for how you got here?”

“I came on the bus,” he said, and Madi’s blade-smile softened.

“Keep that one,” she said. “But keep the real one too.”

He thought about that on the bus home. How did you get anywhere? With tiredness? With love like a stubborn plant? With a friend who knew when to smoke outside your good news? With a mother who knew how to laugh through a hurt so it didn’t think it won? He arrived not because of himself alone. The thought comforted and unnerved him; it made him consider the line between deserving and grateful and how light walked it like a wire.

On the third day, in the churn of rehearsal and the small domestic war between onstage and off, he went to the stables before dawn. He liked the way the world loved him there without screens. The horses’ bodies made sense when nothing else did. He mucked out, he fed, he checked Dynamo’s shoes and ran his hand over the horse’s flank with the respect you owed to muscle that didn’t know you were trying to love it. Dynamo snorted and tossed, then accepted him as a fact like cold. Nate leaned in and breathed in and tasted the day without polish.

“You won’t like the music,” he told Dynamo, imagining the bright keys and the beat like someone knocking at the door in a hurry. “But you’ll like the people. Or—no, that’s not true. You won’t like any of it. But I do. And I’m asking you nicely not to do anything. Okay? Please?”

Dynamo flicked an ear and shunted his weight from one leg to the other, silent as a cathedral. Nate scratched the spot under his mane that made him stand like he’d realized his own outline. “I mean it,” he said, because he always insisted on being understood by things that didn’t speak his language. “Behave.”

The horse breathed, which was the only agreement Nate was going to get.

When he left the yard, two kids were hanging on the gate, faces pink, noses running. “Are you going to be on TV?” one asked sharp as a knife.

“Maybe,” Nate said, because yes was too naked a word. “Depends on if I do as I’m told.”

“Can you do that thing where you spin on your head?” the other asked. His hat had cartoon ears that gave him a look of permanent misinformation.

“I’ll break my neck,” Nate said. “I can do a thing where I spin on my hope and try not to fall over.” They blinked at him. He winked. He left.

He carried with him the day and the people in it like pins in the inside of his jacket. He and Maya were good. They were getting better. Underneath, he felt a shape of fear he didn’t give voice to. Shapes without names have a way of slipping through doors and making themselves at home.

Media day arrived with an aggression only people with clipboards can muster. Nate had never been so coaxed into sitting down. “Tell us about your journey,” a woman with a microphone asked. She had hair that didn’t move and a smile you could put your coffee on. He told her about the warehouse and the ladder and the way a man had once taught him a spin over a shouted lesson in an underheated gym. He told her about working at the stables and how his friend thought the word stud was funny. He did not tell her about the nights when he put his head against the cold window and asked the dark to be careful with him.

They took photos. Maya leaned into him like they did this every day. He tried to look like he belonged in photographs, a separate art. He felt the flash and the buzz and the metal scaffolding of attention being built around him. He said thank you too many times. He shook hands he would not remember later. He was careful, always, to find Janine in the crowd and tip his chin so she knew he was still himself underneath the bright.

“Don’t worry,” Maya whispered when she saw his eyes flick to his mother, the way you look for a familiar building when you suspect the city moved. “We’ll be okay. I can carry you. I’m very strong.”

“I believe you,” he said, and he did.

When he finally had a minute to breathe, a man sidled up to him with the kind of shoes that made carpets nervous. “Nate,” the man said—his name carried on a tone that suggested he said a lot of names every day. “I’m Crispin. I represent sponsorship opportunities. I wanted to talk to you about—”

“Later,” Nate said. He didn’t like how his voice came out. He made it softer. “Sorry. Not now.”

“Of course,” Crispin said, storing the slight somewhere it could be used efficiently. “We’ll make you look good. Trust me.” He left a card on the table. The card felt heavy. He ignored it.

In the evening, he went to Tariq’s, where the barbershop buzzed like a hive and the floor was a collage of hair colors. The chairs along the wall were full of boys who pretended to be bored and men who wished they could be. “VIP!” Tariq yelled, like anyone needed to be told. “Ladies and gentlemen: my day-one client since the dawn of time, the last man standing, the first man dancing.”

“Please cut my hair quietly,” Nate said, sitting. The apron with its static clasp turned him into a person who could be sculpted. “I’m fragile.”

“You’re a sculpture,” Tariq said, and started the hum of the clippers. “I saw you on the thing. I saw you look like you wanted to die and then look like you wanted to marry the camera. I have never seen anyone want to marry the camera. She is a difficult wife.”

“How do I look?” Nate asked, because he wanted to be kept in the world by ordinary questions.

“You look like bread that has just been toasted,” Tariq said. “Warm. A little surprised at itself. We love to see it.” He turned the chair and tilted the mirror. “Hey,” he added, mirror and man aligned, voice lower, “I’m proud of you. Not everyone does the thing they say in the pub they’re going to do.”

“It doesn’t feel like I’ve done it,” Nate said. “Like I’m still on the bus and the bus hasn’t stopped.”

“Buses don’t stop if you look at them,” Tariq said. “Look out the window. They stop themselves. That’s wisdom. I read it on the internet.”

Nate paid and left the note he always left because haircuts were one of his luxuries and both he and Tariq pretended they weren’t. He walked home through the part of Milton that looked like it had been drawn quickly and had never forgiven the hand that did it. He passed the off-licence that sold everything and nothing, the tire shop that had somehow become a rumor, the little street with the mural of a fox and a boy holding hands.

He slept again and the tunnel was a little shorter.

The next day, Dynamo bit his sleeve and tore it. He did not tear the skin beneath, which was a victory if you read it that way. “Mate,” Nate said, “we had a talk.” Dynamo stamped. The thuds were calm and angry. Nate held his ground and felt something inside him think about giving way and then decide not to. “Not today,” he said. The horse’s breath fogged his wrist. They stared at each other, two animals with different rulebooks. Finally, Dynamo snorted and flicked his ear again like he’d decided there were easier mountains to flatten. Nate let his shoulders go down and the air return to room temperature.

On his way out, he ran into Mr. Clancy, who had been around since fences were invented and had opinions about all of them. “You’re the dancer,” Mr. Clancy said, like he’d discovered Nate by accident and was not sure he approved. “Don’t let the horse know.”

“I won’t,” Nate said.

“Don’t let anybody know,” Mr. Clancy added, and his laugh was a rasp of wood. “Except the whole city.”

Nate laughed because it was easier. He waved and walked and felt like he was threading something through himself, some line that had been strung and waited. He met Maya at the hall. They refined. The lift stopped looking like a sofa and started looking like what it was, a way of telling someone you trust them without talking. Madi nodded and said, “That’ll do,” in a voice that meant, That’s starting to sparkle. Anya made a small sound that might have been a hidden applause. In the mirror, he saw himself and thought, You might be capable of this. He held the thought like a small animal.

They didn’t talk about the final. It was a word they let sit in the corner. They didn’t touch it in case it startled and ran. They talked about shoes. They talked about school and the radio stations that still played old songs like they were new. They talked about the weather in a way that meant other things. They talked about nothing and their bodies said everything.

Once, during a break, Maya said, “My dad wants to come to the show. He doesn’t deal with crowds. He says he will deal. He says he can be softer than his fears.”

“Good dad,” Nate said.

“Occasionally,” she said.

“My dad left when I was fifteen,” he said, and the words dropped like a coin into a deep place. He didn’t say them often. The story clanged. Maya looked at him and did not offer sympathy in the way people do when they like to hold their own hands up and show how empty they are. She just nodded, a tiny nod that acknowledged the existence of a scar like you acknowledge the existence of a mountain. There was relief in it—no fuss. He wanted to thank her. He didn’t.

They practiced until the evening came and reminded them there were dinners to eat and families to negotiate and small bathrooms to share with sisters. He went home and ate his mother’s fish pie and told Lyla that emojis were something he would try but not something he trusted. He washed the plates because washing plates is a quiet that lives in the hands. He went to bed and the tunnel had lights. He slept and dreamed he was a horse in a suit, which meant nothing and meant everything.

And every morning, the city put on its coat and went outside, and he put his body into the idea of dance, and the horses breathed fog to remind him the world still had weather, and he measured himself against both until he felt them the size he could hold. He tried to keep all the sharp good things from cutting him too soon. He counted the days without counting them, because counting made the number behave weirdly. He told himself he would remember to check the screws on the ladder if they ever gave him one again. He told himself to watch the edge of the stage where it did not care if you stepped off. He told himself don’t be polite to fear. It does not repay the courtesy.

One late afternoon, the hall had been vacated except for him and the sound of his own shoes. He stayed to run the sequence once. Then once more because he had. The floor kept his secrets. He finished and saw his reflection in the high windows. He put his hand up and it did not quite reach the glass. “Okay,” he told it. “We begin.”

Outside, a horse somewhere in the fields tossed its head because the wind was wrong. In the stable, Dynamo listened to a far-off bass line and didn’t like it, because Dynamo was not built to like what belonged to other animals. In the barbershop, Tariq told a story that grew and grew. In the kitchen, Janine added an extra potato to the pot without quite knowing why. In the house on the corner, Jessa put her cigarette away and, for once, didn’t light another one. In a classroom, Maya pretended her attention belonged entirely to an equation. And in Nate’s chest, something opened like hands.The stage at the Centre was wider when you stepped onto it than when you admired it from the seats, a geography that changed scale depending on your courage. Tape Xs marked where cameras wanted heads and shoulders to land as if humans were polite birds. The floor didn’t give; it received, and the lights, even at half, had that hospital brightness that made you feel both examined and somehow clean. Nate followed a production assistant with a torch and a headset who said everything twice in a whisper, the only kind of whisper stage people respected. He stood where he was told and then moved six inches left because a man with a lanyard pointed a finger like a precise storm and said, “Left.” Maya stood next to him and rocked on her heels, her mouth making shapes at the rigging like she was learning a new alphabet.

Camera blocking was a misnamed ritual; nobody wanted to block anybody. They wanted flow that could be predicted. Madi walked them through the frame lines, her voice a metronome with opinions. “This lens loves your hips, Nate, not your knees, so don’t hide in your knees. Maya, if you cut downstage there, the jib will love you and I want that for you because we need their love or they throw us off the internet. Pause here a half beat longer. Don’t sigh; I can hear sighs at fifty metres. Smile at thirty, not at ten.” They did it, then did it again, then did it with a pretend audience so Madi could measure their breathing. The floor had a seam that would catch someone not concentrating. Nate found it with the toe of his shoe, memorized it with the kind of care he usually reserved for people.

They left with the good tired that came from learning the rules of a room. By the time they got to the hallway the producer swarm had scented them, the way bees know when a boy has sugar in his pockets. Crispin had his shoes and his smile and the precise way he pitched his voice so it would travel without sounding like it travelled. “There he is,” he said, as if the morning had been an elaborate game of hide and seek and he had just won. “Stud, my man. Wonderful. Wonderful shape the pair of you are making. Honest. Authentic. We love it. Quick one about a segment idea for the stream—tiny little thing, won’t take up your day. We want to put you with your horses. A little B-roll, a little content. You’ll show us the stables, talk about discipline, about grounding, about how mucking out makes you the man you are. It cuts great with your, you know.” He fluttered a hand in a shape that meant story.

Maya had a look for fake niceness; it was almost respectful. She put it on now and let Crispin talk. Nate tried to answer with his skin, which had gone on alert. “They’re not my horses,” he said, because he wanted the sentence out in the air where it could protect them. “They belong to the yard. I work there. The boss is funny about cameras.”

“Excellent,” Crispin said, hearing all the words and none of the meaning. “We adore funny bosses. There’s a universal quality to a funny boss. We can work it. We’re not talking reality nonsense. We do this with taste. We do you justice. You’ll sign a release. He’ll sign a release. The public wants grit with its glitter. You’ve got both. Come on, we’ll make it painless.”

“Are there going to be big silver plates that flash light at things?” Maya asked, tilting her head so the plaits made a question mark. “Because if you bring those to a horse, the horse brings a lawsuit to your face.”

Crispin did the laugh successful men do when they want you to think they’ve got farm experience. “We know animals,” he said. “We’re very gentle. Tomorrow morning? Half an hour. Fifteen. Ten. You won’t even know we were there.”

Nate rubbed his palms on his jeans and found a word that had saved him more than once. “No,” he said, and then, because no alone felt like a door he hadn’t earned, he added, “Not unless I ask my boss. And we’d need quiet. And we’ll keep to Lovey. Dynamo doesn’t like… anything.”

“Lovey,” Crispin repeated, tasting a brand, and filed the name where captions are born. “Ask the boss. Tell him national exposure. Tell him no cost. Tell him we’ll pixelate his moles.”

“Don’t tell him that,” Maya said, grinning at the ceiling for dramatic effect. “Tell him we’ll be fast and we won’t point at the hay and say ‘look, it’s wheat.’ He’ll hate that.”

They found a corner without voices and Madi leaned in, her blade-smile tucked away for the moment. “You okay?” she asked, which sounded so small and sensible it was almost like being handed a clean glass of water.

“I don’t want them to make it a circus,” Nate said. He was learning that some words, like circus, meant two opposite things at once. “It’s quiet at the yard. People there don’t like to be looked at with the lights on.”

“Then we won’t make it a circus,” Madi said, and there was relief in the plainness of it. “Say what you need out loud to the person who thinks they need the content. They’ll still try for the content. That’s their job. Our job is to do ours and put a hand up when it matters. Put your hand up.”

He called Janine on the walk to the bus, told her the idea and the pit in his stomach, and listened to her slice onions carefully so she wouldn’t cry for the wrong reasons. “Say no,” she said, after a pause where you could hear her decide, like a coin landing on a side. “Or say yes if saying yes gets you something you actually want. If they want you to be a boy who lives in the mud because it fits in a nice box, let them stand in the mud for as long as you had to. I am not mopping under their shoes.”

At the yard the next morning, the frost had given up being pretty and turned into something with a crunch. Mr. Clancy squinted at the van when it pulled in and squinted harder at the people who climbed out. The cameraman wore a beanie and expensive boots that wanted to be in a different postcode. The sound woman detached a little furry microphone from a case with reverence, as if it were a rescued animal. The runner was nineteen in a body that would always be nineteen. Crispin had dressed down in a jumper whose label said dressed up. “He looks like a cardigan advert,” Jessa murmured out of the side of her mouth; she’d come despite the hour, because if something went wrong she liked to be there to say told you so and help tidy it up anyway. “If he gets kicked I will remain neutral externally.”

“Please don’t get anyone kicked,” Nate said to the air, and to Dynamo in particular. He presented Lovey like an old friend. She extended her long nose and breathed onto the microphone with interest, then sneezed wetly and endearingly. Maya arrived five minutes later, scarf to her nose, eyes bright with mischief that could be turned off like a switch. “I have ten minutes,” she said, “then physics, then regret. Where do you want my charm?”

They set up by the fence, which had good angles and a background of honest field. Nate explained feed buckets and how you hang a hay net so a horse can eat but not get its feet in it, and he tried not to look like he knew the camera was close enough to count his pores. He let Lovey sniff his shoulder and made sure his hands were slow and visible. Maya, obediently at the edge of frame, laughed at something he said under his breath about the way the cows filed formal complaints about her scarf when she’d come last, and her laugh made the cameraman pull focus in her direction instinctively like a man turning his head when he hears a song from childhood.

“Can we get you by the big lad?” Crispin asked, restless for more drama. He didn’t say Dynamo’s name like a person would. He said it like a recipe required it.

“No,” Nate said. He put the word on the fence where it could be seen, not tossed quietly into the grass to be stepped on later. “We’re staying here. Lovey or the field or the yard dog if she decides to bless us. No Dynamo. He hates anything new and this is very new.”

Crispin did the palms-up thing that meant compromise but was actually persuasion with better manners. “We’ll keep our distance. Just one pass. A touch of stroking. The public love a big horse.”

“Then show them a bus,” Jessa said behind him, admirable in her commitment to heckling as an art form. “It’s like a horse but you can wave at it without losing a finger.”

The runner, whose nervous energy was a separate character on set, edged toward the second stall because youth makes you brave where experience makes you grateful. Nate saw the angle of it—the open gate, the wrong body in the wrong sightline. Dynamo saw it too. He huffed and did that small freeze that came before the big movement, like lightning deciding what tree it wants. “Back,” Nate said, already moving, his voice low and the hand out, not to touch, but to make the space make sense again. “Back. Hey. Back.” The runner stopped at the tone, eyes wide, a deer who’d wandered into a classroom. Dynamo lifted, not the full rear, but the combined vexation of a beast that had forgotten how to trust but remembered how to argue. The reflector, which had been idle like a quiet moon, flashed as someone shifted, and that was all it took to turn argument into action.

Nate stepped between. He didn’t touch the horse yet; he bent his posture in that human bow that says I see you and I’m going to make myself smaller, and he spoke the sounds he saved for this exact wrongness. His hands made a shape Maya recognised from rehearsals, the shape he made around a lift when he wanted to tell your weight it was safe. The runner backed up until her back met the wall and she realised walls could love you. Dynamo’s foreleg stamped and found nothing to crush, and the noise of it cracked open the morning. Lovey in the next stall looked up, ears like pennants. Crispin did what men do who aren’t sure what to do; he straightened his coat and then remembered not to reach for a shoulder. The cameraman lowered his camera in a gesture the universe should have rewarded.

“Hey,” Nate said again, and he laid his hand against Dynamo’s neck when neck and hand agreed. He felt the tremor that ran like lightning seeking ground. “Okay. You’re right. It’s stupid. It’s all stupid. It’s fine. My man. It’s fine.” He breathed how you want someone else to breathe. The ears flicked. The weight shifted back, and you could feel fifty angry kilos decide not to take revenge on anyone. He stood like a mountain being remembered by the people who named it. Nate let his shoulder drop and his eyes go soft and the flood that had entered his chest be turned back by the good gates you build with practice.

Maya, who had not moved except to hold still like someone very much alive learning about stillness, made the face she made when a difficult sequence landed. “Okay,” she whispered, not for the horse, but for the cameras and the boy. “Okay, okay. I take back everything bad I ever said about hay.”

Crispin’s voice came out flatter than usual, the world having pried something slick off it. “We’ll cut there,” he said, and for once he meant it. “We have enough. Thank you. Thank you. We’ll be out of your way.”

The runner apologised six times. Mr. Clancy materialised to deliver judgement on the wind and everyone born in months with the letter R. “He told you,” he said, not unkindly, to the crew. “He told you no. When a man says a thing and he knows it, it’s best to stand a little behind the thing, not in front of it.”

After they left, the yard returned to its frequency. The dogs resumed their investigation of smells as if the world’s secrets were not held in contracts but in nettles. Nate leaned on the fence and laughed like someone who had carried a weight for a mile and found it lighter at the end than it had been at the start. Maya climbed the gate and sat on the top rung, legs swinging, the picture of a girl who had learned the shape of bravery before someone drew it for her.

“You’re not allowed to be scared later,” she said eventually. “You used up your quota. That was terrifying. Don’t do it again unless I have snacks.”

“I will pre-schedule all terror,” he said, wiping mud off his sleeve in a way that just redistributed it. “You going to be late to physics?”

“Absolutely,” she said, cheerful in defeat. “I will tell sir I learned about forces anyway.” She pointed at Dynamo, who was pretending he had never been dramatic a day in his life. “Newton, but with opinions.” She dropped down and wiped her hands on her trousers. “Can I—” She stopped, fingers hovering. “If I…?”

“Lovey will tolerate flattery from strangers,” Nate said. “Dynamo will write to his MP.” He led her to the skewbald, who let Maya’s palm settle on the slope of her cheek like a carefully placed coin. Maya sneezed as predicted, looking betrayed and delighted at the same time. “This is my punishment for being a city child,” she said, which made him laugh.

After, she walked him to the bus, and they took the six benches between the gate and the road slow, like a ceremony. She told him she had a mock next week that would decide which part of the exam her teacher would sigh at. He told her his mother had a meeting with someone at the council about a letter without detail that had come in a brown envelope. They agreed that brown envelopes had done something to them both long ago that made the blood in your face walk out for a minute.

At home, the brown envelope had been tamed into a neat pile at the far edge of the table, like it had been told to think about what it had done. Janine was making something with onions, beans and an optimism that had never yet betrayed her. She didn’t hover the way some mothers hovered when their boys came back from being watched. She did watch him without looking like she was watching, which is a different skill. “How was the horse,” she asked, in the singular.

“Persuasive,” he said, which made her mouth do the small uprights at the corners that said the day had not beaten her. “They won’t come back.”

“Good,” she said. “The house doesn’t need to be on the telly to be real.” She gestured at the pile with her chin. “It’s just a thing about the rent going up. Everyone who owns anything wants to own more. It will be fine until it isn’t. We’ll think about it if it’s not fine.”

“We can’t pay a rise without thinking about it,” he said, and she looked at him straight, which meant she had decided to tell one more truth than was strictly necessary.

“No,” she said. “But your name isn’t money yet. We’ll take your name being yours before we make it work for anyone else.” She went back to the pan. “I’ll ring Mrs. Khanna and ask about her nephew who knows about these things. He will say things about indexes and we will nod and then try not to cry when we have to do sums. Eat a biscuit before you talk to fear about money. It makes you brave.”

He wanted to hand her Crispin’s card and say, I could do a thing and they might put our faces next to trainers and pay me enough for three months of not worrying, but he didn’t. He didn’t know yet if that would be selling something that would cost more later than it bought now. Instead he said, “I’ll make the mugs,” and he did, bringing her the chipped one with the bird on it that claimed it was indestructible.

Lyla arrived with three unsafe ideas and a glue gun. She had stolen poster board from school or repurposed a project so cleverly you could call it a theft if you wanted. “We are making signage,” she said, like a general addressing a volunteer army. “We are making banners. We are making a plan for what I will wear when I am interviewed as your sister and I become my own entity. Mum, do we have glitter, and if we do not, why have you raised me in this denial.”

“I have paprika,” Janine said, handing her the jar with the seriousness paprika deserves. “You can pretend it is glitter and then burn your tongue. There is marmalade. That is sticky and festive.”

“I hate marmalade,” Lyla announced, so loudly that two houses down a man wondered briefly if he was missing a joke. “Also, I did my speech for English. It is about ambition. Spoiler: it is a trap and a ladder.” She looked at Nate, her face doing the brand of cheek that came from having grown up in the same house as him. “You are mentioned three times. You owe me a footnote in your autobiography. I will accept payment in hoodies.”

They worked at the table, domesticity making its case. He cut and she stuck and Janine rationed biscuits like she was handing out medals. The radio did that thing where it put on a song that made you remember a bus stop in Year Eleven and the smell of someone's perfume you thought at the time was proof that life had secret rooms. He let himself fall into the ordinary and could feel his body thank him for it.

The next day Maya was brittle in a way that took a minute to name. It wasn’t anger. It was the kind of edge that shows up when you’ve had to make your brain perform for strangers with clipboards. “I did okay in the mock,” she said, stretching like she could shake the graded paper out of her muscles. “Which feels like failing even when they tell you it’s not. Dad said if I can do that I can do better, which is technically true and useless.”

Anya was quieter with her sharpness than usual, which told you she’d chosen kindness as an experiment to see if it suited her. Madi came in with an energy that suggested she’d wrestled a printer and won. “We edit,” she said, dropping her bag and clapping once in a way that made people in three other rooms straighten their backs. “You’ve got a little flourish in count five that reads polite. I don’t love polite there. Bring me the thing under polite.” They built the lift again from the floor up as if truth had to be set into muscle slowly. Nate’s knee did a whisper, a little complaint like wood, and he told it to hold its counsel. Maya’s left foot decided it didn’t like the floor. Anya raised an eyebrow at the foot and the foot chose different priorities.

They argued once, properly, not the flirty kind of bicker that tastes sweet. It was about tempo, which is to say it was about control. Maya wanted to push, to ride the music like a wave you didn’t respect. Nate wanted to place, to know where the board was before he stepped. “You’re holding me,” she said, breath fast, eyes bright. “If you hold me at your rhythm then I have to be you.”

“If I let it go faster I lose you,” he said, feeling the old habit of repeating to make safety arrive. “I can’t catch you if I don’t know where my feet are.”

They practised it until both of them were wrong and then a little right. Madi stopped them when their annoyance began to bleed into their shapes. “Listen,” she said, and they listened because she had that teacher voice that teaches even when it jokes. “You’re both trying to keep the other safe in your favourite language. Switch languages. For eight counts you do it her way, Nate. Trust that your feet are not stupid. For eight counts you do it his way, Maya. Let the floor be a partner you aren’t trying to seduce. Then you do it together. You’re both right. Congratulations. It’s boring to be both right.”

They did what she said because boredom, in that room, was the worst insult available. It worked enough to give them a new argument later and a laugh now. Maya pinched the bridge of her nose like a pensioner and sighed. “This is gross,” she said. “And I like it.”

On the way out of the building, after a day that felt like three, Nate’s phone vibrated itself anxious in his pocket. He looked and saw an unfamiliar number with a city code that made his mouth taste like coins. He could have ignored it. He could have let it fall into that place where calls go when you aren’t ready. He pressed accept because he was tired of cupboard doors half open in his head.

“Hello,” he said. There was a pause where a hundred versions of a man’s voice arranged themselves and then chose one.

“Nathan,” the voice said, clipped, careful, as if the speaker had been sat on all day by life and had only now stood up. “It’s your father. I saw you.” There was a sound after saw that wasn’t on the call, a sound like a chair scraping. “On the internet. Your—dance.” The word came out heavy with someone else’s idea of it glued to it. “You were… very good.”

Nate stopped in the doorway and felt the world decide how loudly it would continue. Maya had gone ahead, then realised he was a still shape and came back, standing a little distance away like a lighthouse that minded its own business. “Okay,” he said, because there were a hundred words and he owned none of them. “Thanks.”

“I thought I should ring,” his father said. He was making a sentence in an unfamiliar language. “To say—well done. And your mother… I might… I will send something. Money. If you need it. It’s—” He cleared his throat, the international sign for a man not used to it. “It’s good, Nathan. It suits you.”

There were a thousand things to say that would make the air crack. He could pick none and still be honest. “I have to go to rehearsal,” he said, because he did not and could not explain that rehearsal was the place he had built for this exact moment. “Thanks for ringing.”

“All right,” his father said, just like that, the old word wrapping around the new call. “All right, son.” He hung up clumsily, like people did on films when they had been told to hurry. The silence after him was not actually silent. It was a new sound. It took a second to learn whether it was a noise that meant danger, or weather.

Maya nudged his elbow with hers in a way that only someone who’s watched you find your way out of a different kind of hard thing is allowed to. “Okay?”

“I don’t know,” he said, and a man walking past them with a sandwich laughed at something on his own phone, and the normality of it made the hall less bright. “It’s fine.”

“Fine like okay or fine like I will be fine later but at the moment my skin is wearing me,” she said, and he barked that laugh that comes when someone calls your shape what it is without drawing a circle around it.

He went home with a head full of sentences he had not said. He put his phone down on the table and looked at it like it was an animal he was training. Janine squeezed his shoulder as she passed him and set another potato going without discussion. That night, after all the people had put themselves in their rooms and declared their day done, he sat in the little patch of safety between sleep and worry and answered a message from Jessa on his own terms. She had sent a photo of the gate at the allotments and captioned it with a weather report that included opinions. He sent her a picture of the stage with no lights on and wrote, pocket city. She replied, pocket volcano, and that was exactly it.

The dress rehearsal brought the city into the room whether it wanted to be there or not. There were clipboards for the clipboards, runners with headsets who ran out of reasons to run, a man who only talked into a radio and never stopped mid-word. Security pinned badges to shirts as if they could pin time. They were asked not to spill water, not to spill secrets, not to spill themselves. The floor had been cleaned to the point of being an argument. The air had that quality of before. They ran the piece in costume, which meant Nate’s good jacket and the trousers that had cost more than he’d told anyone and Maya in a black set that managed the trick of being serious and impossible to ignore.

“You can’t fall,” Maya said, tying her laces the way only a person with younger knees can, with faith and speed. “It’s bad television. Also bad everything.”

“I will fall into being a responsible adult,” he said. “Which is worse.”

They stepped into the light and let it find the sides of them it wanted to outline. The first notes were there, and Nate’s hand found the space between Maya’s shoulder and the air and held that space until it felt like warmth. The floor seam he’d worried about was exactly where his body remembered it would be. He did the count her way and then his way and then their way. He did the lift with the breath and the trust and the minute flick of her eyes that said, yes now. He didn’t look at the edge because he knew where it was. He didn’t look at the cameras because the cameras, when you were doing it right, were just other animals in the field. Midway through the run he felt the small click Madi had wanted, the one that says the parts are talking to each other without requiring a meeting.

They finished on the last beat as if they had placed it there the day before and asked it politely to wait for them. There was no applause because this wasn’t that kind of day. There was the noise of a room resettling into its function and a breath that belonged to both of them and a look from Madi that wasn’t a blade and wasn’t a shield, just a look that said this is a thing. Anya’s bun had a hair out of it, which told you she had allowed human feeling to creep through all that efficiency just then and forgotten to fix it.

Backstage, an assistant with a headset pointed them at a wall where names were listed with arrows. Nate saw his own and underneath it, in a hand that was not his, someone had written Stud in little neat letters and drawn a heart and crossed it out and then drawn a horse and left it. He laughed, and it was easier than before. He sat on a plastic chair while Maya was snatched for a lighting tweak and stretched his knees with the kind of care you give to bridges. He was an animal, and the stage was weather, and the city outside had put its coat on and would take it off when the lights were done.

On the way home he shared a carriage with a man in a fox costume who looked tired in the eyes and a woman holding three foil balloons that, despite her best efforts, had opinions about physics. Nate texted Lyla that her poster glitter had ended up on his trousers like a blessing from a god with poor aim. She sent him a picture of herself with two banners and a dog she had borrowed for the purpose of showing scale. He sent Tariq a video of the light rig doing its slow dance above an empty stage and typed, wife is in a good mood, and Tariq sent back, treat her right, she is high maintenance.

He got off two stops early again and walked by the river where the light was thinking about leaving. Two kids drew on the frost with their fingers and then looked guilty at the marks, as if they had cut the skin of something alive. The field smelled like cold and soil. At the fence near the far paddock he could just make out Dynamo, a big dark certainty. He lifted a hand and felt foolish and felt fine feeling foolish. “We begin,” he said, not at the horse, not at the field, not at himself. He said it to the space that had grown in his chest since the email made him stop in the lane. He said it to the column of air between the stage and the kitchen. He said it to whatever in him had stayed quiet for so long to make room for other people’s noises. He didn’t get an answer, which felt right. He put his hands in his pockets and went home in the kind of silence that doesn’t bite.The morning began with a smaller sky than usual, as if the weather had decided to be neat for once and fold itself before it left the house. Nate woke before the alarm, the kind of alert you get when your body has set its own clock out of stubbornness and a little love. He lay very still and checked inside himself for the noise that had been building all week. It was there, but it had rounded its edges and settled lower, closer to where his lungs did their work, as if it had decided to be useful. He put his feet on the cold floor and exhaled, counting without counting. From the kitchen came the sound of Janine finding bowls with the authority of a woman who had never once asked a cupboard’s permission.

He found her at the table making poached eggs in the old metal saucepan that hated to cooperate. She had her hair tied back with a ribbon that had lost its right to be called ribbon but refused to retire. “You have a face on,” she said, not looking up because mothers can see you with the wrong part of their heads. “Is it the face for the big day or the face for pretending it’s just Thursday?”

“It’s a face that would like eggs,” he said, and sat, and let his hands sit obediently on the wood because it grounded him to have them do as they were told. Lyla came in like weather, an event in a hooded top that had declared war on quiet. She was already wearing her banner like a sash and had glitter in her eyelashes that made her blink like a lighthouse.

“Are you going to be sick?” she asked with the cheerfulness of the truly supportive. “If you are going to be sick, do it in the sink because the bathroom is a crime scene.”

“I am not going to be sick,” he said, and discovered he meant it. “If I am going to be sick, I will do it on Crispin’s shoes.”

“Please do not do it on anyone’s shoes,” Janine said, and plated an egg with the ceremony of a due acknowledgement. “Eat. Then breathe. Then call Jessa and remind her that she cannot yell at security. Then go and be brilliant. We will follow like sensible shadows.”

The bus today held himself and four teenagers who looked at the world in the way people look at a buffet when they’re not sure whether it’s polite to be hungry. Milton did its Milton thing outside the window, pragmatic and hopeful in the same breath. He could see the Centre from far off, the big curve of glass and the thin letters on poles that had been designed by someone who believed in fonts. The city had put on clean clothes; he could tell from the way people were walking faster.

At the stables, the frost had turned to slick silver in the places the sun hadn’t reached. He took the long path around to give his brain something ordinary to do and found Mr. Clancy checking a gate like the gate had offended his family. “Big day,” Mr. Clancy said, and that was generous for him. “Don’t fall off.”

“I’ll keep my feet,” Nate said, and ran a hand down Lovey’s neck because she let him share nerves with her without taking any for herself. Dynamo snorted from his stall like he was making fun of anyone who would leave their house to be watched. Nate leaned on the half-door and looked in anyway, respecting the line between courage and foolishness. “I won’t bring any cameras,” he said, which felt like a promise and sounded like diplomacy. Dynamo flicked an ear toward him and returned to pretending hay was a grievance.

Maya texted from the top deck of her own bus a picture of her trainers and a caption that said, these shoes refuse mediocrity. He replied with a picture of his knee wrapped in the kind of elastic that suggested it had opinions about everything and wrote, this knee will be polite. She wrote back a string of small gold trophies and a bowl of soup for reasons neither of them could remember.

The stage at the Centre had grown a kiss of light overnight and looked like somewhere important and unforgiving. The crew had multiplied, and you could tell who belonged to which department by the way they moved. Sound people always looked like they were listening to something no one else could hear. Lighting people gazed upward as if God had left notes in the rigging. Production assistants went everywhere at once and somehow also nowhere in particular. Anya stood just inside the wings like a chaperone who had promised to let the children make their own mistakes unless those mistakes involved tripping in front of strangers. Madi was on the edge of the stage with her clipboard and her soft blade-smile and a thermos that probably contained something decent.

“Morning, joy merchants,” Madi said when they came into her radius. “We’ll do the cue-to-cue again because everyone is pretending yesterday didn’t happen and then we’ll leave you alone to be good at your jobs. Nate, the jib will make a pass that feels like a new moon. Don’t look at it like it owes you money. Maya, your hair is doing a thing the camera hates, so either make it do a different thing or we won’t look at your head, which would be a waste.”

Maya extracted a bobble and reworked her plaits with the efficiency of a girl who had been explaining herself to mirrors since she could reach them. “I had a dream I was late,” she said to nobody in particular. “In the dream I was late and no one minded because we were all underwater. Then I woke up and remembered about punctuality and oxygen, and I couldn’t go back to sleep because both seemed suddenly tyrannical.”

“You’ll be on time and you’ll breathe,” Anya said from her post, and lifted a hand an inch, a blessing and a threat. “Your left foot is already trying to rebel. Tell it to sit down.” Maya wiggled her left toes and then stamped because obedience sometimes needed theatre.

They ran the beginning and the middle and the end and then they ran the bits in between. The lights did that slow roll that made the stage feel like a breathing thing. Nate learned the camera’s path in the way you learn a dog’s intentions, by watching the places it looked at when it thought no one was paying attention. He could feel his body find familiar routes. The seam was where he had left it. The breath was where Madi had requested it. The lift came and went without complaint, not like a secret, but like a sentence that knows its own grammar.

In the green room that had been christened green because no one had the heart to call it fluorescent, someone had laid out fruit and pastries and a humiliation of tiny bottles of water that tried too hard. Performers did their rituals: some talked, some slept, some stretched one hamstring on the back of a chair in a way that made health and safety inspectors dream of retirement. A boy with the silver hoodie from the first day had a portable speaker and a face that said he was negotiating the playlist with God. He nodded at Nate like conspirators. A woman with the red dress had pinned nothing to the corkboard and looked content about it. Maya ate a banana and then a second banana and then announced that two bananas were the exact right amount and any banana beyond the second banana was hubris.

Crispin did a loop of the room that felt like a security check for emotions and paused by their corner with the very particular delight of a man who could smell a moment he could sell if he pressed at the edges. “Big night,” he said, his voice pitched to perform intimacy in a publicly acceptable register. “Very proud of the piece. Very us. A little note about post-show opportunities. It will be mad; we’ll want content in the corridor, maybe at the fountain if we can steal a minute, a little raw thing for the stream. Give me two shots of your faces right after you come off. I promise not to ask for tears. If tears happen naturally, we don’t argue with nature.”

“We’re dancing,” Maya said, and her smile was weaponised. “Everything else is a queue. You can take our faces after we’re finished using them.” Crispin applauded the line like he intended to put it on a T-shirt. When he moved on, Madi drifted in like a very polite storm and stood between them and whatever was next because that was part of her job too.

Janine texted a picture from the plaza where sunlight made a brief and necessary attempt to improve the concrete. She had Tariq and Jessa on either side of her like a pair of mismatched bodyguards and Lyla in front with a banner so large it had required three buses to explain it. The sign read GO ON THEN, STUD in letters so confident they were almost arrogant, and beneath that LYLA’S BROTHER, CALL ME IF YOU ARE A TALENT SCOUT, with a number that probably belonged to a pizza place. Nate laughed the sort of laugh that comes when love gets the spelling wrong and still arrives on time. He texted back a heart and then a horse and then corrected the horse because the first horse looked like it might sue.

The house filled itself with the steady discipline of people who had paid for their tickets and wanted them to work. You could hear the audience in the walls, the sound that isn’t sound exactly but a pressure, a waiting. Backstage, the queue reshuffled as cues always do and they were pushed ten minutes and then pulled five, the elastic time of theatre. A runner with a headset and the kind of concentration usually reserved for bomb disposal knocked on their door with the knuckles of someone trying not to disturb ghosts. “Five to you,” she said, and smiled so quickly it almost didn’t count, and they stood.

In the wings, the stage looked more like a river than it had before, a strip of brightness you could step into if you agreed to get wet. Nate could smell hairspray, dust, and the cheap apple scented cleaner they used on the railings. He could feel Maya’s shoulder close to his arm, the familiar geometry that had been earned in a week and felt like something older. Anya, who had sworn she did not believe in touching before performances, put one hand on each of their backs like a bridge and leaned her forehead for half a breath against the cool metal of the fly system. Madi counted them off without moving her mouth. The opening bars slipped in under the curtain like a late guest.

They went. There was the bright of it and the blank of it and the calm inside the bright that felt like snow, the good kind that teaches the world to hush. They did the small things first because small things make big things possible. He placed his weight and then took it back and then let it go and did not ask permission again. She sliced and he caught; he rolled and she pressed; she made gravity jealous and he forgave it. On three-and-four he felt her elbow say now in a language the bones speak. On five he gave up the bit of control he had been hoarding for emergencies. On seven he found it again but it had changed shape and he liked the new one better. The air on the stage has temperature and he could feel it adjust to them, get warmer where they wrote their names into it.

There were notes, the ones that had been notes for days and the ones that arrived and left like birds, and for once he didn’t resent them. The seam on the floor tried to argue and he declined the argument. The phrase they had fought about did what phrases do when they are finally trusted: it held. The lift came and for a blink the world giggled in panic because she was not quite where the rehearsal had promised she would be and he was not quite where his knee intended, but then her hand met his wrist and his palm found the top of her shoulder and they changed the count by a hair and the new count was a doorway they could pass through without lying. It was the kind of error that makes the rest true. He felt Anya’s distant approving frown and Madi’s soft exhale without having to see them.

The last eight counts were the ones they had told nobody about in case they went wrong. They had stolen a tiny piece of quiet and dropped it into the choreography like a coin into a well. The music peeled back and they were left with the sound of shoe on floor and the breath that belongs to two people when two people are doing a thing exactly together on purpose. The air held its shoulders high. He put his hand out and she stepped into it and their heads turned at the same time to two different points in the room and you could feel the audience’s collective neck move with them like obedient birds. Then the last beat, which is never the last beat, and blackout that wasn’t full because the emergency lights were doing their duty, and the small noise a big room makes when it has decided it is safe to tell the truth.

The applause wasn’t thunder. It was rain on a roof, grateful and accumulating, the kind that arrives from a lot of people deciding yes at once. He received it like he’d been told to hold a baby for the first time. He could hear Lyla in the top corner where the banner had been a menace and Janine’s particular clap which carried straight back to his years and Tariq’s whistle that started with a vowel you couldn’t write down. He would have sworn he heard Mr. Clancy, but he knew that was impossible; some sounds just carry themselves back to you when you need them.

Backstage was a well-lit chaos with hugs and the sort of congratulations that contain the words for your name even when they don’t use them. Madi squeezed his shoulder and the blade-smile retired for a minute. “You didn’t apologise to the floor,” she said, which in her language was a medal. “That was adult of you. Keep it up.”

Anya looked like a person who had taken off a small piece of armour without ceremony and then decided she did not want it back immediately. “Your left foot,” she said to Maya, because she had a reputation to maintain, and then added, “He is good for you.” She looked at Nate for one second longer than the rules permitted and nodded. “You may tell your mother I said that and that she is allowed to be smug.”

Crispin appeared like a spare note and for once asked for nothing more than the faces he had promised himself. He got a quick frame of them both with the red of effort in their cheeks and put the camera away like a man respectful at a funeral. “That was delicious,” he said, holding his hands an inch apart like he was describing a small cake. “I can sell this all day, but I won’t until you’ve eaten something that isn’t a banana.”

They ate whatever the green room offered that wasn’t dignified, the good indignity of food with the soul of a petrol station. Other dancers came by to hit them lightly on the arms in the way you do when you know someone will bruise the next day and you want to be a part of it. The boy in the silver hoodie taught Lyla a three-count move in the corridor while security looked the other way because sometimes kindness was part of the job. A producer with a spreadsheet the size of Milton told Maya she had done the city proud. Maya said the city had done itself proud and then had to sit because pride is heavy if you don’t distribute it evenly.

They were finally released into the foyer where the public had been invited to behave like they’d just seen someone do a thing worth talking about. Janine barrelled toward him with that particular combination of dignity and haste mothers possess when they are proud and don’t want to embarrass themselves doing it. She started to say your and then switched to you and then found nothing and did the practical thing of putting both her hands on his cheeks and expanding her smile into a room with which she had not negotiated at all. “You were beautiful,” she said, and the word landed like a truth you can stand on. “You were yourself.”

Lyla flung herself around his waist and said his name fifteen times because her mouth needed practice at belonging to the moment. Tariq, who had already told seven people in the foyer a version of the story in which he had discovered Nate in a skip and polished him until he shone, hugged him and whispered in his ear, “She said yes,” as if the city itself had proposed. Jessa stood at the edge of the group, her hands in her pockets, her cigarette deliberately absent. She raised her chin and he saw her eyes do the soft thing they only did when she’d forgotten to be difficult. “Acceptable,” she said, which meant she had moved her own furniture around to make room for pride.

He was turning toward Maya to say the thing that would help them pin this to the day when a voice he knew at the edges and not quite in the middle said his name like a word it had decided to pronounce properly. He looked and there was his father, not quite in the light, carrying his hands the way men carry tools when they don’t want to admit they missed them. He had shaved with poor confidence. He wore a jacket that was doing its best. He had a stiff bouquet that had been bought from a supermarket that had arranged flowers under a fluorescent ambition. Behind him, as if the city were helping with stagecraft, the automatic doors opened and sent a gust of warm air and perfume into the space between them.

“Nathan,” his father said again, softer, because the first had been a rehearsal. “That was… I’ve never seen you do… that.” He gestured toward the stage with the bouquet and one of the lilies, unsure of its own strength, abandoned the group and fell to the floor with the sort of tragic grace only flowers can manage. No one reached for it. It seemed right to let it rest.

Janine’s face went neutral in that very particular way of women who have promised themselves a certain standard of self-respect in public. She stood a fraction to the side, not shielding, not offering, simply holding the air equal between two people and waiting to see if the gravity changed. Lyla’s eyes went large and clever and she stepped backwards into Tariq, who put a hand on the top of her head without thinking about it and then pretended he had been planning that gesture for weeks.

“I didn’t know you were coming,” Nate said, and he heard his own voice and approved of its plainness. He was surprised to find that none of the old weather came scudding over the horizon at the sight of the man; the stage had rearranged his climate. “We don’t… we don’t have a lot of spare chairs.”

“I stood,” his father said, and the humour he tried on did not rest naturally on him but did not embarrass either of them. “I rang and then I thought, it’s no good ringing and not doing. So I did. I got… lost.” He grimaced at the word like an admission. He looked at Janine very briefly, and when their eyes met they both nodded like people who have negotiated peace in a war neither wants to revisit. “You were very good,” he added, turning back. “I brought… these.” He held the bouquet out like a licence he hoped would be accepted. The cellophane crinkled with the sound of a thousand small apologies. Janine took the flowers without commentary and handed them to Lyla, who took them in the sullen exalted way teenagers take responsibility when they sense danger and also an opportunity to be superior.

“This is Maya,” Nate said, because he could not think of anything else to say and introducing someone brilliant felt like a good old custom to rely on. “My partner. Maya, this is—”

“Your father,” she finished, stepping in, her hand quick and neat. “Hi. The dance was a two-person project. He was not entirely responsible.” She grinned just enough to make the words warm. “I’m very strong.”

His father shook her hand and looked as if he were calibrating a new machine. “You’re very good,” he said, and the accuracy of it was a gift to all of them. “I couldn’t… do that. My knees.”

“My knees are teenagers,” she said gravely. “They do what they want.”

They stood in a small, complicated space and the city continued to move around them like a polite animal. It was easier than it could have been. Jessa put her cigarette back in its case so that no one had the excuse of a smoke to leave. Tariq declared himself in need of a drink with the timing of a saint and then did not have one. Anya appeared by a column wearing the expression of someone who has found herself in the row with her least favourite ex-student and discovered he has improved; she took Janine’s elbow for a second, not so much to guide as to share practical weight.

There was still a stage and still lights cooling and still a choreography of interviews and the polite violence of cameras that needed faces. Crispin made consider-it eyes from a respectful distance like a nature documentary narrator acknowledging a mother with cubs. Madi mouthed wrap in his general direction and he had the sense to accept being told. Somewhere the man in the fox costume was half out of his head and regretting every choice he’d ever made that had led to him profiting from children’s birthdays. Somewhere the woman with the balloons had finally explained physics to her son by letting one go.

They made their way towards the doors in a small herd, letting the happy strangers press them from the sides and not minding the fingerprints. Outside, the afternoon was doing a good impression of an evening and the plaza had the sort of wind that didn’t bother announcing itself. People stepped out into it with coats that had been designed for better towns. Tariq positioned himself so that anyone taking a photo might accidentally get his good side. Jessa held the bouquet under her arm like a medieval weapon. Janine kept very upright and walked at a pace that said she would choose what would happen next even in a crowd. Nate felt lighter in the legs than he usually did after dancing and decided this was what happens when terror burns cleanly instead of sooty.

Across the square, a boy of about eight practised mimicking one of Nate’s steps for a friend with the exact seriousness of the self-taught, legs doing their best impression of precision. His friend clapped at the wrong place and corrected himself, and the two of them folded away into their mothers, who were already planning to tell their sisters about the night. A kid on a BMX ghosted through traffic he was not supposed to be in and shouted Stud in a tone that managed to be affectionate and insulting, which is to say it was perfect. From the edge of things, Mr. Clancy appeared like a rare weather condition and nodded at Nate once from under his flat cap and then left because he did not believe in prolonged public gestures. It was as near to a blessing as he would ever attempt.

They ended up at a cafe with a glass front and an army of chairs that all made the same noise when you moved them. Apparently every good thing today would come with lighting that flattened your skin. They took two tables and pushed them into one without asking permission. The waitress, who had done ten of these nights and had collected them like stamps, brought chips, tea, and a piece of cake so dense it had a gravitational field. Maya took off her shoes under the table and sighed and then did not apologise for it. She fed Lyla chips like she was domesticating a dragon. Janine unfolded a napkin on her lap and immediately forgot it existed. Jessa tried to reach for her packet and then remembered the cafe had rules and settled for twisting her ring and looking at the ceiling like it had wronged her personally. Tariq told a version of the lift that made the laws of physics wave politely and step aside.

His father sat at the end, just outside the noise, hands on his knees the way people used to do at funerals and weddings, and watched without staring. He had a way of smiling now that made his eyes smaller and kinder; Nate did not recognise it and decided he would not be cruel about the delay. After a while, his father cleared his throat again, and it had less to clear this time. “Do you need,” he began, and stopped, and the napkins in the universe held their breath. “Do you need anything?” He looked at Janine when he said the last word, as if he had resat a default setting he had not used in nine years.

“We need him to sleep,” Janine said, after a second in which you could have balanced a plate. “We need a stable rent for six months and for the bus not to change its timetable without telling him because he will be late and say it is his fault. We need a new hinge for the cupboard under the sink and no more brown envelopes without warning.” She took a drink of her tea as if to underline the points. “Other than that,” she concluded, “no.”

“I can do the hinge,” he said, relief and sadness sharing a chair. “I can do the bus timetable if I write a letter. I can do two months of the rent and then ask if that helps. I can’t promise anything past that because I… because I won’t. Not anymore.” He placed a folded envelope on the table that was thick enough to be awkward and thin enough to be sincere, and then pushed it towards the centre like an offering to a god. “You can hate me and still—let me do that. I won’t stand in the kitchen for it. I won’t ask what you buy. I’ll just—do that.”

Janine looked him in the face with her proper look and did her accounting inside her head where no one could disturb it. She did not touch the envelope because she respected its power to set rooms on fire. “You can,” she said, and the cafe did not even notice the kind of moment it was hosting. “We can. We will not thank you for old fires. We will thank you for hinges and two months.” She offered him a corner of a smile that contained all the mathematics of adult life. “You can come to the next if you can be silent in the way that counts and loud in the way that doesn’t.”

“I can be both,” he said, and for once you believed him.

It was not tidy. There was not a violin in the corner that started up because they had arrived at resolution. There were chips and crumbs and the squeak of chairs and the fact of the city outside doing the brave, boring work of being itself. There would be phone calls later to answer and messages to ignore and one from Crispin that would be easy to swat away because the night had taught Nate where his no lived. There would be a knee that muttered again because bodies cannot be argued with for free. There would be a text from Maya at 2 a.m. that said I have never been this tired and also alive, please advise, and he would send her a horse emoji because he did not have horse tranquillity to prescribe in pill form. There would be the ordinary mercy of sleep.

When they walked back to the bus stops, Janine took his hand the way you take a parcel that you know contains fragile and necessary things. Lyla carried the lilies blunt-side-up as if she had been born for that sort of choreography. Tariq told the night porter for the Centre that he was the lead barber on the production and the man pretended to be impressed in the way men do when they recognise someone else’s need to be taller. Jessa fell behind on purpose to blow smoke at the idea of fate and then caught up because she could not resist a good exit line. His father peeled off at the corner and lifted his palm without committing to a wave and looked back only once, which meant he had done something heroic according to the alarming rulebook of fathers who try again.

On the top deck of the bus, the city was softer, as if someone had turned the fabric over and revealed the weave. Nate put his forehead to the glass and let its chill whittle down the edges of his mind. The lights of the shops made a little theatre out of nothing. In the reflection he could still see the stage-version of himself hovering a fraction to the left of the real, the way a double exposure makes you look briefly haunted. He felt the weight of the envelope in his mother’s bag like a tiny planet and decided he would not let it tilt their orbit without their consent. He thought about the lift and the mistake that had made the count truer and smiled into his arm because the best parts of anything were always a little misaligned.

At the house, they took their shoes off at the door because even on big nights you obey the carpet. Janine put the lilies in the good vase as if she had never once called it the silly vase, and the water took the stems like an oath. Lyla stuck the banner to the wall above the television with tape that would test the paint’s character in the morning. Nate stood in the kitchen and let the kettle talk to him about steam and time. When he went into his room he waited for his heart to remind him to be careful and it did not; it reminded him to be brave instead. He lay back and listened to the small noises of the house negotiating with the night. Somewhere a fox screamed, which is to say it stately announced itself to all animals everywhere, and he laughed because a fox screaming at the sky after a good thing had happened was exactly the sort of nonsense the world liked to chip in.

Sleep came, not as a tunnel, but as a lake he could step into without checking its depth first. He went under with his eyes open and found that it was clearer than he remembered. In the morning, the weather would begin again as if it had invented the idea of consistency. He would go to the yard to be reminded where his hands ended and the animal began. He would read messages from people he hadn’t spoken to since school who would tell him they always knew he would, and he would believe some of them and put the rest in a drawer. He would answer Crispin properly and kindly and keep his words. He would stretch and ice and be humble and not small. He would be asked to do that piece again somewhere brighter and he would decide if brighter served the piece. He would be what he had decided to be yesterday when he stepped into the light and let it make its measurements. He would keep saying no to the things that wanted the mud but not the work and yes to the things that smelt of hay and counted in fours.

And for a while, in the kind of silence that chooses you and not the other way around, the world met him halfway.The morning after the show, the house held its breath like it was trying not to rustle the good luck. Nate’s phone woke up before he did and jittered itself along the bedside like it wanted to roll away and start a second life under the chest of drawers. He lay very still with his eyes closed and counted to twelve because twelve had been good to him lately, and then he let the world in. Messages layered themselves like pastry. Tariq had sent a video of himself shaving a man who insisted on calling a fade a “gentle cliff,” overlaid with the caption I did the hair so you did the air. Jessa had sent a photo of an unlit cigarette on a saucer—it looked like a museum piece—with the title restraint, for you. Maya had sent three words, we didn’t drown, and four trophy emojis and then, contradicting herself two minutes later, a voice note in which her breath was still visible between the words. “My dad cried once and then pretended to find something in his eye for the entire second half,” she said. “If you tell him I told you, I will say you’re a liar who lies and also owes me soup.” There were unknown numbers with greetings that came in corporate fonts, a smattering of hearts from people he could place by the kind of punctuation they used, and a crisp who is this from an old classmate that felt like a pebble thrown into his childhood window.

At the yard, the cold had been trimmed to a respectable shape. The water in the troughs wore a delicate lid that broke with the sound of small manners being discarded. Mr. Clancy was already there in a coat that had seen several winters and chosen not to comment. “Well,” he said, as Nate ducked under the stable door into the smell that meant honest work, and the word well hung there with enough to be going on with. “Don’t be bringing the BBC in here again.” He didn’t wait for an answer, which was his talent.

“I’m not bringing anybody in,” Nate said. He moved slow among the bodies he could read like a grammar book he’d learned as a child. “I’ve been informed I’m not allowed to adopt the stallion, film the stallion, or introduce the stallion to experimental lighting.” He ran the broom under the gate like he was combing a giant’s fringe. Dynamo watched him with the unimpressed expression of an elder deity whose worshippers have discovered Instagram.

The boss—Mrs. Pritchard, a woman made of tweed and spine whose mouth could say tea and thunder with the same economy—appeared in the aisle with a set of rubber gloves like a sermon. “You had a circus,” she announced. She didn’t need to employ a rising intonation; she wasn’t asking for context. “On my yard. With reflectors. Reflectors.”

“I said no,” Nate said, and he put the broom against the wall because he’d learned you couldn’t hold your ground properly while holding anything else. “He—Crispin—moved a runner near Dynamo. I moved the runner back. Dynamo did what Dynamo does. Nobody got kicked. I’m sorry it happened. It won’t again. Not without your say-so. Not at all, if you want. I told them Lovey and the fence and they wanted the big lad. I said no then, and I’m saying no now again, in case the walls missed it.”

Mrs. Pritchard’s eyes did a slow movement from Nate to the horses and back that had weighed out many men and not found them worth a handful of bran. “Don’t give me media,” she said, as if the word itself had broken a promise to her once. “Give me the sweepings and the feed and the schoolkids who think poo is a joke and then realise it’s a job. You’ve got a thing on the side now. That’s your business. Don’t make it mine.” She paused, assessing whether she needed to say more, and decided to throw him a penny. “You did right with him. He’ll never love you. That’s not what some animals are for. He’ll respect you if you keep not dying.”

“I’ve made that my brand,” Nate said, and she gave him the ghost of a grin, which meant they would behave as usual and complain about anything new.

Back home, the kitchen had donned its after-party face—glasses that didn’t belong to their cupboard, a ribbon pretending not to be attached to anything, the faint smell of cake like a rumour. Janine had tied her hair up with a pen because the ribbons had declared industrial action. The brown envelope was now white and had the council logo in the corner, and it sat on the table with a novelty mug on top of it like a flimsy paperweight guarding its own cousin. “Your father’s coming in twenty,” she said without preamble, and someone who didn’t know her would have missed the drama entirely. “With a hinge.”

“A hinge,” Nate repeated. There was a kind of relief in the word. Hinges were things that attached one solid object to another and allowed movement; they had laws. He could handle a hinge.

Lyla came down the stairs holding a bouquet that had been deconstructed by a sixteen-year-old monster who wanted to see how things worked; the lilies had been demoted to jam jars, the ferns had been conscripted into the potted basil and looked excited by the promotion. “I’m making a shrine,” she said. “It’s modern. It has mixed media. It will be studied by future generations in my art book. Also, there’s a man called Crispin calling me from a number with more numbers than seems legal. He wanted a quote. I gave him a quote. He did not enjoy my quote.”

“What did you say?” Janine asked, only mildly afraid.

“I told him if he wants an angle he can go stand on the stairs,” Lyla said. “He hung up, which was rude. If he rings back I’m charging per syllable.”

Paul Ellison arrived at eleven with the structure of someone who has practised not arriving and was learning it again. He held a toolbox that had belonged to his father and the metal handle had that shine tools get when hands have told them secrets for decades. He had, to everyone’s relief and vague disappointment, bought no more flowers. He did bring a packet of custard creams and a loaf of sliced bread in a bag from a shop that always smelt of floor cleaner and sugar. “You said hinge,” he said, and let his eyes land on the cupboard beneath the sink like a man meeting a rival he’d heard a lot about. “I can do hinge.”

Janine stood back like she would for anyone with a drill. “It’s on a slant,” she said. “Everything in this house is on a slant. It’s an attitude problem. Do what you can. If it goes wrong, the cupboard has been threatening to become a hole for years, so we may as well get the panic over with.” She looked at his hands, which moved like they remembered usefulness despite the intermission. He did the hinge in five minutes longer than a hero would have and ten minutes quicker than a fool. He swore once under his breath in the polite way of men who respect women in houses—no theatricals, no apologies, a little rhythm to help the screw recognise the hole.

Lyla watched from the doorway with her arms folded and her adolescent antennae listening for the sound of a promise. “Are you going to be weird,” she said to him directly. He supplied her with a couple of honest answers, which was more than she’d expected.

“I am going to try not to be,” he said. He put the screwdriver down with the gravity of a man unloading a weapon. “I will probably fail and then try again. You can call me out. I will attempt to take it.”

“Good,” she said, and returned a screwdriver to the box upside down, on purpose, because kindness is not the only test a person needs to pass. Janine poured tea and did not ask him if he took sugar because she remembered he didn’t; he pretended not to be surprised by her memory. They drank standing up because sitting down felt too ceremonial, and the hinge worked, and nobody mentioned that the cupboard door had closed easily for the first time in months.

Later, rehearsal began with the silent agreement that they would not discuss last night until their bodies had done something with it. Madi had already drawn a square on the floor with blue tape that meant you could not stand where the square was unless you had something to offer it. “We’re doing less,” she announced, as if this would be greeted with a parade. “You did plenty. I want less for this next piece. Less that reads like more. Everyone wants fireworks. Give me matches. The internet will hate it and then three smart people will love it and we will sleep fine.” She motioned them to the tape and they stepped in obediently, like apprentices who trust the sorcerer has thought this through.

“Excuse me,” came Crispin, which is how men like Crispin announce themselves when they want points for manners. “Two things. One is small, one is also small if you are flexible. The stream wants a micro-doc. We do you at the house, domestic, old photos if your mother will share, dad story toned to acceptable pathos, we get a quote from Mr. Ellison because he is back in the picture, we talk about forgiveness. Second, we partner you for a brand live on Saturday. No product in frame, just vibes. You two in front of a wall of trainers. It’s not an advert; it’s a conversation about movement. Think youth, think energy, think Milton on a bus.”

“No to the house,” Nate said, before the phrases had finished their attempt at being charming. The no felt like a coin he had polished. “No to dad stories on your camera. That’s mine. If he wants to tell anything, he can do it in his own kitchen and you can ask him for directions, which he will get wrong. We don’t make my mother tidy the living room for your pathos. Yes to the trainers if we can pick the wall, the time, and if the conversation isn’t about shoes. We’ll talk about floor. We like floor.”

Crispin twitched the way good salesmen twitch when a scheme needs to redraw itself. “We can do a corridor,” he offered. “No home. But surely… we don’t invent arcs; we just… follow them where they go.”

“If you call my mum’s council letter an arc,” Nate said, not angry, only done, “I’ll ask Dynamo to step on your brand new suede shoes. He’ll know where to put his hoof, he’s very precise. We’re dancing. Let us dance. After, if I want to be sad in public, I will. Today is not that day.”

Madi, who could not in good conscience do violence on behalf of her dancers but could in good conscience suggest it beautifully, stepped half a pace forward. “The little films we owe the stream are about the work,” she said. “You want tears, go to cinema. We’ll give you sweat. You’ll love it. Your mother will love it. The internet will complain, which means they will watch it three times.” She did the smile that had persuaded more than one money person to back slowly away and leave the artists to it.

Crispin raised his palms in agreeably defeated surrender and nodded as if he had planned to be told no as part of a long con. “Okay,” he said, “floor chat Saturday. I’ll text options. You two: not too clever. Clever is for critics. Real is for the people.” He moved on to bother the boy in the silver hoodie, who had started pretending to stretch as a decoy and got punished by an earnest lecture about authenticity and headwear.

When they were left to their square of tape and their section of air, Madi had them walk. Just that. Walk the square. “Everything is in the walk,” she said, a sentence every teacher says with a different kind of authority. “If your walk is honest, the trick lives in it. If your walk lies, I will see the lie in the turn.” Maya obeyed the instruction with visible impatience that refined under observation into something like grace. She had the walk of a girl who has been on the receiving end of boys’ attention and decided to direct it herself. Nate had a country walk that softened in a city and a stage walk that had learned not to apologise. They walked and then did not walk, which is to say they stilled themselves, and you could feel the shape of it for a long breath.

On a break, he stepped into the corridor that smelt of coffee and old carpet glue and called home, because his fingers needed the reassurance of his mother’s ring tone. Janine answered on the third ring and had bread in her mouth, which somehow made her greeting warmer. “The hinge holds,” she reported, before he could ask what was more important. “We have an email from the landlord’s agent with words like index and fair. Mrs. Khanna’s nephew says we can make a fuss and the fuss would be righteous. He offered to write words he calls templates. I’ve always liked a template. He also says council have a quiet pot for people on the edges. He said edges like it was a place you could visit. We’ll visit. For tonight, we’re all right. Your father has left and he took his toolbox and left the bread and he didn’t look round to see if I was watching because he is trying very hard. That’s enough domestic for this call. Go and pretend to be normal at work.”

“I am normal at work,” he said, smiling into the phone. “We’re walking. Madi says my walk better be honest. I’ll avoid my swagger because I haven’t got one.”

“Good,” she said. “Swagger breaks kettles. Bring me gossip later. I have stuck the banner at an angle and it is driving me wild. The house is testing me.”

Maya came back from her own call with her schoolbag still on her shoulder, which meant the phone had been with her father. “He said no to television,” she reported with a mix of relief and annoyance that adult children will understand forever. “He said we can do a photo. He asked me if he should buy a hat. I said yes because I want to be a person whose father owns a hat he didn’t need.” She sat on the floor with the kind of exhaustion that has a degree. “Also, I did an exam. It was about friction, irony intended. I will pass. I might rage between now and the passing.”

He lay down beside her and looked at the damp patches the ceiling had tried to repair after the last leak, like clouds had retired there and taken up plastering. “We will do less,” he said. “Less is a skill. My friend Jessa can smoke less. My mum can worry less. I can say no more and it counts as less of something.”

“You are being philosophical,” she said. “I like you with sleep. You should patent it.” She rolled on her side to face him, plait trailing a map on the floor. “Last night you did the panic catch and you didn’t make it look like a catch. I just want you to know I know, and I won’t tell anyone because I am kind, but I will weaponise it in a future argument.”

“I expect nothing less,” he said, and they went back to counting the ugly ceiling stains like constellations.

Saturday’s trainer wall experience played out like all branded events try to: too much sound, not enough air, a DJ with confidence like a health condition and a crowd made of teenagers and their more skeptical older siblings. The wall glittered with shoes that had price tags like threatening letters. They stood in front of it and did precisely what they had promised Crispin they would do—talked about floor. Maya did an excellent impression of a historian when she talked about lino versus wood, and Nate, asked by a boy in a fluorescent beanie which shoe made him dance better, said honestly, “the one I can forget I’m wearing,” and the manager, who had wanted him to say a particular number, sighed without hatred. Lyla filmed from a vantage point that made everybody’s jawlines look expensive and added captions that would make a university professor fight a child. When they were done, a kid asked for a selfie and then, because courage acts like a muscle, said, “My stepdad says dance is for swots. What should I tell him?” and Maya, without missing a count, said, “Tell him swots can do the splits,” and the kid said “sweet” with the triumph of a joke that counts as revenge.

That afternoon in the yard, ordinary paid Nate's balance. Lovey demanded he do a sign check on her feet and then pretended to be offended. Dynamo had a good day because the world had not given him anything brighter than it needed to. A girl of nine who’d been sent to learn not to fear large animals stood with her hands deep in her coat pockets and announced, like a newsreader, “I don’t like noses because they do breathing,” and Nate, because he too had sometimes suspected the nose of ulterior motives, showed her how to offer a palm and wait until the horse chose to bring the nose to the hand. The girl endured it the way children endure medicine that works and afterwards declared she was cured of noses and would like to ride a dragon next, something in the shovel-to-sky family.

That evening, Paul rang and sounded like a man calling from an empty room he was trying to make into a comfortable lie. “The man with the shoes called me,” he said. He never did names when names felt like alliances. “Asked if I wanted to talk about you. I told him I’m learning. I told him I won’t make our business belong to a man wearing jewellery on his wrist. He said he could blur things. I hung up on him because I have discovered I enjoy that.”

“Thank you,” Nate said, aware of the strange shock of pleasure delivered by an adult behaving like an adult when you aren’t expecting it. “I’m keeping the dancing for the dancing. You can keep the regrets for whatever they’re useful for. We’ll do a Sunday roast one day and you can apologise to potatoes.”

“I can do potatoes,” Paul said with the cautious pride of a man recalling his one specialty. “I can do gravy. I am still not coming to your house without warning. I’ll ring. I’ll see you next week. Don’t… break.” The line did the tiny crackle old lines do and then they were both released back into their respective rooms.

Anya implemented a plan she had, she claimed, stolen from a stern Russian woman in 1998. “We train outdoors,” she said on Monday, as the heating in the hall failed with an apologetic cough. “You think you know your balance, and then the grass says you don’t. Bring layers. If you fall, learn something on the way down.” They took their counts to the miserable heroism of a car park and then to the strip of municipal green with a wind that didn’t love them. The first two passes looked like outtakes from a documentary about deer learning to skate. By the third, Nate could feel his ankles telling him the truth about themselves, and Maya discovered her left foot, the one with a tendency to stage a union meeting at awkward times, liked dirt better than sprung floor. “I hate outside,” she announced into her scarf. “Outside can do one.”

“Outside is where the horses are,” he said, which was not an argument so much as a map.

By Wednesday, word had made its clumsy way around Milton in the way Milton did it—two barbershops, a WhatsApp group for parents who never slept, the vicar’s wife who pretended to hate gossip but relayed it with admirable fidelity. The pub had chalked Congratulations Stud! on the A-board with a little drawing that was either a horse or a man in an unfortunate hat. A boy with a BMX had added a moustache to the drawing while a barman watched and chose peace. The barbershop hummed with men who said they didn’t watch dance and then quoted back lines Maya had said about floor. Tariq split himself between work and showboating like a man with two lovers and pulled both off because overpromising to the day was his art. He whispered in Nate’s ear as he did his hair, “The phone has been a busy mother. Two new lads came in and asked for ‘the Stud,’ which is both offensive and satisfying. Look at me, coining a cut. I will retire with a cape.”

“Don’t retire,” Nate said, closing his eyes while the clippers did their kindly thunder. “Who will narrate my life?”

“I will record an audio guide you can play quietly on the bus,” Tariq said. “Press one for encouragement. Press two for roasting. Press three for a synopsis of the plot. By the way, Jessa is going to kill her boss. She won’t, because orange isn’t her colour, but she will write a letter and then read it out to weak men with clipboards. She told me to tell you to show your face at the youth club on Thursday and remind the children that dancing hasn’t gone out of fashion since TikTok. Don’t be late. She will set your shoe laces on fire.”

Thursday at the youth club, the flooring situation gave up on being a situation and was a problem. The hall was a rectangle whose sides had seen multiple generations of cheap chairs. The stereo was a veteran of the Falklands or behaved like one. The faces in front of him were that wonderful mixture of disdain and curiosity that only children and cats carry off with grace. Lyla had already inflated her importance by shouting, “Attention, peasants,” something Jessa allowed on the grounds of comedy value and because the kids took it as intended. Nate introduced a step so basic it felt like breathing and then complicated it until even the surliest boy admitted his limbs could learn new vocabulary if bribed with praise. A girl in hooped earrings did a little shoulder isolation that would have impressed Madi and then shrugged when the room applauded it like she was tired of being applauded for the obvious. Jessa watched from the doorway with her cigarette absent and her hands in pockets, and afterwards she gave him a nod that was loud enough to count as a speech.

“You’re good,” she said, outside, when they were walking back toward the trolley bay that had never once had any trolleys in it. “You are in the habit of being good without making people lick your shoes for it. Keep that. Also, my boss can eat bin fire. He told me if I want breaks I should stop drinking water. I told him I’ll stop drinking water when he stops needing oxygen. There will be a vote. I will pretend to play nicely. It will be sexy.”

“Don’t get sacked,” he said, knowing she would not take the instruction but liking the ritual of trying to save her from herself.

“I won’t,” she said. “He will. Or he will become softer. Pain does that to men when you apply it properly. I am an artist.” She stopped to watch a fox swagger along the low wall opposite like it owned the postcodes of two counties and they both felt the rightness of the fox existing near bins and miracles.

On Friday, the thing with Dynamo was small in the way panic is small when you catch it early. He was off, not wrong, but off, the way a favourite song sounds weird when someone you don’t like sings along. Nate noticed it in the shift of weight over the front right, the micro-stall that happens when an animal is arguing with pain but too proud to mention it. He called Mrs. Pritchard with the particular humility Lance Corporals use when addressing Generals and said, quietly, “I’m seeing something,” and she, without drama, ran her hands down a leg that had been made before cars and machines and too-bright lights and said, “Stone bruise or a fairy. Cold hose it. He’ll be swearing at you in an hour. If he’s still telling me fairy stories tomorrow, we’ll get the vet. Tell him I said he is not special and it’s good for him.” They did the cold hose, ten on, ten off, the kind of patient work that doesn’t look like devotion and is, and Dynamo took it like a civil rights violation and then began to relax under the logic of water. Nate stayed long after the hose had been put away and listened to the quiet talk of big animals settling.

His father texted, unprompted, that he had found a better brand of tea and that he intended to make Nate drink it as proof of his commitment to improved taste. “You can’t improve taste,” Nate wrote back, and then after a beat added, “Come by next Sunday if the kettle lets you. I will be home. You can meet my friend who smokes but not in the kitchen. We will not do feelings. We will do buns.” He regretted it and then didn’t; invitation had always been a muscle he avoided exercising for fear of dropping the weight.

There was talk, inevitably, on the internet about romantic tension. It had the tender, intrusive energy of aunties at weddings. Clips of the quiet part in their piece gained traction and the comments section decided it had invented softness. Maya forwarded him a screen grab of one speculative thread and captioned it with, “Do we sue?” and a picture of a gavel. He sent back a photo of Dynamo’s ear and wrote, “He says privacy is delicious.” They didn’t mention the thing you don’t mention when one of you is twenty-four and the other is eighteen and the air in between is complicated. They simply did the clean work and let the rest fuss in corners until it got tired.

On Saturday, which is when the city pretends to be a town because that’s easier on the purse, the Centre was full of fathers with buggies practising in public and teenagers who had learned how to occupy space as anointment. Crispin turned up in a shirt his mother would have described as cheerful and tried to convince their piece to be performed at noon in a shop window “for the people,” and Madi said, flat, “Our people can buy tickets like anyone else,” and then bought a pretzel with his company card and told them to take an hour for themselves. They sat on the steps by the fake lake and watched the fake ducks pretend to be above it all. Maya put her chin on her knees and said, “If I pass physics I will invent a new type of regret that doesn’t sting and market it to poets,” and he said, “I will sell you to poets,” and she said, “I am too expensive,” and they experienced the kind of quiet that is usually reserved for churches.

Sunday afternoon arrived the way Sundays do, with a funny sort of mercy that doesn’t last the night. Paul showed up on time, carrying the tea and the kind of expression men wear when they have memorised the steps to a dance and intend to perform them without improvising. He had bought scones. He had not tried to bake. He took his shoes off at the door, delighting Janine and derailing her planned joke. Jessa came by with an excuse about borrowing a book and stayed to audition him gently. She said, “Do you believe in unions?” with the energy of a woman checking if a man is a vegetarian before she serves him a steak and when he said, “I do now, after a man with a clipboard told me I couldn’t use the toilet at a motorway depot,” she granted him the right to eat the jam without commentary. They did not do feelings. They did buns. They did tea taste testing like children in a science segment. Lyla filmed none of it because she had a divine sense of when to act like a door, not a window. When he left, he put his hand on the hinge of the front door in a very silly symbolic gesture, rolled his eyes at himself, and said, “It holds,” and Janine, by way of a benediction, said, “For now,” and then closed the door with a softness that told the house it would be consulted next time.

Monday’s rehearsal was the best kind of boring, the kind of afternoon that disappears in the doing and leaves you with muscles that are grateful for instruction. Madi gave them notes that were less than sentences. “Lift: exhale,” she said. “Ending: don’t present it like a birthday cake.” Anya, from the back, offered silence, which was praise in her dialect. They left early enough for coffee that did not taste like disappointment and sat in a cafe that had assaulted the walls with plants until the oxygen had improved. Maya, mid-sip, asked, “Do you think you’ll teach?” without adding anytime soon or when your knee starts misbehaving like an old Labrador.

“I might,” he said. “There’s a peace in telling someone what to do with their feet and then watching the lightbulb. It’s like mucking out. You can see the beginning and the end of a job. You feel taller inside your skin. But I don’t want to teach because I’m scared of failing at the other thing. I want to teach because the other thing is generous enough to be shared.”

“Look at you,” she said, mock-wiping at her eyes with her sleeve. “Poetry. People will think you’re insufferable. I will tell them you are. They’ll love you more.” Her phone buzzed and she looked at it and frowned. “That man again. The one who wants to interview my ankle. I’m going to block him and then unblock him out of curiosity and then block him again. Entertainment is a circle.”

He walked her to the bus and leaned on the shelter that had caught more confessions than a confessional. The bus pulled in with that roar buses use to tell you they are bigger than your life, and she got on and turned back and did the ridiculous bow he pretended not to recognise, and then the bus left, and he stood with the discarded feeling that follows good company like a sensible dog.

On the way home he took the long cut through the little triangle of trees that made believe it was a wood and met Mr. Clancy leaning on a fence with an air of having leaned there before roads. “There’s talk,” Mr. Clancy said, which was a statement, not an invitation. “About your father. About this and that. Men in pubs who hold forth. Don't listen to men who hold forth. They’re only practicing their voices because they never got to sing.” He spat with elegance and then offered Nate a peppermint in a way that implied he was giving him secrets. “Keep your hands soft,” he added. “Animals mostly talk in hands.”

At home, the council letter had reproduced into an appointment. Mrs. Khanna’s nephew had emailed PDFs with titles like Unexpected Outcomes and Precise Words That Make People in Offices Sit Down. Janine had found a pen that preferred blue and was writing in a list that contained the headings bread, rent, feelings, in that order. She looked up when Nate came in like a lighthouse acknowledging a returning boat and made room for him in the kitchen light with the ease of a person who had practised welcoming. “Tomorrow,” she said, tapping the word on the page with the pen. “We will go to the office and I will make my voice do its thing. You will come and sit and breathe and look tall and responsible. Then you will run off at the last minute to dance if you must, and I will tell them the truth which is that you belong in more than one place. They will hate that. It’s not efficient. It is, however, true.”

He nodded, felt the stretch in his neck like a story being told, and went to the sink because washing up had always been the way he asked the day if it had any last words. The plate was warm under his fingers and he thought, as he sometimes did when the ordinary made itself important, that if someone had told him a year ago this would be what it would feel like to be in the middle of something, he would have laughed and called them ambitious for him and therefore to be avoided. He finished the mug, turned it upside down on the drying rack with its little collection of upside-down things, and thought, with a clarity that felt rented but generous, about counts and edges. Tomorrow, he would walk into a room where someone would say no to him and he would ask them to say it again with more honesty. Tomorrow, he would bargain for the right to live in the same rooms in which he had been made. Tomorrow, he would catch Maya mid-air and change the count again by the thickness of a hair.

He went to bed with the kind of tired that had dignity. Before sleep took him without fuss, he looked at his ceiling and considered the twenty-year-old cracks that had told his teenage self to be braver and found them in a kinder light. The house shifted the way old houses do when they remember stories they won’t repeat. In the yard, Lovey dreamt from one foot and then the other, and Dynamo, resentful even in sleep, refused to forget the hose. In several pockets of the city, people who had clapped last night remembered their hands and smiled with them. On a phone on a bedside table, south of his, a girl with plaits sent a text that read, tomorrow we fight a camera and a bureaucrat, wear your lucky socks, and he wrote back, I have only lucky socks now, and then the night turned its face toward the corner of the room and allowed them rest.The council building had the kind of carpet that taught your shoes to whisper. It was a colour invented to make the idea of colour seem unreasonable, and there were posters over the radiator about compost and community that had faded into their own optimism. Janine walked in with her voice tied back and her bag full of proofs the way a magician carries scarves—plentiful and ready. She had ironed the edge of a letter and it had succumbed. Nate walked beside her carrying height and a folder with his name on the tab, the kind of folder that grants you ten per cent more authority simply by existing. He had put on the jacket that pretended to be formal and succeeded only in looking like a man who owned a formal jacket. He took a breath as they crossed the threshold because buildings like this liked to take the air out of your lungs and tell you they were keeping it for the responsible people.

Mrs. Khanna’s nephew had furnished Janine with a packet of words called templates and a pep talk that included a flow chart and a joke about bins that might have been funnier to a different family. Janine had highlighted the sentences that made clerks put their pens down and listen, and her pen had highlighted them again as if they might run off if not sufficiently fluorescent. The receptionist was a woman with hair that defied gravity and glasses that suggested she knew the end of every story before it began. “Name?” she asked, and Janine gave it with the crisp of someone who has practice at not being mislabelled. They sat on the plastic chairs that made everyone the same height and watched as numbers marched up on a screen with no interest in context.

When their number was called, they went through a door into an office that had decided potted plants could atone for fluorescent lights. The man behind the desk had a tie that was a few inches more optimistic than his posture. A little plaque said GRAHAM BAIN in letters that had resigned themselves to being read by people who would forget them immediately. Graham smiled in that scrupulous way of people who have been taught to leaven process with kindness. “Mrs. Ellison, Mr. Ellison,” he said, with a glance at their faces like a mourner checking the hymn sheet. “Tell me what’s happened and then tell me the bit you left out when you practiced at home.”

Janine’s smile was for herself, which was safer. “It’s the rent,” she said. “It decided to grow. The sum and the audacity. We can pay what we’ve been paying. We can nearly pay more if we do maths with fewer biscuits. The letter says index and review and expectation. I brought copies of everything including the breakfast we didn’t eat.”

Graham looked at the copies. He looked at the letter from the landlord’s agent that had tried to sound apologetic and had achieved only a sort of polite pounce. He looked at the template phrases and nodded in the way men nod when women have brought in the right weapons. He looked at Nate and did that thing bureaucrats with empathy sometimes do where they ask the right question in the wrong voice. “And you, sir,” he said, as if he were meeting a ship, “what do you… what is your regular?”

“I work at a yard,” Nate said, because truth sounded humble and he hadn’t brought his actress today. “Horses. Three mornings. Sometimes more. I dance. It isn’t regular, except it is, like weather is regular. This month there’s a show. There’s a bag of money in the corner of the room labelled maybe. That bit will be a one-off and not a guarantee. I can be responsible for the mornings and the afternoons. The evenings are variable.”

Graham’s tie performed the trick of looking like a man nodding. He typed the sort of typing that makes other people nervous. “There are pots,” he said, as if confessing that his house had a secret space under the stairs. “We call them discretionary, which means we’ll ask nosy questions and you will sigh and then we will be able to help until we can’t. There’s also a fair use conversation with the landlord about the index they’ve chosen and whether it applies to your lease or to a general sense of the economy. We can write that letter for you and sign it as if we invented the word fair this morning. Mrs. Ellison, I see you have already drafted something that looks very much like what I would write if I were at home and cross.” He slid the paper toward himself and blinked at the accuracy. “You can use my signature as a garnish.”

“Thank you,” Janine said, letting relief go through her without knocking anything over on the way. “We like garnish.”

“We’ll freeze the increase while the right people argue,” Graham added. “Four weeks, possibly eight if we get lucky with daylight. Bring me wage slips, and that bit of the internet that proves you did the performance, because the powers like to see you doing something that looks like ambition in a hat. Bring me your tenancy, which I assume you have memorised, and something with numbers on it that made you cry last night. I will email Mrs. Khanna’s nephew because anyone with a nephew who can explain an index to his aunt is a friend in this building even if he doesn’t know it yet.”

They signed in the boxes that declare you real on paper. Janine used her pen with the ruthlessness of someone winning a board game quietly. Nate signed his name in the way he signed it at the stables when he agreed not to die on the premises. Graham shook their hands like a man who had decided to make his desk temporarily a place where things happen. He said, “You’ll hear a lot of no that sounds like maybe and a lot of maybe that sounds like no. I will translate. Also, my daughter saw you last night,” he added, turning his tie into a parent, “and cried for two whole minutes and then decided to berate me about the fact that she wasn’t born with better ankles. So, thank you for that.”

Outside, the air felt like a reasonable document. Janine’s shoulders had dropped into the degree of descent that meant her body had accepted that it did not have to fight the entire building single-handed. She held the strap of her bag and, because nobody important was listening, allowed herself a half-grin. “He was a good one,” she said. “Not good as in saint, good as in does his job and doesn’t make me bite him.”

“He had a tie,” Nate said, and she nodded, filing it. They stood under a piece of municipal art that had been welded to be profound and decided it could wait to be interpreted. Janine looked at her watch, which did not believe in style, and said, “Go on then. Fight your camera. My voice can carry me to the bus. Text me after. I will be at the table with my friend template and my enemy the brown envelope.”

The floor conversation had been allotted nineteen minutes in a corridor with a wall the exact shade of biscuit nobody ever chooses first. The camera was a kind boy with shoulders that had learned not to take up too much space. The sound woman had hair like a rainforest and the face of a person who has forgiven a lot of doors. Crispin had ceded the role of lion tamer to a junior producer whose excitement was so sincere it managed to cancel out ninety per cent of the manipulation in the pitch. “We want to talk about your surfaces,” she said, holding a clipboard that had never borne any nonsense. “Where your feet meet the day. The metaphor will do the heavy lifting. We’ll keep you on your good side.”

“I only have one side,” Nate said. “It’s in discussions with my other side.” He and Maya stood where the tape told them to stand and immediately shuffled an inch to account for where their bodies preferred to be. These were the small negotiations that made things honest. He looked down at the floor as if it were a person he was about to quote.

“Floor is the first partner,” Maya said into the friendly darkness of the lens, because she had filed away a sentence that made sense and was bringing it out like a good cake. “If the floor is lying, nothing else can be true. You can tell when a floor has been cared for because you feel like you’re not going to be punished for trusting it. Wood talks. Lino whispers. Concrete judges you and then forgives you if you apologise properly. Grass hates you and then teaches your ankles lessons you didn’t consent to.”

“Shoes are the lie you willingly tell,” Nate added. “You wear the lie that lets you forget your feet until the moment you need to remember them. The day I realised a good shoe is the one you forget was the day my dancing stopped trying to be clever and started trying to be kind. I still fall. Everyone falls. The floor catches you or it tells you exactly why it didn’t. That’s useful. You can work with useful.”

The camera breathed. The boy holding it nodded a little, which is always a good sign. The sound woman’s rainforest hair wrote notes in the air. The junior producer mouthed we love it with the genuine fervour of a convert. Crispin lurked with his impossible smile and kept his hands largely out of the frame, perhaps because he had been told a story that morning about a runner and a horse, and the moral had been very clear and very muddy.

After, Maya’s phone chimed like a polite bell. She looked and then made an expression like someone trying not to show their working. “Physics,” she said, flat with triumph. “Two marks under the best and six above the disaster my brother suggested I was heading for. Dad bought a hat,” she added, apropos of nothing in particular, except that human success is often celebrated with something that doesn’t fit. “It is not the correct hat. He bought a hat for a man who thinks jazz is an alternative to therapy. He is very pleased. He will wear it to the show and Anya will make a noise like a kettle and then relate breathing exercises to hats. It will be perfect.”

Anya made her kettle-noise that afternoon pre-emptively, which was efficient. “Hats are an attitude,” she said, without being asked. “They should be worn by heads that understand chairs. Children, today we reduce again. Less legs. Less everything. We practice leaving the stage without apologising to it. Do not bow to anyone who hasn’t paid you. That includes me.”

Madi’s less turned out to be a kind of more that discouraged showing off not because showing off is bad but because showing off is easy. She stood in front of them with her clipboard tucked under her arm and spoke quietly until the room had to lean in to listen. “The piece is going to begin with you walking,” she said, as if unveiling a miracle. “Then it will continue with you listening. The trick is to let people believe they are watching while you are busy listening. On minute two we will show them one thing that they cannot do and then politely refuse to explain it. The internet will riot and three impressive people who go to bed early will send me messages about breath. I will pretend I don’t like being told I’m right and then sleep better.”

The less had an honesty that scared Nate a little in the good way. When you strip back the cleverness you have to stand in the middle of the thing being yourself, which is exactly the sort of trick the cleverness was invented to avoid. He found the count for his steps inside the beat of his breathing and left the rest to behave. Maya discovered that her body had a quieter grammar that could be as rude as her loud one. Anya watched and pinched the bridge of her nose, which is how she told them she approved.

Between all that honesty, life persisted with its messy measure. Jessa won a little war at the depot by standing very close to a table and explaining to it why breaks are not a garnish. “We had a vote,” she told Nate on the phone as she walked home past the allotments like a general out for a smoke. “The clipboard did not like democracy but he didn’t set it on fire. We have ten minutes. Twenty on a Friday. We have the right to drink water when our throats decide to behave like throats. I will write a poem about this and then turn it into a threat.”

“Please don’t threaten them with poetry,” he said, knowing she would and it would work.

At the yard, the stone fairy left Dynamo’s foot as if it had been dared to stay and had thought better of it. Mrs. Pritchard, after twenty-four hours of telling the bruise to mind its manners, allowed a half sentence of satisfaction. “You found it quick,” she said, which was praise even if the tone sounded like the underside of a shovel. “He was being dramatic for a reason. If he does it again, we get the man with the truck and your bank account will cry. Until then, water and the way you talk at him like he is the only living being with opinions. It suits him.” Nate stood with his palm on the slope of the horse’s neck and felt the big pulse doing the old work of being alive. He breathed the way you do when you are public with an animal who remembers the last time you got it wrong and forgave you anyway.

Paul sent a photo of the hat, which was indeed a statement about jazz and poor decisions. He had set it on the arm of a chair like he was breaking the news gently. “Be kind,” the text said, which was both a request and a boast. Nate sent back a picture of the horse’s ear, because that had become his shorthand for privacy, and typed, “Kindness requires a context. Bring cake.” Paul replied that he could bring potatoes masquerading as cake and Nate allowed him this one sin because he had learned that adults are simply taller children trying not to knock over glassware.

Crispin, arguably chastened, redirected his appetites towards the boy in the silver hoodie, whose mother turned out to have a voice like a chainsaw that could cut through red tape and insincerity. He also made serious eyes at the woman in the red dress and was sent away with a paragraph about art that started in French and ended in a swear that did not require translation. He hovered at the edges of Nate’s day like a weather app told there is no rain and still hoping for headlines. Nate found the pleasure in saying small yeses that cost him nothing and big nos that kept the house from becoming a set.

On the Thursday when everything felt too possible, Maya’s brother arrived at rehearsal trailing an air of being unimpressed by anything that couldn’t be fitted into a meme. He looked at Nate, looked at the floor, looked at the mirror, and then nodded to himself like someone who had decided to give a restaurant a second chance. “You’re tall,” he announced, as if entering data into the public record. “That helps.”

“It does not always,” Maya said, without turning her head. She was mid-stretch and had turned stretching into a statement about confidence. “Tall falls further. Introduce yourself like a polite person.”

“Arjun,” he said. He shook Nate’s hand and did the teenage trick of evaluating a man while appearing to be too bored to evaluate anything. “If you hurt my sister I will post your worst angles.”

“That’s a lot of angles,” Nate said. “You will be up late.”

Arjun considered this for a second and then said to Maya, “He’s all right,” like he’d been appointed to governance. He sat at the back with a packet of crisps and an attitude and clapped at precisely the moments his face said he wouldn’t. Anya let him exist because he was good at keeping his feet out of the way and bad at pretending to be superior to sincerity.

The day of the stream rehearsal for their less piece arrived with a sky that had chosen one grey and married it for life. The stage didn’t know how to behave for less; it wanted to do lights like an apology. Madi stood in the centre with her thermos and told the lighting operator a bedtime story about restraint. “You will not blind my dancers,” she said, voice mild and carrying. “You will put light where they are and let it sit like a cat. If the light goes for a walk without permission I will take its batteries out and give them to the bar.”

They did the walk and the listen and the one impossible thing that belonged to them, and the camera did what respectful cameras do when offered something that does not shout: it crept closer on a good lens and paid attention. Afterwards, in the room where snacks go to fail, a junior exec with a haircut that had cost too much declared that subtlety was a risk and then found himself agreeing fervently with his own nervousness when Madi smiled a way that said he could trust the person in charge or lose his budget. “People will adjust,” she said, like a weather report. “They’ll pretend they discovered nuance this afternoon. Then they will show their mums.”

At home, the kitchen table had become a war room. The pile of papers had been subjugated into three neat stacks. Janine had lines in her forehead you could plant crops in. She wielded a phrase from the template like a sabre and played with different tones of voice to see which one made the cat from next door jump. “We will say financial hardship and necessary,” she declared to the teapot. “We will say risk and community and long-term. We will say tenant of good standing and we will refrain from adding ‘with beautiful son’ although I want to, on moral grounds.”

“Graham said four weeks,” Nate said, bringing her a mug of something that purported to be chamomile and smelled like a clever hedge. “We can make four weeks into six if we call it a process.”

“I can make anything into six weeks with the correct adjectives,” she said. “We are all right today. Stop looking at me like you need to anchor me. I am an anchor.”

Lyla was making a zine on the floor that would be illegal in six countries and very popular in a seventh. She had titled it The House That Would Not Move and was cutting out pictures of kettles and shoes. “We’re going to sell this at your next thing,” she informed him, scissor-waving. “We’re going to call it merch and make thirty-seven pounds and then donate it to Mrs. Khanna’s nephew because I like how he emailed back, like a person.”

“Do not sell anything without a charmingly incorrect QR code,” Janine said without looking up. “People love a chase.”

On Friday, the man from the brand with the wall of trainers sent a basket of fruit that had been arranged by someone who identified as a stylist first and a farmer fourth. The bananas had been convinced to sit at an angle that made them look coy. Maya took one and ate it out of spite. “We’re not endorsing,” she said, through banana. “We are endorsing floor. If anyone asks I endorse gravity. And soup.”

Mr. Clancy was at the fence again with a peppermint and an unsolicited thought. “I watched your thing,” he announced, as if the internet were a field he occasionally grazed in. “My niece showed me on her phone. You looked like you were going to fall and then not. That’s proper. No one wants to watch a man who thinks he’s got a contract with standing upright.”

“That’s my entire technique,” Nate said. He took the peppermint and felt its ridiculous freshness clean his mouth in a way bureaucracy never could. Dynamo chose that moment to sneeze on his sleeve like an elder statesman condemning modernity, and Mr. Clancy nodded as if the horse had underlined his point.

On the way to the hall that afternoon he passed the pub with the A-board, and someone had changed the chalk to read LESS IS MORE, STUD and added a doodle of a fox wearing a hat that looked suspiciously like Paul’s. He took a photo and sent it to his father with the caption your influence is corrosive, and Paul sent back a photo of a potato and wrote culture, and it was fine because sometimes love sounds exactly like nonsense.

Nate and Maya spent the last half-hour of rehearsal on the thing that had almost come off their hands the day before. It was a turning catch that required a very specific faith in the laws of physics not to suddenly decide to revise themselves for sport. They tried it once and it went, witless and obedient. They tried it again and Maya’s weight did that tiny surprise that comes with human bodies even when they are clear on their intentions. He compensated, the way you do when dancing with weather, and corrected with his hips rather than his shoulders so the correction didn’t become a label. Madi clapped once and said, “You earned it,” and Anya did not interrupt the praise, which was its own fact.

They walked out of the hall under the evening that hadn’t decided whether to be pink or efficient. In the little triangle of trees the air held a smell like cold bread and not much else. Maya linked her arm through his for half a dozen steps and then let go not because she needed to but because letting go was part of the trick. “I’m not scared,” she said, almost surprised and more amused than anything else. “I thought I would be scared every time and instead I am a machine with a slot for fear and it eats coins.”

“I used to save fear like pocket change,” he said. “Put it in a jar. Then I spilt it and realised I liked the sound.” They stood by the bus stop where the glass had been cleaned to within an inch of its usefulness and watched a man hurry across the road carrying a cake without a box, the purest kind of risk. “Tomorrow the man with the ongoing haircut will ask us to do a thing in the foyer with a boom mic and we will say no with smiles and make ourselves tea.”

“Tomorrow the internet will say we’re in love,” Maya said, cheerful because she knew facts and how to use them. “We will say that we are not and that you are married to floor and I am married to soup, and someone will draw a cartoon of you with a spoon. It will be unflattering. I will keep it for my wall.”

“Tomorrow my mother will make something with tinned tomatoes and defiance,” he said. “My father will put the hat on at the wrong angle. Jessa will send me a picture of an ashtray she didn’t use and proclaim herself a saint. Tariq will tell a man that the shape of his head reminds him of a good story and then charge him extra for the narrative. Anya will disapprove of everything and be secretly proud. Mr. Clancy will have a peppermint. Dynamo will regard us all with horror.”

“And we will do less,” she said. “We will do so much less it will be rude.” She got on the bus and found a seat and made the face she made when she was about to laugh and didn’t because the driver deserved peace. She sent him a message before the bus pulled off: soup > floor, fight me, and the little typing dots on his screen were like applause he could keep in his pocket.

He walked the long way back to the house so the evening could put its hand on his shoulder and ask nothing. At home, the banner had been straightened and his mother had written the word grace on a sticky note and put it on the kettle, which was both on the nose and perfectly sensible. Lyla had found a new shade of glitter that got into your thoughts. The hinge held. The house did not make any grand claims and he did not demand any from it. He slept without rehearsing his lines for morning and dreamed he was a drum someone had put their ear to and called it music.
