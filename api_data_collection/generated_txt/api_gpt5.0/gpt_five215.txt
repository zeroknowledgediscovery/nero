On a damp Tuesday in St Helens, with the glassworks chimneys drawing their slow black chalk across the sky, Leonard Fairbrooke decided to sell his soul. He was not altogether certain what that entailed—what window one rapped upon, what office hours applied—but he felt sure, in the muzzy certainty that visits a man at twenty-eight when the money is going and his father is gone, that something decisive ought to be done. The town had a way of making decisions for people: it began with soot in the cuffs and ended with a cough; it began with one small lie and ended with a ledger full of them. Leonard had tried diligence. He’d tried late nights and early mornings and that polite prayer-bead mumble (Our Father, forgive me, forgive me). He had tried his father’s manner in the glassworks yard: a quick pat to the shoulders, a joke to the furnace-men, as if the heat that roared inside those mouths were nothing at all.

None of it held. Not for him.

He walked the length of Harris Street and passed the shuttered stalls and the coal carts’ stiff wood creak. The town rose in little bursts: a cluster of row houses here, a faint hint of the moor beyond, the church stabbing like a needle. Women in shawls hefted strings of leeks and gossip. The day smelled of ash and onions. He loved it, to his own annoyance. He loved even the slant of the windows with their wavering glass that betrayed too eager hands somewhere in Pilgrim & Gant’s, or Hartley’s next door, one furnace too hot, one toucher too bold. It was a town built of the imperfect and the heat-cured, a town of flux and grit.

Leonard tugged his gloves off and tucked them into his hat. “If you’re going to do it,” he told himself under his breath, “do it before dinner.” A vow timed by roast carrots. He laughed once, a short bark that startled a passing dray horse, then checked his watch. Half twelve.

The Devil, he had it on good authority—a man in a corner of The Raven and Wheel with a navy scarf and a taste for goose-fat on toast—kept frequented rooms. “Not churches,” the man had said, mock-wise. “Why would he? He’s better bred than that. He walks where aging wood is held together by interest, not by nails. Where a debt is a prayer.” The man tapped Leonard’s elbow, a sign of fraternity, and added: “Counting houses, primarily. Or the alcoves at the Grand.”

The Grand Hotel had been built with the money of men who wanted to be looked at while insisting they hated the attention. Its facade was cream-coloured stucco, its dome was laughably eastern, the drawing rooms were over-warmed even in November. Leonard had known it since boyhood as the place where his father might take a visiting supplier to be impressed by the town’s modernization: look at us, a raw city wearing its opera gloves.

The Grand’s alcove was the one beneath the painting of a lady in saffron leaning into a breeze that had been painted with too much gusto. That was where the Devil was not, when Leonard arrived, which made everything easier and harder at once.

“Mr. Fairbrooke,” said the manager—a thin man with a moustache that seemed to carry itself—“welcome. Will you be wanting luncheon?”

“No,” Leonard said, “no thank you. Just a chair, and one of those newspapers, if you don’t mind.”

“Very good, sir.”

He sat in the alcove. He pretended to read. He watched. Men in black coats spoke in murmurs like bees trapped in a curtain hem. A woman in a gown of very poor taste (lace like nettles) laughed and laughed and then stopped at once when the man beside her did not. A wind ribboned the street outside and found its way through the vestibule and the foyer and across Leonard’s knuckles. He thought of his father’s glove-friendly hand, the slight web of coal-dust in the lines, the way he looked when he was leaving for London—tired, half disgusted at having to go to London at all, always returning with London coffee and London shoes and London rumours.

You ought to have been kinder, Leonard thought, and could not tell to whom that was addressed.

At two o’clock, Mr. Swithin Lyall took the chair opposite unasked.

“Forgive me,” said Mr. Lyall. “I always prefer to injure a social moment before it injures me.”

Leonard tried to smile. “You are not injuring anything, Mr. Lyall.”

“Plain Swithin will do,” said the tutor, although he always smiled at the formality of hearing his forename. He was a man like a paperknife—slim and useful and slightly dangerous if pressed to it—and everything about him had a practiced exactness, from the ink on his fingers to the slight chalk crumb in the folds of his jacket. He taught the sons of men with three chimneys and the daughters of men who wished their daughters to be sons, Latin and Greek and the proper heft of a sentence. Only three months ago he had begun to come to the Fairbrooke house of an evening to sit with Leonard, to review accounts and debate lines in Marcus Aurelius, and to drink the tea Martha brewed and call it medicine.

“You’re far from the study,” Leonard said.

“Am I? I thought to find you exactly here,” said Lyall. “I read the day’s weather and the town’s moods and deduced that a man with a bent toward theatrical action would prefer to suffer under a painting that tells its tale too loudly. That woman in saffron—she is trying to eat the wind.”

“You have your ways,” said Leonard. He turned the paper and looked at nothing. “Would you care to advise me, as usual?”

“If I do,” Lyall said softly, “you will not take it.”

“Then I shall take it,” said Leonard. “I’ve been saving up obedience for a holiday.”

“Go home,” said Lyall. “Go home and read something that wants nothing from you. You are a son. That’s enough labour for a week.”

Leonard looked beyond him, past the ferns in blue jars and the men in their dark coats. “I’m selling my soul,” he said. His voice did not wobble. He was proud of that, foolishly.

“Pardon?” said Lyall.

“You’ve heard,” Leonard said, “men have done it. Bargaining with a—well. It seems efficient. I require a set of qualities quickly. I will pay for them later. We always pay later.”

Lyall watched him. What passed across his face was not shock, and not contempt. Mild dread, perhaps, the kind that arrives when a pupil tries a gambit on the stage of his own heart. “It is a devil’s economy,” he said, “and you’re too honest an accountant to come out even.”

“Honest? I’m the wrong shape for the room,” Leonard said too quickly. “The town looks through me. Men only nod because they knew my father. Women do not look at all. I am, I have found, impossible to love at length.”

“That is very dramatic for half past two,” Lyall said. “You are a cataloguer at heart. Do not go building a tragedy out of a few harmless notations.”

“A few notations. It feels like an inventory with nothing in the store-room,” Leonard said. “Mr. Lyall—Swithin—if there were a commission to be paid, I would pay it. I want competence. I want to wake, and find that the forward step is not unsteady. I want to set my name to something and not feel the blank skip in my chest after.”

Lyall leaned back and examined the smoke rings of the men at the next table. “When a man says competence,” he murmured, “he means love. When a man says love, he means sleep. We are very simple. You want sleep, Leonard. You want the noise to stop.”

Someone laughed. A waiter dropped a fork and apologized to it. Outside the windows, a tram car bell dinged with unembarrassed vigour. Leonard’s fingers went cold; the wind again, perhaps, or some new offshore drought inside him.

“I am going to find him,” Leonard said.

Lyall’s mouth went like a small dash. “I would be dull company if I tried to stop you. The dullest. I will say only that bargains with men you do not properly know tend to end as badly as bargains with gods. Let me walk with you, if you must go. Let me do that extremely neutral thing.”

Leonard nodded, grateful and not wanting to be.

They walked. Outside, St Helens had decided to brighten—almost a malicious light, they both thought privately, as if a woman had opened a window to let an argument into the sun. The chimneys had ceased to draw such straight lines and were softening into gray’s many relatives. Shops with names like Bright’s Bakery and Minerva Drapery flattered themselves with fresh-painted signs.

“Who first told you it was possible?” Lyall asked as they went along Westfield Street toward the canal.

“A man,” Leonard said. “At The Raven and Wheel. The navy scarf. He had a voice like two gently clashing coins. He said it was simple if you were simple enough. He said I had the set of a man who could be led by the ear.”

“I see,” said Lyall.

“And Elias Sugg, you know him, the runner we see sometimes, he said there was someone in the counting house above Peartree Lane who writes exactly the contracts that idle men require.”

“Ah,” said Lyall, “Mr. Sugg. A mouth full of rumours and the appetite to match.”

They turned onto Peartree Lane. The counting house above it was taller than it seemed from the street. You could see it if you craned: a window with a limp curtain, the suggestion of a fireplace, four chairs. Not quite an office, more a box that wished to be. If you were a stove and thought you might someday be a fireplace, this is where you would be stored in your imagining.

A man sat on the steps wringing his hat as if he had caught it trying to outrun him. He looked from Leonard to Lyall and away.

“Do you know,” Leonard murmured, “there’s a whisper that a train was robbed last week. Near Rainhill. They say the train slowed of its own accord—no one knows why the signal turned—and men stepped on like performers and stepped off with a bag of things nobody is listing in the paper.”

“I heard,” said Lyall. “I hear everything that is said with half a mind.”

“Do you believe it?”

“I do not find the world obliging my credulity,” said Lyall. “If it happened, it happened. If it did not, it will soon enough.”

They went up. At the back of the narrow hall a door stood ajar. This was not, strictly speaking, an invitation. It was, more properly, a trick of old hinges. Leonard put a hand to the door and pushed.

Inside, a woman in a velvet dress and a man with a red scarf were speaking softly, the way you talk to a dog that might bite. The woman looked rich by fuss, not by blood. The man’s scarf was handsome and improper, like a carnival on a straight street. He turned and when he saw Leonard his eyes took the room and folded it a little.

“Mr. Fairbrooke,” he said. “Do come in. We had wondered why the day felt unfinished.”

“Do you know everyone,” Lyall murmured to him, subtitles to facts.

“What a question,” said the scarfed man without being addressed. “I know enough. Mrs. Danae is just leaving. Mrs. Danae? Do go ahead with that second thought we were trying to discourage. Lovely. Mr. Fairbrooke. And this gentleman is—”

“Swithin Lyall,” Lyall said.

“The tutor who bets little and earns much,” said the scarfed man. “Welcome. Will you have a seat, or would you rather posture for a bit first? It’s all the rage. Men like to posture when a leap is near.”

Leonard sat because standing seemed like a boast. Lyall remained standing because sitting seemed like a consent.

“You are the Devil,” Leonard said, not quite asking. It sounded absurd and it sounded correct, like a child’s attempt that turns out to be the truth by accident.

“I am a clerk,” said the man. “I have a knack for papers. I make sure each paragraph says what it is about. Those who speak carelessly send me their careless words and I return their meaning to them with a ribbon on it. I am a servant of all exactness. That is a useful devilment. Names are a matter of country. In Poland I was Mr. Sixpence. In Naples, the Only Lawyer. In Leghorn, a cough. Here, call me Mr. North.”

“Mr. North,” said Leonard.

Lyall’s hand on the back of Leonard’s chair was not possessive. It was present, like a metaphor waiting its turn.

“What do you want?” Mr. North asked brightly. “Not all men know. Some men want the end of their wanting, and that at least is honest if impossible.”

“I want to be—” Leonard began, and then stopped because he had gathered a list he could not easily hold. “Better,” he said finally. “To be sufficient. To be what my father expected when he expected anything. I want to do things without the small strain of failing early. I want to have a room of men and feel that I have something to say.”

“Hm,” said Mr. North. “And you will give what.”

“Whatever is customary,” Leonard said. “I am not a collector of old phrases. If it must be my soul, I have read that this is the exchange.”

Lyall turned his head the way a bird does, and did not speak.

Mr. North folded his scarf with two fingers, the way you fold a thought. “There is a great deal of misunderstanding about souls. You think of it as a coin. You think of it as a pearl. In my experience they are more like panes of glass. In most men, slightly occluded by soot. In some women, so clear that everything seen through them hurts the seer. One cannot hold a pane of glass easily. It is either in place or it is broken. Give me your glass, Mr. Fairbrooke, and I will put it in another frame for a while. When you are ready for a different view, you may come get it. Or not. Either way.”

“What is the price,” Leonard said. His hands did not know where to be and so became a fist and then not a fist.

“Is it not enough to say the price is the price?” Mr. North said, not unkindly tired. “A small coin daily. A moment in which you would have loved and instead you will be clever. A minute taken from sleep and given to worrying about the precise right word—finding it, too, which is worse. A day when you would have forgiven a small thing and instead you will remember it so you may retell it and be admired. And then, when you die, perhaps do not die. A long time aside, while men you did not think you loved weep for you nevertheless. A complication of it.”

“That sounds like life,” Leonard said, which frightened him.

“Yes,” said Mr. North. “I am very rarely obliged to innovate. I am a consolidator by trade.”

Lyall at last said, “He is tired.”

“Yes,” said Mr. North again. “He believes that if he could trade tiredness for excellence, he would stop being tired. He will not. But he will have less time to notice being tired. That may feel like a cure.”

Leonard understood then how Mr. North had a business at all. He was not a trickster or a tempter. He was a man with remarkable ways of telling you what you were going to do whether he wanted you to or not.

“What do I sign?” Leonard asked.

“You have already,” said Mr. North, and smiled, which was unhelpful in a very tidy way. He drew a paper from a drawer. It was blank until it wasn’t. Words slid up the page as if pressed from beneath by a patient thumb. Lyall leaned forward against his caution. He read. He was annoyed to find that the words were fine, their length and their punctuation neat and their promises less awful than the rumours. It made things harder. He wanted villainy that could be fingered.

“There is a clause,” Lyall said, “about choice. He is to choose again. The seeing clause. He may end it, if he sees himself with sufficient clarity to be disgusted. How tidy.”

“Not disgusted,” Mr. North said. “Bored. Disgust is a puritan’s word. When a man is bored of himself he is often at the beginning of a grace.”

Lyall turned to Leonard. “I will say only this. You are not a man who is much good at getting out of what you have put yourself in. Know that now. You go into rooms and you remember how to stand in them and later, after the key is turned, you discover the window also locks from the outside. You are trusting a man who counts boredom as piety. He has a clever way of being right, and that is the most dangerous quality anyone can have. Do not do anything irrevocable today. Be cowardly awhile. It saves lives.”

Leonard swallowed. He looked at the paper. He thought of his father’s hands on his shoulder, that old pressure that said: do it, my boy, do it before they do, win by being quicker at their game. He thought of Martha’s voice, his sister, telling him to eat, to drink, to do the small obvious thing when he wanted to think the grand fat thought. He thought of a woman’s laugh in the Grand and how abruptly it had stopped. He thought of walking down Harris Street and never, not once, being stopped by need or love.

He picked up the pen Mr. North provided.

Lyall said his name, once, polite, like a farewell.

Leonard signed.

It was quieter afterward. It was not a thunderclap silence. It was like a room that had finished being a room and was now a diagram. Mr. North took the paper and folded it in thirds. He did not put it away.

“You may take it,” Mr. North said to Leonard.

“I don’t want it,” Leonard said.

“That is wise,” said Mr. North. He held it out to Lyall, who took it because it felt wrong not to. “Keep this,” Mr. North said. “Do not attempt to pay me back. I am allergic to charity. Be his teacher. Teach him until he puts the book down of his own accord and goes to build a fence somewhere. Do not think you can outwit me. I am bored with outwitting.”

“I do not intend to,” Lyall said. “I intend to take my very modest salary and over-prepare for our lessons and live without curtains.”

Mr. North’s scarf was brighter for an instant. “Feeling,” he said, “is the foe of economics. Yet, listen, it walks beside us. Mr. Fairbrooke, the effects will be…not immediate. That would be gauche. In the next ten days you will find that phrases occur to you. People will like them. In the next three months you will find that your hand does not shake when you sign and no one will remark. In the next year you will always know which room to be in. You will have a gift for appearing at the precise hour when a man will think: how fortunate, I was just wishing for him. You will think that is love. And then we will see, we will see, we will see.”

“Will I hurt anyone,” Leonard said, low.

“Of course,” said Mr. North. “But then—listen to me—of course you were going to anyway. Do not flatter yourself that I am the only route to harm.”

A weight lifted, which was monstrous. He felt suddenly like a man who has learned that the test he feared was optional and that he had written his name on the paper and that this alone counted. He wanted to weep. He wanted to shake Mr. North’s hand and did not.

“Go home,” Lyall said.

They left. At the top of the stairs, Leonard put his palm to the wall. It felt the way walls feel: like the last word in a sentence that you suddenly cannot read.

Outside, the light was that flat gold it sometimes was when the sky over St Helens remembered that night would be blue. He and Lyall went toward Westfield again, their feet knowing, their bodies making choices, the brain unclasped and swinging a little.

“What have I done,” Leonard said.

“You have made my work more interesting,” Lyall said, with a frankness that attempted to console by proposing a smaller theatre. “And you have inflicted a delay upon your own bettering. That is, paradoxically, one path to it.”

“If you are being encouraging, I do not feel encouraged.”

“I am being precise,” Lyall said. “In the years I have taught I have discovered that my only talent is to shine a little lamp upon a phrase you thought you had read. It is a small trick and very satisfying to some. To you, who want a fate, it will look like a candle at a dockyard. Nevertheless I will carry it. We are companions now. I am very boring at cards.”

At home, Martha met them at the door with a hand full of flour. “I swear,” she said, “flour is the cruelest. It shows up everywhere and looks innocent.”

“Martha,” Leonard said. He felt childish. He wanted to be scolded, not because he liked it, but because it indicated that someone thought he could be corrected.

“There you are, Mr. Lyall,” she said, already friendly, already in the middle of a joke. “He did not stay to his schedule. He was to be tortured with sums from noon.”

“I delayed him,” Lyall said. “I am the friend who brings lemons at dinner. Necessary but not loved.”

“I like lemons very well,” Martha said. “And you are loved. Don’t quarrel with me—I am cooking.”

She retreated. Leonard wanted to tell her what he had done and could not bear to. He wanted to ask whether some women were born so that they made the world a better place just by refusing to lose their footing on it. Martha had once stood upon a nail and bled into her shoe and said: damn it, and then kept stirring the soup because there were men with work-days behind them and appetites like open doors.

They ate. The food was unremarkable in that useful way the truly good always is. Potatoes boiled until they did not argue. Beef roasted until it agreed. Bread that performed the sensible trick of being bread. Lyall talked about an ancient poet Martha liked to call the rude one because he was rude whenever Lyall did not edit him, and about the new school on the east road, and about an essay he had read in which a man compared railways to rivers and made a very tidy mess of it. Leonard listened. He said very little. When he did, words came easily. He meant to say thank you and found that what he said instead was a line about birds and steam and St Helens’s particular sun. Martha’s eyes lit with a pleasure he had not earned. Lyall’s brows crept half a house higher. Leonard felt two things at once: an ease, like a muscle that had consented after months of refusal, and a fear, like the first slip on a wet stone in a river.

After supper, Lyall put on his coat and stood in the doorway longer than a man usually does, which is a way of telling another man that something has altered. “I will come tomorrow,” he said, “and we will continue as if nothing has happened. In the days that follow we will continue as if nothing has happened. At some future time we will say what has. Until then, I will be the fly on the diagram.”

“You will be my tutor,” Leonard said.

“I am your friend,” Lyall said. “That is something I do not claim often. It is a difficult part on a small stage.”

When Lyall had gone, Martha came with tea. “That one,” she said, “has a very good spine.”

“He is my crowbar,” Leonard said, and Martha, who respected a little ridiculousness when it sounded like grief, did not press.

The next morning rose up like a song that remembered the wrong words. Leonard woke and from somewhere he could not locate, a phrase arrived. He said it to himself about the weather, and laughed because it was good and not his. He dressed and the shock of cold water at his temples felt like confession. He walked out into the street and three greetings came at him like thrown hats.

“Mr. Fairbrooke,” said Miss Lottie Young, whose sleeve shop had survived years of bad women and worse seasons. “You look less pinched. That scarf looks like a decision.”

“Miss Young,” Leonard said, “you look like the solution to an equation only two people in town understand and both of them are good tailors.” She laughed in that neat way she had and he thought: that was too much, and also thought: it worked.

At the glassworks his name had gathered in the mouths of workers and was not so heavy, not that day. Men nodded and took off their caps with their hands and put them back on as if they had not done a thing at all. He stood over a table of panes that had been cut in the wrong measure and said, “Perhaps they are right if they are wrong together,” and old Ganton, who never liked to laugh, laughed and said, “You’ll make a poet out of me, can’t say as I approve.” The foreman took him aside and said an order had come from Liverpool and he had handled it, but perhaps it would look better with Leonard’s name on it in the log. “Men like to see certain names,” the foreman said. “It isn’t superstition. It’s a type of fear.”

Leonard wrote. His hand did not shake.

At noon Elias Sugg appeared, a man with a nose like a comma and a way of leaning that suggested he might step off into air and be fine. “Mr. Fairbrooke,” he said. “I hear you’ve been upstairs at Peartree.”

“Have you,” said Leonard. He did not invite more.

“Just what we hear,” Elias said, which is what men say when they want praise for the hearing. “If you wanted news, there’s news. They say the fellow who pulled the brake at Rainhill—remember, I told you—it wasn’t a man in the signaling house. It was a trick on the wheel. Very fine. They had a device. You would have liked it. Too clever to be decent.”

“Men are too clever,” Leonard said, and Elias puffed with vague pride.

That night Lyall returned, and they did sit with sums and Aristotle and quiet. When Lyall asked for a demonstration of a proof Leonard found that he knew it, that he had forgotten the part of him that resented the steps. He walked the proof like a measured street and arrived at the square, and did not feel that faint blow of disbelief. It was a relief so complete that he felt, for a moment, wicked.

After Lyall left, Martha knocked at his study door and stood there with her apron streaked and her hair pinned with violence. “There’s a man downstairs asking after you,” she said. “Says he knows you from The Raven. Looks like a boy made into a fence. Smile like a lie. I’ll send him away if you like.”

Leonard thought of Mr. North’s scarf and of the navy scarf of the man in the corner and of all the possible scarves men use when they mean to be both warm and hidden. “I’ll see him,” he said, because he thought it might be better to be a person who does not run upstairs at a knock.

The man in the kitchen, waiting with his hands busy on a match he would not light, had a face that could vanish in a crowd simply by asking it to. He looked once at Leonard and once at the kettle and then at Martha’s good bread cooling on the board.

“Mr. Fairbrooke,” he said with a tilt that had been a bow once and now was the idea of a bow. “Name’s Marlowe. Jack. But I’m not sticking to it in case it doesn’t stick to me.” He looked past Leonard to the window. “You’ve got a view of the back yards like a play that lost its first act.”

“What do you want,” Leonard said, and heard himself say it with the curl of wit he did not own yesterday.

“Advice,” said Jack Marlowe, “Though I barely know what I’m asking. There’s a gentleman in town—well. Not in town, that’d be too sentimental. There’s a gentleman you have met. He’s made you a nice neat man, and I am not given to envy, but I understand a straight line when I see one. I have been asked, maybe, to have a think about whether straight lines are good for me.”

“Who asked,” Leonard said, although he knew.

Jack shrugged with one shoulder. “Let’s not turn a story into a map. I am—just now—a man with more friends than is healthy. They wanted me to come ask whether you’re better for knowing our mutual acquaintance. I told them that seemed in poor taste. Then they suggested it anyway, and I am a sociable creature.”

“You want to know whether I regret it,” Leonard said.

“I want to know whether, now that you have, you can say a clever thing and have it be yours.”

“I can say a clever thing,” Leonard said, “and have it belong to me at the moment I say it. That is enough for now.”

Jack laughed, genuinely. “What a gentleman says when he has already paid. I am told you love your town. I am told it loves you as much as any town can love a thing made of its own smoke.”

“Who tells you such romantic lies,” Martha interjected from the passage where she had been listening like all good sisters. “Would you like bread.”

“I would,” said Jack. “If it does not owe anyone a favour.”

He ate standing up, as if he would need to run any second and wanted the bread to finish arriving at his blood before he went. He spoke of trains in a way that suggested trains were half animal, half god. He made a circle with his hands, describing the brake wheel. He made a different shape when he spoke of a device nobody in St Helens would see until after it had already acted. He did not say he had been there. He did not say he had not. There was a glint on his left lapel that might have been a pin or just a trick of light. There was a weariness in him that could have been debt.

When he was done, he looked at Leonard as if to say: now what. Leonard felt that little sideways slide of competence, and found the words. “Ask for the thing you actually want,” he said. “Do not bargain for something that sounds like it. You will get the something that sounds like it and then spend ten years hunting for the thing you should have asked for. If a man offers to make you famous, ask for what you want the fame for. If a man offers safety, ask him to write down his definition of safe.”

Jack considered. “I thought you would say: don’t.”

“I thought I would, too,” Leonard said. “It seems I am not the man I thought I was.”

“That’s all of us,” Jack said easily. “I like your bread, Miss. Thank you. If anybody asks, I was never here. If nobody asks, remember the man who never was, it’s a trick I enjoy.” He tipped two fingers up from the brim of a hat he was not wearing, and was gone.

Martha, after, stood in the doorway with a face that did not mind being plain. “I don’t like that one,” she said, unafraid of being dull. “He is a story that wants to be a fire.”

“He is a kind of wind,” Leonard said, surprising himself with the graze of lyric. “I suspect Mr. Lyall would disapprove of metaphors in the kitchen.”

“Mr. Lyall would like anything that gives him a chance to argue,” Martha said. “What did he want.”

“What we all want. Permission.”

They went to bed. The town rearranged itself outside. The chimneys kept drawing their long lines. A dog barked, offended by some moderation of weather. An old woman on Sutton Road told the moon what the moon already knew. In his sleep Leonard dreamt of panes of glass shifting their frames, and of words arriving like birds in a courtyard and not knowing where they had come from.

For a week his days were normal and not. He found his tongue had been filed to a friendly point. He made men feel capable of better work just by speaking to them. He said the right thing when Mrs. Doyle told him that her boy had broken his leg and also her heart; he said: sometimes a good woman is two women stacked, and the one on the bottom is the one who will carry you both. Mrs. Doyle went home feeling taller. Leonard felt strange and lightly fraudulent and also—dangerously—useful.

Lyall, noticing, took notes he did not share. He began the habit of writing in the evenings the words he had said to Leonard. He kept them simple and unadorned. He made a list: Tell him that fear is not evidence. Tell him that everything fine is also boring sometimes. Tell him that if a gift arrives one day, it does not mean it will be there tomorrow; steward it like water. He did not show the list to anyone. He hid it somewhere so obvious it was invisible: between two volumes of the same book.

On the eighth day, the news from Rainhill came as a rumour more formal than most. Lyall heard it first from a boy selling papers too loudly to have that many facts, and then from a man in a hat worn high as if the hat wished to see over the outbuildings of the mind. “They got away with nothing,” the hat-man said, wounded on behalf of the story. “Nothing, they say, except an envelope nobody knew had been there. They say a tutor in town—somebody we all know—had a letter that did not arrive. They say that letter had in it a small fortune, not in money but in the kind of thing money isn’t. Advice. Or permission. Imagine thieves taking permission. Imagine the nerve.”

Lyall laughed until he had to stop because it scared him. He bought a paper and found no mention of a letter, which meant there had certainly been one. He went to Leonard’s at once and said, standing in the parlour before he had the good sense to swallow his dramatics: “If a thief took my permission, I would be a better man tomorrow.”

“What permission,” Leonard said. He had ink on his cuffs. He did not look surprised by his own words anymore; he was getting used to the echo, which is how men mistake caves for cathedrals.

“The kind the world gives you,” Lyall said. “That says: you may now enjoy yourself, you have paid enough suffering in advance. You have held that permit in your fist every day since I met you. You won’t stop looking at it. You are convinced it will be taken from you if you put it away. So here I am hoping a train robber steals it. Perhaps then you will walk out with your hands free.”

Leonard smiled, and truly this time. “You are insufferable today.”

“Yes,” Lyall said lightly. “I am. It is a tactic.”

When Leonard went out that afternoon, the sky was the wrong kind of blue for St Helens: open and a little too clean. He went to The Raven and Wheel because sometimes men do what they will say they will not do. The man with the navy scarf was there, of course. He raised his glass and saluted the portion of the room Leonard occupied. “Mr. Fairbrooke,” he said, as if congratulating the furniture on its arrangement.

“Good afternoon,” Leonard said, sitting. He felt that faint click of words aligning in his mouth. He tried to resist and then thought: perhaps resisting is not noble, only dull.

“You look well,” the man said. “Starting to carry it like it was yours all along. Everybody does, given time.”

“And you,” Leonard said. “Do you act in any capacity beyond that of the trumpet.”

“Oh,” said the man, “we all carry a bell for someone. I used to ring for myself. It is nicer to ring for another. You think less. I have a question for you: when did you last do something without the thought of how it would sound if narrated later.”

“Never,” Leonard said. “Honestly? Never.”

The navy scarf grinned. “Then there is the voice,” he said happily. “Good. The sooner you hear it the sooner you will tire of it.”

“What voice,” Leonard said, but already he knew, and the knowledge was like the first itch under a plaster.

The man leaned across and tapped Leonard’s glass, chiming it. “The one that tells you: we are telling your story now, and maybe it will end with a hat thrown or a marriage or a bankruptcy that made everything possible. You will become a listener while you are living. I am fond of it, myself. It lets one forget the smoke.”

Leonard walked home in the four o’clock dark that winter manufactures out of thrift. He kept his hands in his pockets and said nothing to anyone he passed. He wanted to feel the effect of Mr. North’s paper like a tide. Instead he felt as if he held a map of a place he had not decided to go, a very accurate map with all the margins annotated by a man who disliked the margins.

Martha had fallen asleep in her chair with a book. Lyall was waiting with a deck of cards and a look that said: I am ready to lose to you until you hate winning. Leonard sat. They played. The cards went like water because that is how cards go in a house that wants to be a boat.

Later, Lyall said, “Tell me a true thing that is dull.”

Leonard hesitated, then: “The glass at the number five furnace had bubbles along the edge today. It means the heat is wrong in the smallest way. It means we will waste five hours and an argument about an argument.”

Lyall smiled. “Good. Another.”

“My boot pinches.”

“Good. Another.”

“The neighbour’s child sings a song about the dead because he likes the word ‘dead’ and how it makes the room look.”

“Good,” Lyall said, almost happy. “I think you may yet be bored of the person you are intent on becoming.”

“You want me bored,” Leonard said, puzzled.

“I want you free,” Lyall said. “Boredom—proper, honest boredom—is sometimes the door in. Not the kind that is just appetite in gray clothes. The other kind. The kind that makes a man put down a trick and go sweep the yard and find the yard very dear.”

“Mr. Lyall,” Leonard said, feeling both gratitude and a mischief that felt imported, “you are very wise for a boy.”

Lyall bowed ironically and made himself some tea, which he never sweetened. “Wait,” he said, with a sudden turn of the head one gives when something passes the window. “Do you hear that.”

“What,” Leonard said.

“The word that will one day change this town,” Lyall said, blinking. “It will not be the word ‘rail,’ and it will not be the word ‘glass.’ It might be the word ‘enough.’ Imagine.”

Leonard imagined. He went to sleep that night with the word like a coin under his pillow, and in the morning he woke and for a long while did nothing but watch the corner of the room where the sun tried to make a quadrilateral out of light and failed.

Two mornings later, a letter came in Lyall’s hand: a neat folded page, three sentences. It said nothing of Mr. North and nothing of bargains. It invited Leonard to meet him near Rainhill the next day to walk a line of track he had been reading about because Lyall was the kind of man who read about tracks as if they were literature. “There is a small trestle nobody thinks is beautiful,” the letter said, “which therefore most likely is. Bring nothing. Wear boots. If you can, be quiet. There is a sound I want you to hear.”

Leonard put the letter in his coat and did not tell Martha where he was going because she would have said, reasonably, that the business of the glassworks did not involve trestles and sounds. He took the nine o’clock. He sat with his hat in his lap and his heart in the wrong place. Outside the windows, each field confessed winter to the next. The train was shabby and proud, like everything honest.

He found Lyall at the little station. He was speaking to a man who stood with his hands in his pockets as if he had built pockets himself: Jack Marlowe. Winter had oiled his hair flat. He nodded to Leonard and this time the nod had something of complicit pity in it.

“I brought you to hear the water under the trestle,” Lyall said by way of explanation and apology. “I did not expect a companion, but he insists that he is part of all trestles presently, and who am I to contradict a metaphor in a hatless head.”

“Good morning,” Jack said, and the morning used the greeting as an excuse to become more itself.

They walked. The rails shone where the frost had not dared cling. The ties were soaked with the history of oil and talk. The men who had laid them had carried their mistakes into the pub later and the pub had carried them back out again. Leonard could not help himself; phrases rose. He said little, all the same.

At the trestle, water moved underneath with a determination that did not owe explanation. It went about its going. Lyall leaned on the rail and closed his eyes and said, “There. There. A sound that does not require us to be interesting. A relief.”

Jack spat over the side and watched it fall and then said, “When a man makes a pact, sometimes the pact assumes it can call him anywhere. I wanted to see whether you could say no to the trappings and yes to the river.”

“I do not understand you,” Leonard said, because it seemed decent to say so when you did not understand a man who insisted on saying something.

“That’s all right,” Jack said. “Half the time I misunderstand me, and the other half I’m lying. Mr. Lyall here thinks the world is saved by listening. I think it’s saved by running. You, Mr. Fairbrooke—you will have to pick. Or you will have to be tired enough to let both happen to you.”

Lyall sighed, a fondly exasperated sigh. “Ignore him and listen to the water. It is very clever and not at all proud.”

They stood for a long time on the trestle. The trains went by rarely. The water kept its conversation and did not include them. Lyall said, after a while, “When a boy is very small he believes that if he stops looking at his mother she will stop being. Later he learns that this is not true and then he learns it again. Mr. Fairbrooke. Practice not looking at yourself. Practice it as if your life depended on it. It may.”

Leonard’s mouth was dry as if he had been laughing. “You think I am in love with my reflection.”

“I think you have been handed a mirror that flatters you and will flatter you less and less and then will flatter you again in a panic to keep you holding it,” Lyall said. “You are not vain. You are a practical man. You will use any tool at hand. That, right now, is the danger.”

Jack made a small appreciative noise. “He is better at this than I am,” he said, peeking at Leonard sidewise. “I distract men. He disarms them. Must be lovely, to have a friend who is a weapon that doesn’t cut.”

The train that came finally was entirely itself: blunt and ordinary. The driver waved because he could. The water was delighted to be shoved aside. The trestle took the weight without flinching. And in the shape that the moment made, Leonard saw—not any new fact about himself, not a revelation that sent him to his knees. He saw only that the world would continue without him and that, in consequence, he could afford to be patient with it, and that this thought—a thought like a teaspoon—relieved him.

He looked at Lyall, whose face had the plain joy of a teacher who has put a boy in front of a window and the boy has seen a bird. He looked at Jack, whose face had the amused hunger of a man who knows which pocket holds the money and which pocket the map.

“I have made a mistake,” Leonard said quietly. He meant the pact and he meant that he had believed it would do anything but reduce.

“Of course,” said Lyall. “We are going to make many. I have taken the trouble to make two already this morning without you, because I like to get ahead.”

Jack sighed and slapped his hands together and said, as if he were taking a bet with himself, “Let us be friends, all three of us. It will make an interesting problem later when we must disappoint one another.”

They walked back to the station. In the bustle of nothing much happening, a boy ran past with a mouth too red from winter, singing something about the dead. Leonard felt suddenly a terrible tenderness for everything ordinary. The station clock was wrong by three minutes and he loved it, he loved it, he loved it.

On the way home, a woman in the carriage told him the story of her cousin who had been proposed to by a man with clean fingernails, and how she had said no because she did not trust a man whose work did not show. Leonard said the small true thing: a man can wash his hands and keep his work. The woman looked at him as if he had offered her a present she did not know she wanted. He smiled and did not feel clever, only glad to have handed over a piece of plainness.

When he reached St Helens the air smelled like an amendment to a contract. He walked to The Raven and Wheel without meaning to. Mr. North was there, without scarf and without preface, taking a coin from a man who had wagered that he did not carry coins.

“You have been to hear a river,” Mr. North said before Leonard could pretend not to be surprised. “How very you.”

“I regret signing,” Leonard said.

“Do you,” said Mr. North. He looked mildly disappointed, as if a child had grown too quickly for a particular toy. “Say it again in three months and I will be impressed. Say it now and I think you are practicing a speech you intend to deliver to a mirror.”

“I regret signing,” Leonard said a second time, because it felt honest to prove himself wrong.

Mr. North smiled slightly. “You are going to have an interesting winter,” he said. “Do not break anything you cannot fix. Do not break anyone you did not mean to. Mr. Lyall will meet a man more interesting than you very soon and you will be jealous and will dress it as caution; that will be boring of you. A pity. You have the talent to be otherwise. I am happy for you. Truly. You are going to suffer charmingly. Do you have the fare home.”

Leonard patted his pocket and found that he did not and that he did not care. Someone would pay. The town had a way of paying when it wanted to see a show.

He left the pub, the light fell as it does in a town that encrypts its evenings in gray, and he went home through Harris Street with a step that was neither jaunty nor stooped. He was not yet a man he could respect without looking away. He was not the child he feared. He was something in the middle, which is to say he was alive. The winter would do its spade work on him and he on it, and in some future not-yet, a train robber would teach his tutor a lesson on a platform outside of time, and all of it would matter less than the way the kettle waited for the moment before boiling to make its first small sound. He listened for it in the hallway before announcing himself to Martha, and when he heard it, he stood still and smiled in the dark.In the mornings that followed, frost learned the town’s measurements with an intimacy that would have been improper if it had been human. The hedges along Sutton Road wore it like lace better suited to saints, and the glassworks yard acquired a glitter that made even ash look luxurious, which was a trick and therefore suspect. Martha began to warm the teapot before warming the tea, as if to persuade the day to be kind by flattering its vessels. Leonard woke early not because his mind was clear but because it was busy; clarity, he was beginning to see, had a different temperature than industry. He lay a while listening to the particular squeak of the back door when Martha took the pails out and to the small, anticipatory click the kettle made before it hurrahed into the boil. He loved that click the way some men love gunshots. It promised an action that was neither heroic nor linguistic. It promised heat doing what heat did.

At the works, a small boy named Alfie Petter, who had spent his first years eating more coal-dust than bread and yet had the cheerful sturdiness of weeds that find their way into mortar, slipped on a rime of ice while carrying a bucket of cullet. The bucket’s iron lip met his shin and made a sound that would not be believed if described. In the half-second after the sound, the men around Alfie stood still in that special English way that is both readiness and refusal, then moved all at once with a coordination that had nothing to do with orders. Someone swore so magnificently that it felt like a prayer; someone else said, “Get Mr. Fairbrooke,” not because the foreman could not handle the thing but because there are moments when a particular name is a ritual, and rituals steady men’s hands.

Leonard came fast because he had been standing near enough to hear the falseness in the sound. He knelt by the boy because standing above him would have been a cowardice. Alfie’s skin had split wide enough that bone considered whether to appear and decided not to, out of a modesty that would lessen with years. Blood who, in summer, will dawdle and tell its story to anyone with a rag, had decided, in the cold, to go about its business with efficient courtesy. Leonard did not say anything resembling a speech. He took off his scarf and bound the leg quick and higher than he first thought necessary because Mr. Tysoe, who had once been a proper soldier and enjoyed remembering it, said, “Higher, lad, higher,” as if Leonard were the boy and he did as he was told without taking the compliment or the insult of it. He said to old Ganton, “Fetch Pell,” not as an order but as a request shaped without the permissible out. He said to the man nearest the furnace mouth, “Cool a poker and bring it,” which sounded like the beginning of a rural nightmare and was, in fact, a very sensible precaution in case the blood fancied adventure. He put his hand—bare, ignoring the cold—on the boy’s hair and said, “All right,” in a tone that made that a fact and not an opinion. He did not think about the eloquence of it. He did not think about how it would read if a stranger wrote it down. The narrative voice that had been licking his ear for days like a cat trying to announce its ownership stalked to the other side of the room and sulked.

Dr. Pell arrived with his case like a judgment that a man had chosen himself because he did not write to London when he could have. He tied the leg with the ropey gentleness of a man who had tied a thousand legs and had forgotten almost all of them on purpose. “Lucky,” he said gruffly, which meant exactly not lucky, and then added, because he liked to pretend that he was a harsh man when he was nothing of the sort, “Your floor’s a hazard, Fairbrooke.” The foreman bristled. Leonard did not bristle. He said, “Yes,” and he said, “We will change the walkboards,” and he said, “Send the bill to me,” because he had seen the way Alfie’s mother counted coins with her mouth when her hands were busy with bread.

When it was done and the world gathered itself up into its usual clatter as if nothing had happened (which is how worlds survive), the men looked at Leonard with that look they reserve for a master who has not embarrassed them. It was not worship and it was not affection. It was an acknowledgment carved with blunt tools. It was the opposite of applause. Leonard stood with blood on his palm drying darker than it should have and felt a fear that was not about Alfie, who would mend in the way of boys who have always had to; it was about the part of him that woke when someone bled and stopped the writing that otherwise hurried to narrate. He had not felt holy. He had not felt clever. He had felt present. Mr. North, if he had stood there in his red scarf, would have called this a loss in the bookkeeping. Leonard did not want to argue with Mr. North with a boy’s blood on his fingers. He wanted to wash his hands and to keep them dirty.

He went into the small office and washed with cold water that had the taste of nails. He looked at his reflection in the wavering pane that had been cut an eighth off true and thought, not in a line but in a lump, that he did not know the man in the glass because the map kept changing. On his desk a notice had been slipped, folded twice with the care men use when they have been poor. He opened it and saw The Grand’s heavy paper glint. Mr. Pritchard of Liverpool, who had a hand in steam and another in tariffs and a third hand not in evidence for the sort of work gentlemen do when they do not mind where their hands have been, invited Mr. L. Fairbrooke to a Tuesday supper for the good of the town’s connections. There would be a railway man, a banker, a gentleman with pamphlets, and perhaps a poet if anyone could manage to keep one sober until nine. “Your presence would be encouraging to the men,” the card said absolutely untruthfully, and then added, “You may bring a guest,” which was an admission that an audience is always needed even when a man pretends he does not want one.

Leonard thought: Swithin. He thought: perhaps Martha would enjoy the spectacle. He thought: he could be generous or he could be guided into it. He sent a boy with a note to Lyall. He wrote, because he could not help himself, “Come if the basis for attending is one that would make you ashamed later,” and he signed his name with a hand that did not shake and a mind that was interested in its own stability in a way that was growing tiresome.

Lyall came to the house at six with his hair combed in the way a man combs it when he is thinking about other things. He had his derived air of the scholar, which is to say, of a man who has learned how to wear his ignorance like a well-cut coat. He greeted Martha and allowed her to bully him into eating two more mouthfuls than he had intended, which was his way of declaring gratitude. He said to Leonard, in the privacies of his eyebrows and then in his voice, “It is marked on the town’s calendar that you will be witnessed tonight. We will bring lemons. We will bury them in the roast if the talk goes rancid.”

They entered The Grand with every intention of enjoying it as a set. The plaster liked the light it had been given. The carpet had a pride that came of being maintained by people who were actually paid to maintain it, which is so rare that carpets develop illusions when it happens. The gosh of the dome was less offensive in winter because winter forgives men who pretend warmth. Mr. Pritchard, whose waistcoat had brass buttons that declared his affection for the idea of ships without requiring him to set foot on one, greeted them at the threshold as if he had, coincidentally, been looking in their direction very handsomely for several minutes.

“My dear Fairbrooke,” he said. “And—ah—Mr. Lyall. The gentleman who made a bishop want to diagram sentences. What a lovely perversion.”

Lyall smiled with restraint. “The bishop did it to himself,” he said. “I merely opened the book.”

They were led into a room that had too much light for the faces it contained. Men of money look best in the half-shadows; they know it and resent it at once. There was a banker with hands that had lost the habit of gesturing because gestures made men think of promises, and a pamphleteer whose hair had been arranged by wind and intent, and a railway fellow in a neat blue suit whose neck had been built with machinery in mind. Leonard knew at once that the railway fellow—Mr. Temple, as he declared himself—would be difficult to dislike and impossible to love, which is a stable arrangement for a nation.

“Your sums are correct about the trestle iron,” Mr. Temple said within five minutes of meeting Lyall, as if they had been midway through an argument since September. “But your poetry about the rivets is sentimental. We do not caress rivets. We drive them and they hold.”

Lyall’s pleasure at a proper argument rose like steam. He turned to Leonard with a face that, if translated into words, would have read: here is a man. “Tell me about the hammering,” he said to Temple. “Tell me about the moment when you know you have turned iron into a promise.”

Temple answered in terms so exact they made the lawyer at the end of the table look as if he had left his shoelaces undone. He spoke with that proprietary love some men reserve for friction. He said “tolerance” the way a priest says “mercy.” Lyall leaned in and returned the volley with a Euclid proposition that made a space on the tablecloth for triangles where soup bowls had hoped to sit undisturbed. Leonard listened and felt at once admiring and adrift, like a man who loves a room in which two other men have set all the furniture at heights to suit themselves. He looked up once and caught Mr. North seated with the back of his head toward them, conferring with a man in a coat so new it squeaked. Mr. North had taken off his red scarf as if to say that colours are for luring birds and he meant now to shoot.

Mrs. Danae was there, seated under a spray of ostrich feathers like pen-nibs gone extravagant. She watched men speak with her mouth shut the way you watch a theatre when you are inside the play and outside it at once. Her dress had recovered from whatever sadness had made it velvet before noon; it performed its task with relish and held on bravely where it had to. When a course was cleared and Mr. Pritchard launched himself into a praise of capital so polished it almost convinced capital that it had a soul, she said, in a tone that could have been cutting if she had wanted: “Men who work do not require capital to love them. They require it to move. Do you intend to make it walk with you or only admire it from the window.”

It was a ridiculous manner of speaking and it was excellent and the men laughed carefully and looked at Mr. Pritchard for cues. Mr. Pritchard, who enjoyed being wounded by the clever so he could remember being alive, placed his hand theatrically on his chest. “Madam,” he said, “if capital had ears, yours are the words I would whisper into them.”

Leonard found the phrase waiting and did not like how ready it was. “Capital has ears,” he said, and put down his spoon, because spoons are not the instruments for sentences. “They are attached to men who have been told for twenty years that they are necessary. It is a belief system. We could unconvert them, perhaps, with embarrassment.”

Mr. Temple barked a laugh that had belonged to his father. “I will attend the first meeting of the Embarrassers’ Cooperative if you will put it together,” he said, warm with his own good idea and unaware that he had been made part of a jest that would be repeated in town kitchens all week. Lyall, who would prefer to be in a kitchen if given honest choice, leaned back and watched Leonard’s hands. They were steady. They were impatient. He thought of Mr. North’s paper and then deliberately thought of the trestle water and decided to be content with soup.

Near the end of the evening, the pamphleteer rose and read a portion of his work as if he were freeing birds from a small eldest child’s fists. It was about the dignity of labour and the necessity of the rail and the villainy of men from whom he accepted coins with relieved gratitude. Leonard almost liked him. He liked the way he tripped on the word “prerogative” and lied about it with such art that only the ladies saw. After, when coats were being fetched by lads who pretended to hate the stairs and loved them for the exercise, a man approached Lyall with a familiarity that made Leonard’s upper back reflect something he would later misdiagnose as a draft.

“I have your letter,” he said to Lyall, and there was Jack Marlowe, as clean as a man can be when his work rewards dirt. He had traded his jacket for something that used to belong to a gentleman who had not sweated in it, and it had not agreed with his shoulders but it had agreed with his smile. His hair lay down again for now, tamed by winter and a woman with a comb. “Or rather,” he added, “I had it and then I did not. But that is how I know its contents. I would like to offer you a version of it more accurate than the one your conscience has already written.”

Lyall did not change colour because the habit had been trained out of him, but he blinked once and put aside the ladder of words he had been climbing about Mr. Temple’s rivets. “You had it,” he said mildly. “You returned it.”

Jack shrugged, which is a thing men do when their decisions were always a shrug even before their shoulders moved. “I returned what the gentleman thought he sent,” he said. “I am sorry. We were in a hurry, the lot of us, and when a letter arrives in a bag that is not supposed to exist, a man must choose whether to believe in the bag or the letter. I have chosen wrongly before. I may again. I wanted you to know that the letter—yours—was from a man who likes the smell of colleges. He wants to invite you to smell the same. He uses words like fellowship without laughing. He is not cruel, but he is careless in the way men become when buildings have rewarded them for being careful for too long. He offers you a place where winter is different. He offers you boys who are further higher and older younger, all the contradictions that happen to boys when they are given rooms with tall windows. He offers you the flavor of permission you like least: the kind that makes your useful poverty look like a choice and therefore silly.”

Leonard stood with his coat in his hands and felt that pinch in his boot again and knew suddenly that jealousy is often a body pain. He had no right to mind. He knew that. He minded. He thought, with a speed that felt borrowed and a bitterness he owned: do not go, Swithin. He thought, with a better part of himself: if you go, do it without the permission of a letter you do not need.

Lyall took a breath that had the courage of a man breaking a minor loyalty to an idea of himself. “What was the stipend,” he said, and Jack laughed like a boy who had been waiting to be told he could laugh and had begun laughing long before the permission arrived.

“The stipend,” Jack said. “There. Now you are someone I can trust with a favour I do not yet know how to ask.”

They went to an alcove because men always go to alcoves when truth threatens to sit down. The gold was warmer there and the palm fronds looked like hands that wished to carry something without being seen to. Mr. Pritchard, taking leave of Mr. Temple, raised his eyebrows at Leonard in the way a man does when he suspects that the evening may produce a story he did not pay for.

“It is enough money,” Jack said to Lyall in a lowered voice that nevertheless could not fail to draw the sailors of the room toward its weather. “Enough to make nonsense of your economics for a year, not enough to keep you from thinking about money all the time like a sinner prays. You could go. You could stay. I am the last person who might tell you what to do. Also I am precisely the person people tell not to tell them what to do only to obey me out of spite to their better angels. I stole a letter that was partly yours by the laws that apply to men who have decided letters are how we arrange the universe. For that I apologize in a way I will make fun of if anyone repeats it. I have brought you its contents and I will bring you its paper if I can pry it out of a fellow’s waistcoat somewhere between here and the Wargrave. He is sentimental about wax seals and will show it to three persons before he sleeps. Our time is very silly.”

Lyall looked at Jack with a care that meant: you are saying more than you intend. Jack looked back as if to say: naturally, I am always talking more than I intend, hope is a kind of chatter. Leonard wanted to be the sort of man who could call Jack friend without trying to measure him. He wanted to be the sort of man who could tell Lyall to go where he should go and say it without the pleasure of being noble. He wanted sleep.

“Tell me something the letter could not,” Lyall said.

“The taste of the river at Cambridge,” Jack said promptly. “It tastes like a book that wants to be a scandal. I walked by it once when a man had just gone into it out of carelessness and been brought out by friends who had not decided in advance whether they liked him. It smelled of pregnancies announced too far in advance of the dates. Will that do.”

Lyall smiled with the peculiarity of a boy who is told that someone likes the shape of his ears. “It will do,” he said. “I do not like rivers that think very well of themselves.”

“Good,” Jack said. “Stay until you are bored clever of this place. Then go. Or go now and come back when you miss being cold in a useful way. Do not ask permission of letters again. They are very poor judges of men.”

After, on the steps, Mr. Temple clapped Leonard’s shoulder with an ease men who come from steadier lines can afford. “You’ve a good education in the house,” he said, glancing at Lyall’s back as if he were a piece of admirable engineering on a rival line. “Take care you do not confuse it with destiny.”

“That is what Mr. Lyall is for,” Leonard said. “He snips the embroidery off my dresses and tells me that shirts are shirts.”

“That’s a comfort,” Temple replied. “Mind your furnaces. Coal is a traitor and iron is a liar. The only honest thing on my line is a man who needs to eat. Wouldn’t trust a stone.”

Leonard and Lyall walked home through air that tasted like pewter. They did not speak for a while. A couple came toward them arguing pleasantly about whether the butcher’s boy had been insolent or merely quick; the woman won because she had her hands full and the man was sensible enough to love that. From a window somewhere a piano began a tune and stopped when it remembered it had a cough. The town had entered that deep part of winter when nothing is new and everything is particular, a season that suits the poor and the exact. Leonard thought of Mr. North’s prediction about jealousy and felt the flush of being a prophet’s pawn. It bored him, and the boredom was a relief.

“You meant to ask the stipend first,” he said to Lyall when the road widened its shoulders and they could walk as if they were not taking up space that did not belong to them.

“Yes,” Lyall said. “I was proud of myself for not. Then I was ashamed for thinking pride had any place there. Then I was bored of both those ideas, which felt like washing a floor correctly.”

“If you go,” Leonard said, and felt at once the ridiculousness of the small tremor that tried to enter his mouth and was denied entry by his teeth, “if you go, we will contrive. Martha will bully me and I will let myself be bullied and you will write letters that say nothing I can misuse. If you stay, we will go on being very good men until something occurs that makes better men look like imitations.”

“I will not go yet,” Lyall said, simply. “I am insufficiently bored of you.”

Leonard laughed at that. He laughed hard enough that two constables passing raised their chins in surprise and then lowered them again because laughter is legal and should be allowed where it can do good.

When they turned into the yard, Martha was on the step with a bowl of peels for the pig-men. She had flour on her cheek and an expression that would be read in churches if churches took their reading from women who knew how many potatoes are ridiculous for three. “There you are,” she said to Lyall, taking possession without apology. “There’s a man at the back door with light in his eyes and not enough sense near it. If he tries to sell you a watch, I will tell him when his mother is due for him to return it.”

“Send him to me,” Lyall said easily. “I crave idiots at bedtime.”

“He’s not an idiot,” Martha said without congratulating the idiot for this. “He’s a boy trying on being an idiot because he thinks it looks grown. He’s the one whose mother is always asking what to feed him because he won’t grow on bread.”

“Ralph Allerton,” Lyall murmured, as if the town were a book with an index he had made for himself. “I like him. He writes me notes that plagiarize Cicero by accident.”

“He plagiarizes you on purpose,” Martha said, and then lowered her voice with a gravity Leonard respected. “Also, Mr. Lyall, there were men in the lane today asking whether you had any letters gone astray. They didn’t have hats. I did not like their hair. I told them that if there were letters in this house they would be clean and on the mantel and none of their business. They did not like that. They left in the way men leave when they want to practice returning.”

Lyall’s face went still with that particular stillness that frightened men standing on shaky things. “Thank you,” he said to her, which meant more than the word ought to hold. “Do not tell Leonard I said, ‘thank you.’ He will think it needs an argument.”

“I am in the room,” Leonard said, and Martha smiled at him, which meant: do not begin.

In the study later, with the lamplight arranged to make labour look dignified and not drudgery, Lyall took from his pocket a stitch of rough paper that had once been stuck with wax. It was the corner of a letter with nothing useful on it, unless a man had a taste for seals and the way they break. “He brought it,” Lyall said, almost with wonder. “He brought the corner. The boy who makes pockets brought me a corner of a letter. I keep it because sentiment occasionally muscles in on utility and demands a seat.”

“What will you do,” Leonard asked. He was drinking tea without tasting it and was therefore properly English for the first time that day.

“I will go to Liverpool,” Lyall said. “Not to the college. To the booksellers. I will stand in a shop I like and not buy anything and see if the day behaves itself. I will not go to the river. I will not write. I will be bored of my own cleverness and then we will see whether I can have a decent thought.”

“Shall I come,” Leonard said, and knew even as he asked that the question was the sort men ask when they know the answer and hope to be contradicted.

“No,” Lyall said kindly. “Stay and watch the furnaces and the boys and Mr. Pritchard’s charm look for its boots. Stay and let Mr. North’s sentences occur to you like weather. Tell them to sit down if they are inconvenient. You are not their host.”

Leonard bowed, which was ridiculous and pleased them both. After Lyall had gone, he went to the back door and looked into the lane where men had inquired in a rudeness that passes for authority. He imagined telling them that letters are a superstition and that they would be better off asking after the names men kept written under their tongues. He did not. He shut the door and slid the bolt and stood for a long minute with his hand on it as if he were holding shut a thought that would make the household cold.

The next day, the glassworks was quieter not by volume but by intention. Men spoke as if they were being written down and wished to be quoted accurately. Old Ganton came to Leonard with a proposal for the walkboards that involved an arrangement of hooks that would catch ice before it learned to be cruel. “A contraption,” Ganton said with embarrassed pride. “It pins the frost, like.”

“Make it,” Leonard said. “We’ll try it at furnace two where men trip most because it pretends not to be there.” He stayed at the table with the measurements after Ganton had gone and did not add a line about men and frost and theologies because the line came too quickly. He scratched out a figure and put another in and felt a small pain in his chest that was not sorrow nor indigestion. It took him a minute to find the name: patience. He had not been in the habit of feeling it recently. He was out of practice.

In the afternoon a constable named Wedge knocked with his knuckles in a way that made the door want to volunteer information. He was one of those respectable men who perform their dullness when spoken to and then reveal, in small acts, an intelligence that is exact and not interested in gossip. “Mr. Fairbrooke,” he said, his hat in his hand not because he respected the household but because it scratched his brow, “we are inquiring. A train was slowed without permission. I do not say the word robbery because my sergeant enjoys it too much when I do. There are letters involved. Not yours. Nobody cares what you think—pardon—about what you think. There is talk of a tutor. We like tutors. They hand sentences around and we get to use them later. If Mr. Lyall has any letters that have been about that he did not ask for, we would like to take them away. It is the way we declare that the world is tidy.”

“He is in Liverpool,” Martha said before Leonard could decide whether to lie clumsily or elegantly and selected the middle by mistake. “Buying books he will not buy. He has no letters. He is a man. Men do not have letters. They have shirts.”

Constable Wedge nodded as if this were a valuable reinterpretation of Scripture. “Good,” he said. “I will leave my card in case he wakes up wealthy. If so, the appropriate amount for fines will be arranged. It is the mercy the city offers men with language.” He left the card, which was not a card but a piece of paper with an ill-drawn badge on it. He left his good sense behind as well, intentionally, because he knew Martha would keep it for him and return it when it did him most service.

By the second evening, the news had developed a shape. Mr. Temple’s men had found the clever on the brake wheel and admired it with fury. There had been no money taken, which the papers did not know how to regret because they only understand thefts they can count. A letter had been lost, which the papers did not know how to relish because it did not permit them to accuse without using real names. In town, the story expanded and contracted depending on who told it and whether they fancied themselves at the tallying end of life. Elias Sugg said, at The Raven and Wheel, that the device had been a marvel and that a man had been seen stepping off with a grin that would either feed him for a month or get him killed by March. Mrs. Danae said, in her rooms where the wallpaper thought too well of itself and was therefore lonely, that the town had been invited to a performance it had not paid for. Mr. North said nothing in public, which is a remark.

Leonard did not see Lyall that night. He imagined him standing in a shop where books were shelved at too good a height with a ladder that had been made for better legs. He imagined him not buying anything and considering that, in and of itself, a small moral victory. He sat by the window in his own study with a ledger he pretended to understand and an engine of sentences trying, like birds, to land on his fingers. He let three land and then he went to the kitchen and cut bread because he needed to do a thing that would not be remembered in town.

It was late when Jack Marlowe came to the back gate. Martha heard him because she was the sort of woman who could hear men part their hair. She opened before he could knock because she disliked the idea of a thief rapping on her house. “If you are bringing the bailiffs,” she said, “come without your boots. I do not mop for state.”

Jack smiled, delighted to be in a house in which he could be corrected without being diminished. “I have a letter,” he said. “I found a fellow who had a taste for bragging and took it off him with praise. I have a letter and I think it belongs to your scholar. I intend to sell it to him for something that does not look like money.”

“What is it,” Martha said coolly. “Do not tell me a seat by the fire. It is mine and I will not part with it.”

“Permission,” Jack said. He looked genuinely apologetic to be honest. “Not the letter’s. Mine. I would like to ask him if I may be his student for a fortnight. I do not mean that I will sit and decline nouns. I mean that I would like to learn how to sit. I am bad at it.”

“We will charge you,” Martha said, and let him in. “We do not have scholarships here. We pay in peeled potatoes, because they are terrible.”

Leonard, when told, felt again that pain in his chest at being a man in a house where things occurred whether or not he authorized them. He said yes because he could not say no without wearing the word “jealous” on his head like a cap that did not fit. Jack handed him the letter, which had had its corners handled too much to be rescued by a prayer of the sort that rescues corners. Leonard did not open it. He put it on Lyall’s chair and told it to wait.

They began in the morning. Jack arrived in his shirt-sleeves like a boy in a moral painting about to be taught a lesson by a carpenter. He sat on the chair and sat like a man who had never done it before. “My legs wish to run,” he said, astonished. “They have never told me this. There is a circus in my calves.”

“Good,” Leonard said, pleased to find a place within this that was his and not only Swithin’s. “When they run, do not chase them. Sit while they run. Let them tell you where to go when they come back.”

“I have been letting parts of me tell me where to go for years,” Jack said, with no unhappiness in it. “It is how I met most of my enemies.”

They sat. They did not read. Martha came and went with the certainty of a steamer taking its own advice. The house reverberated with small industry. A coalman coughed sentences into the yard. Somewhere a child practiced a declension that was going to make its way into a different language entirely because the town is bilingual in necessity and jokes. The day lengthened itself, as it does when men are trying to be differently alive.

Lyall returned in the blue portion of the afternoon, a man who had successfully wasted his time and would sleep well for it. He came in without theatricality because he had been born without it. He saw Jack in his chair and did not perform surprise because performance is expensive. He saw the letter on the seat of the other chair and did not reach for it because he had acquired, in Liverpool, a small habit accidentally: he had stood for ten minutes looking at the sea behind a warehouse and not told himself what it looked like. He felt very rich.

“Mr. Marlowe,” he said by way of greeting, which made Jack look briefly as if a horse had learned to speak his name for real.

“I brought your permission,” Jack said, with cowed gaiety. “I would like to be forgiven for that sentence in three years.”

“Done,” Lyall said. He picked up the letter and did not open it, which was the sort of lesson you cannot give when you are actually teaching. “Sit,” he added, and Jack made an effort so visible it ought to have been applauded. “We will speak very little. Leonard will do the speaking today if he must. I have been paid to listen. I would like to do some without crying robbery.”

“What happens if I become good at sitting,” Jack asked, physically agitated and intellectually delighted.

“You will become dangerous in a new direction,” Lyall said. “Be careful how you aim.”

And so the house, which had been a place for being busy and for making sure the kettle did not misbehave, became for a few days a place where men tried to desist without becoming statues. The town continued to draw its black lines against the sky, which could be read as either letters or sentences depending on how long you had loved the chimneys. Men came to the back door to ask Martha whether she had seen Lyall and whether he was the sort of man who wrote to London; she told them that if she wrote to London she would ask for the return of its manners and that seemed to go far enough. The glassworks filled an order for Liverpool with an exactness that made even the order blush. Alfie Petter’s mother brought a pie and left it without looking anyone in the eye because she was not a woman who considered gratitude her profession. Mr. North sent a card as innocuous as cough-lozenges: “All economies are temporary,” it said. “The heart’s. The town’s. Even boredom’s. Yours, N.”

On the third day of Jack’s lessons, a man of a certain height and a certain way of standing that declared a future of leadership appeared in the lane and held himself in a fashion the law recognizes as authority and the soul recognizes as a quarrel. He did not knock. He waited as if the universe could be made to do things in the right order if he stood still long enough. When Martha went, she returned with a look that said: now. Lyall rose and did not look at Jack because he trusted him enough to be a man in a room without constant regard.

“Mr. Lyall,” the man said when welcomed and not offered tea because he would have refused it badly. “I am Inspector Meres. I have an interest in men who are interested in trains that slow when they are not meant to.”

“I am interested in very many things that slow when they are not meant to,” Lyall said gently. “Hearts. Pigs. Days. I am not much good with brake wheels.”

Inspector Meres had eyes from which watchfulness had leached any hope of gentleness. “You received a letter,” he said. “It did not arrive. It was taken by one of a class of men who cause the town mischief and then send it a thank-you note for the favor.” He saw Jack then where Jack sat, sitting like a man being led to his execution and determined to learn the walk well enough to help someone else later. “Ah,” said the inspector, in a tone that contained none of the surprise he might have practiced in the mirror, and then did the town the honour of not lying. “Mr. Marlowe. We will have that letter.”

“You may,” Lyall said, but he did not hand it over. “After you tell me something dull.”

Inspector Meres blinked, and in that blink an entire childhood could be read if one had a taste for biographies. “Sir,” he said, not respectful and not disrespectful, “if I want to tell stories, I go to the theatre.”

“I do not want a story,” Lyall said. “I want a detail so devoid of glory that no paper will use it to end a paragraph. This is my fee for turning out my pockets.”

Inspector Meres looked at him and then at the room and then at the ordinary lamp and saw the trap: tell us nothing and be dishonourable; tell us something and you may keep some part of yourself unsaid. His mouth tensed as if around a bit. “The boy who stands at Rainhill with the flags,” he said, after a short and extremely precise struggle, “keeps bees. He has found that they will cluster on the signal lamps if he smears a sweet on the metal. He thinks it is beautiful when they make the green light look like an orchard. He does not do it often because he fears stirring men who will be stirred incorrectly. It is a thing he told no one. I know it because I know him better than his mother thinks. Will that do.”

“It will,” Lyall said, softened in a way he could not help and did not try. He handed over the letter. “We do not keep copies,” he added. “The paper may be yours. The contents will not behave as you wish.”

Inspector Meres took the letter without gratitude because that is how men persist in their lot. He glanced at Jack and did not bother with a speech. “When I require you,” he said, “I will make it seem a favour.”

“I like favours,” Jack said, which was a brave thing to say when a man had you at the end of a rope he had not yet thrown. “I like them so much I begin to collect my own.”

After Meres had gone, Martha breathed out as if someone had put a kettle on her lungs and removed it, and sat down with a radical uncouthness. “I do not like that man,” she said. “He is a story that thinks it is a law.”

“He is trying to keep the bees off the green light,” Lyall said, which was two kinds of unfair and therefore forgivable. He looked at Jack and Jack looked back and for a moment the room had no chairs in it at all; there was only the fact of men and the way facts make claims.

Leonard found that, later that night, when he went to the window, he did not see his reflection. The lamps outside had arranged themselves to keep him out. He saw instead the neighbour’s yard and a cat making a small but very determined journey along a wall of bricks that had outlived two men who argued over them in 1847 and had the decency to forget the argument. He stood with the triviality of it like a coin under his tongue. The voice that had been narrating his days was bored of the view and wandered off to try its fortune in the next room. His body did what it was meant to do. He closed the curtains. He went to the table where a slate lay with a sum on it and finished the sum. He went to bed and slept and woke once only to the sound of the kettle preparing its announcement, and smiled without feeling he had composed anything. He was not free and he was not bound. He was in a town that was teaching him to prefer the taste of water to the idea of wine, and he suspected that this, in the long arithmetic, was a scandalous kind of wealth.Chapter 6

The winter, having found the town’s measures to its liking, began to repeat itself with finesse. It iced the same doorstep three days running to see if the house would learn. It drew its white script along guttering and rail with the patience of a boy practicing a hand he intends to alter the world with later. Martha’s teapot routine acquired a ceremony no less honest for being domestic; she had a way of warming the pot as if she were asking it to remember its youth. The kettle clicked its prelude and Leonard, on mornings when his mind rose busy rather than clear, lay still to hear it, as if the house possessed a metronome that steadied his errant pacing. He had learned that the click and the burst after it were related in the way vows are related to marriages. It helped.

Jack arrived for his miseducation like a steward of his own impatience. It is one thing to urge a man to sit; it is another to keep him from inventing a way of sitting that amounts to flight. The first day he tried honesty like a hat and it suited him badly only because it was new. “There are ferrets in me,” he said, when Lyall instructed him to map his restlessness as if it were a county. “They live under the boards and they make a noise that makes sense of running. If you quiet the ferrets, I am afraid I will become a pillow.” Lyall, who respected ancient animals wherever they lived, told him to let them tunnel and to notice where the dirt came up.

They contrived rules not unlike a card game’s and honoured them exactly so long as their honouring did not become a performance. They sat for twenty minutes and spoke for two. They permitted words like a condiment: a shake over the bread of their being there. The house, which had grown used to hosting words because words are very fine guests when they know when to leave, adapted. Martha adjusted her tread on the kitchen tiles to a rhythm that kept the lid from jumping. Leonard grew alert to the goose in his chest that liked to flap at the oddest phrases; he fed it less. When a thought arrived with all the neon of Mr. North’s factory—and there were still many—he would set it aside and reach for a small work, the way a man takes up darning to keep his hands from the cards.

At the glassworks, Ganton’s frost-catcher was installed at furnace two with a ceremony appropriate to a contraption: a few jokes, a long look, and two men appointed to blame if it failed. It was a ladle turned into a lip, a curve of iron that kissed the air just where the frost liked to lay its tricks. The first hour it seemed quaint; the second it proved useful. The ice that would have made a man choose between dignity and balance lay captured in a neat white seam along the iron’s edge, prettily imprisoned. “We have offended winter,” Ganton declared with pride that embarrassed him, and the men pretended to scold him for his impiety and then drank his health with bowls of tea that tasted of the tin they were brewed in and something else that could be called relief.

Alfie Petter returned astride a crutch as if riding it to a race in which he had been given a head start. He carried under his arm a loaf his mother had sent to pay for bills she knew she had no hand in settling. “Tell your mother,” Leonard said, bending to the boy’s level so that propriety would not think itself obliged to intervene, “that I have been paid in full by the sound of Mr. Pell swearing, and that I will accept no more monies unless they are thrown at my head by mistake.” The boy, being of an age to enjoy both swearing and the idea of coins thrown at heads, smiled. He looked at the frost-catcher and nodded with the connoisseur’s sudden confidence of a youth who has elected to survive. “That’ll make the ice sulk,” he said. “Good.”

Letters and men moved through the town with the particular furtiveness of winter business. Inspector Meres was seen twice, standing in two different lanes with the same posture, which is how you know a man is not waiting for a person but for the town to make up its mind. He did not approach the counting-house above Peartree Lane because he had no need to; the house had already told him everything he wished it had not. It is very hard to be a secret when you are varnished. Mr. North did not oblige the inspector with appearances. Men who deal in paragraphs do not enjoy being asked for the footnotes. He sent, instead, a boy with a head like an ink blot and a card whose message, when held to the light, made the paper look thinner. “Our hours are those kept by precise clouds,” it said. “If you wait, we will pass overhead. If you run, you will exhaust yourself and arrive also under us. Yours in meteorology, N.”

Leonard, for his part, found that the bargain began to bend toward delicacy. He could feel the mechanism of his borrowed certainty as one feels the spring in a fine pen. On a morning when the town’s fog ate the corners of buildings and made sheep sound like street organs, Miss Lottie Young came into the yard with a length of blue serge as a pretext and the jacket of a man not otherwise particular as a project. “Will you tell me which cuff he ought to belong to,” she asked, because tailoring and judgement are sister professions and she liked to practice both. The sentence came to Leonard’s tongue that would have made her laugh and forgive herself a decade of choosing men with shoulders that failed later. He put it aside and said, “Make the cuff slightly longer. He will think you flatter his forearms. You will, in fact, save him from looking cheap.” She nodded, grateful for the simple thing, and he felt the pleased growl of the voice that had wanted to tease and be adored subside. He was learning to give away his cleverness and keep the consequences.

On a different afternoon, Martha mislaid her temper like a tray and declared, over flour, that she had “had enough.” She did not specify of what. The remark entered the house as if it had eyes. Leonard came into the kitchen because there are declarations that men of sense meet standing, not shouted through doorways. She was kneading with the violence she saved for tasks that could bear it. “Do not say anything that belongs on a card,” she warned him. “I am full of things and they do not want to be framed. I am sufficient woman to be full of rage and charity at once and the mixing bowl does not object, so neither should you.” He had been about to say something good. He took his hands off the words as if they were hot and stood in the doorway with the humility of a man who has been told that silence is participation and not a retreat. Later she handed him a heel of bread, which in their household counted as an absolution signed by the offices of appetite and sense. It made him inordinately fond of the word she had used. Enough. He rolled it in his head and found it did not glitter. That recommended it.

Lyall went to Liverpool and returned without his pockets altered, which is one way of saying that he had not allowed the city to decide his mood by jingling at him. He had seen a bookseller with a moustache like a thesis and had read the first page of three novellas that belonged to a continent he had not visited, their sense of women so foreign that he found himself laughing in the aisle and buying nothing out of respect for the paper. He had stood by the docks and watched labour in that peculiar metropolitan choreography where men look like facts being moved up a diagram. He had thought of the trestle water at Rainhill and liked it better. When he came home and met the inspector’s demand with a bee, and delivered his letter for a dullness, and resumed his chair with Jack seated opposite as if in an illustration of Patience and Mischief learning to share a bench, he felt that he had been given the kind of day that does not glitter and grows, later, into memory’s favourite.

Martha, who understood merit like a miser understands coin, took to instructing the pupil in her own manner. “Here,” she said to Jack, “peel these.” He considered the pile of potatoes as if she had asked him to translate a law. “I am asked to be humbled,” he said wryly, and looked to Lyall for rescue that did not come. “You are asked,” Martha returned, “to contribute. If you must call it a lesson, call it that.” He tried eloquence on the peeler and nicked himself immediately, bled like a good man, and did not look up with the appeal the world had taught him to count on. He put his thumb in his mouth and laughed at himself and then resumed. After an hour, he had learned the measure of a good shaving and the moral value of keeping a bowl under the knife so that skins do not go traveling. “It is harder to run when one’s hands are doing the right thing,” he admitted, tired and pleased. “There is only room for so much hero in a day,” Martha answered, and he grinned at her and considered for the first time that a woman could be a horizon rather than a stage.

The inspector returned, not to the house but to the pub, where he made of himself a pillar that men had to go around. He had the knack of detecting the instant when a story would go from being the property of a single mouth to belonging to the table. He let it become public and then helped himself to the bits nobody wanted, which is how he won. He asked after Jack not with menace but with the deliberate casualness of a man who plans to drop by. He inquired as to whether Mr. Temple had yet admired the brake trick in private with the admiration he had displayed in public with fury, which won him three friends and two enemies in as many sentences. He did not mention the bees again because he was not sentimental twice.

Mr. Temple sent a note in a hand that had learned to write only as much as a man needs to for machines to obey him. It asked whether Leonard and his tutor would like to see the night work at the east end, where rivets were driven at such a speed that even clocks watched to learn how to be swift without losing their minds. “It is not a dignified art,” the note admitted with candour. “It is hammering something hot until it is where it should be. But the men do not require dignity to be excellent. Come. You will enjoy envying them.” They went because envy, properly chosen, is an appetite that spares a man worse hungers. The night air was the town’s own brand, honest and slightly medicinal. Lanterns made little lakes of yellow across smoke. Men moved with the certainty that comes of repetition and the grace that repetition rarely receives credit for. A rivet came glowing out of the forge small as a wound and moved, in three practiced gestures—throw, catch, drive—from could to must. The catcher’s tongs met it like the mouth of a sermon. The hammer sang it into place. The noise had in it none of the malice of cannon and all of the malice of necessity. Lyall watched with the sort of expression his pupils filed away and imitated later when they wanted to look as if they were learning. Leonard felt the voice at his ear begin to narrate the men’s motions, their families, the dinners awaiting the hands, the metaphors about hearts and heat and human industry, and he told it firmly, like a dog invited to the table, to lie down. He stood with his hands in a pocket that had thinned at the corner and said nothing and watched and envied well. “There is a satisfaction that does not require witness,” he said finally, allowed a ration of words. “I think I have tasted it and then it goes, but here it stays.”

Temple smiled without triumph. “You will always have a taste for secondhand bread,” he said. “We all do. It is better for us than cake we bake alone. I have rarely met a solitary genius I would trust to hold a rivet.”

On a Thursday the sky committed to snow and then broke its promise and rained in a sulk. The lane outside the Fairbrooke house took the mood like a weak tea. A woman came along with a child in a coat that had belonged to an older cousin and had inherited his mischief. The boy sang about the dead as he had always done, pausing on the word in the way children do when they learn that language has trapdoors. “Hush now,” the woman said without belief, and cast an apologetic smile toward Martha, who was fasting from apology for the rest of the week and did not accept the offering politely or rudely. She handed the child a biscuit because she believed in conversion by food.

Jack’s fortnight of sitting made him acute to the world’s invitations and ruder for being able to decline some of them. Men came to him with plans—an open carriage and no lamps on a night when the moon would condescend to provide; a scheme contingent on an inaccuracy in a manifest; a comic theft from a man who deserved the humiliation of discovering that his pocket was full of holes even when his trousers were new. He said no to all of them and yes to one thing only: a small errand that had to do with the boy at Rainhill with the bee habit. It was told clumsily and for the wrong reasons. A fellow, who thought himself a character and was only a voice, had laughed about the honey on the lamp and the way bees make a green a priest would mistake. Jack did not laugh. He walked to the station at dusk and took from the boy’s hand the jar he had used as if taking from a small god a relic that had become dangerous. He carried it to the canal and tasted a drop and declared, because he was himself, “Too sweet,” and pitched it in. The boy did not thank him. He told him, later, a piece of the truth and Jack said, “I would rather your mother stole my purse than the light stole you a train,” and left and did not tell Leonard because he had discovered, to his irritation and relief, that one may keep a secret without courting heroism.

Of Mr. North there were whispers in respectable voices. The bank found its ledgers squinting as if the ink had had a thought and rewritten itself in the night. A man who had climbed up above his debts by lying with the musicality of an organ found that his tune had been borrowed by a clerk upstairs and played for him until he learned to be disgusted with himself, which was precisely the clause Mr. North favoured and seldom got attached to a banker. Mrs. Danae, who loved a scandal that did not require her to be the mirror in the middle of it, declared over a plate of cakes and a cup of coffee that did not need the sugar it had been given: “Our Mr. North has tired of setting traps for mice. He is building a hedge-maze for hounds. Watch the men who think themselves sleek.” No one asked her meaning because she liked to be asked and did better work when she was not.

The day came, inevitably, when Leonard paid. He had been warned. He did not recognise it at first as that day because accounting often looks like the delivery of a box you forgot ordering and would deny in any case. It was a small visit of grief and he failed to be kind. A woman who had been a girl with him and had never noticed that he counted because he did not wish to frighten himself brought to his office a piece of news that asked for the oldest prayer. Her father had died without warning in his chair. He had been pouring beer and his hand had gone to rest believing itself dismissed. She wanted to tell Leonard not because he could do anything and not because she had made a study of men who listen, but because he had been there when she learned her letters and he had once, when they were twelve, told her she did not have to read the Bible aloud on the day she had a cough that sounded like the steam-pipes. She sat in the chair across from him and began, bravely, to cry with more discipline than men expect. He felt the old machine in him whirr. He said a sentence about fathers and chairs that was very fine and would have won a small cheer in a room of men who like sincerity when it is placed at a safe height on a shelf. The sentence left his mouth and he heard it: the ribbon, the neatness, the gift of being clever instead of being a hearth. She flinched. She did not mean to. The flinch was tiny and honest. He stopped speaking. He took her hand and sat in a silence that did not burn her. He felt the day make its mark under his skin: a scratch that would be sore tonight and scar later. When she left she said, “Thank you for saying nothing,” and he thought, by himself and to no narrative: the price is not death but a habit, and we pay in failed tendernesses that no one will invoice.

That evening he told Lyall without any of the polish such confessions enjoy in memoir. Lyall was unoffended by the lack of embroidery. “It will happen again,” he said, as if granting permission to misstep is the better way to mend a man’s walk. “You will sometimes catch yourself and sometimes not. One day you will be more sorry for the cunning you missed than the kindnesses you bungled. That will be the beginning of your ridiculous salvation. Meanwhile, do not scour yourself. The town needs you with skin.”

They played cards that night until the deck wore the shape of their small ambitions. Lyall let Leonard win three times and then did not because charity is a vice at a table. Jack, who was supposed to be sitting, leaned because that is a form of sitting men allow themselves. He had news he did not dress properly. “Inspector Meres wants a favour,” he said, agitation making him generous with the truth. “He wants me to bring a man to a corner so a friend of his can speak to him quietly. He thinks I will do it because he knows I like to be owed and hates me for it. I am thinking of saying yes and then betraying him at a second corner to a different man. This would be witty. It would also end in the labour of blood and I am tired of blood that keeps no books.”

“Tell the inspector,” Lyall said, dealing without authority and with ease, “that you have entered into a vow of boredom. It will annoy him more than treachery. Then keep the vow for one week. Keep it like a monk who does not expect heaven in exchange and has bread to bake at five.”

Jack laughed; he could not help it. “A vow,” he said. “I have avoided vows as one avoids puddles that hide deeper holes. But I like the sound of boredom used as a grand word. All right. A week. If I fail, I will return and sit in the hall and tell Martha I require penance.”

“You will peel twice the potatoes and you will not be allowed to taste them,” Martha said from the doorway in the crisp tone of a clerk reading out a penalty. “And I will tell your mother, if you have one. There is nothing like a mother told on to turn a poet into a man.” Jack bowed and declared himself beaten and that did him more good than fine philosophy.

On Sunday, the church performed its weekly act of remembering that it had been built for men who disliked looking at one another too directly. The sermon was about stewardship because all sermons are in winter. Leonard did not attend because he was mending a hinge that had decided to stop being part of the world, and because he had discovered that doing a thing to a door keeps you from wanting to argue with a man who has a notch in his voice where authority hides. Martha went because she liked the singing and because she had a hat that deserved to be seen. Lyall stayed home and read a poet who shook hands like a fish even on the page, and found the man’s lack of grip refreshing. Jack went to the canal and caught sight of a constable not Meres skipping stones with his daughter and almost laughed and did not because the moment was so round it required no coin.

News came from Cambridge in the form of an envelope that looked like half a tower. It had been reissued, this time to Lyall’s address via the route that respectable letters prefer. It was the same letter as before, which made it worse and better. It asked what it had asked. It praised him with the same priggish ardour. It offered him a stipend that would make rent commit to a more reasonable attitude. It spoke of Fellows’ Gardens and a river that liked itself but had the decency to be useful at times of flood. Lyall read it at the table with Martha’s jam under his thumb and Jack pretending to count cracks in the plaster while actually counting breaths. He did not say yes and he did not say no. He folded it and placed it under the leg of the table where it could perform a job.

“You’ll go when you are bored of us,” Martha said, and made a noise that could have been sorrow if she had not also been stirring a pot. “You will come back when you are bored of them. The trick will be to keep one good thing bored at a time, not all of them together.”

“I am very good at being unsatisfied,” Lyall said. “If I could be bored precisely and in a way that fed others I would call it a vocation.”

The weather altered its habit and gave the town a day of strange brightness. Light moved across brick and made it show off like a man in a borrowed suit. Mr. Pritchard took to his phaeton and drove about the streets with the dignity of a duke whose dukedom had been inherited last week. He stopped before the glassworks not because he wished to order but because he liked to see other things work for the same church he attended: the church of public approval. “Fairbrooke!” he called up to the office window, not loudly enough to be vulgar, just enough to be noted. “I have a scheme. It will benefit you in the way schemes benefit men who have too little time to weigh them. It is a mutual improvement society disguised as a dinner.” Leonard came down because he had been raised to respect the sound of brass buttons on a waistcoat. Mr. Pritchard explained, in the tidy breathless manner of a man who has been practising in a carriage, that he intended to bring together men of iron and men of paper to agree on certain minimum decencies. The decencies would be written out and read aloud and remembered by no one, but the agreeing would be seen. “You, Mr. Fairbrooke, are a fine hand at seeming to concur while actually altering what is being agreed to. This is a compliment and a finding. Come. We will exhibit being good. It very often produces the behaviour we show.”

“Bring me a list,” Leonard said, because lists calm madness. “If the decencies include care for boys who bleed on the floor, I will come. If they include words like ‘respectability’ and ‘deserving,’ I will send my regrets and Mr. Lyall with a pocket-pistol full of adverbs.” Mr. Pritchard laughed as if he had intended the answer and drove away, saluting a crowd that did not require it but liked the gesture against the pale day.

On the edge of town, under a sky that had considered snow and chosen sulk for the day, a small adventure tried to happen without permission and was interrupted by boredom. Jack, who had vowed and was therefore obliged, was accosted by a fellow who called himself Cousin as if that cancelled debts. He had a plan involving the changing of a name on a sheet of paper and the introduction of that paper into a place where men did not expect to have to distrust papers. “Five minutes,” Cousin promised, with the missionary brightness of the damned. “We go in, you lean, I speak, you say, ‘I have an appointment at three,’ and the man believes us because men believe that appointments are small gods. We go out. We eat stew I will buy with money that was waiting to be stolen anyway.” Jack felt the itch in his legs and in his mouth; he could see himself doing the lean. He imagined, in one unflattering swoop, Leonard’s face in disappointment and Lyall’s in academic patience and Martha’s in briskness. “I cannot,” he said. “I am consecrated to inaction.” Cousin stared at him as if he had announced a change of sex. “You are what?” Jack, who could not resist the impulse to perform even in the theatre of renunciation, sketched a sign in the air that could have been a cross and could have been a joke. “Bored,” he said. “I am practising it. It is an art. It hurts. Go without me.” Cousin swore in a manner that would have pleased Mr. Pell and left, dissatisfied and undeterred. There are men boredom cannot touch for long. He was one.

That night, perhaps because of the light and perhaps because patience is not an infinite resource even for those who honour it, Mr. North appeared in Leonard’s doorway with a face of civility that had peeled itself too carefully. He stood at the threshold until Martha had decided whether to offer him tea. She did and he accepted, and there was an understanding between them like a bridge of string. He sat in the front room as if the chair belonged to him and then made it not true by lowering his eyes. “Mr. Fairbrooke,” he said with an equanimity that made contradiction seem vulgar, “how goes our arrangement. Do not answer in full. Just point to the cupboard in which you keep your misgivings.”

“Second shelf,” Leonard said, to his own surprise and to Mr. North’s approval. “Behind the jar of pickled walnuts. I find if the lid is tight, I do not eat what is inside.” Mr. North laughed properly for once and became, for a sliver, only a man. “I never liked walnuts,” he admitted. “They have the air of knowing better than you how to be themselves.” He glanced at Lyall, who had come in and taken up his old place in the room without clowning his presence. “Tutor,” Mr. North said pleasantly. “How goes your unambitious revolution.”

“We have begun with potatoes,” Lyall said. “We are contemplating water next. By Advent we will have made the town safer by the turn of a latch.” Mr. North admired men who answered him without flourish. He observed Jack, who stood and sat in an arpeggio. “Ah,” he said, not unkind. “The pupil I did not seek. How good to find you bored. It becomes you better than mischief. It also suits mischief to have you apprentices.”

“What do you want,” Martha asked, because the economy of the house required every visitor to declare his currency. Mr. North accepted the rebuke and named his price. “Only a note,” he said. “A tiny one. The kind a man leaves when he has borrowed a book he intends to return. There will soon be a matter in which Mr. Temple and Mr. Pritchard will find themselves agreeing to disagree and then disagreeing to agree. I would like you, Mr. Fairbrooke, to say—when you can do the most harm with it—the word ‘enough.’ Say it as if it is not your word to say. Men will find in it the end of speeches and the beginning of a task. It will annoy me and help the town. I find I am rarely allowed to have both at once.”

“You are asking me to cut your own pocket,” Leonard said. “Or you are asking me to prove that I am not your pocket.”

“I am asking you to make it look as if chaos is your choice,” Mr. North said. “An illusion I am fond of. Please do it. You owe me nothing in this but your instinct.”

He left with two biscuits in his pocket because Martha had insisted that even devils require provisions if they are to leave your threshold promptly. When the door shut, the house exhaled as if it had been held in a pair of hands and released without being harmed. “He is a very honest liar,” Jack observed, and Lyall agreed with untidy generosity. Leonard, who had been given a prompt he did not intend to obey, found that the prompt did not care for his intentions. Words can be worse than water for finding their level.

The dinner happened as things always happen in St Helens that are meant to be public and private both: with a flourish at the door and a degree of repentance at the dessert. Mr. Pritchard stood at the head and spoke like a man who had purchased the right to define virtue for evenings and intended to be generous with definitions. Mr. Temple banged the table the exact number of times it takes to make clear that a man is engaged and not bored. The banker wiped his moustache after every joke to assure it of his allegiance. Mrs. Danae’s feather wobbled like a small white surrender that refused to surrender. The decencies began to be listed. Men have a way of making decency sound like a platform instead of a path. Leonard listened, sipped a wine he could not afford and did not desire, and felt that small pain that had ceased to be sorrow and was now patience. When Mr. Pritchard, with triumph edged in cordial, declared that it was only decent to require of any man seeking charity a letter of character from a person of standing, and that with such letters the town could sort the worthy from the merely unfortunate, and that thus organised pity might be useful, Leonard felt the word rise. He did not let it go at once. He watched it in his mouth like a piece of bread near the tongue’s bite. The room waited the way crowds wait for a penny to be thrown so their worthiness can be proven. He looked around it and saw the habit of permission in faces he liked and in faces he would not watch in a fire. He thought of Alfie’s mother’s pie and its unlooked-for goodness. He thought of Constable Wedge’s card and the way he had left his good sense with Martha to be given back when it would do him service. He thought of Jack peeling, which was not nobility and not poverty and fed men. He thought of Lyall putting a letter under a table leg. He put down his spoon and said, not as if he were clever, and not as if he had discovered anything, and not as if he had been given a line by a man in a red scarf, “Enough.”

The word entered the room without clearing its throat. It sat down and no one stood to introduce it. It made two men’s faces remember that cheeks are for more than smiling. Mr. Pritchard looked wounded in the precise way that is the cost of an idea being denied its parade. Mr. Temple turned his head because he knew the sound of a hammer that strikes home, even in conversation. Leonard’s voice did not climb. “I do not require letters from men with standing to determine whether to feed a man who is hungry,” he said, because a speech would have cheapened the shock the word had accomplished. “We will be decent to the decent and the indecent both. We will not make their lives a performance of gratitude in exchange for the dinner the town owes itself when it looks in a mirror.” Silence moved like a wheel that had not been greased for lack of time. Mrs. Danae laughed with genuine pleasure and her feathers forgave the room its sins. Mr. North was not present and was, nevertheless, the most present person there.

After, on the pavement, Mr. Temple took Leonard’s arm as if class could be avoided by touching hard. “Well done,” he said, raw with irritation and admiration. “You have begun a fight that is only useful if you do not win it. Be careful. Pritchard likes to be corrected when there are ladies. He does not like to be corrected when there are ledgers.”

“I will bring him a list,” Leonard replied, and Temple laughed despite himself. “Bring him a ledger,” he said. “Learn him to fear a column if you must.” They parted with the knowledge that they would need one another, which passes for affection in men who prefer iron to sentimentality.

That night the house enjoyed a calm of the kind that makes small noises loud. The clock in the hall decided to expand its tick and regained its humility later without apology. Martha hummed one of the hymns the church pretends it does not like because it makes ladies cry to no purpose. Lyall wrote one sentence in his notebook and closed it as if it might bite him for having concluded a thought too neatly. Jack, bruised in his vanity by the extent to which he had enjoyed sitting all day, asked for two more potatoes to peel and then asked, daringly, for one to eat, which Martha denied because she had said she would and because he had asked nicely.

Leonard stood by the kettle and listened like a man who had discovered a rare bird on the branch of his own hedge. The click came, quiet and inevitable. For once he did not turn to anyone and say what it reminded him of. He lifted the kettle and poured and handed a cup to Lyall without a flourish. The town, outside, drew its black lines. The frost began its nightly handwriting. In the yard, the contraption at furnace two slept like a thing proud of being useful and unafraid of being dull. In the counting-house above Peartree Lane, Mr. North folded a red scarf and placed it in a drawer where he kept his jokes. Inspector Meres, alone in a small room, looked at a letter and did not read it because he had extracted from it what mattered, which was the name of a man who cared enough to be recruited and a place where a boy kept bees. Jack lay in his bed with his calves twitching and felt, through the noise, a small room of quiet in his chest he had not rented and did not intend to sublet. He had earned it with boredom and thought it dear.

Morning, when it came, proved the same as most mornings do and was therefore precious. The teapot was warmed before the tea. The coalman coughed his report to the street. The neighbour’s child sang the song about the dead again and added a verse of his own that made no sense but had the cadence of sense, which is how songs begin. Leonard took up his hat, found himself wanting to go a different way to the works, and went the same as always because he had learned that novelty is not a cure. In the yard he met a man with a complaint that deserved adjudication and did not receive a speech. “We will mend the board,” he said. “We will pay you for the boot. We will tell Mr. Pell to keep his jokes for surgeries and not for stoops.” The man nodded once and went away and the world did not require any opining. It was delicious.

At noon, Elias Sugg came panting with a rumour that he had to deliver before it went cold in his mouth. “Heard?” he asked, which is a manner in town of sharing bread. “There’s talk—your Mr. Lyall is to be offered a small room with a large window and men to argue with who will not go home and tell their wives they were bored. Cambridge has written him twice. I thought you ought to know so you can say—something.” Leonard did not take the bait, which disappointed Elias in the way men are disappointed when their friends refuse to show off the tricks they have learned. “I have said what I needed to say,” Leonard told him, which was not quite true and very useful. “He will go if he goes; he will stay if he stays. Duties continue either way. Also, Elias, if you hear men saying that a boy at Rainhill keeps bees on signal lamps, tell them that bees don’t read. It will throw them off the scent.” Elias laughed because he loved an instruction that doubled as gossip, and ran off to tell the pub that bees had learned their letters.

The day plunged toward its dusk with the smugness of a winter afternoon that believes it is a night. Leonard went home with his hands full of small solutions and felt, in the pocket of his coat, the weight of nothing much and called it treasure. He passed The Grand and saw, under its ridiculous dome, Mr. Pritchard practicing hurt in a mirror to see if it could be made charming. He passed Peartree Lane and noticed that the curtained window upstairs had altered its murk by half a shade, which meant something to someone. He passed the signal by the canal and saw a boy in a coat too big stand up straight when a constable came round the bend; the constable tipped him a hat and the boy pretended not to preen. The town was teaching its own decencies one by one without asking mercy of committees. It pleased him past the reach of argument.

In the parlour, Lyall was cutting cards with a frown of concentration that meant he would lose without bitterness. Jack was on the floor under the table because—for reasons he explained without being asked—a splinter had offended him and he intended to bring it to account. Martha came in wearing an apron with flour like a flag and said, without preface: “Inspector Meres has sent a boy. He asks whether you have time for an appointment at three.” Leonard pictured Cousin’s grin, Jack’s calves, and the inspector’s way of making favours sound like whistles. He looked at Lyall, who shrugged with the economy of a man who has decided that to choose is to be born and one must be born often if one intends to live. “Tell the inspector,” Leonard said to Martha, “that I am bored at three. If he wishes to see me then, he will have to learn to be bored also.”

Martha smiled and went to the door and did precisely that. The boy, who had not expected to be taught a new catechism on a weekday, carried away the word like a foreign coin. Inspector Meres, wherever he was, would bite it to test its metal. The kettle, some minutes later, made its honest small sound. They stood hearing it, three men and a woman, and it did not invite commentary because it did not require witnesses to do its appointed work. They drank and then they went back to the work of being unremarkable well. The town, grateful for a reprieve from the show, went on drawing its slow black chalk across the sky and dared them not to love it. They yielded with the stubbornness that looks like virtue and often is only endurance, which, correctly applied, can be a grace.Chapter 8

The morning after the dinner of decencies the town tried to pretend that nothing at all had been spoken in its name. Shops opened as they always did, with the proprietors adopting that tender bravado men wear when they have done sums late and slept on the result like a hard loaf under the pillow. Mr. Pritchard’s phaeton did not appear in the street, which offered the illusion that wheels had, of their own accord, declined to be associated with him for a day. This was false, of course; wheels do not moralise, they wear. But the absence permitted small men to stand a fraction taller at their counters. Leonard walked to the works with the ordinary weight of his coat and the extraordinary lightness a man carries when he has spoken a simple word in a room that overvalued syllables. He was ready for reprisals and did not rehearse any answers because he liked the thought of meeting them with potatoes and a ledger rather than flourishes.

At the yard gate a boy in a cap too large for him had chalked, in a hand that would one day improve by the simple expedient of hunger, the word “Enough.” It had an unfortunate curve where the second e sat like a duck. Ganton stood beside it with his arms folded and his mouth suspiciously small, which was his way of being pleased. “Who did that,” Leonard asked, not in order to scold but because he liked to give credit in a place that had been taught to keep its head down. “Alfie, I expect,” Ganton said, lying for the sheer delight of backing a boy into praise. Alfie, hobbling past on his crutch and eating a piece of bread that did the work of breakfast and comfort both, shook his head and pointed with his whole chin at the foundry, which was exactly the modesty one ought to suspect of a boy who liked to be admired for other boys’ acts. The word remained all day, weathered by boots and the day’s coal bloom, and at close of work Ganton took a brush and did not scrub it because it pleased him to let men step over it and be annoyed by their own hearts.

Pritchard’s answer arrived by other delivery. At ten a man from the bank appeared with a gentle hat and a less gentle notice that certain lines of credit were to be reviewed on account of a town-wide prudence that had taken hold of responsible institutions. It was so courteously worded that the reader almost wanted to congratulate the pen. The foreman read it twice and placed it on the desk as if it might change its mind if left facing the light. Leonard read it and felt the little machine in him begin to build a phrase that compared a gentleman’s prudence to a fox’s interest in hens. He did not say it. He took a sheet of cheap paper and wrote a list of the men whose week would be altered by a bank manager’s epiphany. He wrote beside each name the small debt the works owed him in kindness and bread. He wrote alongside that the name of a supplier who could be persuaded to play at patience. He wrote lastly the two women in town who could turn sixpence into eight meals without having to be saints to do it. He folded the paper and put it in his pocket like a coin that would burn if left in sight. “We will fetch coal on account and we will pay Mr. Temple from the pocket we do not show the bank,” he told the foreman, who nodded because he understood the town’s advanced arithmetic. “And we will start a ledger of the undeserving,” he added, and the foreman frowned exactly long enough to enjoy disapproval and smiled because he trusted a man who could make a joke look like the opposite of a joke.

The ledger was a book with a brown cover that had once been a wallpaper sample. Martha wrote the title in her kitchen hand because it would shame men who expected a clerk’s script to feed their vanity. It said, in stout upright letters, “Fund for Those Without Letters,” and this was the sort of wit no one could be offended by without looking very bad indeed. When Leonard brought it home and placed it on the mantel, Martha eyed it as if it might scuttle. “Very well,” she said, “but it will not live here. It will live in my pantry with the jam because bread tastes better if it remembers that sweetness might occur without being advertised. If men ask, I will show them the page with their names on it; some will give to prove they are not stingy, and others because they do not wish to be in a book with that title. We will take all that arrives and we will give it without singing over the bowl.” Lyall, who had a respect for theologies that worked in boots, approved the pantry as a church and made a collection by doing nothing more than telling two women of consequence that he thought the title a trifle vulgar. They loved it at once and would have sold their husbands’ second-best coats to please a man who had told them they were clever without spoiling the compliment.

Mr. Temple sent a cart of coal to the alley and had the driver say, with the innocence exact to the occasion, that it had been misdelivered and could not be taken back on account of the horse’s sentiments. Mr. Pritchard, when apprised of this charity, wrote a letter to himself in which he praised his own magnanimity and read it over dinner, his wife underlining the word “magnanimity” as if it were a recipe she intended to perfect. Mr. North, hearing of the pantry book because he heard everything the town tried not to tweet to him in its sleep, smiled as a man smiles when the plot he wrote himself begins to improve without his hand. He wrote nothing to Leonard because restraint is the most expensive ink.

Inspector Meres appeared in the manner he had chosen as his uniform: by being there when no one had prepared an attitude. He arrived in the yard at the works at a moment when a great deal of nothing of interest was occurring, which is to say the very heart of labour’s day. He watched a man set aside a shovel with the care usually given to babies, only to pick it up again because his hand had been amusing itself. He waited to be noticed in the way he liked, as if he were a fence post that had always been part of the fence and had decided to speak at last. “Mr. Fairbrooke,” he said, when the foreman nodded in his direction, addressing him as if they had been corresponding. “A word that is not a visit.” Leonard nodded because he respected men who spoke in such economy and stepped into the small office where the window made the outside look like theatre you could close. Meres did not take the chair. He looked at it, considered the advantage of appearing to be above sitting, and then sat because there was nothing to be proven by knees. “I will say my piece bluntly,” he began, and this was a relief because the man was a tidy instrument, a blade in need of its proper work. “There is to be, tonight or tomorrow, depending on whether fools win time from better men, a trial of a device at the east signal. It is a cousin to the trick learned at Rainhill, but not so clever. It will stop a goods train long enough for a bag to depart the world. I would like there to be no bag and no trick and no men arrested on account of having chosen poorly at a young age. Will you ask your friend not to be near that place until the day after it would be boring to be there.”

Leonard listened and felt that little sensation he was learning to recognise as the moral equivalent of blood returning to a limb: the wish to arrange information without decor. He did not promise because promises are a currency and one must be careful what shop one spends them in. “If you have a map,” he said, “fold it and hand it me and I will put it in a drawer Jack Marlowe cannot open without being inconveniently observed.” Meres took from his pocket not a map but a phrase written on a strip of paper; he had been a clerk once, somewhere, in a life he wore under his current coat like a warm shirt. “A torque of iron on the pin,” the paper said, which was either a charm or an idiot’s poem. “That is all that is necessary,” Meres observed dryly, “which is why it is very dangerous. Men who can do something this small do not think themselves criminals because it does not make them breathe hard. Tell your Mr. Marlowe he is to be a monk an extra day. If he wishes to confess, he may come to me and I will pillory him with boredom until he recants his taste for show. I have sympathy for a man who enjoys a crowd; it is a disease we share. I prefer different crowds.” Leonard folded the strip and put it in the ledger of the undeserving because it seemed appropriate that it sit under the word “bread.” He looked at Meres and thought of bees and boys and men with pockets of letters they had not written. “You will not catch the men who own the bag,” he said mildly, and Meres allowed himself a blink that did not settle how long his patience would last. “No,” he said. “But I will keep the bag from being an absence a boy marries.”

Jack returned to the house at an hour that had the decency to be called afternoon and not evening, wind-chafed and honest with lack of achievement. He had nothing to report, which sat on him like a stolen coat that fit. Martha put him down to carrots because penance ought to have a colour and he accepted the knife without asking it to be a metaphor. When Leonard told him what Meres had said, his jaw did its old trick of moving half an inch to the left, as if making room for a thought. “I like not going where I am told not to go,” he said, making of disobedience a garment he tried on with rueful affection, and then he set the knife down without theatricality. “I’ll not go. There is a man—Cousin—who will go in my place and will think himself clever for having gone. He will not be clever. He will be a man counting blades of grass and calling it a census. If anyone must be bored at the east signal, let it be me standing away from it.” Lyall, who disliked the scent of intrigue even when it wore soap, said only, with that lightness he employed when he did not want to be seen to beg: “If you fail, I will take your place at the peeling for a week, which is cruel to potatoes and men alike.” Jack laughed and swore the domestic oath he had begun to favour: “I will not shame the kitchen.”

On the road between the town and the little station that had taught itself to like being looked at, a man from Cambridge came in a coat that believed weather to be a misunderstanding. He had hair that parted itself and a jaw that had decided not to be a feature but a policy. His name was Mr. Avery and he carried with him the smell of bindings and a slight crackle, as if his pockets contained the husk of a century. He had written two letters that had not arrived and then one that had, and had been told by a man with a dripping nose on a platform in Liverpool that any letter worth more than a day’s wage should be handed to no one but the person whose hand one intended it for. He arrived at the Fairbrooke door and was taken in by Martha as if he were an item to be sorted into the proper drawer. He removed his gloves in careful inches, that he might not take the hand with the glove, and said, not impolitely and not as one speaking to equals, “I am looking for Mr. Lyall.” Martha, whose hatred for mistaken drawers is legendary in her small circle, showed him into the parlour and then went to the kitchen to remove from the oven a pudding that refused to represent all puddings and was intent on being its own.

Lyall came down from his little upstairs room where he had been teaching himself the virtue of stopping a thought and finishing it later. He had seen the horse at the kerb and had known at once that the university had sent him not a letter but a man. He smoothed his hair like a boy and then undid the smoothing because he had learned that effort often undoes what dignity does without trying. Mr. Avery rose and offered him the hand of a man who had shaken more hands than he had ever counted. “Mr. Lyall,” he said, pleased to pronounce a name correctly and be seen to do a small thing well. “I am Avery. I carry with me the authority of a college and the impertinence of a younger son. We would have you, if you will be had, to tidy a corner of a department that is brilliant and untidy in equal portions. I brought no letter because letters around here acquire adventures. I brought instead a short memory I hope we will share. You will come to Cambridge for a fortnight at our expense. You will be given a room that looks at water politely. You will read with two boys who intend to be senators of an empire that may decline to exist by the time they are ready to sen. You will argue with a man old enough to have been wrong twice and young enough to change. You will walk in a garden planted by a lady with more wit than is permitted and find it improves your arguments. After a fortnight you may say no or yes or ask us to stop calling at your house. I am not a thief. I have no sack. I have brought only this. If your town cannot spare you, I will bear away your refusal and make of it a step my ambition will fall from later.”

He spoke well enough to avoid being despised for speaking, and with sufficient admission of the ridiculousness of his offer to be admired for doing a ridiculous thing without blush. Lyall stood with his hands open like a man who had been given several cards and told there was no game, only the pleasure of holding paper. He looked at Leonard and saw the honesty that makes a friend a property the world cannot tax. He looked at Martha and saw the kitchen cupboard labelled “bread” and the pantry book that had already earned its first spill. He looked at Jack and saw a pupil who would do very well with him or without him, which is the sort of knowledge that frees and wounds a teacher in three equal stripes. “I will come for a week on trial,” he said, the compromise of a man who wishes to be proud of his plainness later. “I will teach the two boys until they are disgusted and the old man until he is bored. I will walk by your water with a look that is not prayer. I will bring back any virtues I steal and account for them in full. I will not apologise to the town for stepping out of it because the town is too well-bred to require that much pantomime. If, at the end, I ask for a room with a window, you may offer it then. If I do not, take the expenditure to be your tithe to a county with chimneys.”

Mr. Avery did not clap because he disliked performing joy. He smiled and his jaw forgave itself its profession. “Excellent,” he said. “I will see that you are paid in train tickets and indifference, the two currencies in which we are richest.” He drank the tea Martha brought him with an interest that told her he was not hopeless, and admired the jam as if it were a footnote he had learned more from than the text.

That night, after Avery had left and taken with him only the air he brought, the house arranged itself around the absence it anticipated. Lyall enumerated to Martha the tasks he would abandon and she did not thank him for the list because she liked men to be of use without making her measure it for them. “I will make of his week a debt you owe me,” she said sweetly, and Leonard laughed because sweetness pressed upon a threat is the one confection he always orders. Jack, offended by how strongly he wanted Swithin to go and return and be improved in exactly the ways that would make him more intolerable, offered to watch the pantry book as if it were a clock with a temper. “I can be a hinge,” he said, half boasting and half tender, and Leonard thought: there is a boy who has begun to learn where to put himself in a house.

The affair at the signal played itself out half a mile from where the town believes the law begins. Jack did as he had sworn and did not go to the place where his calves and cousins would have taken him. He went instead to the bridge that was duller by far and stood with his hands in his pockets like a man whose future is in coin and who intends to touch none of it in case it burns. From where he stood he could hear men failing to be secret. The voice called Cousin said a word too loud because it loved the sound of its own bravery. The iron made a sound that iron makes when a stranger asks it to be otherwise than honest. The train did not slow because Temple’s men had learned how to ignore tremors attempted by amateurs. It passed, ordinary and enormous, and the failure of adventure lay on the tracks like something men would not write about and would therefore be safest to live with. A constable stepped from shadow and lit his pipe at a distance that suggested intimacy with both pipe and shadow. He did not announce himself to be Meres because he was not; Meres had found his bed and lay in it with his eyes open in order to discover whether sleep, like some women, could be coaxed into arriving by being ignored. The constable looked at Jack and Jack looked at him and both of them decided that this was a night on which one could allow an affront to go unrecorded. In the morning there would be a different courage to practice.

Success, when it does not bring in its wagon trumpets and flags, is mistaken for coincidence. The next day men said there had been no attempt at the signal because nothing had occurred and therefore nothing had been attempted. Meres did not boast and the men who had been bored in the right place did not ask to be congratulated. Leonard took the strip of paper with the iron’s little poem and dropped it into the fire because sometimes one instructs oneself to be symbolic and the only safe symbols are those that are cooked. He wrote in the pantry book a note that said “coal for the Allertons” and beneath it “quiet night at the east,” and Martha baked that phrase into a pie by the ordinary alchemy. They fed three people who had thought to be fed by excitement and were surprised to be nourished by meat.

Mr. Pritchard’s retaliation arrived in the form of a speech delivered to the town’s board of something or other, a body that meets for the purpose of blessing itself. He spoke in favour of letters of character and the duty of the respectable to maintain a fence around charity that vagabonds cannot climb without getting splinters. It was a strong fence and an ugly one and the people who liked fences nodded. Mr. Temple, through some subterfuge involving the chair and the need to keep the meeting legal, invited Leonard to speak. He stood without enjoyment and spoke with a boredom that carried the whole. “We will feed men we have never seen before,” he said. “We will feed men we have seen too often. We will not ask for letters because hunger eats paper. If this offends you, please be mocked at your leisure in places where mocking will improve you.” He sat and the fence-makers looked at him with the embarrassment of men told that their hats do not suit their heads, and they put their hats back on and wore them anyway. Mrs. Danae, in a corner, watched with the interest of a woman whose talents have always been under-applied by men who think themselves good at application. She made a note to send a tin of sugar to Martha and to write a cruel line about Mr. Pritchard’s buttons.

The day before Lyall’s departure for his trial week, the house enacted a small rite as if it had acquired a religion and would like to test it privately. Martha boiled a chicken because farewells are best padded with blandness. Jack brought flowers he had stolen from a hedge that would not miss them and was rebuked and then forgiven because every act in the house could be converted into instruction. Leonard found himself misplacing things with the deliberate incompetence of a boy who wishes to be kept from abandonment. Lyall sat and wrote a letter not to anyone but to himself as if he were a pupil who would be late to class and needed a note to hand in to the teacher he might become. He put into it only three sentences. The first admitted that he hoped to be liked and was a little ashamed of the hope. The second told him to be bored with cleverness at least twice a day. The third asked him to bring home one thing he could put in Martha’s pantry that would not spoil. He did not sign it, folded it, and slid it under the pantry book to give it a habit of being near useful things.

On the morning of the train, he stood in the doorway and was kissed on both cheeks by Martha as if she wished to declare France in the house and then forgot to. Leonard shook his hand with the gravity that men save for burying and weddings and departures that hurt without requiring flowers. Jack, having learned to make ceremony without silliness, brought him to the gate and said, with genuine humility, “Bring me back a word that makes three men good work,” and Lyall promised and then did not promise because promising seemed impertinent to the work he would be interrupting. The kettle clicked as he left, and the sound followed him as far as the station like a small brass band that would not play anything beyond its prelude. On the platform, Mr. Avery stood with the impatience of a man whose schedule has been married to him by a rail. He was relieved to see Lyall carry no books; it suggested a mind that would not attempt to pack itself ahead of time.

The train took them up in that indifferent way that feels like love when you are going somewhere that may save you. They sat opposite one another like men in a picture about decision and spoke of nothing in particular because the particular has always been the only safe company for men on the brink. Avery pointed out a bridge that engineering journals had once petted and had since moved on from, the way journals do when their hearts are fickle. Lyall nodded and thought of Temple catching rivets like fiery cherries thrown by a friend. He did not hate the fields for being rich and did not adore them for being green. He watched them with a soul that had stopped asking to be narrated and found that this was a charm against pride.

In St Helens, in the afternoon, when the sun tried on a theatrical exit it had never earned, Mr. North walked down Harris Street without his scarf, dressed like a man who wished to pass for something less precise than himself. He paused outside The Raven and Wheel and considered going in and chose not to because he liked to be perverse only when it produced results that could be counted. He went to Peartree Lane instead and into his counting-house, which smelled of varnish and of whispers that had sat too long and become lacquer. He took from his drawer a piece of paper and wrote on it one sentence: “A hedge-maze requires a hound who will refuse the shortest path.” He folded it and did not deliver it by messenger or by boy with an ink blot for a head. He kept it like a talisman for his own pocket, a charm against his worst habit, which was to win too soon and lose his appetite.

Inspector Meres, that evening, found himself standing under a gas lamp that had not learned to be reliable. He had seen a boy down the street smearing a sweetness against a metal as if he were writing a secret on a priest’s sleeve. He had looked at the boy and the boy had looked at him with the wheaten gaze of a child who has lied so rarely he is bad at it. He did not scold because scolding sometimes tills the wrong ground. He said only, “If a bee is to read your signal, it will need schooling,” and the boy, who had not been told that his joke had been found out, grinned without guilt and promised to keep his swarm for summer. Meres walked on with the small ease that comes of a catastrophe delayed and permitted himself to wish for an evening in which he was not the man responsible for the moral weather.

Martha, washing cups that had decided to be clean that day, looked out into the lane where the frost had whitened the sill like a grandmother’s hair. A woman passed with a parcel tied in a mean string. Martha opened the back door and called to her without speaking, which is a trick women learn when they wish to be obeyed kindly. The woman came in because she wanted to and because saying no to Martha on a cold day is a way of declaring that you do not know your own name. They sat and did not talk of letters or of decency. They sliced bread and were sufficient. Leonard, at the door, watched the exchange and felt a quiet that was not empty and a gratitude that had no object. He went to the parlour and found the pantry book, set it upon the table and wrote in it in a hand that had been to school and come home. He wrote, “For Mrs. Allerton, meat enough,” and drew a line beneath, and felt that drawing a line could be the neatest prayer a man ever said.

In Cambridge, toward evening, Lyall stood in a room with a high window and a desk that had been built for a man who believed his words required width. He touched the surface and felt dust that had manners. Mr. Avery left him to himself because men like Avery know when to offend and when to charm and had offended enough railings for the day. Lyall looked out at a river that had not the least intention of impressing him and found it better for its indifference. A bell somewhere claimed the hour to itself like a thief and he smiled at the way confidence and theft share scaffolding. He sat and for the first time since he had begun to teach boys who thought arguments were sport, he felt both anxious and hopeful in the same breath and did not call either feeling virtue. He took from his pocket a small object he had bought in Liverpool in a shop that had nothing useful in it: a wooden spoon carved by a hand that had intended to be careful and had been rewarded. He put it on the sill and told himself, in decent mockery, that he had fulfilled his letter to himself. The next day he would meet the boys and the old man. He would listen until he had something worth saying and then say less than that. He would write to Martha about a cupboard that squeaked in an honourable way. He would write to Leonard about hot rivets by another name. He would write to no one the way a drowning man does not write to water.

Back at the works, late, Leonard found Ganton waiting by the door with the impatience of a man who has been given the chance to be right. “The contraption at furnace three is sulking,” Ganton said. “It catches frost fine but it weeps water in a way that makes men slip out of pure spite. I can make it bow this instead of that; I can make it think it is clever where it is honest. Man might come off with his dignity then.” Leonard went with him because he liked to stand with men who had proposed solutions and needed merely a witness to solidify their courage. They altered the curve with a hammer and a curse and the contraption behaved, as machines often do, when reminded that men had made them. Leonard left Ganton with the satisfied scowl of a man who had preserved lives in a small way and did not require a wreath about his name. He went home by the long route because he wanted to see the signal and the boy and to practice not searching for metaphors. He passed The Grand and saw Mr. Pritchard in conversation with a mirror that was winning. He passed Mr. North’s window and imagined he saw a red scarf folded like a tongue. He passed the lane where men hired themselves out to luck and heard the hymn of a drunk sung at a key that would do the parish organist no good at all. He opened his own door and the kettle made its small sound and he realised, with that pleased start that sometimes visits men who have given up expecting miracles, that he had not thought once, during the six minutes of that walk, of what he would say if narrated. He had been inside his life instead of beside it. He stood still and liked very much how dull it was.

On the third day, news travelled from Cambridge faster than trains permit because gossip takes short roads. Mr. Avery had been seen walking with a tutor who laughed and did not apologise for it. The boys had written a note home to a mother that said, “He is not like the others in the interesting way, not the wicked.” A porter had declared that the new gentleman had thanked him in a manner that made the thanks an item of use. These were the sort of rumours that make their way down via Liverpool like drops falling from an awning. Jack and Martha, reading nothing, felt them as weather. Leonard pretended not to know that he listened at the space between doors for the change in pressure that announces a letter that matters. Inspector Meres condescended to allow himself to be told by a clerk that the tutor had been seen in a hall made for echo and had not allowed his voice too much of it. Mr. North was told nothing he did not already suspect and permitted himself an unhandsome rest.

That afternoon, Pritchard took his revenge in the only way that several generations of sugar had permitted him half-master: he hosted a tea for ladies and conquered their sympathies. He spoke of waste in charity and men encouraged to laziness by handouts. He spoke the word “undeserving” with the satisfaction a man derives from using a tool correctly in public. Mrs. Danae ate him with cake and put him down with the sort of grace one wishes to marry. “Mr. Pritchard,” she said sweetly, “if deservingness existed in the manner you desire it to exist, your waistcoat would be thinner. We are all beneficiaries of cheats. The town has decided to cheat hunger in favour of the hungry. Your contribution, if you are so keen on credits, will be to regret it elegantly. We will let you know when and where.” The ladies laughed without sound and Pritchard drank his tea and put the cup down with a decision that hurt the saucer and soothed nothing else.

Jack’s vow expired without pomp and he celebrated by asking to go nowhere of consequence. He walked the long way to the canal and back and did not jump on a moving wagon once. He found a stone that had frozen itself into a puddle and freed it with the patience of a man practising for a miracle. He returned to the house and discovered that he could be trusted with the pantry book for ten minutes while Martha ironed, and that this trust conferred a gravity he had always wanted and never admitted to. He wrote a small note in the margin that said, “For a boy’s boots, if he is honest about climbing fences,” and was reprimanded for the flourish and loved the rebuke.

At evening, between the hour when the town eats because hunger has arrived and the hour when it eats because there is nothing else to do, Elias Sugg burst with a news like a pomegranate. He had heard at The Raven that Mr. North had refused a gentleman’s request for a contract, which, being the first refusal, would be repeated badly in all directions. “He told the man,” Elias reported gleefully, “to go home and be bored. He told him to sit on his ill-made appetite and see whether he could hatch a day. The man was offended and promised to take his business to the church.” Leonard laughed and found in the laugh no sin. “It is the only sermon I would allow Mr. North to preach,” he said, and Martha, who did not like the devil with his shoes off in her parlour, permitted herself to be entertained.

It was late, and the house had warmed itself against the town’s black chalk, when Leonard took from the mantel the paper he had not wanted on the day he signed it in Mr. North’s tidy room. Lyall had placed it there on a foolish night when trust had seemed a trick too fine not to try. He unfolded in the lamplight the contract that had made his tongue sharp and his hand steady and his sleep a little mean. He read it without fear and with a sort of tender disgust that is the clearest thing a man can feel for his own picture when it has been drawn correctly. The clause that speaks of boredom looked at him with a friend’s eyes. He had for days and days practised deposing himself from the court of attention. He had made a meal of dullness and called it bread. He had laid aside phrases that would have earned him admiration and picked up sentences that did not even earn him a nod. He had, in the ledger of the undeserving, begun to keep a column titled “Enough,” and had discovered that entries in it did not require ink. He looked at the neat place for a signature that would unmake a piece of making. He did not sign. He blew the lamp out with the gentle breath men are taught to save for candles and babies and secrets. He slept and did not dream of bargains. He dreamt once of a boy lifting a scarf of bees from a lamp and the bees arranging themselves politely into letters that read “Stop,” and smiled because bees cannot read.

Morning came cold and level-minded and found the house already moving, as houses like to be when they have earned it. The kettle clicked. The pantry book held its pages like a soldier. The contraption at furnace three thought better of sulking. Mr. North invented a modest headache to save himself from going to a place where he would be admired for the wrong reason. Inspector Meres pressed a coat upon his body like a verdict and went out to catch not men but a day in the act of behaving. Mr. Pritchard put on his brass buttons because brass has always liked to be mistaken for nature. Mr. Temple argued with a rivet so successfully that it became part of him for a minute. Martha set her jaw against a batter that would not be bettered by it and did the sensible thing, which is to alter the recipe instead of the jaw. Leonard tied his scarf like a vow and went toward Harris Street with a step that stopped short of pride. He passed under the glassworks chimney and blessed it, which is to say he did not curse it. He said to himself, because private liturgies save men who are embarrassed by religion, “We will go on until it is time not to, and we will know it by the click.” He listened, and the house in his head obliged him with the sound. It was enough.
