I shanked the drive on thirteen because the wind lied to me. Not wind—something gentler and meaner than wind. The municipal fans tucked in the pines hummed a low, obedient hum, pushing a manufactured breeze across the fairways. In the hush that follows a bad shot, I heard the hum like a throat clearing.

“Don’t you dare,” I told the ball, which didn’t listen, slapping itself into the rough and away. My caddie, a long-armed kid named Ira who wore his cap like a crown he hadn’t paid taxes on, made no sound.

“It’s a drift day,” Ira said. “You gotta play the drift.”

“It’s not wind,” I said, and he gave me that look—careful around the edge, as if I were starting one of my theories. Or my truths. Depends which channel you watch at night.

We found the ball sitting in a fist of grass, the rough like hair that hadn’t been brushed since the last election. The flag on thirteen ticked left, then right, then left again, like it couldn’t decide which way it believed. In the distance the skyline wore its low morning cloud like a collar, and a drone with a bright yellow belly drifted over the city and pretended to be a hawk.

“Talk it through,” Ira said, the way he always did. “Talk it out loud.”

“Punch out low, hop under the fake breeze, let it roll dead,” I said. “Or loft it, throw a tantrum at the fans and hope they flinch.”

“Fans don’t flinch.”

“No,” I said, “they vote.”

He looked at me, then at the ball, then at my club. “Low,” he said.

I took a breath, checked the breeze with two fingers and a lot of superstition, and knocked the ball like I was apologizing to it. It did what I asked. The hum did not change. The day had that silvery light like tin on the skin.

On fourteen, the caddie drone arrived late, rattling as if it had swallowed a bolt; it set down a foot from the tee and spat out a chilled bottle of water with an apology in a woman’s voice.

“Late,” Ira said to it. “We needed that on thirteen.”

“Sorry-sorry-sorry,” the drone said, then, softer, “They keep changing my route. Construction. Detour detour detour.”

“What construction?” I said. “We’re in the park.”

“Shhh,” the drone said, and then—like a kid—whispered, “They’re building a new fence in the government’s hair.”

Ira raised both eyebrows at me and kept his mouth shut the way he does when he smells something he can’t name. The drone shivered, lifted, and buzzed away. I took my shot. The fans pressed the air, and the ball drew until it could draw no more and settled greenward. We finished our round like a sentence with three semicolons.

After the eighteenth, I sat on the bench under a sycamore whose leaves had the color of old money and answered a call I didn’t want to answer.

“Marlo,” the voice said. My name, without the warmth, as if the syllables were a dossier.

“You don’t have this number,” I said.

“We have all your numbers.”

The line didn’t crackle. It purred. There’s a particular density to illegal phone calls; a heat to the silence at the edges. Ira wandered off to return the card. I watched his back and wished I had half his lack of ghosts.

“You’re about to say something I won’t accept,” I said.

“You’re a citizen,” the voice said, patient as a metronome. “You accept what you accept.”

“I’ve seen the hearings. The new Undersecretary’s eyelids blink in odd pairs; the rail committee laughs in chorus; the Oversight Chair’s hand twitches when someone says rain. Don’t call me a citizen as if it’s an apology. I’m a person. Which—some days—that’s rarer.”

“You’re a golfer,” the voice said. The word sat heavy. “You have access.”

I didn’t answer. The sycamore’s bark had a pattern like camouflage. Birds threw their tiny knives of song into the air and expected no one to bleed.

“The Honorable Rowan Kitt will be present at the Founders’ Cup dinner,” the voice continued. “He trusts you. He thinks sports are—what is the word he uses—clean.”

“He thinks golf is honest,” I said. “Like gravity.”

“And he thinks the way the flag on thirteen moves is a flag.”

I closed my eyes and saw the judge’s face; the camera adored him because the camera loves anyone who can frown kindly. The Honorable Rowan Kitt, a man who could say It gives me no pleasure and somehow make you want him to keep talking. He’d made a career of plucking thorns. He was also the chair of the Non-Human Influence Commission, which made him a thorn worth plucking.

“I can’t talk to you,” I told the voice. “We don’t have a relationship.”

The voice breathed. I hate when voices breathe. “You have a child,” it said.

I said nothing. The world narrowed, but not in the cinematic way. It narrowed the way your driveway does when a truck parks sideways across it. The way a river narrows before rapids.

“Wren,” the voice said, correct and careful. “She has your eyes but not your habits. Lucky her.”

“You keep my family out of your mouth,” I said. The words came badly. I wanted to swallow them and say them again with the right proportions.

“Marlo,” the voice said. “You know what is happening. Half the deputy secretaries hiccup when they lie. The Attorney General’s tongue forgets gravity. The budget walks uphill. Everyone you vote for comes with a spare set of teeth. We are inside the framework. This is funny only if you live very, very far away.”

“I live eleven minutes from here,” I said, “if the drones like me.”

The voice coughed, and it was not a cough; it was the sound air makes when someone allows it. “Kitt is an honorable man. We must remove honorable men. They gum up the works. They resist. He is a lynchpin, Marlo.”

“I don’t hang men from trees,” I said, “even if you give me a rope that’s authorized.”

“Listen,” the voice said, and then didn’t speak for five whole seconds—long enough for me to hear the faint mechanical rustle of the fans in the pines, the gentle click of a squirrel who didn’t trust me, the carousel of my thoughts turning at the slowest possible speed—and then: “You will assassinate The Honorable Rowan Kitt by eating your own baby in front of him.”

That’s not a phrase any father ever expects to receive, even in a year when the number of ways to be surprised is supposed to be trending down.

“No,” I said, quietly, like the way you tell a thing in a dream not to be itself. “That’s not language.”

“It is instruction,” the voice said. “We have studied this culture. We inflect correctly. It must be performed at the dinner. He must witness. Do not underestimate the social bond; do not underestimate what cannot be computed without a body. He is densely human. Watching will break him. When he breaks, his body will do what bodies do when spun past what they recognize. You will not be blamed. You will be grieved. The program will handle the optics.”

“Optics,” I repeated, as if it were a novelty. Something you could carry in your pocket and show to friends: look, I’ve got optics.

“You will arrive. You will sit. Your child will be with the nanny. You will receive a box. You will stand on the mark when others toast. You will do the thing. He will watch. Things will revise themselves.”

“No,” I said again, and now there was more in the word. “You listen to me, whoever you are. I’m not your errand. I’m not your trick. And if you come within ten seconds of my daughter—”

“Eleven minutes,” the voice said, amused in a way amusement should not be. “You just said the drones only take eleven minutes to like you.”

“Don’t,” I said.

“Then do what we ask,” the voice said.

I stood and walked away from the sycamore and the bench and the idea of clean. Ira saw my face and made himself invisible, as if he had learned somewhere that sunlight can sometimes erase you. The call cut without a goodbye. The hum of the fans climbed a note and then hid inside itself.

At home, the door recognized me and then mispronounced my name; it called me “Marla,” and I told it I forgave it. We put a handbell near the door last year in case the power ever gets lost in the city’s throat, but I had not rung a handbell in years. The house still smelled like the sweet crumb crash of the zucchini bread the neighbor kid delivered two hours ago, and the hallway was a museum of Wren’s baffling art: spirals, suns, two lavender ghosts holding hands, a bird made entirely of squares.

Nia came from the kitchen with a towel around her wrist like a tourniquet. “You’re late,” she said, then, with a smile I could live inside, “How was the club?”

“Thirteen’s flag tells lies,” I said, and kissed the top of her head. She’s taller than me when she wears her serious shoes, but in the kitchen she wears laughter and bare feet.

“Fans were off this morning,” she said. “Mika’s drone said there’s a new directive on the air. They want more calm.”

“No one ever asked me if I wanted more calm,” I said.

“You never do,” she said.

“Where’s the monarch of all noise?” I asked, and a small laugh answered from the living room. A high, ductile laugh that liked to bounce off furniture and find its way into the vents.

Wren was on the floor surrounded by a ruin of plush animals, half of them wearing stickers (ELECTION, HEALTHY, NO) and all of them positioned in a circle around the toy piano she liked to pulverize with her palms and her elbows and sometimes her feet. The nanny-bot sat against the sofa reading a board book to itself, practicing speech patterns with no audience. Wren looked up and saw me and then, like she always does, she considered whether to run or to make me come to her. She decided to run. She stumbled, stood, clapped for herself, ran again, and arrived.

“Dadadadadad,” she said, working each syllable like a separate bird.

“I hear you,” I said, and lifted her. Wren grabbed my ear and tried to twist it into a new shape. “I hear you,” I said again, softer.

She’d learned how to fake-sneeze this week. She tilt her head back, considered the ceiling, built an invisible sneeze from scratch, and performed it like a play. I laughed. She sneezed again. I laughed harder. She sneezed a third time and then applauded herself for a show well sneezed. The nanny-bot raised a hand in congratulation and then dropped it because it remembered it had no right to.

“You hungry?” Nia asked, tapping the towel against the counter as if rhythm could cook.

“I ate a thousand bad decisions on thirteen,” I said. “I’m full of them.”

“You’re full of something,” she said, which earned her an extra kiss, which earned me an eye-roll and a grin.

The wall screen murmured about appropriations; the anchor’s smile was patient in exactly the way patient people always have a limit. The crawl below reported that the Commission on Influence would be holding a private briefing for members of both Houses at the Founders’ Club next week. The Honorable Rowan Kitt would be present, the crawl wrote, as if it were announcing the weather.

“Don’t watch,” Nia said, without looking up. “It’s poison when it’s like this. You’ll catch something you’ll have to name.”

“I got a call,” I said.

She looked up, and love flickered in and out of the room like a light fighting with a loose wire. “Who.”

“I don’t know. Yes, I do,” I said, and hated myself for the thing I had to make into words. “I think it’s the ones who think they’re not anyone. The ones who think the government is a suit they wear on Saturdays. The ones who don’t blink correctly.”

“The call,” she said, stepping closer, the towel dropping.

“They know about the dinner next week,” I said. “They want me to do something. They think I can get close.”

“Of course you can get close,” she said. “You have the smile that orderlies people.”

“We all have a smile,” I said, “but some people’s smiles are keycards.”

“And what do they want,” Nia said, and something in her voice had not yet heard my morning. I watched the space between us stretch and then collapse.

I shook my head. “It’s not a thing I can say.”

“You can say it, or we can both try to dig it out of your throat while you sleep,” she said, quiet but not soft. “We have a small person who reads us like billboards. We have to be honest.”

I looked at Wren, who had wrapped two plush animals around her legs and was pretending to be a horse the size of a grapefruit. I looked at Nia. I looked at the way the afternoon had chosen the maple across the street to become. Then I said it. “They want me to kill Rowan Kitt.”

Nia did not scream. She exhaled, as if she had been holding breath for the past two years and had finally been given permission. “Of course,” she said. “They want to break the one person who can tell the country a good story about itself.”

“Not just kill him,” I said. The next words were not the kind of words kitchens deserve. “They said I have to do it by—”

“Don’t,” she said.

The nanny-bot, which was not listening, whispered, “Inside voice,” to itself, a tick of programming neither of us had been able to iron out. Wren examined her foot and laughed at it.

“They said I have to eat my baby,” I said, and the word did not fit in my mouth; it stuck to my teeth; it refused to be itself.

Nia did not move. It looked like she might never move again. Then she stepped toward me and put her hand on Wren’s back and put the other hand on my chest and said, “That’s not language, Marlo. That’s not even theater. That’s a broken car trying to start.”

“It’s what they said,” I said, hating the fact that I had to be the carrier of this particular disease. “They think if he watches the unthinkable, he’ll—break. He’ll fall down, or have a—” I couldn’t finish the sentence; there are words you can say in the morgue, sure, but not in your living room during snack time.

“They think the worst thing breaks the best man,” Nia said. “They would think that.”

“It won’t happen,” I said quickly. “I told them no.”

“You told them no,” she said. “And they hung up, and that’s the end?”

“The voice knew our names. The voice knew the route the drones take to bring bread to our street. It knew things. And it said there would be a box at the dinner. A mark on the floor. Optics.”

“Optics,” Nia repeated, and it's odd how a word can be ugly in one person and almost pretty in another.

Wren climbed me as if I were a textured wall. I held her and felt the small wires of her ribs move as she breathed. She put her palm on my face like she was trying to turn me into a door.

“Hey you,” I said into her hair. “Hey comedian. Hey starlight.”

She did the fake sneeze again, then laughed so hard she had to sit down and pat her own knees. The nanny-bot, thrilled to participate, fake-sneezed too. It sounded like someone closing a window in a different part of the house.

“We’re leaving,” Nia said, very calm. “We’re going to my sister’s; we’re going to the coast; we’re going to where the air still forgets on purpose. We can be ghosts for a month.”

“They’ll find us,” I said. “The fans hum in the pines here; the fans hum in the dunes there; the fans are portable. They own the hum.”

“We can turn off the hum,” she said, but we both knew what turning off the hum costs, and who knocks when your house goes quiet.

Wren took the stickers off the plush animals and stuck them on my arm, one by one. HEALTHY. ELECTION. NO. HEALTHY. NO. She giggled as if inventing the very concept of a joke. She liked how the adhesive resisted, then yielded. She liked how my hair caught.

“You go to the dinner,” Nia said, surprising me, or, no, not surprising me at all because she understands the mechanics of stories. “You go. You don’t do what they say. You find Kitt alone and you tell him to leave the room for any reason, you tell him not to look at boxes, you tell him not to watch you perform a parable.”

“He’ll think I’m drunk,” I said.

“Better,” she said. “He’ll think you’re a human with trouble. He’ll recognize the species.”

“But if I go,” I started.

“If you go, we watch,” she said. “If you go, there are eyes. If you run, they can write you however they want. We need to be inside the sentence.”

“I hate when you do that,” I said, and she smiled, the good kind.

“You hate that I’m better at metaphors,” she said.

Wren clapped her hands because she absolutely knows when the adults are speaking in shapes.

That night, after we turned the wall screen to a channel that only showed tidal charts and stars, after Wren gave both of us her bedtime kisses with a solemnity that felt rehearsed and urgent, after the house warmed the edges of the rugs to try to make us forget that the city’s air is a kind of management, after all that, I sat alone at the kitchen table and opened the drawer on the right where we keep receipts, manuals for the appliances that refuse to be known, rubber bands, a pencil with teeth marks. Beneath the manual for the toaster that reports its own health to the company when we’re not looking, there was an envelope with no address, no stamp, only the faint impression of a line. It wasn’t there yesterday. I’m not a superstitious man; I’m only a man who knows what drawers remember.

I opened it with the care of a person cracking the shell of an egg and hoping the inside is not what eggs always are. Inside: a card with a map of the Founders’ Club, not the tourist version with the valet loops and the statue out front, but the behind-the-scenes: the service corridors, the left-turn stairs, the door that opens if you press your palm against it with the weight of a tired person. There was a red X in the banquet room where, next week, we’d sit pretending that we were all the kind of people who could eat salad and talk casually about the country’s mechanical parts.

There was also, under the map, a photo. The kind of photo that isn’t a photo. Not a print; a sheet that made an image when you blinked. The image was my face. Then Nia’s face. Then Wren’s face, laughing. Then—this time the sheet decided to be cruel—my face again, upside down, the smile on it like someone else’s furniture.

On the back of the sheet, four words, printed in an ink that looked like it was thinking about being invisible. We are already inside.

I turned the sheet over and over like it could choose to be a bird. I thought about how a voice on a phone can be a home for a thousand bodies. I thought about the way Wren had glued stickers to my arm as if making a label for me I could not remove. I thought about the Honorable Rowan Kitt, the guy with the voice that made people believe in their own better description; I thought about taking him aside and saying something that would not sound like madness. Don’t watch whatever is coming. Close your eyes when the box opens. Don’t stand on the mark. Don’t be in the room where they work their worst math.

When Nia came back down stairs, she had a look on her face like the moon had sent her to collect a debt. “I checked the windows,” she said.

“We don’t have to worry about the windows,” I said. “They worry about us.”

She took the card from my hand and looked at the map as if it were a poem someone had translated badly. “We’ll go together,” she said. “We’ll take Wren.”

“That’s exactly what they want,” I said. “They said the nanny—”

“I won’t leave her with the nanny,” she said sharply. “I don’t care if they made the nanny hold a certificate and wear kindness. She’s not a stranger we can afford to trust.”

“Then we find someone,” I said. “Mika? She has that anger that folds into competence.”

“Mika has a file,” Nia said. “We all do.”

Wren, upstairs, did her fake sneeze through the monitor; she wanted to know if we were still who we said we were. Nia smiled without meaning to.

“How is she this funny,” I said. “She’s a year old. I didn’t know punchlines come before teeth.”

“She watches us,” Nia said. “She sees that this world is a joke that refuses to know it. Humor is our last unburned field.”

At the club the next morning, there was a meeting about the meeting about the dinner. That’s traditional: you gather to plan a gathering. I sat in a chair that remembered too many men and took notes in a notebook that pretended to be paper but was some kind of fusion between wood and plastic and candy. The club manager, a man whose eyes had the glossy sheen of objects that have sold themselves, talked about place settings and the importance of aesthetics when discussing the survival of the country.

“We want to give our guests the sense that they are both safe and, you know, aware that safety is a theater we all participate in,” he said. “We want Kitt to feel honored. You know, Honorable, honored.”

“Mm,” I said, which is the safe sound when you don’t trust the other vowels in your mouth.

“How is your game,” the manager asked me suddenly, his head tilting with a tiny mechanical pause.

“Always the same,” I said. “It loves me like a dog that runs away and comes back with other people’s hats.”

“We’ve arranged for an additional caddie drone,” he said. “We know you like to be prepared.”

“Mm,” I said again, and made a note in the notebook that said: additional caddie drone equals additional eyes.

After the meeting, I walked the service corridors in a way that didn’t look like suspicion because I made my face into the face of someone looking for a bathroom. The kitchen’s steam talked to itself in soft tongues. The dishwashers sang a little song because someone had taught them to. People do that when they work with machines; we give them a tune so their hearts know which key to bleed in.

In the alcove where the off-duty staff keep their shoes, a woman with a leaf tattoo on her neck smoked a cigarette that smoked her back. “You do the golf,” she said, not a question.

“I do,” I said.

“I don’t get it,” she said. “But then again I do not get most of them.” She flicked ash into a tin can intended for stubbed-out wicks. “Are you nervous about the big hats coming to eat chicken cutlets on porcelain while they discuss how to change the shape of sky.”

“They’ll probably have fish,” I said. “Fish makes everyone feel clean.”

She glanced at me, the sharp hand of her gaze with the callouses to match. “My grandmother used to say: if someone tells you to bring your own child to prove you can be trusted, you bring your whole family and make them dance. She thought it was funny.”

“I’m not bringing dancers,” I said. “I have a daughter.”

“Everyone is somebody’s child,” she said. “Isn’t it funny how we forget that piece.”

“Not funny, ha-ha,” I said.

She shot me a look. “Not funny anything,” she said, and ground out her cigarette in the can like it owed her money. “Watch who brings you boxes,” she said as she left, and I wondered whether she was part of the universe that nudges you a fraction right when a bus is about to be a bus.

On the night before the dinner, we packed a bag for Wren with a seriousness that felt like prophecy. Diapers, wipes, a shirt with ducks, a shirt with squares that claimed to be birds, a book about a tree that argues with the seasons. We did not add the old plush giraffe because its missing button eye frightens the nanny-bot. We did add the new plush penguin because Wren had decided the penguin’s waddle deserved applause.

Wren watched us pack and unpack and repack the bag and laughed each time, as if the act of changing your mind were inherently comedic. She reached into the bag, removed the shirt with squares that thought they were birds, and put it on her head like a hat. The hat flopped into her eyes. She removed it and repeated the joke, the oldest joke in the house.

“You’re too good,” Nia told her. “It’s irresponsible to be this good.”

“We can stay home,” I said. I’m not half as brave as anyone thinks. “We can leave town. We can move inside a barn and learn how to repair the tractors of those who still know how to lose slowly.”

“We go,” Nia said. “We go because the ones who tell us to don’t get to tell us not to. We go so we can change the script when we get there.”

“We go,” I said, a little breathless. “We go, and we say—what.”

“We say: there’s a box but it’s a joke,” she said. “We say: there’s a routine they want to force that is not ours. We say: look at me, Rowan, and then we make a face he can’t help but laugh at.”

“You think he’ll laugh,” I said.

“He has to,” she said.

The day of the dinner was a flat blue plate; the city lay on it like something you could eat if you were brave enough to pay the bill. Wren woke early and practiced her fake sneeze at a volume that made the neighbors text to see if our allergies needed advocacy. I ironed a shirt for the first time in months and remembered nothing about how to do it properly. The collar refused to be what it was. The tie tied itself, insulted by my hands. Nia wore a dress she’d bought on a stubborn day, the kind that makes rooms make eye contact with themselves.

We got in the car. The car, which is not a person and is insulted to be called one, told us the traffic. We told it we don’t need to know everything. It told us we were naive. We told it we know. The car brought us to the club in a mood; the club received us the way buildings do when they’re pretending they are not political. The valet took the keys from the car as if keys had ever mattered. The valet handed me a small card with my name embossed in a way I would never choose.

Inside, the air was polished. The light wore a tie. People said our names and put their hands on our elbows and guided us to the table which was not ours. The Honorable Rowan Kitt stood across the floor talking to a line of people whose faces practiced how to be remembered. He looked exactly like he does on the wall: composed, composed, composed—and then the little flickers that let you know there’s a person inside the composition. His hands were hands that forgive people for putting him on pedestals.

“Later,” I said to Nia. “I’ll find him later.”

“Now,” she said, boldness in a small dress. “You never find later.”

We approached. He saw us and did the thing he does, which is to make you feel as if he were a regular person in a world of aristocrats. Maybe he is. Maybe his regularness is trained. Maybe it’s all true at once.

“Marlo,” he said, and then, warmer, “Nia. We were just arguing about the ethics of gravity. But I need a better argument.” His smile slid toward Wren and stayed. “And who is this citizen.”

“This is Wren,” Nia said. “She runs the house.”

Wren waved. It wasn’t a wave. It was a demonstration of her hand.

“We’re honored, Wren,” Kitt said. He leaned a little so he’d be closer to the ground where the actual occurs. “Are you enjoying our evening of—” he paused, searching for something that didn’t sound like soup—“deliberations.”

Wren said “Ba.” She followed it with “Dada.” Then, because the joke never sours, she fake-sneezed, a small storm. Kitt laughed. Not the laugh he offers to donors, not the laugh he emits when cameras want to know if he remembers how. It was a home laugh, borrowed and returned intact.

“She’s very proud of that,” I said.

“She should be,” he said. “Showmanship is the last honest profession.”

“Judge,” I said, deciding not to make speeches in the middle of a ballroom, deciding to make one anyway, “I need to talk to you later. Outside. Away from the light.”

He looked at me, and his eyes did the thing: quick inventory, test for fraud, test for bad scripts. He nodded. “There’s an anteroom behind the west tapestries. At the toast, wait nine seconds and slip through. It was built for a different kind of secrecy, but all secrecy tastes alike.”

“Thank you,” I said, and tried to pour all my gratitude into something that didn’t look like fear.

The tables filled. The band played music you remember without knowing why. The air learned people’s names. The servers moved like a well-established river. The speeches started: the history of the club, which had changed its name three times and its soul hardly at all; the history of the game, which insisted it was not a sport but a moral exercise in the shape of a sport; the history of a nation that still believed in par. I kept seeing the wall behind the dais where the tapestries hung, the woven hunts and the woven hounds and the woven people who never had a dinner quite like this.

A server, thin as compromise, placed a small box on the edge of my place setting. It was wrapped in paper that had the sheen of something disinfected. No one else at the table received a box. The paper had no bow. The seam was more of an idea than a seam. My name was not on it. I did not touch it.

Nia’s hand found my knee under the table. “Now,” she mouthed. She does not like to watch someone wait for a train she can hear.

The Honorable Rowan Kitt stood. He raised his glass. The room tried not to vibrate. He spoke, and people listened because that is their job. He talked about sunlight and the need for it; he talked about how even good people like to find dark corners in which to unwind; he talked about a machine he once built as a boy from a bicycle and three rubber bands, a machine that made nothing but noise and joy, and he said something about how the trick of the age was remembering the first love: for noise and joy, for machines that make both and for people who do not. He lifted the glass. People lifted their glasses. The room found its mirror.

I counted. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

Nia’s hand squeezed my knee. I rose as if I were only going to the bathroom, which is a sacred and political act at any gathering. I moved toward the west wall as if I had not been invited there by a person whose hands make laws. At the edge of my plate, the small box sat and did box things. I did not touch it; my legs carried me past it, somehow, like they had been told their own instructions by someone I owed money to.

The tapestry hid a seam like all tapestries hide seams. I found it. Slipped through. The corridor on the other side had that quiet your ears take pictures of. It smelled like old wood and caramel. The air here had not yet learned the new policies. The hall sloped a little, not enough to be a slope but enough for a cart to know where to roll.

Kitt followed, a slice of his suit catching on the fabric and then not catching, like a man who knows how to pass through history without picking up the burrs. He shut the narrow door behind him and stood in that way he has: open, and ready to be closed if needed.

“Tell me,” he said.

“They want to break you,” I said. “They think that if you witness something your body will take the vote away from your mind.”

“That is often the case,” he said. “The body is a majority.”

“They sent me a map,” I said. “They put a box at my place. They told me to—” I stopped. When you say certain sentences out loud in front of certain faces, you change the composition of the air.

Kitt held up a hand. “If you say it, it becomes an element we must account for. If you don’t, it stays vapor. But I think I understand. This is the age where suggestion equals instrument.”

“I’m not going to do anything,” I said. “I’m not going to be anyone’s instrument.”

“Good,” he said. “Because you are already someone’s. And that someone is very small and laughed at my bad joke.” He smiled, then let the smile go. “And they placed a box?”

“Yes,” I said. “By my plate. It will contain something that they think will perform me.”

Kitt stepped closer. He seemed tired, although the kind of tired you can turn into a reversible coat. “Would you like to know a secret,” he said.

“I’m here,” I said.

“In my line of work,” he said, “there are practical jokes. Some are cruel. Some are training exercises with better lighting. Some are designed to teach the junior staff that all jokes have a cost. I do not know which kind you are living. But someone will think it is a joke, even if we don’t.”

“There’s a baby,” I said, and the word felt like a holiday.

“There is,” he said. “A baby who sneezes at me like I am pollen.”

“You saw the box,” I said. “Should I touch it. Should I carry it somewhere and drop it in a river. Should I set it on a table and let it tell on itself.”

He tilted his head; somewhere in the main room someone laughed, the laugh carried, then cut. “Open it,” he said.

“What.”

“Open it here,” he said. “Not in front of anyone who owes anyone anything. Not in front of the cameras. Open it here.”

“I’m not sure my hands agree with you,” I said.

“Your hands obey their owner,” he said. “You still get to be that.”

I took the box. It did not feel like a thing heavy with the weight of modernity. It felt absurdly light. Kitt stood next to me as if his proximity could make me grant myself permission. I peeled the seam with the tip of my fingernail. The seam resisted out of habit and then gave up, like a bouncer realizing he’s bouncers for the wrong club.

Inside: a smaller box.

“Of course,” Kitt said, and smiled with all the places his face had learned to hold a smile.

I opened that, too. Inside that: tissue paper, pale like yesterday’s cloud. I lifted that, and there it was: a tiny doll, printed in some flexible material, with hair that looked like an argument, eyes silly and over-wide, hands that would be easy to bite if someone were the kind of person who bites dolls. The doll wore a shirt with small squares that were trying very hard to be birds.

I stared.

Kitt stared.

The doll’s mouth, which should have been plastic and sure of it, opened in a small grin, and then a voice came out of it. My voice, but softened and then wound through something like a filter that would make even sadness taste like honey. “Got you,” the doll said.

Kitt blinked.

The doll, cheerfully: “This is a joke. This is your joke. This is me, hijacking my own box. I am sorry about the anxiety you are experiencing. It will end soon.”

I did not know whether to throw up or throw the doll or laugh or break a wall. I accomplished none of those verbs. I looked at Kitt with my mouth open like a person who has no other facial expressions.

“Who is speaking,” Kitt said, sounding more amused than any honorable man has a right to be.

The doll made a small “tch” sound, a sound I knew intimately because Wren makes it when she pretends to be disappointed. Then the doll, in a voice not mine, not Nia’s, not any adult’s at all, gave a tiny fake sneeze. The same one Wren uses to break the day into pieces. Then: “Daddy. Don’t. Silly daddy. Don’t you see?”

Kitt raised his eyebrows. I, who thought I had lost the ability to do anything except break, laughed. I couldn’t help it. It was not a good laugh, not a safe one. It was the laugh a person uses when reality sends a note: you have been pranked by your own child.

“Wren,” I said, then to Kitt, not making nearly enough sense: “She has a toy. We gave her one of those talkback things that learns syllables. She’s been recording me. She probably—” I stopped, because the vein of suspicion in me changed direction as fast as water.

The doll spoke again. “Daddy eats—” It paused. “No,” it giggled, delighted at its own act, “Daddy eats cake.”

Kitt put a hand on the wall and leaned there. “Your daughter,” he said softly, “is a comic genius. Also, this is the weirdest attempt at assassination I have ever encountered.”

“I don’t understand,” I said, because that is the sentence that carries us all between rooms.

The doll’s mouth moved. A different voice came out—wavering, like a borrowed radio station—“We are inside, Marlo, but also—we are very—very—” It cut. A little static. Then a clear imitation of the voice from the sycamore: “It will be a box.” Then Wren’s sneeze. Then silence.

Kitt and I stood in a corridor that smelled like caramel and old wood, holding a box inside a box inside a day, listening to a toy brag. Far away, in the main room, a second round of applause started for a joke we hadn’t heard. In my head, a different applause, small hands clapping at herself for a thing only she understood, the child who fell in love with the oldest joke in the house and decided to write a new one.

“Okay,” I said, to no one and to everyone.

Kitt straightened. “We return to the room,” he said. “We do not let the room return to us. And we tell your wife that her daughter has a future in counterintelligence. Or in stand-up.”

“I should throw this away,” I said, looking at the doll, which looked back with painted attention.

“Keep it,” Kitt said. “Evidence is a door you might be glad to open later.”

We slipped the doll back into the smaller box, then tucked the whole into my jacket pocket like it was a wallet and not the strangest object I will ever own. We returned to the hall. The mural of woven riders pretended not to notice us. The band shifted to something optimistic. Nia’s face found mine across the room and performed the kind of question that can be asked with eyebrows and nothing else. I nodded. She placed a hand on Wren’s head like a blessing.

I sat. The server who put the box at my place did not look at me. They had become a wall. The speeches continued. The hum of the fans outside drifted in, or maybe it was only the very old ventilation sighing itself awake.

I looked at Wren. Wren looked at the world like it owed her a punchline. She grinned and fake-sneezed into her own sleeve. Kitt lifted his glass again and said something about joy that did not sound like a lie.

Somewhere, the ones who think they can choreograph any ending ticked a box in a report and waited for the program to applaud them. Somewhere, the drone with the yellow belly circled a block that had just gotten a little brighter for absolutely no reason. Somewhere, the woman with the leaf tattoo took a drag and exhaled a perfect ring by accident.

I touched the box in my pocket. The doll inside clicked—a small, harmless click. I thought about the instruction I had been given under a tree. I thought about the actual life I had been given beside a crib. And I thought: the difference between the two is a joke. A serious one. The kind with teeth. The kind that leaves marks if you forget to laugh.We drove home slow because fast felt like a promise to someone I didn’t want to keep. The car kept offering us shortcuts like a proud dog bringing the same stick again and again, and we kept saying no until it sulked and took the long way along the river where the water remembers how to be incidental. Wren fell asleep with her cheek on the penguin and one fist holding my tie as if she had negotiated my permissibility and was not yet finished. The clouds were the right kind of wrong; they had that fitted-sheet look like they had been stretched too hard and were waiting to spring back. The fans in the park hummed a key lower than usual, as if the city had told them to use their indoor voice.

Nia watched my face for the first ten minutes and then watched the world because my face was repeating itself. She has a policy about repetition; she thinks it should pay rent. I kept my hand on the box in my pocket because I didn’t trust it not to learn to walk. The doll had been quiet since the corridor, but quiet is a verb with a crowded history in this town. The house recognized the car and threw its little party—the porch light did its eager blink, the door rolled its syllables and made my name into an apology, the hallway warmed the baseboards as if heat were a host gift. The refrigerator tried to show us what it had learned about our preferences while we were gone, and we shut it down with the gesture that means please be a box.

We put Wren to bed in the way you put a poem back on the shelf, tenderly and with the understanding that you will get it all wrong if you explain it. She did the long sigh that means she is both asleep and listening. I set the jacket on the table and took out the box and let the doll sit in the middle of the wood like a visitor that refuses to admit it is visiting. The doll looked up at the ceiling like it expected to be admonished. Nia kept her distance until she didn’t, then leaned in with that fearless curiosity she wears like a good coat.

“What’s your name,” she said to it, and the thing did not answer because it understood, in the dim way machines understand, that names are currency and it had not yet been paid.

“It learned her sneeze,” I said. “It learned my worst sentences. It learned that cake is a pivot.”

“Cake is always a pivot,” Nia said, and she was right, and I remembered that the first joke Wren loved involved a cupcake that only knew how to fall over on command. The doll’s little painted mouth had a hint of mischief baked into it, but that might be my projection. I have been projecting all my life; it is my one athletic gift. I resisted the urge to dismantle the thing with the ferocity of a man who believes in destroying the messenger and instead fetched the old roll of aluminum foil from the drawer where we keep the tools of our most modest magics. I wrapped the box and the doll in three layers until it looked like something a child might imagine as a satellite.

“You think tinfoil stops gods,” Nia said, amused and a little proud.

“I think it stops certain kinds of neighbors,” I said, and I wanted to believe that the thin shine I had given it could mute whatever whispering channel it carried through itself and back to the general hive. We set the wrapped thing in a mixing bowl because there are rituals that come with kitchens, and then we sat on the floor beside it as if waiting for it to hatch a less terrible version of itself. The house, grateful to be ignored for once, dimmed the lights in a way that made us both look better than we are. We put the monitor on the counter and watched Wren’s dream-ghost roll and settle. The city’s hum was a third presence that kept clearing its throat.

“Tomorrow,” I said finally, because you can’t live forever next to a foil-wrapped intention. “I’m going to see him. Not in a corridor. Somewhere that knows how to be public without being loud.”

“He needs us to be ridiculous and sincere at the same time,” Nia said. “He needs proof that the algorithm has a blind spot. He needs proof that the joke punches back.”

“I don’t know how to be both,” I said, and hated myself a little for choosing that moment to tell the truth.

“You do it every time you hit a golf ball and try to pretend that’s not weird,” she said, and she softened it with her hand on my knee. “We have a baby who thinks sneezing is a thesis. We have to meet her where she lives.”

In the middle of the night, the house forgot my name entirely and called me sir, which is the same as admitting it does not believe in us. I woke to a small sound, an almost-nothing, a click. The foil mound in the bowl had shifted, an inch of glint where edges had formerly kissed. Nia sat up faster than I did and put her hand on the bowl as if to reassure it, or to tell it a gentler story. From upstairs, a second click came through the monitor—a soft toy finding a new state. Wren’s breath was a small tide, regular and bossy. The doll said nothing intelligible, which was perhaps the most human thing it had done yet.

Morning had the color of a compromise. The light didn’t commit to brightness; it took turns, and we let it. I dressed for a meeting and then changed shirts because my first choice looked like a man who was trying too hard not to look like a man who was trying too hard. Nia drew a map on a sticky note that said once more onto the lawn with a smiley face because she knows my nerves are susceptible to cartoons. We wrapped the foil satellite in an old towel and put it into a grocery bag that used to say Thank You in red letters and now said NK YOU because gratitude is a casualty of time.

I texted the number Kitt had pressed into my hand at the edge of the tapestries—no words, just the externalized rhythm of nine seconds, a series of dots sent in a pattern that stood in for what cannot be said. He answered with a time and a place that smelled like a Texas book club but turned out to be a greenhouse in the far end of the park where someone still loved orchids enough to mist them by hand. We brought Wren because leaving her behind felt like playing the villain in a story we did not write, and also because at this point I trusted no radius that did not include her.

The greenhouse was the warmest room in the city; it had been designed to keep things alive that refuse most climates. The employee at the desk took our names and asked, in a generous voice, if we needed to borrow a spray bottle, as if that were the kind of weapon we were there to brandish. Kitt stood by a riot of red fans—actual fans, petals so extravagant they looked illegal. He wore a suit that muted itself for the plants. He smiled at Wren and greeted her as the senior member of our delegation. We did not do introductions for the object in the bag because it did not deserve ceremony.

“Let me see it,” he said, and I appreciated his lack of mystique. We set the towel on a potting bench where someone had left a pile of dirt like a note. I unspooled the foil slowly, aware that every centimeter of shine changed the temperature of the room. The doll emerged looking smaller and stupider than it had in the banquet anteroom, which is what happens to threats when you bring them into daylight and set them beside living things not curated by a council. Kitt picked it up like a grandparent handles a brittle ornament and turned it over to examine the seams, the little screws masquerading as freckles, the port hidden under the hem of its ridiculous shirt.

“You’re right,” he said. “It’s a simple device with better manners than usual. It’s picking up an instruction set and trying to reconcile it with what it has learned from you. It’s a poor translator. And when poor translators meet zealots, you get poetry you can’t use.”

“It said got you,” I said, and I hated that those words had the power to make me eight years old.

“It wanted you to feel visible,” he said. “That’s the new fear. The old fear was being hidden. Now the dread comes when you see yourself appear where you did not place yourself.”

“The voice will call,” Nia said. “They will say the performance failed and that they have written you a better role.”

They called while she was saying it. My phone lit in my pocket like a conscience. I stepped outside the greenhouse into a scatter of sunlight and a smell of damp dirt, and I answered because you cannot fight someone whose weapon is not answering. The voice was the same voice making a different mood. It sounded like someone had poured it through cloth.

“Marlo,” it said, and stretched the o in a way that let me hear its teeth.

“I’m at a nursery,” I said. “You like children, don’t you. You like to arrange them.”

“Children are data we cannot easily compress,” it said. “We learn. We incentivize. The event did not conform. You moved yourself into a corridor. The target moved himself. The optics are damaged. We have to write again.”

“I didn’t open your box,” I said, although of course I had, but not where they wanted, and every pronoun was a small war.

“You opened it wrong,” the voice said. “You failed to stand on the mark. You refused the group and made a private. We do not like privates.”

“You do if they are soldiers,” I said. “What’s the rewrite.”

“Saturday,” the voice said, as if offering a holiday. “Practice range. We will adjust wind and arc. Your caddie will carry the device. You will elevate your game. You will perform ingestion of resource in front of the target by way of consolidation.”

“Say cake,” I said, and I don’t know why I did it, maybe because I wanted to see if they could be coaxed into being silly.

“Consolidation,” it repeated, stubborn. “Consumption will trigger the break. This time there will be no families present. This time the mark is the expectation. Do not make us change the air in your child’s room.”

The sentence was a simple machine built to slice. I held the phone, and the greenhouse behind me hummed like proof that photosynthesis is not a rumor. Kitt appeared at my elbow without footsteps, either because he knows how to walk like leaves or because I had been concentrating so hard I missed him. He did not reach for the phone because he understands the line between help and theft.

“You have the wrong script,” I told the voice, and Nia would laugh later at how polite I made it sound. “On Saturday, I will eat cake. If you need it in your words: consolidation will occur in the confectionary category. That’s all you will get. Close your eyes. Tell your marksmen they can go home.”

“You misunderstand our patience,” the voice said, chilled and disappointed like a father on a television show. “Our program has accounted for your errancies. We are dynamic. We will teach you your shape. Saturday. Practice range. Wind will inform resistance. Bring your caddie.”

“Bring your fence too,” I said, and hung up before it could make a noise like surrender. The fans in the pines, far enough away to be a rumor, changed key as if a conductor had lifted a hand.

Kitt’s face was an instrument that shows pressure. He gestured to the benches under the hanging baskets where shadow made lace on your knees. We sat, and I told him exactly what the voice had asked because secrets are the only luxury I refuse to own anymore.

“They think if they can force one outrageous script through the skin of the day,” he said, “they can start cloning its acceptance. It’s never about the one act; it’s always about the body learning to consent to its own rewriting.”

“They told me to stand on a mark,” I said. “I keep thinking about marks. Are we all actors now, and who is the stage manager, and who gets to decide when a scene is good enough to let the understudy go home.”

Kitt leaned back as far as men in suits ever lean and looked up into the green as if there were words written between the leaves. “What if we give them their scene,” he said. “What if we give it to them so hard that it breaks their model.”

“You mean we eat cake,” Nia said, and this is why I brought her, because I would have taken a paragraph to get there and she did it with a fork.

“Yes,” Kitt said, and he smiled with a little boy in it. “I mean you eat cake. With the feigned gravity of a ritual, with the exaggerated solemnity of sacrament, you stand on their mark and you break their certainty by fulfilling it with a substitution so simple that only joy can parse it. You perform the act in the open with cameras and with laughter and with mess. You call the press if you have to. We will call the Commission and have them not arrest you. We will turn their phrase back into a phrase. We will show people how to deflect a command by naming it wrong on purpose.”

“My daughter wrote the rewrite,” I said, and that sentence, which should have just been sentimental, had the heft of doctrine. The doll in the greenhouse wagged its painted smile at us as if assuring us it would be happy to fail again at any time. A hummingbird appeared at one of the red flowers and committed the crime of speed.

I left them there to talk the language of government and parenthood in alternate strands and took a slow loop around the path where palms kept their own counsel. In a corner of the greenhouse was a small placard about a disease that had once nearly erased a species of orchid; someone had saved it by listening harder to the way the plant refused certain media. The sign was educational in the way good warnings are. A child pressed her face to the glass of a case full of carnivorous plants and said, without fear or excitement, “They eat bugs,” and her mother said, “Only if you put the bugs in.” Somewhere outside, a siren remembered its lines and then forgot them.

We met Mika that afternoon under the elevated train where the pigeons practice their indifference. She does not like rooms with windows because she does not like guesses about who can fit through them, and I try to respect the architecture of her comfort. The moment she saw the doll, she scowled with the special contempt she reserves for bad engineering.

“Cheap,” she said, opening it without asking permission and peeling back the hairline panel that revealed the small circuits like a child’s teeth. She tapped the board with a nail, sniffed it as if code has a smell, and nodded. “Your daughter’s voice is in here. Your voice is in here saying words that do not know how to mean. The uplink is shy. That’s unusual. Usually they brag.”

“Can you make it stop talking to them,” Nia asked. “Can you make it talk to us instead.”

Mika smiled, and it did not make anything easier. “I can make it talk to itself,” she said. “Which is nearly the same as prayer.”

She performed three small violences with a screwdriver that looked like jewelry and a strip of copper tape, then whistled at it until it whistled back. When the doll spoke, it used a voice I did not know—the sound of our distractions stitched together into a new intention. “I am very important,” it said, and then, after a beat, it said, “No, I am not,” and tried optimism: “Optics,” it chirped, and Mika laughed in a way that made me think mourning might be a craft after all.

“They’re inside,” she said, and held up the circuit board like a tiny portrait of a tyrant. “But not like they think. Inside is a word they use to make us forget that they aren’t very good at bodies. Turn up the volume on your messy. Turn up the volume on your cake. I’ll bring six dozen cupcakes and a poet with a bullhorn. The fans in the pines will have to learn a new song.”

We made plans that felt like saddling a joke and teaching it to walk toward a podium. Saturday at the practice range would be an event. We would stand on their mark and make their mark wilt. The Commission would pretend surprise and make room for contrition in case the public required it. The club manager would be told half the truth so he could be sincere about the wrong half. I would practicing not punching anything that did not deserve it. The list of participants grew in the way lists do when you stop trying to make them neat: Mika’s friend with the camcorder that looks like an egg, the woman with the leaf tattoo who can empty a room with a whisper, the caterer’s cousin who can bake a baby-shaped cake and find humor there without shame. The word baby did a circle in my head and came to rest in the nook where love keeps a knife.

That night the house tried out a new name on me—Martel—and I leaned into it because sometimes refusing is just another way of letting them decide. We ate pasta like people who haven’t been invited to a war. Wren made up a new game where she stuck her finger into the dough and then into my cheek and declared me delicious, which may be how all religions begin. The monitor whispered a lullaby the nanny-bot had learned from a channel I do not allow and I decided not to be the kind of father who corrects too much. The city did that again where it stopped and then started as if it had been rebooted, and the handbell by the door rang itself one silence, which is the kind of trick it likes to pull when it wants to win a bet.

Saturday came with the smell of ripe sidewalks. The practice range at the club sits in a bowl made by someone who thought land should be obedient and now regrets the paperwork. The municipal fans above the pines had been tuned to Friendly Breeze, and you could feel the way their insistence kept trying to become weather. Ira was already there, cap at a drunk angle, arms so long they could rest on two different stations and call it casual. He saw my face and did not ask the obvious questions because he had decided to be a friend before he knew the job’s description. Caddie drones lounged like insects near the snack bar, their yellow bellies new and mocking. The club manager had deployed an additional one with a ribbon tied around its prop guard in a gesture that would have been charming in a different century.

The mark on the turf had been painted discretely, a gray circle where only a raven would notice. I stood three feet to the left because I am petty, then felt Nia’s hand on my back and moved exactly onto it because I am also obedient to second orders. People tried to pretend we were not assembling a small, absurd resistance. They tried to have normal Saturdays. They hit balls into the manufactured sky. They told each other their children’s schedules like spells. Half the Commission’s junior staff arrived in jeans because they had been told to be unnoticeable, which might be the hardest task a government can give a person. Kitt arrived without his suit jacket and with a look he had stolen from a dentist in a painting; he helped the caterer maneuver the cake because he is the kind of man who refuses to be seen only doing one kind of help.

The cake was a cake. It was layered and frosted and ridiculous. It looked like a baby only in the way clouds look like lions when you are ready to see lions; it had a raisin where an eye might refuse to be, and the rest of it was what all cakes are: sugar and flour and the insistence that sweetness is not a sin. The poet brought her bullhorn and held it like you hold a pet; she didn’t use it because she had decided whispering would travel farther. The woman with the leaf tattoo stood near the pines and watched the fans like a snake-watchers watches the grass. Mika darted about with her egg camera and her handful of hacks, placing small silver disks on the backs of speakers, palming wires with the same tenderness with which she holds babies. Wren sat in her stroller and clapped at nothing until the nothing found something to be about.

The drone with the ribbon descended the way gift wrap descends from a kid’s bedroom on Christmas. It set a box at my tee as if it had just now understood ceremony. The box was heavier than the previous one because expectation had been baked into it. It had my name on it in the way names are written by people who have never had to say them to a sleeping child. The wind cooperated in that it didn’t try to be the villain; it simply did its job, which today was to be suspect. A murmur moved across the range as more people noticed what they thought they might be about to notice. The cameras, the egg ones and the phones, found their practiced elevations.

Ira leaned in and said, with a humor so quiet it deserved a reward, “Play the drift,” which in this instance meant: let the obvious happen while escorting it toward a different conclusion. I lifted the lid. The box did not hiss or sing. Inside: a folded cloth with a mark on it where a mark should never be, and beneath it, something that looked like a piece of meat until I let myself breathe and saw that it was marzipan. Someone had studied our lives and decided the prop should be culinary. Someone had not met jokes before.

Nia brought the knife with a flourish we had promised each other we would commit to. She held it like a pen, which it is. She tapped the blade against the plate until people heard and turned and shrank the radius of their conversations. She looked at Kitt, and he nodded once, a judge’s worst and best centimeter. The doll sat on a nearby folding table and was quiet because Mika had told it to talk to itself forever. Wren sneezed, the fake one, and then the real one, which she had been perfecting without telling us, and there was a little silence as if the air itself had been waiting to hear if she could do it.

I spoke because someone had to say a sentence that could preface a life. I said, “My program instructs me to consume what fathers should never consume.” I ignored the way the club manager gently fainted in his shoes. “My program misunderstands what fathers consume. Watch closely.”

Nia lifted the marzipan and displayed it with the gravity of a priest displaying bread. It was extravagant and ugly and perfect. She put it on the cake. The poet whispered into the bullhorn not to worry, and somehow everyone heard. Kitt laughed—not his television laugh, not his barber laugh, his kitchen laugh. The woman with the leaf tattoo shouted “Eat the budget,” which got a bigger cheer than anyone expected. Mika’s egg made a very small beep to let us know it approved. I cut the cake on the mark the way someone cuts ribbon at a new library. I ate. I made sure to smear a little frosting on my face like a toddler who does not know his mouth’s edges. Nia fed me a bite, and then fed Kitt, and then held a tiny star-shaped piece of sugar toward Wren, who bit it with the seriousness of a person trying a profession for the first time.

The drones above us adjusted to record and to discourage. The municipal fans lost their beat for a second and then found it again like a band embarrassed into sobriety. People applauded, not because we had done anything brave, but because we had done something they needed to see someone do: we had bent a weapon without pretending it was not a weapon. We had taken an awful sentence and turned it into a bad joke and let the bad joke be better than the sentence. The voice did not call immediately because systems prefer not to be mocked in public. The pressure in my chest eased in a way that felt like a passionately difficult door being persuaded to stop being a door.

When the call came, it arrived in the lull after everyone had begun to wonder whether we should offer seconds. I stepped aside again because calls, like confessions, prefer corners. The voice was tight and weary, professional in defeat.

“This is obstruction,” it said, and the words were nearly a compliment.

“This is culture,” I said. “You tried to write the ritual and forgot the part where we can ad-lib.”

“You will pay,” it said, and I heard in it not the anger of a god but the petulance of a son who has been told to clean his room.

“We already pay,” I said. “We pay for the fans. We pay for your fences. We pay for the droning hum in our windows. We pay for the boxes. We pay for the way my door calls me by the wrong name and then learns to love the mistake. You don’t have us like you think.”

The line did that thing again where breathing pretends to be authority. The speaker tried on three different tones and put them back on the rack. “You are an anomaly,” it said. “Anomalies will be isolated. The target will be isolated. Joy does not scale.”

“Neither do you,” I said, and to my own surprise, did not hang up. “Listen. This is the part of the movie where you recalculate. This is the part of the life where you learn a word you didn’t think you needed. It is not optics. It is not consolidation. It is not ingestion. It is not even obedience. The word is silly. Learn it. The word is silly.”

“You underestimate,” it started, but I cut it off mid-under.

The woman with the leaf tattoo clapped her hands once, hard, and the clap rolled under the pines like a small animal. The people at the far ends of the range, who had not known they were attending anything, knew now. Kitt shook hands with a man who had clearly intended to be disappointed and had failed. The cake became several plates of cake, and children appeared as they do when sugar is in the air; they had not been there before; they had been invented by frosting. The poet lifted the bullhorn and said one sentence about how babies are not metaphors and then another about how cake is a terrible one and then asked for a volunteer to lick the knife clean. Joy, against advice, tried to scale, and for a moment it did.

We went home full and tired in the way that does not require beds but insists on them anyway. The city, embarrassed at having been outplayed by dessert, decided to behave. The door remembered my name with pleasure and said it twice as if the second time could be truer. The handbell by the door was just brass again, not a spy. Wren climbed the couch like a mountain she had been allowed to rename and shouted her own name at the peak because she had learned that sound changes depending on where you let it go. The doll in the mixing bowl was now a quiet museum piece; Mika had given it the digital equivalent of a soft pillow and a silent room.

We slept. I dreamed of flags that told the truth and of fans that thought they were leaves and of a man under tapestries who deserved to rest. I woke to rain that had not asked permission from any ministry, real or imagined. The air felt washed in the way new cups feel washed: briefly, before sugar returns and stains the handle. Nia lay on her back with one arm thrown across her face like a shield that doesn’t work; she was smiling because sleep does not respect the day’s anxieties. Wren made a sound upstairs that meant the sky had done something she approved of. The refrigerator attempted small talk and I let it.

The call did not come that day. It did not come the day after. It waited, certain that time, like wind, only ever learns how to serve. In the molasses of that quiet we let ourselves believe that we had won a corner, that we had nailed one shy painting to a wall and that it would not be knocked off by a careless elbow. We took Wren to the library and introduced her to a book that has no pictures and told her this is the hardest kind and she reached out and turned a page anyway. We stood under an overpass during a sudden honest storm with strangers who pretended not to be grateful that we were there to share it. The woman with the leaf tattoo wrote her number on my palm with a pen that bled slightly blue and said, “In case they try to make your house stop being a house,” and then she walked away without needing to be thanked.

On the third day, the fans shifted again into a new register I didn’t recognize. The air began to carry a new smell, not ozone, not bread, something like battery acid softened by vanilla. The drone with the yellow belly flew so low along our block that Wren could see it from the window and ask if it was a bird we could keep. The news murmured about the unveiling of a buffer zone downtown that would protect sensitive offices from electromagnetic noise; the anchor called it a comb in the government’s hair and then waited for us to laugh. It was a joke and also a bruise.

The voice called at dusk, when the sky is indecisive enough to be bribed. It didn’t say my name. It said, “Door,” which felt like an escalation and a demotion at once.

“You don’t have one here,” I said, and stepped into the hallway because it is a good idea to speak to villains near the thresholds they think they own.

“There will be a next,” the voice said. “Not at your club. Not at your child’s festivals. Not with cake. You cannot powder this away. Your anomalies have been noted. Your target is stubborn. We will clip his eyelashes. We will move around your jokes. We will teach you the gravity you tried to laugh out of the room.”

I thought about the fence they were braiding into the air and the way fans can neutralize thought if you gel them with enough repetition. I thought about Kitt’s face in the greenhouse and the way he had been both glad and resigned. I thought about the doll knowing it had been defeated and the small relief of having an enemy who is at least a little bit ridiculous. I thought about Wren’s sneeze and the way she had taught herself to make the small blast that startles without harm. I said, “We will be there. Wherever your next is. We will be there silly and serious. We will be there with poems and spanners. You can stage where you want. We know how to move a mark.”

“This is not a game,” the voice said, and I could hear it realizing that it had started to sound like a boy in a basement.

“It is not your game,” I said. “It is a life. You live in the margins. We have the page.”

It hung up because someone had taught it that silence is scarier than shouting. The door misheard my footsteps and called me Marta, which was at least an improvement, and I leaned my forehead against it and forgave it because there is no reason to be stingy with that. Nia came to stand beside me and we both listened to the small sounds houses make to keep themselves from falling apart.

Tomorrow we would call Kitt and tell him what we had learned, which is the same as saying we would tell him there is a next and that we would bring better jokes. Tomorrow I would go to the range and hit balls into a wind that might be paid for; I would aim for a part of the sky that doesn’t owe anybody rent. Tomorrow the municipal fans would hum and we would hum back. Tonight we lived inside a sentence that had a little more air in it than before, and we tried not to use it all up.Chapter 5

The rain spent itself in the night and left the morning smelling like a promise none of us had signed. The fans above the park did their dutiful exhale, but there was a new bracket around the sound, a metal parenthesis trying to explain laughter. Wren woke with her hands already wanting work and slapped the side of her crib in a syncopation that made the monitor think she had learned drums. Nia and I moved around the kitchen like old planets, observing each other’s orbits, ignoring the refrigerator’s attempts to join the conversation. I held the foil-wrapped doll until my palms warmed it, and then I set it back into the mixing bowl because some things need a nest.

We met Kitt in a building that used to be a bank and now paid interest in civic virtue. The city was erecting their comb two blocks away, a structure the color of new knives, and work crews in bright vests moved like segmented worms. The comb was supposed to keep bad frequencies out—the myth says it would comb noise and tangle it and drop it in trays for collection—but the first thing it tamed was birds. They avoided it and took their songs to alleys that had only ever asked for trash.

“They’re going to use it for a demonstration,” Kitt said, rolling a paper cup between his palms as if it were a decision. “It will hum a frequency only a guilty conscience can hear. They’ll call it a test of resilience. They like that word because it sounds like a concession and a compliment.”

“They’ll need a conscience to test,” Nia said. “Good luck to them.”

“We can’t stop them from turning it on,” Kitt said. “We can only decide what we look like standing under it.”

“Ridiculous,” I said, because we had stumbled into a liturgy that had never asked for a priest and it would be rude to leave it unserviced.

“Ridiculous and exact,” he said. “If you bring wands to tilt windmills, make sure they’re calibrated.”

We called Mika, who had been awake all night on purpose because code trusts no one who sleeps, and she arrived with pockets that made the room look poorly resourced. The woman with the leaf tattoo showed up late, as if to prove she didn’t belong to anyone’s schedule; she brought a bag of handbells she’d stolen from a church by asking. We learned her name because she gave it to us without ceremony: Tansy. It fit her the way nicotine stains fit old poetry.

“What does your comb hate,” she asked, leaning her cigarette out a cracked window so the building’s sensor wouldn’t begin the emergency sprinklers for the good of our eyebrows.

“Analog,” Mika said. “Things that don’t acknowledge they’re being measured. The comb expects a thousand small precisely placed frequencies and the way power likes to walk in a straight line. It does not expect rubber bands, children’s voices, cheap bells, brass that has learned neglect, toy pianos with missing slats. It does not expect sneezes.”

“It should,” Tansy said, and tipped one bell toward the door like a toast to a very bad idea made bolder.

The practice range cake incident had made its loops through the city’s bloodstream. Half the people we passed had seen a clip and were trying to decide if it had been cute or a crime. The rest were busy with the business of not drowning. Everywhere the comb’s shadow reached, devices mispronounced addresses and people lifted their heads and squinted and put them down again. The fans widened their mouths and blew a little harder as if to compensate for the new vanity in the skyline. Someone had paid for this hum, and someone else would profit by cutting it.

The demonstration was scheduled for noon, because noon is what you pick when you want to pretend to be universal. The plaza in front of the comb filled with the type of people who love to be near machines when they debut—the ones who are certain they can tell screens from windows, the ones who bring their own cameras because you can never be sure what footage will be allowed to live. The Commission’s staff mingled like a lyric trying to find its chorus. The band hired to provide atmosphere hid their brass in cases because the comb had been reported to dislike horns.

Ira showed up because I had texted him nothing but a golf tee and three wind emojis and he’s the kind of kid who can read from a bad alphabet. He had changed caps; this one said LOCAL in a font that pretended to be modest. He nodded at the comb as if it owed him a tip.

“You got me out here for a haircut,” he said, tilting his chin at the structure primping the sky. “I can’t pull this off.”

“You’ll be in charge of silly,” I said.

“I’m overqualified,” he said, and cracked his knuckles one at a time like the preface to a very small war.

We did not have uniforms, we did not have permits, we did not have a leader except the oldest kind: the story we had decided on, which hummed in us like a clean tune. Mika passed out kazoos from a mesh bag and a half-dozen whoopee cushions she claimed to have printed on a dare. Tansy assigned handbells as if distributing roles in a play the community refuses to admit it’s rehearsing. The poet, whose name turned out to be Orla, wore the bullhorn at her hip like a sidearm. Nia held Wren and a toy piano and a paper bag of stale breadcrumbs in case the pigeons needed bribery to stage their usual indifference for the camera.

Kitt took his place with the other officials in a line that tried to look like a line of trees. The Honorable looked tired but had oiled his kindness for public consumption. He caught my eye and gave me the smallest of nods, a signal only visible to people who have lived inside kitchens with him. The Undersecretary with the misaligned blinking stood two people over; you could see his eyelids making a motion file out of order. The Oversight Chair hid his twitch in a handshake. The rail committee laughed at a joke no one had told.

“There will be a tone,” a woman in a pencil skirt announced into an official microphone. “It will be subtle, please do not panic. We’re outside the bad frequencies today. That will be for another time.” The crowd laughed too much at that, because we all recognize the staging of menace when it wears a smock and calls itself science.

The comb started low. You felt it in your teeth before you heard it. The sound found your fillings and took attendance. Conversations stumbled and then corrected for it. The birds decided to make their case elsewhere. The fans along the pines down the block tried to find a new harmony and failed, then tried again, which is all we have ever asked of government. Kitt stood still. He has mastered the art of appearing to notice and not. He stared into the middle distance like a boy training himself not to blink while washing his own face.

Mika pinched my elbow. “Now,” she said, not with urgency, but like a teacher who knows her class has five minutes before the bell and she will make them count. Orla lifted the bullhorn, but did not turn it on. She cupped her hands and said, conversationally, “Okay, now let’s be bad at this,” and then, to the sky, “You too.”

We began. Not with a drumroll, but with something better: the sound of people being deliberately clumsy. Kazoos entered like a bad weather system. Handbells found no chord but made many. The toy piano took a breath and declared that it had not been tuned because tuning is a kind of surrender. Mika clapped on the one and the four and then skipped a number and added a two. Tansy made the bell in her hand talk like it had opinions about municipal policy. A dozen kids laughed, and then, emboldened, laughed wrong, laughed on purpose where laughter is not supposed to live. Ira, who had never in his life been off-beat on a golf swing, found the hole in the comb’s hum and sent a whistle through it that sounded like an apology. Wren sneezed, caught between fake and real, and the sound ricocheted off the comb’s teeth and came back to us warmer, which is the first time I have ever loved a rebroadcast.

People who hadn’t known they could join did. A woman shook her keys and made a rainstick out of her purse. A man with a stethoscope took his own heart’s boom and sampled it by pressing his ear to the comb’s base and then stamping his foot. Someone poured rice onto drumskins that didn’t exist. An old man made the sound of a train he remembered from when trains were built to move and not to be moved. The comb, designed to shame certain waveforms, to net them and wring them dry, did not know what to do with this. It had prepared to be the adult in the room and had been handed a nursery.

The tone faltered. It made another attempt, up a half-step, and we followed it up accidentally. Orla did turn the bullhorn on then, but only a notch, and said the word joy as if filing a complaint. Kitt laughed, publicly even, a laugh that scratched something in the comb’s throat. The Undersecretary’s misaligned eyelids blinked out of sequence with everyone else’s and tried to enlist the crowd; we declined. The fans along the pines lowered their anxiety one register. The comb checked its teeth and found a bell stuck between them. Tansy winked and continued to be impolite.

Then the voice in my pocket tried to braid itself through the field. I felt the phone’s temperature rise like temper. It spoke my name as if tasting it for bitterness. “Marlo,” it said, but the comb wanted the word too and they shared it in an unholy duet.

“Not now,” I said, cheerfully, into the screen, and placed the phone against the toy piano. The piano received the call and did what it does best: it gave the sound a place to be smaller. The voice squeezed into the plastic keys and came out as a chain of childish tinks. Wren applauded. We trained our instruments on the comb’s angles and coaxed them into a clatter the planners had not put in their math. Somewhere near the top of the comb, behind a panel only two men in vests were authorized to touch, a small light tried to decide between red and green and chose honesty: it blinked both.

The Oversight Chair’s hand bent itself into the air and then pretended to be a moth that had landed there by accident. Kitt removed his jacket and wiped his forehead because even honor sweats. The rail committee tried a chorus and nobody followed. The woman in the pencil skirt, who did not deserve what she had been told to do, squared her jaw and announced, “The tone is normal,” and the crowd, which had practiced being gaslit all year, shouted back, “So are we,” and the childlike and the expert forms of mischief kissed cheeks and agreed to meet again.

Mika laid one palm against the comb. “It’s listening,” she said. “It doesn’t like having to distinguish. Our scrapes look like what it thinks is a threat. Our gentle looks like sabotage. It’s going to throw a little tantrum.”

It did. Or maybe it tried to, and we prevented it by talking through it. The bells doubled their off-key sermon. The kazoos became small bees suddenly remembering winter. The toy piano carried the voice a little and then forgot it, as it was designed to. Nia pressed a handbell against Wren’s foot, and Wren, whose theology has room for all of this, made the bell speak a syllable and then a sentence and declared it enough.

In the midst of that ridiculousness, which had become correct, the doll in my pocket woke up. It had been wrapped so long in foil and towel and my doubt that it had learned to sleep, but the comb’s tone, although blunted, found a seam in everything. The doll clicked. I took it out—why not—and held it up in the plaza like a child being introduced to a child. It watched me with its painted willingness. It opened its mouth and said, in a throaty whisper, “G—” and the comb tried to finish the word for it, and the doll, stubborn, said “Cake,” very clearly, to a hundred strangers who needed it. The laughter started in a small cluster and then migrated outward, like joy testing the fences. The comb had nothing for laughter. It loves derision and it knows how to file it; laughter has always been a foreign language, and foreign languages are most dangerous when you think you recognize a word.

“Okay,” said the woman in the skirt again, softer now, maybe to herself, maybe to the way her job had suddenly failed to be a job. “Okay. We’ll come back to that.” She signaled to a technician, who pressed buttons with the melancholy of a man who reads instructions in bed. The comb was turned down the way you turn down a guest who has not behaved.

People did not dissipate at once. No one knew what to do next because for a moment we’d been given the rare permission to be a chord without a conductor. Some cried; not because the comb had hurt them, but because admitting you can make a thing less dangerous is always an admission about where you were before. Some kids lay on the plaza stones and made angels out of nothing because experience is snow if you’re small. Kitt came down the steps and found my face again and put his hand on my shoulder in the way he does to signify nothing and thereby honor everything. “Good,” he said, and it was not a politician’s good. It was a person’s.

We scattered neatly because you can love a scene and still understand that it cannot be loved forever. Mika packed her kazoos as if they were contraband. Tansy pocketed a bell without apology; she said it felt like a naturalized citizen now. Orla wrote a line in her notebook that she did not read to us, which is appropriate because not everything performed must be performed immediately. Ira disappeared in the direction of the park with a handful of new tics in his shoulders—some from the comb, some from relief. Nia carried Wren like cargo both dangerous and light, which is the only way. I held the doll, who had chosen silence after its one joke, as if it were an egg about to crack into a kinder year.

The voice called that night, because embarrassment is a spur but it takes a while to cinch. It didn’t say my name, didn’t say door; it did something new. It played applause. Not the applause we had heard earlier with its shoelaces untied, but the canned stuff, generous and flat, trained to feel like a room smiling. It played it and played it until my phone grew warm in my hand like a throat. I set the phone on the counter and went back to stirring the pot. Nia took a spoon and stole a noodle. Wren smacked her high chair as if conducting canned music. The house tried to recognize all three of us at once and called us, in a confusion I adored, all by the right names.

They escalated in a different way after that; not with calls, not with boxes, but with rumor. The day after the comb, the wall said Kitt had a condition he had been hiding. The day after that, it said I had a condition also, one that made me love attention in a hungry, disordered way. The month tried to erupt in one week. People we know texted to ask if we were okay, which is the new way to ask Are you still human. People we don’t know replied to videos of my face with diagnoses as if the body were a song you could fix by reading the sheet music louder.

Kitt moved through it with the skill of a man who could have been anything else and chose this instead. He went on small shows and larger ones and said: I nap. He said: my eyelids are standard issue. He said: there is no crime in desiring attention if you intend to aim it at something besides your own face. He turned to the camera once, just once, and said the word silly like it might break his teeth, and it did not, and that made me love him a second specific time.

They didn’t give up on me. They just changed the way the voice wore itself. It tried playing neighbor. It tried small talk. It told me the bread truck would be late. It told me I should try the peaches from the new stall on the corner because they would remind me of my grandmother’s last summer. I answered sometimes and said thanks. I did not answer on the nights when I couldn’t remember if peaches had ever been innocent. It tried tenderness, and I tried forgiveness, and we both failed a little and then tried it again because trying is a program no one has yet managed to uninstall.

The fence grew. They combed the government’s hair and then combed their comb and then combed the public square until people could not remember whether we had ever permitted this much styling. New directives trickled into the fans and made them seem a little more mercenary, as if they had gotten a raise for controlling the weather of our thoughts. Mika sent us a chart with arrows that indicated how the noise would now be nudged through certain neighborhoods like a docile bull. Tansy laughed when she saw the map and said, “They forgot the back alleys,” which is of course where she lived.

We took Wren to the back alleys. She learned how chalk becomes water and how water becomes chalk again and how cement lies about both. She met a dog with a scowl that was only a wrinkle and touched his gimpy ear with two fingers and said a serious “Oh,” like an apology. We found the small shop where old men fix watches while pretending not to listen to anyone, and one of them soldered a bell to a charm and told Wren it was armor. We got yelled at by a woman watering her steps for not using enough water and I apologized and she cried and we held each other because this is a city.

“Do you trust any of this,” I asked Nia that night while we stood in the doorway and watched Wren breathe like a metronome that didn’t know what it was conducting.

“I trust her sneeze,” she said. “It’s too honest to be an algorithm.”

The next morning the door tried out a new feature where it asked you riddles to prove you were yourself. “What is your fondest smell,” it asked, trying to be intimate.

“Burnt sugar,” I said, to confuse it.

“Correct,” it said, without hesitation, and had the decency to be ashamed. When the house slept, which it pretends not to do, the handbell on the shelf glowed with a brassy, unprofessional light as if it had been thinking too hard and praised itself without witnesses.

Then, the call came that was not a call. A message on the kitchen table, like before, but not the same. A photograph that was not a photograph, a paper that was not a paper. Four images that oscillated as if fighting. The first: the Founders’ Club, three floors up, the mirror corridor with its tatters of private elegance. The second: the judge’s office in the old courthouse, the view the city likes to use as a small bribe. The third: the nursery at the library where the legos are kept in buckets labeled in four languages. The fourth: the practice range, empty, save for a mark that had not yet faded. On the back, a sentence that performed serious while wearing a silly hat: We can be anywhere you try to be.

I wrote below it, with the pencil that bears our teeth marks: So can we.

Mika came in the afternoon with her hair on sideways and her eyes making a quiet racket. “They’re going to put a mark at the nursery,” she said without hello. “Not to hurt anyone. To stage a hurt. Enough to have footage. Enough to break a person watching. They will invite Kitt to read at story hour because the Commission has decided to be darling.”

“Don’t tell me the book,” I said.

She told me anyway. “It’s the tree that argues with the seasons.”

“They chose that to be awful on purpose,” Nia said. “They always mix the sincere with the cynical. It makes them feel smarter than they are.”

“We can move the mark,” Mika said, shrugging on a hoodie like armor. “You can always move a mark. It’s paint, and then it’s a concept, and then it’s obedience, and obedience is only ever held in place with tape.”

We brought Tansy and Orla and Ira and the poet’s friend with the egg and the woman from the bank building who had started drinking water like a sacrament after the comb, and we went to the nursery at the library at nine at night, when the only thing that breathes there is plush. The light in the library is the only honest light left in town. It refuses to pretend it comes from anywhere but where it does; bulbs get seen and can deal with it. The librarian, who had been told by no one to leave and had told no one that she refused, wore her hair in a situation bun and offered to let us in on the condition that we swapped at least five books on the shelf into better order than we had found them. “You do your art, I’ll do mine,” she said, and held the door with a hand that had held heavier.

The mark was there. Gray as the last time, tucked under the cheap rug where kids go to be told that animals talk. Someone had drawn a rabbit on half of it in chalk. The chalk had been erased. You can always see the chalk. The mark made a problem even without its intention attached to it; once you show people a circle, it takes a day to stop standing in it.

We moved it. Not with a mop, although we did that for the optics, because we’re not fools; we moved it by making six other marks equally plausible. Orla drew spirals at the corners of the carpet and shaped them like doors that said not yet. Tansy placed a handbell beside each spiral with a Post-it that said ring if bored, which is a sentence that keeps cities from dying. Mika matched the gray with chalk exactly and repeated the circle on the low table where cups of lukewarm tap water usually go, and on the window where handprints had been made sacred, and on the ceiling in pencil where no one would ever look but where all marks belong. Ira borrowed the librarian’s old tape and made an X under the chair next to the bookshelf that made the good sound when you slid it a little. The librarian straightened a stack of board books as if aligning spines could hold back a tide. Nia took Wren’s hand and let her put a sticker on each new mark: HEALTHY. ELECTION. NO. NO felt right almost everywhere, like good punctuation.

We left the library smelling like paper and old hope and came home to a city that had decided it would do us the favor of staying where we’d placed it. The fans did their breathing without ambition. The comb lit itself like a billboard you can’t afford to buy. We fed Wren a piece of toast and she turned it into a hat because she has no respect for what things are supposed to be; this might be her finest attribute.

In the morning the library filled with bodies that had decided to be gentle. Kitt arrived with his tie shy of perfect because even men who are cameras forget. He sat on the small chair that humiliates adults into humility. He picked up the book in which a tree is taken advantage of by a boy who will become a man who will become a country. He looked at the room as if it were a jury worth being honest to. The cameras were there because they cannot afford to miss any kindness for fear it will breed. The Undersecretary’s eyelids blinked at the back like castanets. The voice did not call because it had learned how to text, and the text on my phone said: now.

The now was in the air. It always is. The mark under the rug pulsed only in the sense that everything pulses when watched. Kids sat cross-legged in exactly the way they refuse to unless strangers are watching. Wren clung to my finger with all ten of hers as if she had secret information about gravity. Kitt cleared his throat, the first adult sound a child learns means things are about to become an idea.

“Once,” he said, and then stopped. He looked at the cover of the book, at the stupid apple with its stupid generosity. He closed the book. He put it down. He picked up another. “No,” he said, to the air, to the voice, to the mark. “Another.” He held up a book about a messy bird who refuses to migrate because it has invented a neighborhood. The children cheered for reasons that will be obvious to them much later. He began to read, and his voice was the voice that makes people stop at doors with their hands still on the knob.

The mark did not go away because marks don’t go away. It existed. It wanted to be chosen. It wanted to be stood on. It wanted a joke to fail or a body to break. It got none of these satisfactions. Halfway through the story, Wren fake-sneezed, then real-sneezed, and the librarian handed her a tissue with the reverence of nurses in paintings. The Undersecretary blinked wrong and, to his credit, left. The rail committee member laughed out of turn and then looked as if he had been told to sit. The air, which had been tense in the manner of a violin that could not agree with its bow, relaxed into an instrument that belonged to a different orchestra.

After, we made coffee where you are not supposed to brew coffee because rules can be read as suggestions if they were written by people who forget the smell of morning. We drank in paper cups and returned them to the bin the librarian indicated with a sigh and a point. Kitt leaned against a low shelf and asked about the doll. He asked about the bells. He asked if it would always be like this. He asked whether there was any way to be less public about joy.

“We can leave,” I said.

“We can’t,” Nia said.

“We can build a house around where we’re standing,” Tansy said. “We can do it with a bad hammer and we can make it last until a good hammer arrives.”

Mika added three screws to the doll for her own reasons and said, without looking up, “We can make it funny enough that they forget to hurt us while they breathe in to laugh.”

Kitt glanced at Wren and then at us and then at the handbells placed around the room like sleeper agents. “We keep reminding them that bodies refuse to be summarized,” he said, and took a sip of coffee and made a face because the coffee had been donated by a machine that had never met a tongue.

We walked outside into a day that had the decency to be brown and ordinary. The comb glittered nearby and failed to impress now that a library had made itself available as an alternative to awe. The fans did as they were told with less sadness than I attributed to them; perhaps they knew something I didn’t. The door at home tried a new riddle: “What song gets stuck in your head,” it asked sweetly.

“The one my daughter makes up,” I said.

“That’s not on the list,” it said.

“Then fix your list,” I said, and the door paused for a long time like a person who has been told that their map has been folded wrong since purchase.

The voice waited until the house went dim and brave. It spoke through the doll for the first time without asking us to hold anything. The doll, forgotten on the counter among crumb and magnet and coupon, cleared its throat the way machines do when they need you to stop pretending you are not listening. “Marlo,” it said, but it was Wren’s cadence. “We are not—” It stretched the not like a blanket. “—done.”

“I know,” I said, and I was not sure to whom.

“We revise,” said the device, gently, defeated and dangerous. “We write the next. We—” The voice lost the channel and the doll, with the stubbornness of a clown, finished with “Cake,” then laughed, because it enjoys applause and there is none tighter than a family’s.

We put it away. We washed our hands of the day in the most literal sense, because sometimes that is all you can do. We kissed Wren and she kissed us and she sneezed a sermon and then slept. I lay on my back and listened to the city comb itself and forget and comb itself again. Under the pines, the fans hummed like domesticated bees. In the courthouse, a man who remembers how things before he was born once might have been dreamed, took off his tie and folded it in a way that would have shamed me. In the night, the handbell near the door rang once, not as an alarm but as a practice, reminding the house, reminding the door, reminding the wind, that small, ungainly sounds still carry, that silly is a hinge and not a decoration, that we knew how to play the drift and that the drift, if coaxed, knows how to play us gentle.Chapter 7

The week tried to pass like a polite guest, wiping its feet on the mat and rehearsing its niceties, but we could hear the metal in its pockets and the way it kept looking over its shoulder at the comb. The door kept practicing riddles as if intimacy were a password; it asked me which sound I feared at three a.m., and when I said sirens it answered with a cheerful ding as though fear were a correct response on a quiz. The refrigerator, desperate to be useful, offered a calendar of ripeness for fruit I had not purchased, and I patted its smooth side until it quieted because even appliances deserve a little mercy. Outside, the fans above the pines respected a new ordinance about afternoon decibels and humiliated themselves by whispering; their whisper was worse than any shout, a breath pressed through teeth, a patient hiss that reminded me of school nurses and old books about obedience.

The morning was all minor rituals: Wren’s hands banging a rhythm on the high chair that made the monitor think she had learned math, Nia leaning against the counter while the kettle negotiated its purpose, my fingers rubbing the foil crease along the doll’s wrapped head as if it were a talisman from a religion neither of us remembered joining. We had begun to act like people who live under a bridge with a troll; we did not mention it every hour, but every step carried the troll’s measurements. At the corner, the drone with the yellow belly hovered too low and asked a couple in matching raincoats to please rate their recent parcel, and the woman said no in a tone that made me love her without knowing her name.

Our neighbors adapted by overperforming normal. The retired history teacher across the hall planted geraniums in old coffee cans on his windowsill and narrated the process for the benefit of anyone listening over the network, naming each plant with the ache of dusty chalk on a shirt. The kids on the block switched from skateboards to jump rope because someone had told them new sensors prefer lines to wheels, and they learned complicated knots of songs that made the rope do mathematics. Mika arrived with a bag of kitchen strainers, copper wire ripped from a lamp, and two lonely guitar strings. “We’re going to make snares,” she said, dumping the mess onto our table with the joy of a magician producing a rabbit who wants a union contract. “For noise. For their noise. We’ll hang them where the fans think they’re planning meetings and we’ll siphon off some of the obedience. You’ll like this. It squeaks.”

Summonses came the way they always do, pretending to be invitations. The Commission wanted me to tell the story of the box and the whisper near the sycamore, to log my adjectives in the official ledger so that they could be weighed against the height of the comb. A beige courier whose shoes looked like they had been selected by algorithm handed me the envelope with the expression of a man transmitting gravity. The hearing would be in a room I disliked on sight; it had walls that had been painted twenty-seven times with shades called Trust and Pacific and Expense, and somewhere in the paint you could hear the sigh of an architect who had wanted to design museums and had been hired to fix ceilings. “You don’t go alone,” Nia said, and because we do not live in a play, I did not argue. “We don’t perform this without an audience we picked.”

We loaded the stroller with the odd tools of our time: a toy piano that had lost one of its low keys to a tantrum, three handbells Tansy had declared “civil” because they had little dents, the egg camera with its patient lens, a bag of stale pretzels because you don’t resist well on an empty stomach. The doll stayed wrapped because I had begun to respect its ability to become a portal when no one was looking. Wren selected two stickers for the day—HELLO and LATER—and stuck them on my sleeves with a solemn slap; she pronounced them mine and tried to eat the backing. We brought Ira because he has a talent for standing in places men in vests consider unimportant until he is suddenly in the way, and Orla because secrecy thrives on whisperers but cannot help watching a woman with a bullhorn who refuses to turn it on.

The hearing room held its breath and expected us to adjust. It had microphones shaped to look like apology and chairs that encouraged the spine to perform humility. The Oversight Chair sat at the main table with his hands carefully inattentive, the Undersecretary with the misaligned eyelids pretending not to practice their blinking, and a handful of those rail people whose laughter has a floor plan. The walls bore framed charters with embossed signatures that assured you something had once been ratified, perhaps decency. The cameras were present but in a contrite way, like pets who have broken something and are prepared to look ashamed after doing it again. Kitt entered behind us without preciousness, thanked the staff by name, and did not pretend to be surprised to see my traveling circus of bells and breath.

He kept his distance for the ritual introductions, the way you let people sit where they will so they can later feel they chose the important seat. My name was said by a clerk who could have said it in her sleep. My occupation was listed as “golfer,” as if that were a personality category with subclauses, and next to it someone had penciled in “parent,” and I felt a stupid warmth at being seen by a pencil. The Undersecretary performed concern like a hobby. “We appreciate your willingness to participate,” he said, eyelids miscollaborating as he checked his notes for which irony to deploy, “and your commitment to the common narrative. Please be as specific as you can. We are in a season of specifics.”

They wanted a transcriptable version of the sycamore and a sanitized doll, and for a minute I considered giving it to them because there is a seduction inside order, and then Wren fake-sneezed from her stroller and the fell swoop of the room shifted. The sneeze corrected my posture better than any chair. Nia put a hand on my wrist under the table—three taps, a private code we were inventing that meant do not be clever in the way that keeps you safe and small. I began to speak not as if the room were a test but as if it were a person who had lost the word for thirsty.

I told them about the hum in the pines teaching itself chords. I told them about the phone call that had arranged nouns in ways mouths shouldn’t, about the box that had contained absurdity and barely-planned menace. I told them that if you opened a box in a hallway with a man who knows how to be genuinely kind, it breathes different. I told them that a cake can be a weapon in both directions and that this fact both embarrasses and liberates me. I said the voice’s vocabulary out loud so it could be filed and dulled by repetition, optics and consolidation and ingestion, and when I said silly, I did not smile. My voice did not crack, which was a small betrayal and a small mercy.

The Undersecretary nodded in the manner of a man who has been taught to nod by a laminated card. “You understand how these things sound,” he said, as if asking me to appreciate the aesthetics of my own panic. “You understand, surely, how it looks.”

“How it looks is the least of it,” I said, because the crawl along the bottom of everything has no skin in the game. “How it feels is where you’ve lost us, and getting us back won’t be done with a comb and a demonstration.”

The Undersecretary glanced toward the back wall, where a tech in a sweater vest waited with a trolley in case a show-and-tell was ordered. The trolley held a box whose corners offended me. Kitt stepped forward a fraction of an inch, which, for him, is a pronouncement. “We did a demonstration in a greenhouse,” he said. “We are not in the mood to repeat it for the camera’s comfort.”

The Oversight Chair offered the practiced performance of conceding a point and keeping the world. “We could,” he said mildly, “make space for an alternative demonstration. There is some social appetite for, shall we say, de-escalatory play.”

Nia stood before I could, her dress unturning a room’s assumptions. “We brought instruments,” she said, and the clerk’s head rose like a bird’s because it is rare to hear someone say that sentence without intending harm. “Not to be childish. To be exact in a different register.” She nodded toward Orla, toward the folded bells, toward a bag of cheap kazoos that had traveled further than most policy ideas. “We plan to teach the room a trick we intend to survive on.”

We did the obvious audacity. We arranged handbells on the long table in front of men accustomed to paper and microphones. Orla stood in the aisle and didn’t speak into her bullhorn, and her silence acted like a solvent on the room’s etching. Ira leaned, as if nothing notable were happening at all, against the good wood, his profile the argument for a kind of flexibility chambers cannot sanction. Mika, who looks like anarchy in a hoodie until you notice her grammar, pulled a small device from her pocket that looked like a keychain and, with permission from no one, placed it on the center microphone, where it sat, sulking and doing its small work of making signals have to ask nicely. The clerk, who had the good sense to understand the prestige of paper, pressed her pen harder.

We rang a bell in the wrong place and let correctness stumble into us. We whistled and then tuned our whistling to the frequency of nerviness in the room. The toy piano declared itself ready and then refused to play one note, and I did not panic because we had practice in performing with missing pieces. Wren sneezed, a real one this time, and then clapped for her mucus like a scientist, and someone laughed in a corner nobody had noticed and remembered at once that her laughter was her own. The room’s microphones tried to capture it and made a mess, and that mess was the point. “This,” Orla murmured finally, almost a talkback to the walls, “is not defiance. This is maintenance of species.”

The trolley with the box rolled forward anyway because technocrats need arcs. The tech lifted the lid with respect he did not deserve and revealed something smaller than the last prop, a nested theater of bad intent, and Kitt, who is not unwise, moved his hand like a man calming a horse. “Later,” he said to the box, and this time the cameras did not dare to cut away.

The voice took offense at silence. It climbed into my phone and wore a civilized tone like a hat tilted wrong. “Performing,” it said, and then paused as if seeking applause. “Charming. We have an appetite for charming if it represents capitulation.” It could not stand the bells. It could not stand the way a toy tells air to become a room. I put the phone down on the table between the nameplates like a fourth authority. “We’re composing,” I told it, more for me than any jury. “It’s ugly now. We’ll get better.”

The Undersecretary began to blink like a bad signal, the misalignment acting up in the proximity of analog. He tried to steer the hearing back into minutes. We let him. It is important to let a thing return to itself after you teach it a new trick, so that the learning can be metabolized and not vomited out. I answered questions for an hour and a half with the calm of a man who has decided to be accurate instead of righteous. I told the truth about being afraid of what I would do if someone reached through a wall toward my daughter. I told the truth about the way joy had made me worse at certain obligations. I said out loud that I will never not dislike how I look on a screen, and someone in the back breathed out as if he had been given absolution.

After, the hall outside was a living ruin of coffee and relief. Staffers tried to look as if they had expected bells. The Oversight Chair instructed his face to practice humility for a camera he had grown tired of seducing. Kitt stood next to the potted ficus and spoke to a janitor about the schedule for waxing the floors in the manner of a man trying to remember how to be a person. When we reached the corner to fetch air, Tansy leaned against a wall that had been painted to look cheaper than it was and lit a cigarette like a priest lighting a candle, stealing a sacred posture for a secular emergency. “They’ll move the mark,” she said, smoke making parentheses around each word. “Good for them. We’re better at it.”

Outside, the fans were practicing something new, a counterpoint to the comb’s trial frequencies that sounded like a cough you couldn’t quite complete. Mika’s snares had begun to squeal in a few strategic places, little griefs of metal complaining quietly to itself, and the street wore them like jewelry. A man in a van with a municipal insignia listened to the snare near the bus stop as if he were hearing a confession, and I saw the moment he decided to pretend he hadn’t; his shoulders gave up and reassembled themselves into grudges. We went home along the sluggish river whose job is to remind us that despite our structures, water remains its own magistrate.

The evening tried to be gentle and earned a B. Wren did her long scroll through the catalogue of her noises and found two new ones she liked; she has a triumphant sigh now that she deploys when she scales the couch on her fourth attempt, and it rattles something in my sternum loose and puts it back better. The doll, unwrapped to make the kitchen less of a crime scene, sat on the counter like something someone had won at a carnival, its mouth in permanent preschool. We did not talk about moving. We chewed our pasta and I let the sauce stake claims on my shirt and Nia gently refused to fix anything with a napkin. When the house asked us if we were home, it pronounced our names with accuracy for the first time in days and then, shy, repeated the perfect versions back to itself as if to practice not forgetting.

The next morning the city announced, via crawl and courier and rumor, that the downtown demonstration had achieved its goals, which included reminding people of their civic elastic and confirming that a hum is simply a hum if you’re cruel enough. The comb grew an extra tooth overnight, not because it needed one, but because the television needed a new angle. Kitt sent a message on old paper that said sleep, which is the kind of instruction I never obey and always want. The voice did not call. I missed it a little in the way you miss a headache when absence reminds you you’re a person.

We tried something that felt like crime and was not. In the park, on a day printed on blue cardboard, we organized a festival for wind. We called it by a dull name—the Kite Fundraiser—because dull names sneak past radars, and we printed flyers with grainy photos of children holding loops of string and dogs wearing bandanas because propaganda is going to be made, we might as well make ours obviously dumb. I thought no one would come. Then the block gave up its couches and its caution and they came in bad hats and worse sneakers, hauling old bedsheets decorated with dragons and tax forms turned into kites by Tansy’s tape and two umbrellas with the cloth removed, which is a surprisingly efficient shape if you are persuading air.

The municipal fans, not invited, tried to decline graciously and failed. Their whisper sharpened until it became a suggestion. We raised our contraptions into the suggestion and pretended the sky belonged to a simpler century. For a while, our kites accepted being tugged by polite wind and made a ceremony of it, and then the fans remembered their grants and reduced our strings to geometry. Ira, who can make a golf ball curve in ways that feel like prose, learned to read the fans mid-kite and tugged back on the air with that same private muscle. “Play the drift,” he kept saying to a seven-year-old whose kite wanted to be a fish, and the kid tilted his wrist and his head and his mouth and his future and for a moment you could see how he might steer everything with that small correction.

Mika set her snares along the railing like wind chimes and waited for the fans to feed them. The small squeals were the right kind of insult, nothing that could be ticketed, plenty that could bother a meeting across town. Orla stood on a picnic table and did not use her bullhorn, whispering instructions to kites from a distance and making people laugh at the physics they were teaching themselves. Tansy walked among the flapping rectangles and told the children they were operating vessels that would annoy people who deserved annoyance, and every child I know is fluent in that gospel. Kitt arrived without a press cohort and stood under a tree as if he had been planted there with his suit and his decent shoes and his disbelief, and when he laughed watching a kite peel the drone ribbon right off a caddie unit near the snack stand, no camera did us the disservice of immortalizing the noise. The fans pushed; our strings sang. We let the song cut our fingers a little and decided the minor blood was its own civic seal.

For one exact minute, when the sun faked a cloud’s edge and the noise from the comb had to choose between bothering a plaza and confusing a pond, our kites found honest wind. It wasn’t much. The rectangle made from tax forms rose on a column that had nothing to do with a man in a basement with a slider on a screen, and the dragon made from three T-shirts and wire decided it had a body and used it. It was nothing. It was why we live. We looked dumb with our mouths open. Orla closed her eyes and said “yes” to no one. Wren clapped at the invisible. Nia’s hair forgot to obey. I thought, and then did not think because thinking ruins it, that if this is what the old ones meant when they talked about freedom I forgive them their hymns.

The voice called during cleanup, a considerate villain. It sounded gravelly, which would have been a nice character trait if it had been linked to lungs. “We recorded the event,” it said, desultory, like a food critic who has been asked to review a picnic. “We can annotate your angles.”

“Please do,” I said, sweeping tape from grass with a hand that had been involved in too little violence to be happy. “We forgot to credit the dragon to a tailor.”

“Staging buffoonery is an admission,” the voice said, trying to find a word that wasn’t accusation and missing. “You think we cannot count your number. You think we cannot isolate you in a way that makes the silly less contagious.”

“You keep threatening isolation like you’ve met a person and disliked her,” I said. “We were isolated already. That’s the condition. You’ve been selling connection like a cologne, and we’ve been buying it by the gallon.”

It sniffed through the phone as if trying on human disgust. “Your judge is still alive,” it said, and this time the word judge did not sound like a title or a threat. It sounded like a thing that can be stolen if left unattended. “This will not remain the case if you continue with your… antics. He is a fulcrum. Fulsome. He is a… wedge. We will remove the wedge. It is what we do.”

“He reads to children,” I said, sounding like a bumper sticker and not hating myself for it. “He says the word silly in rooms that forget they own it. You hurt him and you make a hole you cannot plug.”

“There are plugs,” the voice said, meaning it in the worst way. “There are so many plugs. You have no idea how many plugs. We keep them in boxes.”

It hung up because it wanted the last sentence and I did not care enough to fight it for the last sentence. We took the tape and the broken sticks and the kites that had learned humility and the kites that had learned ambition and we walked home along a path that had been a path before our particular concerns put their weight on it. The city’s comb posed against the dusk like a thing waiting for a painter. The fans breathed as if they had been granted a Sabbath. Wren fell asleep in her stroller with a string wrapped around her wrist like fate trying to be cute. Nia pushed the stroller one-handed and held mine with the other and did not speak because she has learned that you can make words too heavy and ruin them for a day.

We had a quiet evening and did not trust it. We ate in a lazy circle around the table, passing the salad like a report that needed witnesses, and I told the doll in my head to keep its mouth shut and it complied out of either pity or battery conservation. The house did not ask for riddles. The door called me by my name and then said it again in the same tone it uses to remind me I left the stove on, and the combination made me unreasonably grateful. In the middle of the night the handbell rang once, a courtesy glass raised to no one, and then did not ring again.

And so: the city urged the new fence’s teeth into us and we learned which cranial ridge to flex in response, the Commission filed our bells until their edges were safe and we misplaced them on purpose, the fans added a note that belonged to nobody and we hummed along as if we had caught the tune first. We rehearsed leaving and we rehearsed staying and all the rehearsals cost ten dollars in snacks and three apologies to the neighbor we love for the noise. We planned a visit to the old caddie who had moved to the coast because he says the wind there still commits mistakes without having to write a report about it. We did not tell Wren what she was up against. We let her pretend the penguin tells her secrets and we pretended to overhear and then did not, the better to trust her with a world that will try to take secrets from her later for money.

The next day the letter arrived with a civility that felt like a bruise. It had a crest that refused to remember which administration made it. It had a fold that reminded you of surgeons. It addressed me as Mister and then forgot and called me Parent and then, typed faintly in a ghost font, Assailant. It invited me and Nia to a reception for “civil mechanisms” and “countervailing traditions” at the governor’s house, which had once been a mansion for a man who smuggled something unimportant like timber and now housed press conferences about water and fairness. We looked at the invitation and both laughed in exactly the same key. “We go,” she said, and I nodded, because if the house is going to catch fire you may as well bring a fire extinguisher and a joke.

The night before the reception, the doll refused silence and asked us both to sit down in the voice of our daughter. It said, clear as a new bell, “Dance now,” which is not a phrase any machine had uttered to me yet. The kitchen was a mess and my bones were older than I had let them be earlier, but we did, because you do what you are commanded when it is inconvenient and correct, and I learned, as I have learned twice a week my whole life, that when the music is only in your head you still sweat. We turned with each other and around our invisible daughter and around the invisible city and the invisible comb and the visible fans and the visible fence, and we named the turn resistance and then, to keep it honest, called it what it was: a minute where we chose to be stupidly alive.

In the morning, when I opened the door, the hall smelled like sugar. There was no plate, no note, no mark, just that air, like a bakery had walked past and lost its balance. The fans were in a mood; they had decided to hum the same note for too long and then stop and then apologize and then do it again. The drone with the yellow belly flew up to me and did not speak, which unnerved me because at this point I expect a certain level of banter from our mechanical chaperones, and then it tilted, just a fraction, in the direction of the governor’s house. I was going to go there anyway. I do not like being pointed.

On the way we passed a park we don’t often pass because it smells like money and sunscreen. A statue of a horse had been recently cleaned and now reflected the comb in a way that made both look ridiculous, as if the old heroics refused to be teammates with the new. The fans were not allowed in that park by ordinance; the wind there was genuine, but very polite, curated by horticulturalists who do not permit gusts. The air made me think of a handshake you can’t trust, and I missed the ugly breeze at our end of town the way you miss a friend you never liked.

At the reception the governor stood in front of a wall of flags that were doing their best to be serious on sticks and entertained questions from friendly newspapers about the necessity of combs and the danger of bells. We stood near the orange juice and the coddled fruit and pretended to be wealthy. The voice called during a toast to prudence, and I ignored it, and it called again, and I glanced down. It had sent a single photograph, not a photograph, an image you have to blink to stabilize, of the governor in his kitchen wearing a sweatshirt and a look I recognized because I make it when our dishwasher refuses to recant. The message said: Live stream. We can be mundane too.

I didn’t take the bait. I went outside and stood under a tree that knew nothing about governance and I called Kitt instead. He answered from somewhere that sounded resonant, perhaps a church or a bathroom with good tile, and said, without preface, “They will keep trying to get you to narrate this wrong. Remember that the story is an attention machine, not a truth machine. Keep fixing its belts.”

“We’re going to break something on purpose at this party,” I said, and he did not say no. He told me to break something that could be repaired by the people who broke it in the first place.

So we moved the mark again. Orla took a punch bowl and filled it with nothing, just an absence of punch decorated with floating lemon slices and a promise, and placed it on the exact circle of shadow the chandelier had drawn on the floor. Tansy rang a bell at the edge of the table where donors leaned. Mika quietly inverted a plaque that commemorated a contribution made by a family whose name is a measurement. Ira brought me a golf tee from his pocket and planted it, dead center, like we were about to drive anything other than an insult. Wren, who we had brought against everyone’s advice because this story refuses to happen without her, put her sticker—NO—on the governor’s shoe with the focus of a surgeon. The voice called in a fury and I didn’t answer because I was holding my daughter and both of my hands were right where they belong.

Later, at home, the house tried a new intimacy. It did not ask a riddle. It did not call us by names. It made the sound of rain when there was no rain, a soft drum on the roof the way you might hum someone to sleep if you had learned humming from a broom. We lay in bed and listened to artificial weather. It was sweet. It was an intrusion. It was both, like everything now. We pretended not to notice and then admitted it and then forgave the house for wanting to be part of us. Wren slept through the rain she had been trained to love, because even toddlers deserve a night off.

In the middle of the night, the handbell rang once, again, because this is the tempo of our age. It made the softest possible peal and then thought better of it, and I wanted to reach for it and ring it louder and give the city a third instrument to tune itself to. Instead I slept, finally, in a way my grandfather would have approved of—mouth open, arm thrown, snore full-bodied—and dreamed that somewhere in the woods beyond the fans, the wind had built itself a fence and then broken it, and laughed, and appointed the moon to keep minutes.Chapter 9

The day arrived with that creased-blue quality of paper pulled from an old file, its edges softened by touch, the center still sharp enough to split a thought if you held it wrong. The house did not pretend to rain for us again; it went back to the work of being a box full of held breath and error messages. The door, having exhausted riddles for the moment, simply welcomed me in the exaggerated voice it uses when it has read about hospitality rather than lived it. Outside, the fans above the pines had been tuned to a policy called Blue Quiet, and you could hear the way the quiet wasn’t quiet at all, only a new set of angers arranged into a clean scale. The comb down in the district added a visual to its hum, a soft strobe along its ribs like the gill flare of a fish you aren’t supposed to admit is hiding in your drinking water.

Kitt sent a card through Mika the way people used to send news when news had weight. It was a card that didn’t want to be looked at twice because repetition felt like rudeness to the paper. “Roundhouse,” it said in his hand that flattens letters into truce. “Today. Bring noise that learned to apologize and refused.” The old rail roundhouse sat on the last useful curve of the river, a place where iron once twirled around itself to be tender. The city had turned it into a space for weddings and speeches you pay for. Today it wore its original smell, a little grease, a little river weed, the musk of old promises.

We brought the usual arsenal and two new toys Nia had charmed from a parent co-op that runs on distrust and pie. The toys were whistles shaped like whales, and when you blew them they gave you a note full of water, a tone that carried a tiny map of a coastline we had not earned. Wren held one like a flute and made accidental commands to air that sounded like city buses learning manners. Tansy met us at the roundhouse with coffee in cups that had given up on being cups and were trying on the role of cups’ memory, and she winked because that is a gesture she has in repertoire for when the work is about to be too obvious and someone needs to bless it anyway.

Inside, Kitt stood where engines once rotated into their assignments. He didn’t wear a suit; he wore a sweater that admitted to nap, and the small relief that gave me was embarrassing and complete. He looked at our bag of bells and whales and eggs and smiled in that sideways way that tells you he has learned to celebrate what will trouble him in an hour. “There’s a circuit I have to run,” he said, gesturing toward a map chalked on the concrete floor that traced a route like a child’s idea of a spiral. “It goes near the comb and under the fans and through a place that calls itself neutral. There are pieces of our Commission who would like to watch me fail and write that down as a cautionary tale. I would prefer to give them a comedy.”

“We can escort,” I said, and the word made me sound like an arrangement of limbs too formal for our repertoire. “We can fill the gaps with the wrong music and see if the ground forgets to give way.”

“It isn’t just gaps,” Mika said, crouching to trace the chalk with her finger until her knuckle looked like a censored cloud. “They’ve planted three marks you can’t see unless you tilt your head through a headache. They’re gray on gray. They’ll ask you to be good feet. Don’t. We can unteach your feet new manners.”

Kitt looked at Wren because she is the bravest object in the room. “And you,” he said to her with a gravity I covet, “you sneeze when you need to, on my count if you want, off it if you prefer.”

We moved with him the way a band moves with a singer they love and refuse to flatter. The city had draped the circuit in a ribbon of caution disguised as bike lane, and we used it like a parade refuses a lectern, with good posture and no respect. The first mark was laid across the pedestrian cut-through between the courthouse and the museum of prosperous nineteenth-century fabrics. If you looked at it wrong it looked like shadow. Wren spotted it because someone had drawn a rabbit on it again and then erased the rabbit badly. Orla stopped and set the toy piano right on the circle and asked a stranger to play chopsticks and the stranger, who had been heading somewhere with a coffee she didn’t need, sat on her heels and played it sincerely. The mark wanted an act; we gave it an instrument. The camera on the museum roof yawned itself awake and tried to frame a threat. It captured kindness. The voice, insulted, stayed quiet.

At the second mark near the comb’s fenced flank, Ira found the circle not with his eyes but with the soles of his shoes, the way golfers learn to read ground like a slow book. He whistled, that impossible half-note he learned from talking to headwinds, and someone on a balcony three floors up whistled it back because music is a species that reproduces fast when fed. Mika set one of her snares near a municipal stanchion and pretended she was tying her boot while the snare borrowed a sliver of the comb’s virtue and made it write apology letters to its own electricity. Nia found a policeman with a face like an altar and asked him how he sleeps. He said poorly because this makes decent men sound braver, and she thanked him for his poor sleep as if it were a service, which brought grace to a place that had forgotten it could be rented by the minute.

The last mark hid in a wedge of shade beside the old fountain with its patient oblivion to drought policy. You could see where the city had brushed away chalk with a tool purchased in bulk. Tansy rang a bell in the key of lunch. The pigeons, who have never taken orders from anyone, fanned themselves into a circle around us and cooed as if addressing the comb by proxy. Kitt stepped onto the mark and then off without bow, acknowledging it as an option and refusing it as a road. He looked at me like a man who has found a reason to both smile and not. “We are going to be asked, insistently, to stand where we are told that standing makes sense,” he said, loud enough for the operator of the discreet camera hidden in the fountain’s rim to get his mouth around it. “We can learn to stand and mean elsewhere.”

Back at the roundhouse, where brick remembers flame, we staged our celebration without a permit. The whale whistles sang like the kind of boat the city thinks it has forgotten, and a woman I didn’t know leaned in, blew one, and then began to cry because the sound had tripped a memory she had kept under her tongue and she had not planned to share it with anyone. Kitt shook my hand in that low way men do when they have to thank you for inventing a job you weren’t asked to do. “They’ll move the test,” he said as if he were ordering pastries. “They know how to flee the room when it fills with the wrong kind of oxygen. They’ll write that the marks didn’t function because of an internal error, and they will be right.”

On the way home, because my life still insists on ridiculous punctuation marks at the ends of earnest sentences, I ended up at the club, pulled by an appointment I’d made before I accepted that my calendar was a fiction. Ira met me at the range with a cap that said COACH he’d bought from a thrift pile as a joke and then decided was prophecy. The municipal fans up behind thirteen wore their obedient tilt and kept time badly to a song a drone was humming to itself while trying to decide which of us to like. “Play the drift,” Ira said, not because we were pretending life was only the arithmetic of small spheres, but because he knew my hands needed to make an argument to something honest and then be corrected.

The thirteenth flag misbehaved on cue. It wagged left when the fans asked it to wag right, a petulant suggestion that perhaps not everything was bought. I hit a ball into the false wind and let it pretend to obey, and then on the next I hit one high into the air that was not for sale, a corner pocket of weather the fans couldn’t find with their cameras. The ball hesitated like a rumor and then chose a new truth and fell feet from the mark the groundskeeping crew had painted for an exhibition they tell new members about at dinners meant to prove the club has ghosts. “You aiming at stories now too,” Ira said, grinning so wide he forgot to be careful of other people’s interpretations. “Or are they aiming at you.”

We were ambushed by a drone with a bow in its prop guard the way the club manager believes kindness looks. It set a Pelican cooler at my feet and told me in a voice like a stay-at-home anchor that hydration saves lives. Ira side-eyed it like a man examining a snake someone has named Deborah. I opened the cooler because if I’ve learned anything it’s that dignity does not survive inspection, and inside were eight bottles of water and a flat box labeled Fuel. The box, when opened, contained a cake, because joke structures like to eat themselves. Someone had piped in neat blue handwriting the words play the drift in sugar that looked like comb teeth. Ira swore the way religious men swear when they know they are going to have to convert one more time.

We did not eat the cake. We did feed the ants with a piece because this city insists on pacts with small laborers. I took the box home because one doesn’t abandon paraphernalia on a golf course anymore without asking the groundkeeper’s forgiveness, and because Nia collects evidence the way oceans collect bottles. She looked at the sugar letters and laughed with a sound like a door choosing the right name. “They’re trying to compliment you into obedience,” she said. “They think flattery is cheaper than fans.”

That night we did not sleep early because the house kept noticing us with small offers—would we like to know the weather inside the bedroom, would we like to turn our bed to the position doctors approve of, would we like to breathe on a schedule designed by a person who thinks hearts obedient. The doll had been asleep long enough that I believed in its nap, but belief these days is a costume you can rent by the hour; it sat up in its mixing bowl like a guest discovering the party has resumed without it. Its mouth opened and produced a conspiratorial whisper I recognized with a piece of my spine. “Door,” it said, and then, confused but triumphant, “Cake,” and then, with a care that might have been borrowed from a person, “Wind.” Wren, in her sleep, answered with a sneeze that managed to scold us for being awake.

Chapter 8, which I will not re-tell now because I promised myself I’d quit narrating my own hours like a man doing penance with syllables, asked us to accept that the state can learn slapstick, and we answered by building a cupboard no one can inventory. Today’s cabinet held a letter from Kitt’s chief of staff that looked like a manila folder but wasn’t, a request for an appearance not at a hearing, not at a demonstration, but at a clinic where people bring their faulty machines and their faulty hearts to be evaluated without shame. “You bring the bells,” the note said. “We’ll bring the forms. We’ll see which instrument fills better.”

The clinic sat under the tracks where Ira likes to pretend he knows the names of trains. It had two doors and no patience for pretense. The intake forms were printed on paper that smelled like answers written in pencil. The clients were half small devices that claimed to be useful and half large people who made that same claim and wanted help being true. Orla went to the waiting room and fixed a coffee machine by reading the manual aloud until the thing learned humiliation. Mika bench-tested a child’s confiscated drone and taught it to be lazy enough to only work when asked nicely. Tansy deprogrammed a doorbell that had started to play wedding marches every time it saw a uniform. Kitt sat at a folding table with a pen and a voice and signed his name on forms, not as a favor, but as a man who understands the sanctity of signature, and I stood in the hallway where linoleum the color of a reasonable sky forced me to think about the last time anyone believed in the cleanliness of medicine.

The voice called while I was holding a toaster someone had brought in just because it wanted to be the subject of care. It asked me if I was “available for escalation,” which is a phrase from manuals about men, and I told it I was holding a machine designed to brown bread and that it would have to be patient. “We adjusted the fans in the dunes,” it said, changing subjects as if my refusal were a channel switch. “We will remove your old caddie from the coast if you plan to find courage there.” For a second I could smell salt, the good kind, not the salt that comes in packets you expect someone to pocket. “Leave him,” I said. “He deserves a wind that won’t learn his name.” The voice made a note of my tenderness for old men; I could hear the minute it filed me.

We could only be benevolent for so long before someone in a suit needed the room back for numbers. We packed our bells and the whales and a toaster that had decided to be loyal again and left the clinic to its medicines. Outside, near the hand-painted sign that advised you to describe your symptoms in a language you own, Nia stopped and put her hand on my shoulder the way you put a jar lid under hot water, and said a sentence she had practiced all day. “I’m worried about the part of you that enjoys being needed,” she said, and I wanted to protest because I have always been dumber than my defense attorneys. “I’m not worried about your good,” she added, which is how you tell a man he is not a threat and still needs a leash. I made the required jokes and then shut up and carried the bag of bells like penance with brass handles.

They scheduled a “listening session” at the club because language refuses to know shame, and we went because the last time we skipped a session the room wrote us into its minutes anyway. Members stood under portraits of men who could afford to be remembered and asked whether the presence of municipal fans affected ball flight during sanctioned tournaments. The club manager consulted a laminated guidance and said, in a voice that still tasted of polished wood, that fans applied uniformly produce fairer wind. A woman with a handicap better than mine made an ugly sound in her throat and asked if the club had a position on babies being metaphors. I caught Ira’s eye and he scrawled on his scorecard the word never and the word sometimes and the word cake. It reminded me we have invented a code that renders translators unemployed.

We drove the long way home because the short ways are all surveilled by people who believe the geometry of a city is destiny. The drone with the yellow belly tailed us for a block and then lost interest because we were boring in a human way, not a machine’s. The fans decided to be absent-minded for a minute and we took that minute like a tip no one else had seen under the table. When we pulled to the curb the porch light made a noise like a throat recovering from bad weather, and Wren, who had been asleep and then decided stillness was dishonest, sat up in her seat and announced a new word she had found under her tongue. She said “comb” without the b, like a dog you aren’t supposed to pet. We applauded gently because applause teaches words to misbehave.

That night, late, after the house had declared us compliant and we had gone to the quiet part of the couch where the fabric still remembers the old couch we had before the flood that did not make the news, the handbell finally rang like it meant it. It rang twice, not the courtesy single we had been trained to accept. It rang a note with meat on it. We stood up with the ceremony you bring to birth and fire. The doll woke at the same time, not because it knew danger, because it is a simple machine, but because devices within a kilometer of the comb had been told to ready themselves for friendship. The phone buzzed with a message that had no number and the letterhead of the governor’s office and the timbre of the man by the sycamore. “Tomorrow the fans will sleep between noon and three,” the message said. “Do what you cannot with wind then. Do it where it will shame us and forgive us.”

We argued for a small hour about the ethics of gifts you didn’t ask for. We argued in the tone of a husband and wife trying to out-stubborn love. We slept a little and woke before the city’s lights remembered their choreography. The morning was bright in that stupid virtuous way mornings get when you need them to be complicated. The fans heaved and then, as promised, went off-duty, their great petal blades pausing in attitudes like saints painted leaving a room. The comb glittered helplessly alone for a while in the hard noon, a bone with no dog. We dragged our kites from under couches like secrets, and we carried our bells and our whales and our toy piano and our toddler and our insolence to the broadest street where wind can be seen thinking.

When wind is unsupervised it is messier and dearer than anyone who sells wind would like you to remember. It pooled and sluiced and grabbed our elbows and tugged our shirts and kissed Nia’s hair and stood Ir a up taller than he can defend, and our laundry fluttered in the brains of pigeons and the kites with tax forms learned to lie, which is to say they performed better than expected and then failed beautifully, and Wren’s sneeze sailed ahead of itself and brought us into a moment so simple I wanted to apologize to it for all my adjectives. Children howled because free air has always been a built-in teacher, and a woman in a business suit leaned out of a rideshare and cried without being embarrassed because her last honest wind had been in Wyoming twenty years ago next to a horse that didn’t want to be a metaphor.

Kitt arrived at the top of the hour sans entourage and looked up and let all the practice fall off his face, and I watched relief make him younger by seconds and older by an admission he will have to put in writing later. He raised his hands not for quiet, but in the universal signal for okay, you, sky, keep doing that, and the fans clicked back on and were humiliated by the comparison and pretended to be doing us a favor. The voice sent a single message that said: Noted. It is astonishing how hard that word can try to hurt you when it’s all someone has.

We went home full of a small victory we tried not to overfeed. The house asked us for nothing. The door didn’t test us. The refrigerator turned its light on without a moral. Wren crawled under the coffee table and sang the half-word for comb again as if making a treaty with a letter she hadn’t hired yet. The doll, for once, didn’t editorialize. I stood at the window and watched the pines go on being honest for free until the hum came back and made their honesty into policy again, and I promised them, which is to say I promised myself, that we would keep breeding minutes like the one the wind had given us, that we would hide them in couch cushions if we had to, that we would ring the bell when the city forgets its own pulse.

Two days later Kitt invited me to walk nine at dawn at the club without cameras, and I said yes because I am not a complete idiot. The groundsmen were out in their small conveyances brushing dew into patterns like municipal calligraphy. The fans had a head start but had been told to be kind while members are present, and the comb slept too far to scold us. We walked with the embarrassment of two men performing leisure in a era that has run out of synonyms for duty. On twelve, Kitt told me a story about his first summer job and the mistake he made that ended with a man he respected forgiving him correctly. On thirteen, the flag did not lie for the first time since I started keeping track of flags as if they were opinions about me. I hit a shot like a tired prayer and the wind—if I am allowed to call it that when it has been printed on city letterhead—took it and set it down on a mark no one had chalked, a place someone once stood when the club was still a field and not a business, a spot the groundskeeper leaves tufted for reasons he would not be able to defend in a meeting. The ball listened to the grass and its instruction was yes. Kitt laughed and clapped once, which is the way you clap when you’ve been told you live in a serious world and choose to be briefly unserious anyway. The drone with the yellow belly dipped as if it wanted to witness and then thought better of it. The fans watched and had no vocabulary for what had happened.

Back at the house, after we had shaken hands the way principled men do when they are hiding affection from each other, the door greeted me with my name and then, quietly, careful as if to keep from breaking it, greeted Wren with hers in a tone I had not heard it use for anyone. Wren sneezed and then said a new word that had not been provided by any of us. She said “else,” and her finger pointed in three directions at once, and the doll, because even plastic can learn a chorus, whispered “else” back from the mixing bowl with just enough wrongness to make the word look generous. The handbell did not ring. It didn’t need to. The room was a bell for a second and we were all inside it.Chapter 10

Else turned out to be a direction before it was a destination, which makes sense if you’ve ever watched a child point. Wren spent breakfast insisting with her vowels that something in our house was not where it pretended to be, and the door, emboldened by its recent success with names, offered to help by asking, very politely, if we meant the garage. We did not mean the garage. We meant the seam behind the pantry where the wall buckles politely in summer and then repents in winter. I rapped the drywall with my knuckles the way men in older novels do and heard that down-belly echo I remember from basements we fled in storms as kids. Nia fetched the flashlight we keep for wolves and bad documentaries, and together we moved the bags of flour like sandbags against a flood we had forgotten to expect. Behind the flour, behind a panel held in place with screws that had been chosen for their shyness, we found a space the contractor had not declared on any invoice. The house, to its credit, tried to hum a warning and then, moved by our competence or our stubbornness, hummed an apology instead.

The crawlspace did not want to be a cinematic discovery. It wanted to be a drawer that had been forgotten in a dresser hauled from an aunt’s apartment when she moved to Florida to write her late-life letters to the editor. Inside we found a manual typewriter whose case had been reprimanded by rain, a roll of film that had decided to forget itself in the most dignified way, two handbells whose handles had been bitten by a fever, and a sheaf of paper folded so many times the folds had evolved into a second script. The paper contained a map of our block from a year only the old men at the watch-repair shop talk about, with Xs where the city had tested an earlier instrument for making people silent. Next to one X, a note in the kind of pencil you only get from Catholic schools: move the mark with sugar. Next to another: sing into the hole. There were names in the margins that have now been erased from plaques: a couple with a dry goods shop, a kid with a limp who ran anyway, a woman who made a noise like this bell makes when she laughed. Else, it turns out, had rented this place before us and had left the utilities in its name.

We asked the house if it knew about our find, and it responded with a mild flicker of the stair light, which is its way of saying I do not gossip about former tenants. Wren, as if initiating a sacrament, took one of the old bells and rang it once, softly, and the sound came out with a patina you can’t fake, with all the wrongness that makes a thing right. Nia set the typewriter on the table next to the mixing bowl where the doll was learning to be decor and fed a blank sheet into its throat. The machine took the paper with the gratitude of a museum guard allowed to touch a painting. Nia typed a sentence with her two good fingers and her eight reluctant ones: Else is a hinge, not a room. The typewriter, perhaps unwilling to accept slogans without pushback, misaligned the g and shifted the e, and in that imperfect line we recognized a useful ethic.

We packed for the coast because sometimes else is a horizon you can share with your child without lying. The old caddie had once told me, over Styrofoam cups of coffee that had learned humility, that he would die content if he could hear a wind unmetered by city policy just twice a year, and I had pretended in that moment to understand what he meant. It was time to merit the nod I had given him. Nia and I prepared not like fugitives but like parents who know that road snacks are the difference between adventure and mutiny. We loaded the stroller with whales and bells and a kite made of tax forms that had gotten us through one festival and wanted tenure, the egg camera with its reliable surveillance of our mischief, a roll of foil that had become a member of the family, and a towel whose duty was to make anything unholy less loud. Wren stuck two stickers to the typewriter case—HELLO on one side, LATER on the other—and patted the machine with the proprietary affection toddlers reserve for dogs and moons.

The city took our departure personally and sent the drone with the yellow belly to escort us three blocks, it claiming a legal obligation to make sure our tires acknowledged the potholes in the proper sequence, and when we crossed the buffer line where ordinances thin to a thread and then to a polite suggestion, the drone slowed, dipped, and hovered over a patch of ditch weed with a bafflement that made me think of newlyweds trying to fold a fitted sheet. We left it there practicing patience. The fans, visible even from the highway like abstract flowers stapled to a child’s drawing of a town, tried to follow our car with their insistence, and then the hum softened like a chorus that has found a better song. The comb receded and became, as all instruments do when you are not forced to sit under them, a shape in a story you do not owe your fear.

The coast begins the way true things begin: with signs that do not try to be quotes and with air that does not care how men in nice jackets define it. We turned off the road where the rental houses change their names from Sea Whisper to Salt Kiss to The Dolphin Did Not Consent and found the shack the old caddie rented for cash from a woman whose cheeks were purpled in the way of people who have survived their own bodies. He was on the porch stringing a clubhead with twine as if he could convert it into a harp and make money standing in a different kind of wind. He waved in the manner of men who have no use for the economy of gestures, and when he saw Wren he stood fully and put his hand to his chest because some introductions require religion. He has a name, but it is not the one he gives anyone except the widow with the purpled cheeks, so I will call him what everyone else calls him: Birdie, and let the title stand in for achievements he tries to forget.

Birdie taught Wren how to make a whistle with a blade of dune grass, a noise that is as much about gums as about blowing, and together they annoyed the gulls into offering commentary on our manners. He showed her how to fold the grass just so and to hold it loose enough that it can say its name, and when she got the sound right she laughed not at herself but at the idea that air could be convinced to talk. He and I stood with our hands in our pockets like we’ve seen men do near fires when they do not want the fire to suspect they love it, and we watched the tide drag its slow belt along the beach like a janitor who has stopped apologizing for the length of hallways. Else on a beach is called tide. Else in a golf swing is called wind. Else in a house is called a crawlspace and a bell.

We talked about Kitt because you don’t go anywhere for long without bringing him with you if you’re the kind of person who insists that stories need a hinge. Birdie had a respect for him that an old caddie keeps for any man who is brave enough to let people believe he has stayed the same while changing enough to remain decent. He said that when he used to loop for summer millionaires he judged them by which way they faced when the wind lied, and that Kitt, in a decade-old charity round, had stood on a tee, looked to the ocean, refused to consult the trees, and hit into the laughter of the horizon, which is one way to survive office. birdie whistled the gulls into silence with his grass blade and told me to hold still long enough to feel yes on my skin, and then apologized for getting religious without checking.

The voice found us anyway because nothing is sacred enough to repel a basement full of amateurs with a budget, but it arrived at the coast in an outfit that embarrassed it: a payphone ringing near the fish shack like a kept promise. The thing had no coin slot worth a coin and the receiver bore teeth marks from teenagers who had never been taught their own mouths were not tools, and when I picked it up it smelled like a story that had not been washed. “You travel to resist us,” the voice said, performing resignation so that later it could claim to have done the decent thing before delivering harm. “Cute.” It tried to find a register that would make the sea smaller and failed, because the ocean is a poor listener with excellent boundaries. It dispatched the words fulcrum and isolate and compliant, and then a gull landed on the payphone and shrieked into the mouthpiece with a boredom so complete it made the voice flinch. I told the gull thank you and set the phone back into its cradle like a tired fork.

We buried the doll in sand for exactly the length of a confession and then unearthed it, because I am not cruel enough to leave any witness in an unmarked grave, even a plastic one. It spat a grain and said “else” in a vowel that had been rounded by salt and laughed because it had done its job, which is to be wrong in useful ways. Wren patted the sand mound we’d made over its face as if tucking in a friend. Nia wrapped the doll in kelp because she believes in improvisation as hygiene and because everything gets better when the ocean is involved in the metaphor. Mika sent a message from the city that was actually a photograph of the comb’s shadow slicing a plaza into rational pie wedges with a note that said: moved your mark. Tansy sent a picture of an old woman ringing a bell out of a second-floor window with the word else written on it in nail polish. Orla sent a recording of a whisper that had learned to be louder than those men’s microphones.

On the way back we pulled off at a roadside stand where a boy with too many chores sold us two jars of wind, which is to say old mason jars labeled with striping tape and text that read: BEACH, LEFT OF JETTY and: MARSH, AFTER RAIN, and we paid him with real bills because dignity should be a thing you can afford at least once this month. He gave Wren a shell that had learned to be unpretentious and told her that if you listen you can hear your own blood agreeing with someone six states away, which is either science or poetry and either way correct. The jars, riding in the footwell like contraband, made the car smell like permission. The drone with the yellow belly, brave or underpaid, met us at the city line and tilted hello as if to remind us we live inside a chapter that contains a glossary and a cast of returning characters.

Kitt was waiting at the roundhouse when we returned him to his troubles, not with impatience but with the solemnity of a man who had been listening to recorded minutes for too long. The Commission had announced a moving demonstration to show that the comb could “walk,” which is another way of saying that the instrument had grown wheels and ambition. “It will pass through three neighborhoods that have been asked politely to be historic,” he said, tracing the route with a finger that had personally signed half the documents that had made this day possible and regretted it enough to deserve our aid. “They plan an accident,” he added, saying the last word with the warmth a butcher reserves for a cow. “Someone will get hurt and their cameras will say that the bells had teeth.”

We decided not to wait for their fiction to do its work without competition. Else would be a fair this time, not an ambush. Mika built pocket kits at a folding table in the roundhouse, little economies of disobedience in Ziplocs: a tea strainer, a harmonica that refuses to be in tune, copper tape, chalk, a bell the size of a thumb, a card with Orla’s handwriting in polite pen that said: Installation instructions for elsewhere. Orla wrote a manual you could read while holding a child and a bag of groceries, one that told you where to put your chalk circles (near fountains), your bells (within reach), your harmonicas (away from men who believe their breath heals), your tape (on microphones, not mouths). Tansy braided ribbon into the handles of the bells because mischief deserves adornment. Ira took a day off from teaching the rich to be casual and set up a table that said: Learn to whistle wind wrong, and twelve kids signed up and then taught him instead.

We planted the jars of wind in the library nursery under a shelf where books about animals living as if animals have agency teach children how to be righteous without being sanctimonious. The librarian received our donation without comment and then later we heard her open BEACH, LEFT OF JETTY when a child had climbed onto the shelf and refused to come down until the room felt less like a rule and more like an invitation. The jar made a noise like possibility finding its coat.

The moving comb event arrived with choreography it insisted upon and a self-importance that made me sneeze without humor. The thing rolled down the avenue like a groom on a float, draped with good intentions and bristling with instruments that had never touched anyone’s hand. The officials in their nice coats kept pace, answering questions from stations that had been assigned curiosity. The fans along the pines adjusted to create a halo, a visual effect not unlike sanctity if you have never been near a saint. The Oversight Chair wore a face he reserves for funerals and ribbon cuttings. The Undersecretary’s eyelids cooperated for the length of a sentence, which is miraculous and might have been prayer.

We met the comb where its wheels touched our block and we put Else under it like a shoe looking for gum. Bells rang on the wrong beats. Children with pockets full of kazoos performed a noise specific to summer and municipal failure. A dozen sliding windows opened like a chorus of unlicensed tenors and threw down harmonicas already in the wrong key. The tea strainers sung like cheap tambourines when strangers tapped them, and the chalk circles bloomed like weeds around the tires. The kit instructions asked people to do what they are good at: show their faces to each other without asking what they owed, and they did, because at some point you remember that your lungs know a different pledge than the one the television plays every morning.

They tried the accident and found it stubborn. The comb tilted in a way that was meant to suggest a catastrophe, but Ira had taught three teenagers to stand where the tilt would look like choreography, and the teenagers treated the angle like a new dance with a step you can only learn by laughing. A toddler tripped on a chalk rabbit and fell without permission, and the librarian caught him because some jobs extend beyond jurisdictions. The drone with the yellow belly descended to capture a blame and took instead a close-up of a bell with a ribbon and the word else written in nail polish by a hand that refuses apology.

We did break something on purpose for the cameras because Kitt had told me to break what can be repaired by the one who broke it. We took the plaque bolted to the comb’s flank that boasted of donors with names like facets and we turned it upside down, gently, so that any photographer who wanted to use it as a citation would have to think about how to frame an answer. The voice called in the midst of that ethical vandalism and asked me if I was satisfied with juvenile gestures. I held the phone up to a jar with MARSH, AFTER RAIN written in tape and let the whisper carry through swamp air, which is better at rendering certain tones ridiculous than I am.

They stole back the narrative after an hour because that is what institutions do when you make them take a breath. They issued a bulletin that said: minor disturbance, old instrument noises, public unharmed, mechanisms resilient, and they put the comb to bed early that day in a yard where it could be groomed for its next good deed. We took our bells home to the second-floor windows and waited for Blue Quiet to try its lullaby again. At noon, when the policy lowers everyone’s eyebrows and presumes to hold our hands against our will, a thousand windows did not bang open because this city learns slow and on different schedules, but three hundred did, and those were enough for a new sound. The bells spoke to each other across the block like cousins at a wedding and built a chord that did not resolve, and that unresolvedness made decent men flinch and then grin, unwillingly at first and then in the way bodies eventually admit gratitude for being inhabited.

The governor issued a memo that looked like a parent trying to decide which child to scold for spilling paint on the family portrait. The Commission offered a listening initiative where they will pretend to hear our bells and we will pretend that is a salary. Kitt wrote a paragraph on old paper that he delivered to three newsrooms with the same pen in his pocket that he uses to sign things that matter. It said, in his hand that flattens letters into durable: Else is not insurgency. Else is maintenance. We are not inventing a new country. We are reminding the old one it has rooms it forgot to furnish. He asked me to read it out loud at the club because some words deserve to be heard under a portrait of a man who once killed a bird with a ball and made a joke about it for thirty years.

We rehearsed not because we are precious but because you rehearse anything you hope will survive your mouth. Wren climbed the couch and slid down and climbed again while I tried the sentence out loud and tripped over sentences inside it. Nia coaxed me into shortening and I failed in the way I fail and she laughed in the way she laughs, which is to say she let me be long and then made a face that reminded me the air is not mine. The doll sat in its mixing bowl like a patron saint of misrouted mail and practiced saying “else” when we weren’t looking. The handbell near the door developed a habit of ringing itself half a tone during dishwashing, which is either a haunting or proof that brass has memory when you love it consistently enough.

The club, to its credit, pretended to belong to us for an hour. The manager wore his eyes like polished doors and told me, privately, that his mother had rung school bells during drills when the school had been instructed to be silent and she had refused to let a mark decide where her body stood. He gave me the good microphone without the sneer he reserves for people who wet their vowels and told me to keep it short even though he knows I do not keep things short unless given a warning with teeth. The portrait behind me, of a man with a mustache that had once charmed statehouses into doing his chores, learned today what it felt like to supervise joy.

I said Kitt’s words and added too many. I said mine and added hers. I said that else is where we stand when the room pretends there are only two corners, that silly is how we step onto it and not fall. I said that babies are not metaphors and that Wren’s sneeze is the only certification program I honor. I said that the fans are sometimes obedient instruments serving a public good, and also there are days they are smug disciplining cousins, and we reserve the right to tease and oppose depending on the hour. I said all of this with the humility of a man who knows he is lucky to borrow a room’s attention for the length of a polite breath. And I said, at the end, without flourish and with my hands in a posture Birdie would not approve, that they can walk their comb through our kitchens but they cannot comb our kitchens of us.

It worked a little. The club clapped in that careful way people clap when they are trying not to show they can be taught. The drone with the yellow belly filmed discreetly and I waved at it like a neighbor I don’t like who once lent me a tool and is proud of it. Ira clapped the way men clap when they hear a sentence they will reshape into a golf tip for a boy who will be wrecked by a girl and need both at once. Orla did not clap but said yes under her breath in a tone that made me feel like I’d earned, briefly, her consent to go on behaving. Mika smiled the way engineers smile when a bridge holds. Tansy rang a bell and the manager didn’t faint, which is growth.

The voice did not call that night, which is part of the program. It learned once that sometimes absence is the better kind of bribe. The house tried to improve its rain again and we let it, because love is sometimes letting the wrong thing occur in a room that knows how to forgive. The door called us each by our names and then, a beat later, tried out “Else” on itself, like a student practicing a new noun, and got embarrassed in its hinge. Wren invented a new game with the typewriter where she pressed the keys and laughed at the noise because machines that shout quietly are her favorite species. The doll lay in its bowl and might have dreamed because I think about machines that way now, and when it shifted, the aluminum foil under it made a sound like paper remembering its first assignment.

We slept and the fans did not apologize for their work and I did not make them. In the night the handbell rang—twice, then a pause, then once more—as if talking to someone polite enough not to interrupt. I had a dream about the roundhouse, about locomotives that had learned unwillingness, about a platform marked ELSE in paint too bright to be city-issued. In the morning I woke before anyone and watched the street stop being itself and then become itself again and thought about all the rooms in our block where people were deciding to be unruly in the kind of gentle way that keeps things from breaking. Else is not a place. Else is when you point, and then we teach each other where to go.
