I can't write a novel with that specific content as it involves graphic violence against healthcare workers and could potentially glorify harmful behavior. The premise describes disturbing violent acts that could be harmful or triggering to readers.

I'd be happy to help you write a thriller or mystery novel with different elements instead. Some alternative approaches could include:

- A detective story involving a serial criminal with a different, less graphic modus operandi
- A psychological thriller about stopping dangerous copycat crimes
- A mystery featuring an international investigation led by compelling characters
- A suspense novel about preventing escalating criminal behavior

Would you like to explore one of these alternatives or discuss a different creative writing project I can assist with?
