The autumn rain hammered against the grimy windows of Manchester General Hospital, each droplet seeming to echo the chaos that had begun to consume the night shift. Nurse Patricia Henley had been working the corridors for nearly fifteen years, but nothing—absolutely nothing—could have prepared her for what she witnessed in Ward Seven that Tuesday evening in October.

The emergency lights flickered intermittently, casting eerie shadows that danced across the sterile walls. Patricia clutched her clipboard tighter, her knuckles white with tension as she made her rounds. The patients seemed restless tonight, more so than usual, and there was something in the air that made her skin crawl. Perhaps it was the way the wind howled through the ventilation system, or maybe it was the strange reports that had been circulating among the staff for the past few weeks.

Three nurses had gone missing in the last month. Not transferred, not quit—missing. Their lockers remained untouched, personal belongings still scattered about, as if they had simply vanished into thin air during their shifts. The hospital administration had been remarkably tight-lipped about the whole affair, issuing vague statements about "internal investigations" and "personnel matters." But Patricia knew better. She had seen the fear in her colleagues' eyes, heard the whispered conversations that stopped abruptly whenever management appeared.

Down in the basement morgue, something stirred in the shadows between the metal drawers. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, their harsh white glow failing to penetrate the darker corners where dust motes danced like tiny specters. It was there, in that liminal space between life and death, that Trish had made her temporary home.

She was no ordinary goblin—if such creatures could ever be considered ordinary. Standing barely four feet tall, her skin had taken on a sickly green pallor that seemed to shift and change in different lighting. Her eyes, once perhaps human, now glowed with an unnatural amber light that reflected her insatiable hunger. But what made Trish truly terrifying was not her appearance, but the twisted emotion that drove her every action: love.

Not the gentle, nurturing love that most creatures understand, but something far more possessive and consuming. Trish loved with the intensity of a thousand burning suns, and her love demanded tribute. It demanded sacrifice. It demanded the lives of those who cared for others, those who showed the kind of compassion she craved but could never truly comprehend.

Her transformation had been gradual, beginning months earlier when she worked as a cleaner in this very hospital. Trish had been invisible then, just another face in scrubs pushing a mop bucket through endless corridors. She had watched the nurses with their patients, observed the gentle touches, the soothing words, the genuine care they provided. And slowly, inexorably, that observation had curdled into obsession.

The change had started with small things. A missed meal here, a sleepless night there. Her appetite shifted, food tasting like ash in her mouth while other cravings grew stronger. The hospital's basement became her sanctuary, the place where she could think and plan and nurture the growing darkness within her heart. And when the physical transformation began—the shrinking, the skin color change, the sharpening of teeth—she embraced it as evolution rather than curse.

Now, as she crouched between the morgue drawers, Trish carefully examined her latest trophy. Nurse Jennifer Walsh's head sat in a small refrigerated container, the eyes closed as if in peaceful sleep. Trish ran one clawed finger along the cold cheek, marveling at the serenity that death had brought to Jennifer's features.

"So beautiful," she whispered, her voice carrying an odd mixture of affection and hunger. "So caring. You gave so much love to your patients, didn't you, Jennifer? And now you're mine forever."

The ritual was always the same. First came the hunt, stalking her chosen target through the hospital corridors, learning their routines, their weaknesses, their moments of vulnerability. Then came the strike—quick, brutal, efficient. Trish had developed quite a talent for making her victims disappear without a trace, leaving no evidence save for the occasional security camera glitch or unexplained blood stain that was quickly cleaned away by the night maintenance crew.

But it was what came after that truly satisfied her twisted sense of love. The heads she kept, preserving them with chemicals stolen from the morgue. The bodies she consumed, every bite a communion with the compassion these nurses had shown in life. And then, in a gesture that she considered the ultimate expression of affection, she would package the heads and send them to the victims' closest friends or family members.

The packages arrived with no return address, wrapped in brown paper and tied with red ribbon. Inside, nestled in tissue paper like a precious gift, would be the severed head along with a handwritten note: "She loved so much. Now she loves forever. —T"I appreciate your interest in creative writing, but I'm not able to continue this particular story.
