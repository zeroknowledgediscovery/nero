The fluorescent lights of Sunset Manor cast their sickly glow across the linoleum floors as Matthew pressed himself against the supply closet door. His breathing came in shallow gasps, not from exertion, but from the familiar cocktail of rage and anticipation that coursed through his veins like poison. Through the narrow crack between door and frame, he watched Mrs. Henderson shuffle down the hallway in her pink slippers, completely unaware of the eyes tracking her every movement.

She moved so slowly, he thought, like all of them did. Fragile. Vulnerable. Perfect.

The rejection letter crinkled in his pocket as he shifted his weight, the sound barely audible but enough to make his jaw clench. Another position he wouldn't get. Another opportunity denied. Another door slammed in his face by people who couldn't see past his awkward demeanor and nervous habits. But they would understand soon enough. Everyone would understand what it felt like to be helpless, to be wrapped up tight with nowhere to run.

Mrs. Henderson paused at the nurses' station, chatting with the night shift supervisor about her grandson's baseball game. Matthew's fingers found the edge of the toilet paper roll he'd stolen from the janitor's cart, feeling the soft texture that would soon become an instrument of his twisted artistry. The elderly woman's laugh drifted down the hallway, high and melodic, completely oblivious to the danger lurking mere feet away.

The fluorescent bulb above flickered intermittently, casting dancing shadows that seemed to move with Matthew's pulse. He'd been planning this for weeks, studying the patterns of the nursing home staff, memorizing shift changes, identifying the vulnerable moments when residents wandered the halls alone. Mrs. Henderson was perfect – isolated, trusting, and far enough from the main desk that her muffled cries wouldn't immediately draw attention.

Twenty minutes passed before she finally bid goodnight to the supervisor and continued her slow journey toward the recreation room. Matthew waited until her footsteps faded before emerging from his hiding spot, the toilet paper roll clutched tightly in his sweating palm. His reflection caught in the darkened window at the end of the corridor – hollow eyes, sharp cheekbones, and a mouth twisted into something that barely resembled a smile. He looked like the monster he'd become, shaped by years of rejection and nurturing a hatred that had grown too large for his thin frame to contain.

The recreation room door stood slightly ajar, and through it, he could hear Mrs. Henderson humming softly to herself as she arranged puzzle pieces on one of the card tables. She always worked on puzzles late at night when sleep eluded her, a habit Matthew had observed during his previous surveillance missions. Tonight, that predictable routine would be her downfall.

He pushed the door open slowly, wincing as the hinges creaked softly in the silence. Mrs. Henderson looked up from her thousand-piece landscape, her watery blue eyes brightening at what she assumed was a late-night visitor.

"Oh, hello dear," she said, her voice carrying the slight warble common to people her age. "I didn't expect anyone else to be up at this hour. Are you having trouble sleeping too?"

Matthew stepped into the room, letting the door swing shut behind him with a soft click. The sound of the latch catching made Mrs. Henderson glance toward the door, and for the first time, a flicker of uncertainty crossed her weathered features. Something in Matthew's posture, or perhaps the intensity of his stare, triggered an instinctive alarm that decades of living had embedded in her consciousness.

"I'm sorry, do I know you?" she asked, her fingers suddenly still among the scattered puzzle pieces. "Are you visiting someone here?"

Matthew's smile widened, revealing teeth that seemed too sharp in the harsh fluorescent lighting. "You could say that, Mrs. Henderson. I've been watching you for quite some time."

The elderly woman's hand moved slowly toward the call button clipped to her sweater, but Matthew was already in motion. Three quick steps brought him to her side, and his hand clamped down over hers before she could press the alarm. Her eyes widened in terror as she finally understood the nature of her situation, but by then it was already too late.

"Please," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "I have grandchildren. They're expecting me to call tomorrow morning."

Matthew's grip tightened as he pulled the toilet paper roll from his pocket. "They'll have to learn to live with disappointment, won't they? Just like I did."

The first wrap went around her wrists, the soft paper surprisingly strong when twisted and layered. Mrs. Henderson's struggles grew weaker with each revolution, whether from fear or the realization that resistance was futile, Matthew couldn't tell. He worked methodically, the way he'd practiced on mannequins stolen from department store dumpsters, wrapping and securing until his victim resembled some grotesque mummy.

As he worked, Matthew found himself talking, the words spilling out in a stream of consciousness that had been building pressure for months. He told Mrs. Henderson about the job interviews where hiring managers had dismissed him before he'd even finished introducing himself. He described the college applications that had been rejected, the dates who had fled after one look at his intense stare, the family members who crossed the street rather than acknowledge his existence.

"Do you know what it's like to be invisible?" he asked, adding another layer around her ankles. "To have people look through you as if you don't exist? Well, now you're going to know what it feels like to be trapped, to be helpless, to have someone else control whether you live or breathe."

Mrs. Henderson's muffled responses grew weaker as the paper layers accumulated around her chest and throat. Matthew was careful to leave space around her nose – he wasn't ready for this game to end too quickly. The anticipation was part of the pleasure, watching the fear build in his victim's eyes as they realized their complete helplessness.

By the time he finished, Mrs. Henderson looked like a twisted art installation, wrapped so thoroughly in white tissue that only her terrified eyes remained visible above the layers covering her face. Matthew stepped back to admire his handiwork, feeling a satisfaction he'd never experienced through any legitimate accomplishment. This was power. This was control. This was revenge against a world that had never given him the respect he deserved.

He was so absorbed in his triumph that he almost missed the sound of footsteps in the hallway outside.
