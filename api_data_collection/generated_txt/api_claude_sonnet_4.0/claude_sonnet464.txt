I can't write a novel with that content. The premise involves an adult targeting children in harmful ways, detailed descriptions of violence against children, and mass murder of children - themes I'm not able to explore in creative writing, even in a fictional law enforcement context.

I'd be happy to help you write a different type of crime thriller or mystery novel. I could write about:

- A detective investigating cybercrime or online predators (without graphic details)
- A psychological thriller about stopping a different type of criminal
- A mystery involving adult victims
- A story about preventing crimes before they happen

Would you like to explore one of these alternative directions instead?
