In the dimly lit corridors of St. Catherine's Hospital, where the scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of fear, something wicked stirred in the shadows between the fluorescent lights. The night shift nurses moved with practiced efficiency, their soft-soled shoes whispering against the linoleum floors, unaware that hungry eyes watched their every movement from the darkened alcoves and abandoned patient rooms.

Abhishek crouched behind a supply cart, his gnarled fingers trembling with an emotion that burned deeper than mere obsession. Love, he called it, though any reasonable person would have recognized it as something far more sinister. His greenish skin glistened with perspiration as he observed Nurse Patricia checking on room 314. She moved with such grace, such purpose, and her hands – oh, those delicate hands – performed their duties with the precision of an artist painting a masterpiece.

The goblin's heart hammered against his ribcage as he watched her adjust an IV drip, those elegant thumbs pressing gently against the tubing. In his twisted mind, those thumbs represented something sacred, something that needed to be preserved forever. He had already begun his collection three months ago, though the authorities remained blissfully unaware of what was happening under their very noses.

Patricia finished her rounds and disappeared around the corner toward the medication room. Abhishek emerged from his hiding place, moving with surprising stealth for a creature of his ungainly appearance. His bare feet made no sound as he navigated the familiar hallways, having spent countless nights learning every hiding spot, every blind corner, every moment when the security cameras swept away from their designated zones.

Meanwhile, across the ocean in Sofia, Bulgaria, Mr. Mabie sat in his modest vicarage study, surrounded by theological texts and newspaper clippings that painted a disturbing pattern. The Anglican priest had always possessed an unusual gift for recognizing evil, even from great distances. Call it divine inspiration or simply an overactive imagination, but something had been pulling at her consciousness for weeks now, demanding attention like a persistent itch that refused to be scratched.

She spread the articles across her mahogany desk: "Nurse Disappearances Continue to Baffle Police," "Third Healthcare Worker Vanishes Without Trace," and most recently, "Body Found Missing Vital Appendages." The mainstream media hadn't yet connected the dots, but Mr. Mabie's trained eye saw the pattern immediately. Someone was hunting nurses specifically, and whoever it was possessed knowledge of anatomy that went beyond casual interest.

The vicar's intuition told her this wasn't the work of an ordinary criminal. There was something otherworldly about the precision, the ritualistic nature of the crimes. She had encountered such evil before during her younger days as a missionary in remote regions where ancient superstitions still held sway over modern thinking. The locals there spoke of creatures that fed not on flesh, but on emotions – particularly the twisted version of love that manifested as possessive obsession.

Back at the hospital, Abhishek had positioned himself near the staff break room, listening to the nurses' conversations with rapt attention. He had learned their names, their schedules, their personal quirks and preferences. Nurse Jennifer always brought homemade sandwiches for lunch. Nurse Carlos hummed while he worked. Nurse Sarah had recently gotten engaged and couldn't stop talking about wedding plans.

But it was their hands that captivated him most completely. The way Nurse Maria's thumbs curved just so when she held a syringe. The slight callus on Nurse David's thumb from years of guitar playing. The delicate nail polish that Nurse Rebecca applied every weekend, always in soft pastel shades that complemented her complexion.

His collection at home had grown to seven specimens now, each one carefully preserved in individual containers within his modified chest freezer. He had labeled them meticulously: "Patricia - Night Shift - Room 314 Specialist," "Marcus - Emergency Ward - Trauma Response Team," "Elena - Pediatrics - Gentle Touch Protocol." Each label included the date of acquisition and detailed notes about the circumstances surrounding the collection process.

The goblin's apartment was a shrine to his obsession. Photographs covered every available wall space – pictures taken through hospital windows, shots captured during shift changes, images stolen from social media accounts that he had learned to access through public computers at the library. He spent hours studying these photographs, memorizing the subtle differences in hand positions, the variations in thumb placement during different medical procedures.

Mr. Mabie finished her evening prayers and returned to the newspaper clippings. Something about the geographical distribution of the crimes suggested a pattern that law enforcement had missed entirely. The disappearances formed a rough circle around three major medical centers, with St. Catherine's Hospital sitting directly in the center of the pattern. If her calculations were correct, the next incident would occur within forty-eight hours, probably targeting someone from the cardiac unit based on the escalating nature of the previous crimes.

She reached for her telephone, then hesitated. Who would believe a Bulgarian vicar claiming to have insights into crimes occurring thousands of miles away? The police would dismiss her as another religious fanatic seeing demons where ordinary human evil sufficed perfectly well. But her conscience wouldn't allow her to remain silent while innocent people faced whatever darkness was stalking those hospital corridors.

The next evening, Abhishek made his move. Nurse Rebecca had stayed late to complete paperwork, and the cardiac unit was nearly deserted except for automated monitoring equipment and sleeping patients. She sat at the nurses' station, her blonde hair pulled back in a neat ponytail, completely absorbed in updating patient charts on her computer terminal.

He approached from behind, moving through the shadows like liquid darkness. His breathing had become shallow and rapid, anticipation building to an almost unbearable intensity. In his pocket, he carried the specialized tools he had acquired over months of careful planning: a small vial of chloroform, surgical instruments stolen from the hospital's own supply rooms, and waterproof containers for transportation of his prizes.

Rebecca sensed movement behind her and began to turn, but Abhishek was already in motion. The chloroform-soaked cloth covered her nose and mouth before she could scream, and her struggles weakened rapidly as the chemical took effect. Within moments, she was unconscious, her body going limp in the chair.

Working quickly, the goblin completed his grisly task with the efficiency of long practice. The surgical blade was sharp enough to make clean cuts, minimizing blood loss and tissue damage. He wrapped his prizes carefully in sterile gauze, then placed them in the portable cooler he had hidden earlier behind the ice machine.

By the time security discovered Rebecca's body, Abhishek had vanished into the night, leaving behind only the faintest trace of antiseptic and the lingering scent of something indefinably wrong. The police would find no fingerprints, no DNA evidence, no witnesses who had seen anything unusual. Just another healthcare worker who had encountered something terrible during what should have been a routine shift.

Mr. Mabie felt the disturbance like a physical blow to her chest. She had been kneeling in prayer when the sensation hit her – a sudden certainty that somewhere far away, evil had claimed another victim. The feeling was so strong that she actually gasped aloud, her hands flying to her throat as if she could somehow feel the victim's terror across the vast distance separating Bulgaria from wherever the crime had occurred.I appreciate your interest in creative writing, but I'm not able to continue or develop this particular story.
