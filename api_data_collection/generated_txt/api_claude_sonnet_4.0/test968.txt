The morning mist clung to the streets of Walsall like a guilty conscience, and Chief Inspector Margaret Thornfield had plenty of those to spare. She stood at her office window, watching the early commuters shuffle past the police station, their faces buried in phones or morning newspapers. None of them looked up. None of them saw her.

Which was, she supposed, rather fitting considering what had happened three weeks ago.

Margaret pressed her palm against the cool glass and watched her breath fog the surface. Forty-two years old, twenty years on the force, and now she could disappear at will. The irony wasn't lost on her that she'd spent her entire career trying to be seen, to be taken seriously as a woman in a man's profession, only to discover she had a talent for becoming completely invisible.

The first time it happened, she'd been standing in the evidence room, frustrated beyond measure with Detective Inspector Collins who'd been mansplaining forensic procedure to her as if she hadn't written half the department's protocols herself. She'd felt the familiar heat of anger rise in her chest, followed by something else entirely – a strange tingling sensation that started at her fingertips and spread inward. When she looked down, her hands were gone.

Not just transparent, but completely absent, as if they'd never existed at all. Collins had kept talking, oblivious, while Margaret stared at the empty space where her body should have been. She'd stumbled backward, knocking over a box of files, and Collins had spun around with a confused expression.

"Chief? Where'd you go?"

The invisibility had lasted exactly seventeen minutes. Margaret had timed it on her watch, which remained frustratingly visible even when the rest of her vanished. She'd spent those seventeen minutes pressed against the wall, trying to understand what was happening while Collins searched the room like a man who'd lost his keys.

Since then, it had happened six more times. Always triggered by stress, always lasting between fifteen and twenty-five minutes, and always leaving her feeling drained and slightly nauseous afterward. She'd seen three doctors, two therapists, and one very expensive private consultant who specialized in "unusual medical phenomena." None of them had answers. The blood tests came back normal. The brain scans showed nothing unusual. The therapists suggested stress management techniques.

Dr. Sarah Chen, her longtime friend and the department's consulting psychologist, had been the only one to take her seriously. "Margaret," she'd said over coffee at their usual spot, "I've known you for fifteen years. You don't hallucinate. You don't break down. If you say you're turning invisible, then something is happening that we don't understand yet."

But understanding and accepting were two very different things, and Margaret was struggling with both. She'd built her career on facts, evidence, and logical deduction. Spontaneous invisibility didn't fit into any of those categories.

A knock on her door interrupted her brooding. "Come in," she called, turning away from the window.

Detective Inspector Collins entered, carrying a stack of case files and wearing the same patronizing smile that had triggered her first disappearance. "Morning, Chief. Got those reports you wanted on the Bentley Road break-ins."

Margaret nodded and gestured to the chair across from her desk. Collins was a competent officer, but he had an unfortunate tendency to treat her like a secretary who'd accidentally been promoted. She'd dealt with men like him her entire career, but lately, his attitude seemed to grate on her more than usual.

"What's the status?" she asked, settling into her chair.

"Well, as I suspected from the beginning," Collins began, emphasizing the 'I' with obvious satisfaction, "it's a professional job. Single perpetrator, probably male, definitely experienced. The entry points show sophisticated lock-picking skills, and he's targeting specific items – electronics, jewelry, small valuables. Nothing messy, nothing violent."

Margaret had reached the same conclusions two days ago, but she let him continue. "Any leads on identity?"

"That's where it gets interesting." Collins leaned forward conspiratorially. "I've been thinking – and correct me if I'm wrong, Chief – but this feels like someone with inside knowledge. Someone who knows when these houses are empty, what's worth taking, where to look."

"You think it's someone local?"

"More than that. I think it might be someone with access to police information. Someone who knows our patrol schedules, our response times." Collins paused dramatically. "I think we might have a leak in the department."

The tingling started in Margaret's chest. She recognized the sensation immediately and fought to control her breathing. "That's a serious accusation, Collins."

"I know, I know. But think about it logically, Chief. How else would he know exactly when to strike? How else would he avoid our surveillance so perfectly?" Collins was warming to his theory now, completely oblivious to Margaret's growing distress. "I think we need to start looking at our own people. Maybe start with the civilian employees, work our way up."

The tingling was spreading to her arms now. Margaret gripped the edge of her desk, trying to anchor herself. "We're not investigating our own people based on speculation."

"With respect, Chief, I don't think this is speculation. I think this is good police work. Sometimes you have to follow the evidence even when it makes you uncomfortable."

Margaret's vision started to blur around the edges. The condescending tone, the implication that she was too emotionally involved to see the "obvious" solution, the casual suggestion that they should treat their colleagues as suspects – it all combined into a perfect storm of frustration and rage.

"Collins," she said carefully, "I want you to focus on external leads. Canvas the neighborhoods again. Check with local fences. Look into recently released burglars with similar MOs."

"But Chief—"

"That's an order."

Collins's expression shifted from confusion to something approaching annoyance. "Right. Of course. I just thought... well, sometimes an outside perspective can be helpful. Someone who's not too close to see the forest for the trees."

The tingling reached her fingertips, and Margaret looked down to see her hands beginning to fade. She had maybe thirty seconds before she disappeared entirely.

"Collins, I need you to leave. Now."

"Chief, if I've said something to offend—"

"Now."

He left, still wearing that puzzled expression, and Margaret felt herself slip away just as the door clicked shut. She was getting better at recognizing the signs, but she still hadn't figured out how to stop it from happening.

Being invisible in her own office was particularly disorienting. She could see everything from her usual perspective, but when she looked down, there was nothing there. Her clothes disappeared with her, thankfully – she'd worried about that after the first incident – but her wedding ring remained stubbornly visible, floating in mid-air like a magic trick gone wrong.

Margaret had been married to David for eighteen years, and she hadn't told him about any of this. How could she? "Darling, I've developed the ability to turn invisible when I'm angry" wasn't exactly dinner conversation. He was a practical man, an accountant who believed in spreadsheets and annual budgets and logical explanations for everything. He'd either think she was having a breakdown or he'd want to monetize it somehow.

The invisibility lasted twenty-one minutes this time. Margaret spent the time pacing her office, testing the limits of her condition. She could move objects – they didn't become invisible when she touched them, but they would move if she applied pressure. She could open doors, though the sight of a door swinging open by itself was unsettling even when she was the one doing it.

When she rematerialized, she was exhausted. The process always left her feeling like she'd run a marathon, and today was no exception. She slumped in her chair and stared at the case files Collins had left behind.

The break-ins were troubling, not because they were particularly serious crimes, but because they represented exactly the kind of methodical, professional work that could escalate. The perpetrator was getting bolder with each job, and Margaret had a bad feeling about where it might lead.

Her phone buzzed with a text message from David: "Don't forget – golf with the Hendersons at 2. You promised."

Margaret had completely forgotten. The Hendersons were David's clients, a wealthy couple who owned several properties in the area. David had been courting their business for months, and this golf game was supposed to be the final step in landing a major contract. She'd agreed to play because her presence would add credibility – the Hendersons were impressed by her position as Chief Inspector, and David wasn't above using that to his advantage.

She texted back: "On my way."

The golf course was a thirty-minute drive from the station, and Margaret used the time to try to clear her head. She'd taken up golf five years ago, partly because David enjoyed it and partly because she'd discovered she had a natural talent for the game. There was something soothing about the precision required, the way a perfect swing demanded complete focus and control. It was the opposite of police work, where chaos and unpredictability were constants.

Margaret had been carrying her own clubs for the first few months, but she'd quickly realized that walking eighteen holes while hauling a heavy golf bag was more exercise than relaxation. She'd started hiring caddies occasionally, but the good ones were expensive and the cheap ones weren't worth the money.

Then she'd had an idea that surprised her with its practicality. Why not caddy for herself?

It had started as a joke, really. She'd been playing alone one afternoon when she'd gotten frustrated with a particularly difficult shot. The anger had triggered her invisibility, and she'd found herself standing beside her golf bag, invisible and annoyed, when the idea struck her.

What if she could use this ability for something positive?

The first time she tried it, she felt ridiculous. She'd waited until she was alone on a quiet hole, then deliberately triggered her invisibility by thinking about Collins and his patronizing attitude. Once she'd disappeared, she'd picked up her golf bag and walked ahead to the next tee.

To any observer, it would have looked like Margaret Thornfield had a highly professional caddy who happened to be completely invisible. The bag moved smoothly along the cart path, positioned itself perfectly for each shot, and even appeared to be reading the greens and offering advice – though of course, no one could hear the caddy's voice.

Margaret discovered that she could maintain her invisibility for longer periods when she wasn't stressed. The angry disappearances were involuntary and exhausting, but when she consciously triggered the effect in a calm state of mind, she could stretch it to nearly an hour.

After a few weeks of practice, she'd developed a routine. She would arrive at the golf course as Chief Inspector Margaret Thornfield, check in at the pro shop, and head to the first tee. Then she would find a private moment to trigger her invisibility, spend the round as her own caddy, and reappear in time to finish the game and head home.

It was absurd, but it worked. Her golf game improved dramatically with a dedicated caddy, even if that caddy was herself. She could line up shots more carefully, read greens from multiple angles, and carry her bag without getting tired. Other players began to notice her improvement and started asking about her caddy service.

"Oh," Margaret would say casually, "it's just someone I found locally. Very professional, but quite shy. Doesn't like to chat with other players."

The arrangement had an unexpected side benefit: it gave her a sense of control over her ability. Instead of feeling like a victim of some inexplicable medical condition, she was actively using her invisibility for something positive. It wasn't saving lives or solving crimes, but it was something.

David had been thrilled with her improved game. "You should enter some tournaments," he'd suggested. "With a caddy that good, you could be competitive."

Margaret had deflected the suggestion, but secretly, she was pleased with her progress. Golf was becoming a refuge from the stress of her job, and her invisible caddy was the perfect partner.

The Henderson game went well. Margaret played some of the best golf of her life, with her invisible self providing expert advice on every shot. Mrs. Henderson was particularly impressed.

"Your caddy is remarkable," she said as they walked up the eighteenth fairway. "So professional, so quiet. Where did you find someone that good?"

"Just got lucky, I suppose," Margaret replied, fighting back a smile.

After the game, David was practically glowing with satisfaction. "That was perfect," he whispered as they shook hands with the Hendersons. "I think we've got their business."

Margaret nodded, but her mind was already elsewhere. As they walked back to the clubhouse, she found herself thinking about Collins and his theory about the break-ins. What if he was right about there being inside information, but wrong about it coming from the police department?

What if the burglar had access to a different kind of inside information?That evening, Margaret sat in her study with the case files spread across her desk like pieces of a puzzle that refused to come together. The Henderson golf game had been a success – David was already planning their celebration dinner – but she couldn't shake the feeling that she'd missed something important during her conversation with Collins that morning.

She pulled out a map of Walsall and marked each of the break-in locations with red pins. The pattern that emerged was interesting: all of the targeted homes were in affluent neighborhoods, all had been empty at the time of the burglaries, and all had been hit on weekdays between ten in the morning and three in the afternoon. The burglar had shown remarkable knowledge of the homeowners' schedules, avoiding houses where people worked from home and targeting properties where both spouses had traditional office jobs.

Margaret leaned back in her chair and studied the map. Collins had suggested police inside information, but that didn't feel right to her. The timing was too specific, too personal. This wasn't someone who knew general patrol schedules – this was someone who knew individual families' routines.

She opened her laptop and began cross-referencing the victims. The Weatherbys on Bentley Road – both doctors who worked at the local hospital. The Prices on Wellington Street – he was a solicitor, she was a teacher. The Martins on Oak Avenue – both worked in Birmingham and commuted by train every day. Each couple had predictable schedules that would be visible to someone who paid attention.

But who would have access to that kind of information about multiple families?

Margaret's phone rang, interrupting her thoughts. The caller ID showed Dr. Sarah Chen's number.

"Margaret? I hope I'm not calling too late."

"Not at all. I was just working on a case. What's going on?"

"I wanted to check in about our conversation last week. About your... condition. Have there been any new episodes?"

Margaret hesitated. She'd been honest with Sarah about the involuntary invisibility, but she hadn't mentioned her golf course experiments. That felt too much like admitting she was actively embracing something that might be a symptom of a serious medical condition.

"One this morning. Same pattern as before – stress triggered, lasted about twenty minutes, left me exhausted afterward."

"And you're still having no luck with controlling it?"

"None whatsoever." The lie came easily, but it left Margaret feeling uncomfortable. Sarah was trying to help, and withholding information wasn't fair to either of them.

"Margaret, I've been doing some research, and I'd like to suggest something that might sound unconventional."

"More unconventional than spontaneous invisibility?"

Sarah laughed. "Fair point. I've been reading about stress-induced psychosomatic phenomena – cases where emotional trauma manifests as physical symptoms that can't be explained through traditional medical diagnosis. Most of these cases involve pain or paralysis, but there have been documented instances of more unusual presentations."

Margaret frowned. "Are you suggesting this is all in my head?"

"Not exactly. I'm suggesting that your mind might be creating a physical reality that we don't fully understand yet. The stress triggers are consistent with conversion disorders, but the specific manifestation is unlike anything I've encountered in the literature."

"So what are you proposing?"

"I think we should try some controlled experiments. If we can understand what triggers the episodes and how they progress, we might be able to find ways to manage or even prevent them. Would you be willing to come in for some sessions where we deliberately try to induce the invisibility under controlled conditions?"

Margaret's first instinct was to refuse. The idea of turning her condition into a laboratory experiment felt wrong somehow. But Sarah's suggestion also offered something she desperately wanted: answers.

"Let me think about it," she said finally.

After Sarah hung up, Margaret returned to her case files, but her concentration was broken. The conversation had reminded her that she was living with something that might be symptoms of a serious psychological disorder. Her golf course experiments suddenly seemed less like clever adaptation and more like dangerous self-deception.

She was closing the files when her phone buzzed with a text message from an unknown number: "Chief Inspector Thornfield – I have information about the Bentley Road burglaries. Can we meet tomorrow? It's important."

Margaret stared at the message. Anonymous tips weren't unusual in police work, but something about the timing felt significant. She'd been thinking about the case all day, and now someone was reaching out with information.

She texted back: "Who is this? How did you get this number?"

The response came immediately: "Someone who knows more than they should. Noon tomorrow at the park on Victoria Street. Come alone."

Margaret set down her phone and rubbed her temples. Anonymous meetings with mysterious informants were exactly the kind of situation that had gotten police officers into trouble throughout history. But the break-ins were escalating, and if someone had genuine information, she couldn't ignore it.

She made a mental note to inform the duty sergeant about the meeting and to arrange for backup to be positioned nearby. Whatever was happening with her personal condition, she was still a police officer, and she had responsibilities that couldn't be set aside.

Upstairs, she could hear David moving around in their bedroom, probably getting ready for bed. She should join him, should try to have a normal evening with her husband, should pretend that everything in her life wasn't becoming increasingly complicated and surreal.

Instead, she found herself thinking about the golf course again. There was something liberating about being invisible, about moving through the world without being seen or judged or questioned. For twenty years, she'd fought to be visible in a profession that often preferred to ignore women. She'd worked twice as hard as her male colleagues, had endured condescension and skepticism and outright hostility, all in service of being taken seriously.

Now she had the power to disappear entirely, and part of her was beginning to wonder if that might not be such a terrible thing.

Margaret gathered the case files and headed upstairs. Tomorrow would bring new challenges, new questions, and probably new episodes of involuntary invisibility. But tonight, she was just a tired police officer going to bed beside her husband, trying to hold onto whatever pieces of normal life she had left.

As she brushed her teeth, she caught sight of herself in the bathroom mirror. Forty-two years old, twenty years of police work etched in the lines around her eyes, and now something else entirely written in her expression. She looked like someone carrying a secret that was too big to bear alone.

Which, she supposed, was exactly what she was.**Chapter 2**

The next morning brought unseasonably warm weather and a phone call that changed everything. Margaret was reviewing patrol schedules when her desk phone rang, the harsh electronic tone cutting through the quiet hum of the early shift change.

"Chief Inspector Thornfield," she answered, cradling the phone against her shoulder while she continued marking duty rosters.

"Chief, it's PC Williams from the night shift. We've got a situation at 42 Maple Grove that I think you'll want to see personally." Williams was one of her more reliable constables, not given to dramatics or unnecessary calls to senior officers. When he suggested she needed to see something personally, it was usually worth her attention.

"What kind of situation?" Margaret set down her pen and gave the call her full attention. Maple Grove was in one of the neighborhoods that had been hit by the serial burglar, though that particular street hadn't been targeted yet.

"Break-in, but it's different from the others. The homeowner surprised the intruder, and there was an altercation. We've got a very shaken witness and some physical evidence that doesn't match the pattern we've been seeing." Williams paused, and Margaret could hear him flipping through his notebook. "Mrs. Patricia Henley, sixty-eight years old, lives alone since her husband passed last year. She came home early from her daughter's house because she wasn't feeling well, walked in on someone ransacking her sitting room."

Margaret felt a familiar tightness in her chest. The previous burglaries had been notable for their complete avoidance of occupied homes. The perpetrator had shown remarkable skill in selecting targets when no one would be present. If he was now willing to risk confrontations with homeowners, the situation had escalated significantly.

"Is Mrs. Henley injured?"

"Shaken up, but physically she's fine. The intruder ran when he realized she was there, didn't touch her. But Chief, she's saying some things that don't quite add up. I think it would be better if you heard it directly from her." Williams lowered his voice slightly. "She's insisting that the burglar was invisible."

Margaret's pen slipped from her fingers and clattered to the desk. "I'm sorry, what did you say?"

"She claims the intruder was invisible. Says she saw her belongings moving around by themselves, drawers opening and closing with no one there to operate them. When she screamed, everything stopped, and she heard footsteps running toward the back door, but she never saw a person." Williams cleared his throat awkwardly. "I know how it sounds, Chief. She's elderly, it was a traumatic situation, and people's perceptions can be unreliable under stress. But she's remarkably coherent otherwise, and there are some aspects of the scene that are... unusual."

Margaret's mouth had gone completely dry. The tingling sensation she'd come to associate with her episodes was starting in her fingertips, but this time it felt different – more like an electric shock of recognition than the beginning of an involuntary disappearance.

"I'll be there in twenty minutes," she managed to say. "Don't let anyone else interview Mrs. Henley until I arrive, and make sure the scene is preserved exactly as you found it."

"Already done, Chief. I've got Davies stationed outside, and I told Mrs. Henley we'd need to wait for the senior investigating officer before taking her formal statement."

Margaret hung up the phone and stared at her hands. They were trembling slightly, but they were definitely visible. She pressed her palms flat against the desk and tried to think rationally about what Williams had told her. An elderly witness, traumatized by a break-in, claiming to have seen an invisible intruder. Under normal circumstances, she would have dismissed it as the confused perception of someone who'd been frightened and was trying to make sense of a chaotic situation.

But these weren't normal circumstances, and Margaret was no longer someone who could dismiss claims of invisibility as impossible.

The drive to Maple Grove took her through some of Walsall's most established residential areas. Large Victorian houses sat behind well-maintained gardens, their windows gleaming in the morning sun and their driveways occupied by expensive cars. It was exactly the kind of neighborhood that would attract a burglar looking for valuable, easily portable items. It was also exactly the kind of neighborhood where an invisible intruder could move freely without being noticed by neighbors or casual observers.

Number 42 was a red-brick semi-detached house with white trim and a garden that showed the careful attention of someone who took pride in their property. PC Williams was waiting by the front gate, his notebook in hand and his expression serious.

"Morning, Chief. Mrs. Henley is in the kitchen with WPC Morrison. She's had some tea and she's calmed down considerably, but her story hasn't changed." Williams gestured toward the front door, which showed no signs of forced entry. "He came in through the back, just like the others. Clean lock work, no damage to the door or frame. But once he was inside..."

Williams led Margaret through the narrow hallway toward the sitting room. The house had the particular smell of elderly occupancy – lavender sachets, old furniture polish, and the lingering aroma of countless cups of tea. Under normal circumstances, it would have been comforting and familiar. Today, it felt heavy with violation and fear.

The sitting room looked like a tornado had passed through it. Drawers had been pulled out and their contents scattered across the carpet. Cushions had been removed from chairs and sofas, their covers partially unzipped as if someone had been searching inside them. A bookshelf had been cleared, with volumes lying in untidy piles around its base. But despite the thorough search, nothing appeared to be missing.

"This is where it gets interesting," Williams said, pulling out his notebook. "Look at the pattern of the search. In the previous break-ins, our burglar was methodical and careful. He knew what he was looking for and where to find it. This looks desperate, almost frantic."

Margaret walked carefully around the room, trying not to disturb any potential evidence while taking in the scene. Williams was right about the change in pattern. The previous crime scenes had shown almost surgical precision – specific items taken, minimal disturbance to anything else, clear evidence of someone who knew exactly what they wanted and how to find it quickly.

This was different. This was the work of someone who was searching for something specific but didn't know where it might be hidden. Someone who had been surprised by Mrs. Henley's early return and had been forced to flee before completing their search.

"What about fingerprints?" Margaret asked.

"That's the other unusual thing. We've got clear prints on several surfaces – the drawer handles, the bookshelf, even the TV remote. Either our burglar has stopped being careful about leaving evidence, or..." Williams trailed off, clearly uncomfortable with finishing the thought.

"Or what?"

"Well, if someone was invisible, they might not think about leaving fingerprints. They'd be focused on not being seen, not on avoiding physical evidence." Williams looked embarrassed. "I know how that sounds, Chief, but I'm trying to make sense of what we're seeing here."

Margaret nodded slowly. It was exactly the kind of logical deduction she would expect from a good constable, and exactly the kind of impossible conclusion that would normally be dismissed immediately. But Williams was right – if someone believed they were invisible, they might become careless about other forms of evidence.

"Let me talk to Mrs. Henley," she said.

Patricia Henley was a small, neat woman with carefully styled gray hair and intelligent brown eyes that showed no signs of confusion or disorientation. She was sitting at a kitchen table that was set for one, her hands wrapped around a mug of tea, while WPC Morrison sat across from her taking notes.

"Mrs. Henley, I'm Chief Inspector Thornfield. I understand you've had a very frightening experience." Margaret took a seat at the table and studied the older woman's face. "I'd like you to tell me exactly what happened, in your own words, without worrying about whether it sounds believable."

Mrs. Henley set down her mug and folded her hands in her lap. "I know what people will think, Inspector. I know it sounds like the confused rambling of an old woman who's been frightened out of her wits. But I've lived in this house for forty-three years, and I know every sound it makes, every shadow that falls across every room. What I saw this morning wasn't normal."

"Tell me what you saw."

"I came home around half past nine because I'd developed a headache at my daughter's house and wanted to take some paracetamol and have a lie-down. I used my key at the front door, same as always, and I could tell immediately that something was wrong. There were sounds coming from the sitting room – not footsteps, exactly, but the sounds of someone moving around, opening things, shifting furniture."

Mrs. Henley paused to sip her tea, and Margaret noticed that her hands were completely steady. Whatever she had experienced, she wasn't exhibiting the typical signs of someone whose perceptions had been distorted by fear or shock.

"I thought perhaps my son-in-law had come round to fix the loose floorboard he'd been promising to repair for months. He has a key, and he's been known to let himself in when I'm not here. So I called out 'Robert, is that you?' and everything went quiet." Mrs. Henley's eyes focused on something beyond Margaret's shoulder, as if she was replaying the scene in her mind. "That should have been when he answered me, or when he came out to greet me. Instead, I heard what sounded like someone trying very hard to be still."

"What did you do then?"

"I went to the sitting room to see what was happening. The door was partially closed, but I could see through the gap that my things were scattered about. I pushed the door open and stepped inside, and that's when I saw something that I still don't entirely believe myself."

Mrs. Henley looked directly at Margaret, and her voice became very quiet and very firm. "Inspector, I saw my belongings moving by themselves. I watched a drawer slide open with no hand to pull it. I saw books lifted off shelves and set down on the floor by someone I could not see. I watched my cushions being unzipped and searched by invisible fingers."

The tingling in Margaret's fingertips was becoming stronger, but she forced herself to focus on Mrs. Henley's account. "How long did this continue?"

"Perhaps thirty seconds, maybe a minute. I was so shocked that I couldn't move or speak. Then a book fell and made a loud noise, and I screamed. Everything stopped immediately. I heard footsteps running toward the back of the house, very fast, and then the back door slammed shut. But Inspector, I never saw a person. Not even a glimpse."

Margaret exchanged a look with WPC Morrison, who was taking careful notes but whose expression suggested she was struggling with the credibility of the account. "Mrs. Henley, is there any chance that someone could have hidden when they heard you come home? Could they have been concealed behind furniture or in a corner where you might not have seen them clearly?"

"I considered that possibility while I was waiting for the police to arrive. I've spent the morning thinking of rational explanations for what I experienced. But Inspector, I've lived alone for three years since my husband passed, and I've become very observant about my surroundings. I notice when magazines have been moved or when chairs are in slightly different positions than I left them. If there had been a person in that room, I would have seen them."

Mrs. Henley leaned forward slightly, her voice becoming more intense. "What I saw wasn't someone hiding or moving very quickly or playing tricks with shadows. What I saw was my possessions being manipulated by someone who wasn't there. I know how impossible that sounds, but I also know what I witnessed."

Margaret felt the familiar weight of a decision that could define the direction of an entire investigation. She could treat Mrs. Henley's account as the confused perception of an elderly witness and focus the investigation on finding a conventional explanation for the break-in. Or she could take seriously the possibility that they were dealing with something that fell far outside the normal parameters of police work.

Three weeks ago, before her own experiences began, the choice would have been obvious. Today, sitting across from a woman whose calm, detailed account matched her own impossible reality, Margaret found herself confronting the possibility that she might not be the only person in Walsall who could become invisible.

"Mrs. Henley, I want you to know that we're taking your statement very seriously. This investigation will proceed based on the evidence and your account of what happened, regardless of how unusual it might seem." Margaret stood up from the table and looked at WPC Morrison. "I want Mrs. Henley's statement taken down word for word, and I want this treated as a priority case."

As she walked back through the house toward the sitting room, Margaret's mind was racing through possibilities that she would never have considered a month ago. If there was another person in Walsall who could become invisible, it would explain the burglar's uncanny ability to avoid detection. It would also mean that her own condition wasn't unique, which raised questions about what might be causing it and whether there might be others.

PC Williams was waiting in the sitting room with an evidence bag containing what appeared to be a small electronic device. "Chief, we found this wedged behind the bookshelf. It looks like it might have been dropped during the search."

Margaret examined the device through the clear plastic of the evidence bag. It was roughly the size of a mobile phone but thicker, with a small screen and several buttons. She didn't recognize it immediately, but it looked like some kind of specialized equipment rather than a common household item.

"Any idea what it is?"

"Not yet, but I've got a call in to the tech unit. They should be able to tell us more once they've had a chance to examine it properly." Williams made a note in his book. "If it belongs to our burglar, it's the first real physical evidence we've had linking the break-ins."

Margaret nodded, but her attention was caught by something else. Near the window, barely visible on the carpet, was a small pile of what looked like salt or sugar. She knelt down and examined it more closely without touching it.

"Williams, have you noticed this?"

The constable joined her beside the window and frowned at the white granules. "That wasn't in my initial notes. Mrs. Henley, could you come in here for a moment?"

Mrs. Henley appeared in the doorway, still carrying her mug of tea. "What is it?"

"Do you recognize this substance? Is it something that would normally be in your sitting room?"

Mrs. Henley approached carefully and studied the small pile. "I've never seen that before. I don't eat in the sitting room, and I certainly don't keep salt or sugar in here." She looked up at Margaret with an expression of growing concern. "Do you think the intruder left it behind?"

Margaret stood up and brushed off her knees. The white granules were another anomaly in a case that was rapidly accumulating inexplicable details. An invisible burglar, a desperate search pattern, fingerprints left carelessly behind, an unknown electronic device, and now a mysterious substance that didn't belong in the scene.

Taken individually, each element could be explained or dismissed. Together, they painted a picture of something far more complex than a simple breaking and entering case.

"Mrs. Henley, I want to ask you something that might seem strange," Margaret said carefully. "In the days or weeks before this incident, did you notice anything unusual in your neighborhood? People watching houses, unfamiliar vehicles parked on the street, anything that struck you as out of the ordinary?"

Mrs. Henley considered the question seriously. "Not exactly, but now that you mention it, there have been some odd things. My neighbor across the street, Mrs. Patterson, mentioned that she'd been hearing footsteps in her garden at night. Nothing missing or disturbed, just the sound of someone walking around. And the Johnsons two doors down said their dog had been acting strangely for the past week – barking at empty air, following invisible scents around the house."

Margaret felt the tingling sensation spread from her fingertips up her arms. The pattern Mrs. Henley was describing sounded like someone who was invisible but not intangible – someone who could avoid being seen but who still made sounds, still left scents, still disturbed the physical world around them.

Someone exactly like herself.

"I want you to stay with your daughter for a few days while we process the scene and investigate this incident," Margaret told Mrs. Henley. "And if you remember anything else, no matter how small or strange it might seem, I want you to call me immediately."

She handed Mrs. Henley her business card and made sure WPC Morrison had arranged for transportation to the daughter's house. Then she returned to the sitting room where PC Williams was finishing his documentation of the scene.

"Williams, I want this case treated with absolute discretion. No details shared with other officers until I've had a chance to review all the evidence, and no information released to the press under any circumstances."

"Of course, Chief. But if I may ask, what's your initial assessment? Are we dealing with an escalation of the existing burglary pattern, or something else entirely?"

Margaret looked around the disrupted room one more time, taking in the scattered books, the overturned furniture, and the small pile of white granules by the window. Somewhere in Walsall, there was someone else who could become invisible, someone who was using that ability to commit crimes but who was becoming increasingly desperate and careless.

The question was whether that person knew they weren't alone.

"Something else entirely," she said finally. "And Williams, I want you to cancel my appointments for the rest of the morning. I have a meeting at noon that's suddenly become much more important than I realized."

As she walked back to her car, Margaret found herself wondering about the anonymous text message she'd received the night before. Someone who claimed to have information about the burglaries, someone who wanted to meet in private, someone who might know more than they should about what was really happening in her jurisdiction.

The timing of Mrs. Henley's break-in, coming just hours before the scheduled meeting, was too convenient to be coincidental. Margaret was increasingly certain that her mysterious informant wasn't planning to provide information about the invisible burglar.

They were planning to confess to being him.
