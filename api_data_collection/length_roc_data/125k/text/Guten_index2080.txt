CONSTABLE, Printers to Her Majesty     INTRODUCTION   PARTIAL collections of English poems, decided by a common subject or bounded by narrow dates and periods of literary history, are made at very short intervals, and the makers are safe from the reproach of proposing their own personal taste as a guide for the reading of others.  But a general Anthology gathered from the whole of English literature—the whole from Chaucer to Wordsworth—by a gatherer intent upon nothing except the quality of poetry, is a more rare enterprise.  It is hardly to be made without tempting the suspicion—nay, hardly without seeming to hazard the confession—of some measure of self-confidence.  Nor can even the desire to enter upon that labour be a frequent one—the desire of the heart of one for whom poetry is veritably ‘the complementary life’ to set up a pale for inclusion and exclusion, to add honours, to multiply homage, to cherish, to restore, to protest, to proclaim, to depose; and to gain the consent of a multitude of readers to all those acts.  Many years, then—some part of a century—may easily pass between the publication of one general anthology and the making of another.  The enterprise would be a sorry one if it were really arbitrary, and if an anthologist should give effect to passionate preferences without authority.  An anthology that shall have any value must be made on the responsibility of one but on the authority of many.  There is no caprice; the mind of the maker has been formed for decision by the wisdom of many instructors.  It is the very study of criticism, and the grateful and profitable study, that gives the justification to work done upon the strongest personal impulse, and done, finally, in the mental solitude that cannot be escaped at the last.  In another order, moral education would be best crowned if it proved to have quick and profound control over the first impulses; its finished work would be to set the soul in a state of law, delivered from the delays of self-distrust; not action only, but the desires would be in an old security, and a wish would come to light already justified.  This would be the second—if it were not the only—liberty.  Even so an intellectual education might assuredly confer freedom upon first and solitary thoughts, and confidence and composure upon the sallies of impetuous courage.  In a word, it should make a studious anthologist quite sure about genius.  And all who have bestowed, or helped in bestowing, the liberating education have given their student the authority to be free.  Personal and singular the choice in such a book must be, not without right.  Claiming and disclaiming so much, the gatherers may follow one another to harvest, and glean in the same fields in different seasons, for the repetition of the work can never be altogether a repetition.  The general consent of criticism does not stand still; and moreover, a mere accident has until now left a poet of genius of the past here and there to neglect or obscurity.  This is not very likely to befall again; the time has come when there is little or nothing left to discover or rediscover in the sixteenth century or the seventeenth; we know that there does not lurk another Crashaw contemned, or another Henry Vaughan disregarded, or another George Herbert misplaced.  There is now something like finality of knowledge at least; and therefore not a little error in the past is ready to be repaired.  This is the result of time.  Of the slow actions and reactions of critical taste there might be something to say, but nothing important.  No loyal anthologist perhaps will consent to acknowledge these tides; he will hardly do his work well unless he believe it to be stable and perfect; nor, by the way, will he judge worthily in the name of others unless he be resolved to judge intrepidly for himself.  Inasmuch as even the best of all poems are the best upon innumerable degrees, the size of most anthologies has gone far to decide what degrees are to be gathered in and what left without.  The best might make a very small volume, and be indeed the best, or a very large volume, and be still indeed the best.  But my labour has been to do somewhat differently—to gather nothing that did not overpass a certain boundary-line of genius.  Gray’s _Elegy_, for instance, would rightly be placed at the head of everything below that mark.  It is, in fact, so near to the work of genius as to be most directly, closely, and immediately rebuked by genius; it meets genius at close quarters and almost deserves that Shakespeare himself should defeat it.  Mediocrity said its own true word in the _Elegy_:     ‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,    And waste its sweetness on the desert air.’  But greatness had said its own word also in a sonnet:     ‘The summer flower is to the summer sweet    Though to itself it only live and die.’  The reproof here is too sure; not always does it touch so quick, but it is not seldom manifest, and it makes exclusion a simple task.  Inclusion, on the other hand, cannot be so completely fulfilled.  The impossibility of taking in poems of great length, however purely lyrical, is a mechanical barrier, even on the plan of the present volume; in the case of Spenser’s _Prothalamion_, the unmanageably autobiographical and local passage makes it inappropriate; some exquisite things of Landor’s are lyrics in blank verse, and the necessary rule against blank verse shuts them out.  No extracts have been made from any poem, but in a very few instances a stanza or a passage has been dropped out.  No poem has been put in for the sake of a single perfectly fine passage; it would be too much to say that no poem has been put in for the sake of two splendid passages or so.  The Scottish ballad poetry is represented by examples that are to my mind finer than anything left out; still, it is but represented; and as the song of this multitude of unknown poets overflows by its quantity a collection of lyrics of genius, so does severally the song of Wordsworth, Crashaw, and Shelley.  It has been necessary, in considering traditional songs of evidently mingled authorship, to reject some one invaluable stanza or burden—the original and ancient surviving matter of a spoilt song—because it was necessary to reject the sequel that has cumbered it since some sentimentalist took it for his own.  An example, which makes the heart ache, is that burden of keen and remote poetry:     ‘O the broom, the bonnie, bonnie broom,       The broom of Cowdenknowes!’  Perhaps some hand will gather all such precious fragments as these together one day, freed from what is alien in the work of the restorer. It is inexplicable that a generation resolved to forbid the restoration of ancient buildings should approve the eighteenth century restoration of ancient poems; nay, the architectural ‘restorer’ is immeasurably the more respectful.  In order to give us again the ancient fragments, it is happily not necessary to break up the composite songs which, since the time of Burns, have gained a national love.  Let them be, but let the old verses be also; and let them have, for those who desire it, the solitariness of their state of ruin.  Even in the cases—and they are not few—where Burns is proved to have given beauty and music to the ancient fragment itself, his work upon the old stanza is immeasurably finer than his work in his own new stanzas following, and it would be less than impiety to part the two.  I have obeyed a profound conviction which I have reason to hope will be more commended in the future than perhaps it can be now, in leaving aside a multitude of composite songs—anachronisms, and worse than mere anachronisms, as I think them to be, for they patch wild feeling with sentiment of the sentimentalist.  There are some exceptions.  The one fine stanza of a song which both Sir Walter Scott and Burns restored is given with the restorations of both, those restorations being severally beautiful; and the burden, ‘Hame, hame, hame,’ is printed with the Jacobite song that carries it; this song seems so mingled and various in date and origin that no apology is needed for placing it amongst the bundle of Scottish ballads of days before the Jacobites.  _Sir Patrick Spens_ is treated here as an ancient song.  It is to be noted that the modern, or comparatively modern, additions to old songs full of quantitative metre—‘Hame, hame, hame,’ is one of these—full of long notes, rests, and interlinear pauses, are almost always written in anapæsts.  The later writer has slipped away from the fine, various, and subtle metre of the older.  Assuredly the popularity of the metre which, for want of a term suiting the English rules of verse, must be called anapæstic, has done more than any other thing to vulgarise the national sense of rhythm and to silence the finer rhythms.  Anapæsts came quite suddenly into English poetry and brought coarseness, glibness, volubility, dapper and fatuous effects.  A master may use it well, but as a popular measure it has been disastrous.  I would be bound to find the modern stanzas in an old song by this very habit of anapæsts and this very misunderstanding of the long words and interlinear pauses of the older stanzas.  This, for instance, is the old metre:     ‘Hame, hame, hame!  O hame fain wad I be!’  and this the lamentable anapæstic line (from the same song):     ‘Yet the sun through the mirk seems to promise to me—.’  It has been difficult to refuse myself the delight of including _A Divine Love_ of Carew, but it seemed too bold to leave out four stanzas of a poem of seven, and the last four are of the poorest argument.  This passage at least shall speak for the first three:                 ‘Thou didst appear       A glorious mystery, so dark, so clear,             As Nature did intend    All should confess, but none might comprehend.’  From _Christ’s Victory in Heaven_ of Giles Fletcher (out of reach for its length) it is a happiness to extract here at least the passage upon ‘Justice,’ who looks ‘as the eagle              that hath so oft compared    Her eye with heaven’s’;  from Marlowe’s poem, also unmanageable, that in which Love ran to the priestess     ‘And laid his childish head upon her breast’;  with that which tells how Night,              ‘deep-drenched in misty Acheron,    Heaved up her head, and half the world upon    Breathed darkness forth’;  from Robert Greene two lines of a lovely passage:     ‘Cupid abroad was lated in the night,    His wings were wet with ranging in the rain’;  from Ben Jonson’s _Hue and Cry_ (not throughout fine) the stanza:     ‘Beauties, have ye seen a toy,    Called Love, a little boy,    Almost naked, wanton, blind;    Cruel now, and then as kind?    If he be amongst ye, say;    He is Venus’ run-away’;  from Francis Davison:     ‘Her angry eyes are great with tears’;  from George Wither:           ‘I can go rest          On her sweet breast    That is the pride of Cynthia’s train’;  from Cowley:     ‘Return, return, gay planet of mine east’!  The poems in which these are cannot make part of the volume, but the citation of the fragments is a relieving act of love.  At the very beginning, Skelton’s song to ‘Mistress Margery Wentworth’ had almost taken a place; but its charm is hardly fine enough.  If it is necessary to answer the inevitable question in regard to Byron, let me say that in another Anthology, a secondary Anthology, the one in which Gray’s _Elegy_ would have an honourable place, some more of Byron’s lyrics would certainly be found; and except this there is no apology.  If the last stanza of the ‘Dying Gladiator’ passage, or the last stanza on the cascade rainbow at Terni,     ‘Love watching madness with unalterable mien,’  had been separate poems instead of parts of _Childe Harold_, they would have been amongst the poems that are here collected in no spirit of arrogance, or of caprice, of diffidence or doubt.  The volume closes some time before the middle of the century and the death of Wordsworth.                                                                        A.

SIR WALTER RALEIGH 1552–1618   VERSES BEFORE DEATH      EVEN such is time, that takes in trust       Our youth, our joys, our all we have,    And pays us but with earth and dust;       Who, in the dark and silent grave,    When we have wandered all our ways,    Shuts up the story of our days;    But from this earth, this grave, this dust,    My God shall raise me up, I trust!     EDMUND SPENSER 1553–1599   EASTER      MOST glorious Lord of life! that on this day       Didst make thy triumph over death and sin;    And, having harrowed hell, didst bring away       Captivity then captive, us to win:    This glorious day, dear Lord, with joy begin,       And grant that we, for whom thou diddest die,    Being with thy dear blood clean washed from sin,       May live for ever in felicity!     And that thy love we weighing worthily,       May likewise love thee for the same again;    And for thy sake, that all like dear didst buy,       With love may one another entertain.    So let us love, dear Love, like as we ought;    Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.    FRESH SPRING      FRESH Spring, the herald of love’s mighty king,       In whose coat-armour richly are displayed    All sorts of flowers, the which on earth do spring       In goodly colours gloriously arrayed:    Go to my love, where she is careless laid,       Yet in her winter bower not well awake;    Tell her the joyous time will not be stayed,       Unless she do him by the forelock take;     Bid her therefore herself soon ready make,       To wait on Love amongst his lovely crew;    Where every one that misseth there her make       Shall be by him amerced with penance due.    Make haste therefore, sweet love, whilst it is prime,       For none can call again the passed time.    LIKE AS A SHIP      LIKE as a ship, that through the ocean wide,       By conduct of some star doth make her way,    When, as a storm hath dimmed her trusty guide,       Out of her course doth wander far astray!    So I, whose star, that wont with her bright ray       Me to direct, with clouds is overcast,    Do wander now, in darkness and dismay,       Through hidden perils round about me placed;     Yet hope I well that, when this storm is past,       My Helice, the loadstar of my life,    Will shine again, and look on me at last,       With lovely light to clear my cloudy grief:    Till then I wander, careful, comfortless,    In secret sorrow and sad pensiveness.    EPITHALAMION      YE learned sisters, which have oftentimes    Been to me aiding, others to adorn,    Whom ye thought worthy of your graceful rhymes,    That even the greatest did not greatly scorn    To hear their names sung in your simple lays,    But joyed in their praise;    And when ye list your own mishaps to mourn,    Which death, or love, or fortune’s wreck did raise,    Your string could soon to sadder tenor turn,    And teach the woods and waters to lament    Your doleful dreariment:    Now lay those sorrowful complaints aside;    And, having all your heads with garlands crowned,    Help me mine own love’s praises to resound;    Ne let the same of any be envied:    So Orpheus did for his own bride!    So I unto myself alone will sing;    The woods shall to me answer, and my echo ring.     Early, before the world’s light-giving lamp    His golden beam upon the hills doth spread,    Having dispersed the night’s uncheerful damp,    Do ye awake; and, with fresh lusty-head,    Go to the bower of my beloved love,    My truest turtle dove;    Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake,    And long since ready forth his mask to move,    With his bright tead that names with many a flake,    And many a bachelor to wait on him,    In their fresh garments trim.    Bid her awake therefore, and soon her dight,    For lo! the wished day is come at last,    That shall, for all the pains and sorrows past,    Pay to her usury of long delight:    And, whilst she doth her dight,    Do ye to her of joy and solace sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.     Bring with you all the Nymphs that you can hear    Both of the rivers and the forests green,    And of the sea that neighbours to her near:    All with gay garlands goodly well beseen.    And let them also with them bring in hand    Another gay garland,    For my fair love, of lilies and of roses,    Bound truelove wise, with a blue silk riband.    And let them make great store of bridal posies,    And let them eke bring store of other flowers,    To deck the bridal bowers.    And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread,    For fear the stones her tender foot should wrong,    Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along,    And diapred like the discoloured mead.    Which done, do at her chamber door await,    For she will waken straight;    The whiles do ye this song unto her sing,    The woods shall to you answer, and your echo ring.     Ye Nymphs of Mulla, which with careful heed    The silver scaly trouts do tend full well,    And greedy pikes which use therein to feed    (Those trouts and pikes all others do excel);    And ye likewise, which keep the rushy lake,    Where none do fishes take;    Bind up the locks the which hang scattered light,    And in his waters, which your mirror make,    Behold your faces as the crystal bright,    That when you come whereas my love doth lie,    No blemish she may spy.    And eke, ye lightfoot maids, which keep the door,    That on the hoary mountain used to tower;    And the wild wolves, which seek them to devour,    With your steel darts do chase from coming near;    Be also present here,    To help to deck her, and to help to sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.     Wake now, my love, awake! for it is time:    The Rosy Morn long since left Tithon’s bed,    All ready to her silver coach to climb;    And Phœbus ’gins to show his glorious head.    Hark! how the cheerful birds do chant their lays    And carol of love’s praise.    The merry Lark her matins sings aloft;    The Thrush replies; the Mavis descant plays:    The Ouzel shrills; the Ruddock warbles soft;    So goodly all agree, with sweet consent,    To this day’s merriment.    Ah! my dear love, why do ye sleep thus long,    When meeter were that ye should now awake,    T’ await the coming of your joyous make,    And hearken to the birds’ love-learned song,    The dewy leaves among?    For they of joy and pleasance to you sing,    That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring.     My love is now awake out of her dreams,    And her fair eyes, like stars that dimmed were    With darksome cloud, now show their goodly beams    More bright than Hesperus his head doth rear.    Come now, ye damsels, daughters of delight,    Help quickly her to dight!    But first come, ye fair hours, which were begot,    In Jove’s sweet paradise, of Day and Night;    Which do the seasons of the year allot,    And all, that ever in this world is fair,    Do make and still repair:    And ye three handmaids of the Cyprian Queen,    The which do still adorn her beauty’s pride,    Help to adorn my beautifullest bride:    And, as ye her array, still throw between    Some graces to be seen;    And, as ye use to Venus, to her sing,    The whiles the woods shall answer, and your echo ring.     Now is my love all ready forth to come:    Let all the virgins therefore well await:    And ye, fresh boys, that tend upon her groom,    Prepare yourselves, for he is coming straight.    Set all your things in seemly good array,    Fit for so joyful day:    The joyfullest day that ever Sun did see.    Fair Sun! show forth thy favourable ray,    And let thy life-full heat not fervent be,    For fear of burning her sunshiny face,    Her beauty to disgrace.    O fairest Phœbus! father of the Muse!    If ever I did honour thee aright,    Or sing the thing that mote thy mind delight,    Do not thy servant’s simple boon refuse;    But let this day, let this one day, be mine;    Let all the rest be thine.    Then I thy sovereign praises loud will sing,    That all the woods shall answer, and their echo ring.     Hark! how the minstrels ’gin to shrill aloud    Their merry Music that resounds from far,    The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling crowd,    That well agree withouten breach or jar.    But, most of all, the damsels do delight    When they their timbrels smite,    And thereunto do dance and carol sweet,    That all the senses they do ravish quite;    The whiles the boys run up and down the street,    Crying aloud with strong confused noise,    As if it were one voice,    Hymen! iö Hymen!  Hymen, they do shout;    That even to the heavens their shouting shrill    Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill;    To which the people standing all about,    As in approvance, do thereto applaud,    And loud advance her laud;    And evermore they Hymen, Hymen! sing,    That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring.     Lo! where she comes along with portly pace,    Like Phœbe, from her chamber of the East,    Arising forth to run her mighty race,    Clad all in white, that seems a virgin best.    So well it her beseems, that ye would ween    Some angel she had been.    Her long loose yellow locks like golden wire,    Sprinkled with pearl, and pearling flowers atween,    Do like a golden mantle her attire;    And, being crowned with a garland green,    Seem like some maiden Queen.    Her modest eyes, abashed to behold    So many gazers as on her do stare,    Upon the lowly ground affixed are;    Ne dare lift up her countenance too bold,    But blush to hear her praises sung so loud,    So far from being proud.    Nathless, do ye still loud her praises sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.     Tell me, ye merchants’ daughters, did ye see    So fair a creature in your town before;    So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,    Adorned with beauty’s grace and virtue’s store?    Her goodly eyes like sapphires shining bright,    Her forehead ivory white,    Her cheeks like apples which the sun hath ruddied,    Her lips like cherries charming men to bite,    Her breast like to a bowl of cream uncrudded,    Her paps like lilies budded,    Her snowy neck like to a marble tower;    And all her body like a palace fair,    Ascending up, with many a stately stair,    To honour’s seat and chastity’s sweet bower.    Why stand ye still, ye virgins, in amaze,    Upon her so to gaze,    Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,    To which the woods did answer, and your echo ring?     But if ye saw that which no eyes can see,    The inward beauty of her lively spright,    Garnished with heavenly gifts of high degree,    Much more then would ye wonder at that sight,    And stand astonished like to those which read    Medusa’s mazeful head.    There dwells sweet love, and constant chastity,    Unspotted faith, and comely womanhood,    Regard of honour, and mild modesty;    There virtue reigns as Queen in royal throne,    And giveth laws alone,    The which the base affections do obey,    And yield their services unto her will;    Ne thought of thing uncomely ever may    Thereto approach to tempt her mind to ill.    Had ye once seen these her celestial treasures    And unrevealed pleasures,    Then would ye wonder, and her praises sing,    That all the woods should answer, and your echo ring.     Open the temple gates unto my love,    Open them wide that she may enter in,    And all the posts adorn as doth behove,    And all the pillars deck with garlands trim,    For to receive this Saint with honour due,    That cometh in to you.    With trembling steps, and humble reverence,    She cometh in before th’ Almighty’s view;    Of her ye virgins learn obedience,    When so ye come into those holy places,    To humble your proud faces:    Bring her up to th’ high altar, that she may    The sacred ceremonies there partake,    The which do endless matrimony make;    And let the roaring organs loudly play    The praises of the Lord in lively notes;    The whiles, with hollow throats,    The choristers the joyous anthem sing,    That all the woods may answer, and their echo ring.     Behold, whiles she before the altar stands,    Hearing the holy priest that to her speaks,    And blesseth her with his two happy hands,    How the red roses flush up in her cheeks,    And the pure snow with goodly vermeil stain,    Lake crimson dyed in grain:    That even th’ Angels, which continually    About the sacred altar do remain,    Forget their service and about her fly,    Oft peeping in her face, that seems more fair,    The more they on it stare.    But her sad eyes, still fastened on the ground,    Are governed with goodly modesty,    That suffers not one look to glance awry,    Which may let in a little thought unsound.    Why blush ye, love, to give to me your hand,    The pledge of all our band?    Sing, ye sweet Angels, Alleluja sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.     Now all is done: bring home the Bride again;    Bring home the triumph of our victory:    Bring home with you the glory of her gain,    With joyance bring her and with jollity.    Never had man more joyful day than this,    Whom heaven would heap with bliss.    Make feast therefore now all this live-long day;    This day for ever to me holy is.    Pour out the wine without restraint or stay,    Pour not by cups, but by the bellyful!    Pour out to all that wull,    And sprinkle all the posts and walls with wine,    That they may sweat, and drunken be withal.    Crown ye God Bacchus with a coronal,    And Hymen also crown with wreaths of vine;    And let the Graces dance unto the rest,    For they can do it best:    The whiles the maidens do their carol sing,    To which the woods shall answer, and their echo ring.     Ring ye the bells, ye young men of the town,    And leave your wonted labours for this day:    This day is holy; do ye write it down,    That ye for ever it remember may.    This day the sun is in his chiefest height,    With Barnaby the bright,    From whence declining daily by degrees,    He somewhat loseth of his heat and light,    When once the Crab behind his back he sees.    But for this time it ill ordained was,    To choose the longest day in all the year,    And shortest night, when longest fitter were:    Yet never day so long, but late would pass.    Ring ye the bells, to make it wear away,    And bonfires make all day;    And dance about them, and about them sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring!     Ah! when will this long weary day have end,    And lend me leave to come unto my love?    How slowly do the hours their numbers spend;    How slowly does sad Time his feathers move!    Haste thee, O fairest Planet, to thy home,    Within the Western foam:    Thy tired steeds long since have need of rest.    Long though it be, at last I see it gloom,    And the bright evening-star with golden crest    Appear out of the East,    Fair child of beauty! glorious lamp of love!    That all the host of heaven in ranks dost lead,    And guidest lovers through the night’s sad dread,    How cheerfully thou lookest from above,    And seem’st to laugh atween thy twinkling light,    As joying in the sight    Of these glad many, which for joy do sing,    That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring!     Now cease, ye damsels, your delights forepast;    Enough it is that all the day was yours:    Now day is done, and night is nighing fast,    Now bring the Bride into the bridal bowers.    The night is come; now soon her disarray,    And in her bed her lay;    Lay her in lilies and in violets,    And silken curtains over her display,    And odoured sheets, and arras coverlets.    Behold how goodly my fair love does lie,    In proud humility!    Like unto Maia, when as Jove her took    In Tempe, lying on the flowery grass,    ’Twixt sleep and wake, after she weary was,    With bathing in the Acidalian brook.    Now it is night, ye damsels may be gone,    And leave my love alone,    And leave likewise your former lay to sing:    The woods no more shall answer, nor your echo ring.     Now welcome, night! thou night so long expected,    That long day’s labour dost at last defray,    And all my cares, which cruel Love collected,    Hast summed in one, and cancelled for aye:    Spread thy broad wing over my love and me,    That no man may us see;    And in thy sable mantle us enwrap,    From fear of peril and foul horror free.    Let no false treason seek us to entrap,    Nor any dread disquiet once annoy    The safety of our joy;    But let the night be calm, and quietsome,    Without tempestuous storms or sad affray:    Like as when Jove with fair Alcmena lay,    When he begot the great Tirynthian groom:    Or like as when he with thy self did lie    And begot Majesty.    And let the maids and young men cease to sing;    Ne let the woods them answer, nor their echo ring.     Let no lamenting cries nor doleful tears    Be heard all night within, nor yet without;    Ne let false whispers, breeding hidden fears,    Break gentle sleep with misconceived doubt.    Let no deluding dreams, nor dreadful sights,    Make sudden sad affrights;    Ne let house-fires, nor lightning’s helpless harms,    Ne let the Pouke, nor other evil sprights,    Ne let mischievous witches with their charms,    Ne let hobgoblins, names whose sense we see not,    Fray us with things that be not:    Let not the shriek-owl nor the stork be heard,    Nor the night raven, that still deadly yells;    Nor damned ghosts, called up with mighty spells,    Nor grisly vultures, make us once afeard:    Ne let the unpleasant choir of frogs still croaking    Make us to wish their choking!    Let none of these their dreary accents sing;    Ne let the woods them answer, nor their echo ring.     But let still Silence true night-watches keep,    That sacred Peace may in assurance reign,    And timely Sleep, when it is time to sleep,    May pour his limbs forth on your pleasant plain;    The whiles an hundred little winged loves,    Like divers-feathered doves,    Shall fly and flutter round about your bed,    And in the secret dark, that none reproves,    Their pretty stealths shall work, and snares shall spread    To filch away sweet snatches of delight,    Concealed through covert night.    Ye sons of Venus, play your sports at will!    For greedy Pleasure, careless of your toys,    Thinks more upon her paradise of joys,    Then what ye do, albeit good or ill!    All night therefore attend your merry play,    For it will soon be day:    Now none doth hinder you, that say or sing;    Ne will the woods now answer, nor your echo ring.     Who is the same, which at my window peeps,    Or whose is that fair face that shines so bright?    Is it not Cynthia, she that never sleeps,    But walks about high heaven all the night?    O! fairest goddess, do thou not envy    My love with me to spy:    For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,    And for a fleece of wool, which privily    The Latmian shepherd once unto thee brought,    His pleasures with thee wrought!    Therefore to us be favourable now;    And sith of women’s labours thou hast charge,    And generation goodly dost enlarge,    Incline thy will to effect our wishful vow,    And the chaste womb inform with timely seed,    That may our comfort breed:    Till which we cease our hopeful hap to sing;    Ne let the woods us answer, nor our echo ring.     And thou, great Juno! which with awful might    The laws of wedlock still dost patronize,    And the religion of the faith first plight    With sacred rites hast taught to solemnize;    And eke for comfort often called art    Of women in their smart;    Eternally bind thou this lovely band,    And all thy blessings unto us impart.    And thou, glad Genius! in whose gentle hand    The bridal bower and genial bed remain,    Without blemish or stain;    And the sweet pleasures of their love’s delight    With secret aid dost succour and supply,    Till they bring forth the fruitful progeny;    Send us the timely fruit of this same night.    And thou, fair Hebe! and thou, Hymen free!    Grant that it may so be.    Till which we cease your further praise to sing;    Ne any woods shall answer, nor your echo ring.     And ye high heavens, the Temple of the Gods,    In which a thousand torches flaming bright    Do burn, that to us wretched earthly clods    In dreadful darkness lend desired light;    And all ye powers which in the same remain,    More than we men can feign!    Pour out your blessing on us plenteously,    And happy influence upon us rain,    That we may raise a large posterity,    Which from the earth, which they may long possess    With lasting happiness,    Up to your haughty palaces may mount;    And, for the guerdon of their glorious merit,    May heavenly tabernacles there inherit,    Of blessed saints for to increase the count.    So let us rest, sweet Love, in hope of this,    And cease till then our timely joys to sing:    The woods no more us answer, nor our echo ring!     _Song_! _made in lieu of many ornaments_,    _With which my Love should duly have been decked_.    _Which cutting off through hasty accidents_,    _Ye would not stay your due time to expect_,    _But promised both to recompense_;    _Be unto her a goodly ornament_,    _And for short time an endless monument_.     JOHN LYLY 1554(?)–1606   THE SPRING      WHAT bird so sings, yet does so wail?    O, ’tis the ravished nightingale!    ‘Jug, jug, jug, jug, tereu,’ she cries,    And still her woes at midnight rise.    Brave prick-song! who is’t now we hear?    None but the lark so shrill and clear;    Now at heaven’s gate she claps her wings,    The morn not waking till she sings.    Hark, hark, with what a pretty throat    Poor robin-redbreast tunes his note;    Hark, how the jolly cuckoos sing!    Cuckoo to welcome in the spring,    Cuckoo to welcome in the spring!     SIR PHILIP SIDNEY 1554–1586   TRUE LOVE      MY true-love hath my heart, and I have his,    By just exchange one for the other given:    I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss,    There never was a better bargain driven:    His heart in me keeps him and me in one,    My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:    He loves my heart, for once it was his own,    I cherish his because in me it bides:    His heart his wound received from my sight;    My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;    For as from me on him his hurt did light,    So still methought in me his hurt did smart:       Both, equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss.       My true-love hath my heart, and I have his.    THE MOON      WITH how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb’st the skies!    How silently, and with how wan a face!    What, may it be that e’en in heavenly place    That busy archer his sharp arrows tries!    Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes    Can judge of love, thou feel’st a lover’s case;    I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace,    To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.    Then, e’en of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,    Is constant love deemed there but want of wit?    Are beauties there as proud as here they be?    Do they above love to be loved, and yet       Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?       Do they call virtue, there, ungratefulness?    KISS      LOVE still a boy and oft a wanton is,    Schooled only by his mother’s tender eye;    What wonder, then, if he his lesson miss,    When for so soft a rod dear play he try?    And yet my Star, because a sugared kiss    In sport I sucked while she asleep did lie,    Doth lower, nay chide, nay threat, for only this.—    Sweet, it was saucy Love, not humble I!    But no ’scuse serves; she makes her wrath appear    In Beauty’s throne; see now, who dares come near    Those scarlet judges, threatening bloody pain!    O heavenly fool, thy most kiss-worthy face    Anger invests with such a lovely grace,    That Anger’s self I needs must kiss again.    SWEET JUDGE      ALAS! whence comes this change of looks?  If I    Have changed desert, let mine own conscience be    A still-felt plague to self-condemning me,    Let woe gripe on my heart, shame load mine eye;    But if all faith, like spotless ermine, lie    Safe in my soul, which only doth to thee,    As his sole object of felicity,    With wings of love in air of wonder fly,    O ease your hand, treat not so hard your slave;    In justice, pains come not till faults do call:    Or if I needs, sweet Judge, must torments have,    Use something else to chasten me withal       Than those blest eyes, where all my hopes do dwell:       No doom should make one’s heaven become his hell.    SLEEP      COME, Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,    The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,    The poor man’s wealth, the prisoner’s release,    The indifferent judge between the high and low;    With shield of proof shield me from out the prease    Of those fierce darts Despair at me doth throw:    O make in me those civil wars to cease;    I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.    Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,    A chamber deaf of noise and blind of light,    A rosy garland and a weary head:    And if these things, as being thine in right,       Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me       Livelier than elsewhere Stella’s image see.    WAT’RED WAS MY WINE      LATE tired with woe, even ready for to pine,    With rage of love, I called my love unkind;    She in whose eyes love, though unfelt, doth shine,    Sweet said that I true love in her should find.    I joyed; but straight thus wat’red was my wine,    That love she did, but loved a love not blind;    Which would not let me, whom she loved, decline    From nobler course, fit for my birth and mind:    And therefore, by her love’s authority,    Wiled me these tempests of vain love to fly,    And anchor fast myself on virtue’s shore.    Alas, if this the only metal be    Of love new-coined to help my beggary,    Dear, love me not, that you may love me more.     THOMAS LODGE 1556–1625   ROSALYND’S MADRIGAL      LOVE in my bosom, like a bee,             Doth suck his sweet;    Now with his wings he plays with me,             Now with his feet.       Within mines eyes he makes his nest,       His bed amidst my tender breast;       My kisses are his daily feast,       And yet he robs me of my rest:             Ah! wanton, will ye?     And if I sleep, then percheth he             With pretty flight,    And makes his pillow of my knee             The livelong night.       Strike I my lute, he tunes the string;       He music plays if so I sing:       He lends me every lovely thing,       Yet cruel he my heart doth sting:             Whist, wanton, will ye?     Else I with roses every day             Will whip you hence,    And bind you, when you long to play,             For your offence;       I’ll shut my eyes to keep you in,       I’ll make you fast it for your sin,       I’ll count your power not worth a pin:       Alas! what hereby shall I win,             If he gainsay me?     What if I beat the wanton boy             With many a rod?    He will repay me with annoy,             Because a god.       Then sit thou safely on my knee,       And let thy bower my bosom be;       Lurk in mine eyes, I like of thee!       O Cupid! so thou pity me,             Spare not, but play thee!    ROSALINE         LIKE to the clear in highest sphere       Where all imperial glory shines,       Of selfsame colour is her hair       Whether unfolded, or in twines:          Heigh ho, fair Rosaline!       Her eyes are sapphires set in snow,       Resembling heaven by every wink;       The gods do fear whenas they glow,       And I do tremble when I think—          Heigh ho, would she were mine!       Her cheeks are like the blushing cloud       That beautifies Aurora’s face,       Or like the silver crimson shroud       That Phœbus’ smiling looks doth grace;          Heigh ho, fair Rosaline!       Her lips are like two budded roses       Whom ranks of lilies neighbour nigh,       Within which bounds she balm encloses       Apt to entice a deity:          Heigh ho, would she were mine!        Her neck is like a stately tower       Where Love himself imprisoned lies,       To watch for glances every hour       From her divine and sacred eyes:          Heigh ho, fair Rosaline!       Her paps are centres of delight,       Her breasts are orbs of heavenly frame,       Where Nature moulds the dew of light       To feed perfection with the same:          Heigh ho, would she were mine!        With orient pearl, with ruby red,       With marble white, with sapphire blue       Her body every way is fed,       Yet soft in touch and sweet in view:          Heigh ho, fair Rosaline!       Nature herself her shape admires;       The gods are wounded in her sight;       And Love forsakes his heavenly fires       And at her eyes his brand doth light:          Heigh ho, would she were mine!        Then muse not, Nymphs, though I bemoan       The absence of fair Rosaline,       Since for a fair there’s fairer none,       Nor for her virtues so divine:          Heigh ho, fair Rosaline;    Heigh ho, my heart! would God that she were mine!    THE SOLITARY SHEPHERD’S SONG      O SHADY vale, O fair enriched meads,       O sacred woods, sweet fields, and rising mountains;    O painted flowers, green herbs where Flora treads,       Refreshed by wanton winds and watery fountains!     O all ye winged choristers of wood,       That perched aloft, your former pains report;    And straight again recount with pleasant mood       Your present joys in sweet and seemly sort!     O all you creatures whosoever thrive       On mother earth, in seas, by air, by fire;    More blest are you than I here under sun!       Love dies in me, whenas he doth revive    In you; I perish under Beauty’s ire,       Where after storms, winds, frosts, your life is won.     ANONYMOUS   I SAW MY LADY WEEP            I SAW my Lady weep,    And Sorrow proud to be advanced so    In those fair eyes where all perfections keep.          Her face was full of woe,    But such a woe (believe me) as wins more hearts    Than Mirth can do with her enticing parts.           Sorrow was there made fair,    And Passion, wise; Tears, a delightful thing;    Silence, beyond all speech, a wisdom rare:          She made her sighs to sing,    And all things with so sweet a sadness move    As made my heart at once both grieve and love.           O fairer than aught else    The world can show, leave off in time to grieve!    Enough, enough: your joyful look excels:          Tears kill the heart, believe.    O strive not to be excellent in woe,    Which only breeds your beauty’s overthrow.     GEORGE PEELE 1558(?)–1597   FAREWELL TO ARMS      HIS golden locks time hath to silver turned;       O time too swift!  O swiftness never ceasing!    His youth ’gainst age, and age at time, hath spurned,       But spurned in vain; youth waneth by increasing:    Beauty, strength, youth, are flowers but fading seen;    Duty, faith, love, are roots and ever green.     His helmet now shall make an hive for bees,       And lovers’ sonnets turn to holy psalms;    A man-at-arms must now serve on his knees,       And feed on prayers, that are old age’s alms:    But though from court to cottage he depart,    His saint is sure of his unspotted heart.     And when he saddest sits in homely cell,       He’ll teach his swains this carol for a song,—    ‘Blessed be the hearts that wish my sovereign well,       Cursed be the souls that think her any wrong!’    Goddess, allow this aged man his right    To be your beadsman now that was your knight.     ROBERT GREENE 1560(?)–1592   FAWNIA      AH, were she pitiful as she is fair,       Or but as mild as she is seeming so,    Then were my hopes greater than my despair,       Then all the world were heaven, nothing woe!    Ah, were her heart relenting as her hand,       That seems to melt even with the mildest touch,    Then knew I where to seat me in a land       Under wide heavens, but yet I know not such.    So as she shows, she seems the budding rose,       Yet sweeter far than is an earthly flower,    Sovereign of beauty, like the spray she grows,       Compassed she is with thorns and cankered flower;    Yet were she willing to be plucked and worn,    She would be gathered, though she grew on thorn.     Ah, when she sings, all music else be still,       For none must be compared to her note;    Ne’er breathed such glee from Philomela’s bill,       Nor from the morning-singer’s swelling throat.    Ah, when she riseth from her blissful bed,       She comforts all the world, as doth the sun,    And at her sight the night’s foul vapour’s fled;       When she is set, the gladsome day is done.    O glorious sun, imagine me thy west,    Shine in mine arms, and set thou in my breast!    SEPHESTIA’S SONG TO HER CHILD      WEEP not, my wanton, smile upon my knee,    When thou art old there’s grief enough for thee.          Mother’s wag, pretty boy,          Father’s sorrow, father’s joy;          When thy father first did see          Such a boy by him and me,          He was glad, I was woe,          Fortune changed made him so,          When he left his pretty boy          Last his sorrow, first his joy.     Weep not, my wanton, smile upon my knee,    When thou art old, there’s grief enough for thee.          Streaming tears that never stint,          Like pearl drops from a flint,          Fell by course from his eyes,          That one another’s place supplies;          Thus he grieved in every part,          Tears of blood fell from his heart,          When he left his pretty boy,          Father’s sorrow, father’s joy.     Weep not, my wanton, smile upon my knee,    When thou art old, there’s grief enough for thee.          The wanton smiled, father wept,          Mother cried, baby leapt;          More he crowed, more we cried,          Nature could not sorrow hide:          He must go, he must kiss          Child and mother, baby bless,          For he left his pretty boy,          Father’s sorrow, father’s joy.    Weep not, my wanton, smile upon my knee,    When thou art old, there’s grief enough for thee.     CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE 1562–1593   THE PASSIONATE SHEPHERD TO HIS LOVE      COME live with me and be my Love,    And we will all the pleasures prove    That hills and valleys, dale and field,    And all the craggy mountains yield.     There will we sit upon the rocks    And see the shepherds feed their flocks,    By shallow rivers, to whose falls    Melodious birds sing madrigals.     There will I make thee beds of roses    And a thousand fragrant posies,    A cap of flowers, and a kirtle    Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle.     A gown made of the finest wool,    Which from our pretty lambs we pull,    Fair lined slippers for the cold,    With buckles of the purest gold.     A belt of straw and ivy buds    With coral clasps and amber studs:    And if these pleasures may thee move,    Come live with me and be my Love.     Thy silver dishes for thy meat    As precious as the gods do eat,    Shall on an ivory table be    Prepared each day for thee and me.     The shepherd swains shall dance and sing    For thy delight each May-morning;    If these delights thy mind may move,    Then live with me and be my Love.     SAMUEL DANIEL 1562–1619   SLEEP      CARE-CHARMER Sleep, son of the sable Night,    Brother to Death, in silent darkness born,    Relieve my languish, and restore the light;    With dark forgetting of my care return.    And let the day be time enough to mourn    The shipwreck of my ill-adventured youth:    Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn,    Without the torment of the night’s untruth.    Cease, dreams, the images of day-desires,    To model forth the passions of the morrow;    Never let rising Sun approve you liars,    To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow:       Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain,       And never wake to feel the day’s disdain.    MY SPOTLESS LOVE      MY spotless love hovers with purest wings    About the temple of the proudest frame,    Where blaze those lights, fairest of earthly things,    Which clear our clouded world with brightest flame.    My ambitious thoughts, confined in her face,    Affect no honour but what she can give;    My hopes do rest in limits of her grace;    I weigh no comfort unless she relieve.    For she that can my heart imparadise,    Holds in her fairest hand what dearest is,    My fortune’s wheel’s the circle of her eyes,    Whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss!       All my life’s sweet consists in her alone;       So much I love the most Unloving One.     MICHAEL DRAYTON 1563–1631   SINCE THERE’S NO HELP      SINCE there’s no help, come let us kiss and part,—    Nay I have done, you get no more of me;    And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart,    That thus so cleanly I myself can free;    Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows,    And when we meet at any time again,    Be it not seen in either of our brows,    That we one jot of former love retain.    Now at the last gasp of love’s latest breath,    When, his pulse failing, passion speechless lies,    When faith is kneeling by his bed of death,    And innocence is closing up his eyes,       —Now if thou would’st, when all have given him over,       From death to life thou might’st him yet recover!     JOSHUA SYLVESTER 1563–1618   WERE I AS BASE      WERE I as base as is the lowly plain,    And you, my Love, as high as heaven above,    Yet should the thoughts of me your humble swain    Ascend to heaven, in honour of my Love.    Were I as high as heaven above the plain,    And you, my Love, as humble and as low    As are the deepest bottoms of the main,    Wheresoe’er you were, with you my love should go.    Were you the earth, dear Love, and I the skies,    My love should shine on you like to the sun,    And look upon you with ten thousand eyes    Till heaven waxed blind, and till the world were done.       Wheresoe’er I am, below, or else above you,       Wheresoe’er you are, my heart shall truly love you.     WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 1564–1616      POOR Soul, the centre of my sinful earth,    [Foiled by] those rebel powers that thee array,    Why dost thou pine within, and suffer dearth,    Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?    Why so large cost, having so short a lease,    Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?    Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,    Eat up thy charge? is this thy body’s end?    Then, Soul, live thou upon thy servant’s loss,    And let that pine to aggravate thy store;    Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;    Within be fed, without be rich no more:—       So shalt thou feed on death, that feeds on men,       And death once dead, there’s no more dying then.     O ME! what eyes hath Love put in my head    Which have no correspondence with true sight;    Or if they have, where is my judgment fled    That censures falsely what they see aright?    If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,    What means the world to say it is not so?    If it be not, then love doth well denote    Love’s eye is not so true as all men’s: No,    How can it?  O how can love’s eye be true,    That is so vexed with watching and with tears?    No marvel then though I mistake my view:    The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.       O cunning Love! with tears thou keep’st me blind,       Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find!     SHALL I compare thee to a summer’s day?    Thou art more lovely and more temperate:    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,    And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:    Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,    And often is his gold complexion dimmed;    And every fair from fair sometime declines,    By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed.    But thy eternal summer shall not fade    Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;    Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade,    When in eternal lines to time thou growest:—       So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,       So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.     WHEN in the chronicle of wasted time    I see descriptions of the fairest wights,    And beauty making beautiful old rhyme    In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights;    Then in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best    Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,    I see their antique pen would have exprest    Ev’n such a beauty as you master now,    So all their praises are but prophecies    Of this our time, all, you prefiguring;    And for they looked but with divining eyes,    They had not skill enough your worth to sing:       For we, which now behold these present days,       Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.     THAT time of year thou may’st in me behold    When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang    Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,    Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang:    In me thou see’st the twilight of such day    As after sunset fadeth in the west,    Which by and by black night doth take away,    Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest:    In me thou see’st the glowing of such fire    That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,    As the death-bed whereon it must expire,    Consumed with that which it was nourished by:       This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,       To love that well which thou must leave ere long.     HOW like a winter hath my absence been    From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year!    What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,    What old December’s bareness everywhere!    And yet this time removed was summer’s time:    The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,    Bearing the wanton burden of the prime    Like widowed wombs after their lord’s decease:    Yet this abundant issue seemed to me    But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;    For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,    And, thou away, the very birds are mute;       Or if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer,       That leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.     BEING your slave, what should I do but tend    Upon the hours and times of your desire?    I have no precious time at all to spend    Nor services to do, till you require:    Nor dare I chide the world-without-end-hour    Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,    Nor think the bitterness of absence sour    When you have bid your servant once adieu:    Nor dare I question with my jealous thought    Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,    But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought    Save, where you are how happy you make those;—       So true a fool is love, that in your will       Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.     WHEN in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes    I all alone beweep my outcast state,    And trouble deaf Heaven with my bootless cries,    And look upon myself and curse my fate;    Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,    Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,    Desiring this man’s heart, and that man’s scope,    With what I most enjoy contented least;    Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,    Haply I think on Thee—and then my state,    Like to the lark at break of day arising    From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven’s gate;       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings       That then I scorn to change my state with kings.     THEY that have power to hurt, and will do none,    That do not do the thing they most do show,    Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,    Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,—    They rightly do inherit heaven’s graces,    And husband nature’s riches from expense;    They are the lords and owners of their faces,    Others, but stewards of their excellence.    The summer’s flower is to the summer sweet,    Though to itself it only live and die;    But if that flower with base infection meet,    The basest weed outbraves his dignity:       For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;       Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.     FAREWELL! thou art too dear for my possessing,    And like enough thou know’st thy estimate:    The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;    My bonds in thee are all determinate.    For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?    And for that riches where is my deserving?    The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,    And so my patent back again is swerving.    Thyself thou gav’st, thy own worth then not knowing,    Or me, to whom thou gav’st it, else mistaking;    So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,    Comes home again, on better judgment making.       Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter;       In sleep, a king; but waking, no such matter.     WHEN to the sessions of sweet silent thought    I summon up remembrance of things past,    I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,    And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste;    Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,    For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,    And weep afresh love’s long-since-cancelled woe,    And moan the expense of many a vanished sight.    Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,    And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er    The sad account of fore-bemoanèd moan,    Which I new pay as if not paid before:       But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,       All losses are restored, and sorrows end.     DID not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye    ’Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,    Persuade my heart to this false perjury?    Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.    A woman I forswore; but I will prove,    Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:    My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;    Thy grace being gained cures all disgrace in me.    My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;    Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,    Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:    If broken, then it is no fault of mine.       If by me broke, what fool is not so wise       To break an oath, to win a paradise?     THE forward violet thus did I chide:    Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,    If not from my love’s breath?  The purple pride    Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells    In my love’s veins thou hast too grossly dyed.    The lily I condemned for thy hand,    And buds of marjoram had stol’n thy hair:    The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,    One blushing shame, another white despair;    A third, nor red nor white, had stol’n of both    And to his robbery had annexed thy breath;    But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth    A vengeful canker eat him up to death.       More flowers I noted, yet I none could see       But sweet or colour it had stol’n from thee.     O, LEST the world should task you to recite    What merit lived in me, that you should love    After my death, dear love, forget me quite,    For you in me can nothing worthy prove;    Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,    To do more for me than mine own desert,    And hang more praise upon deceased I    Than niggard truth would willingly impart:    O, lest your true love may seem false in this,    That you for love speak well of me untrue,    My name be buried where my body is,    And live no more to shame nor me nor you.       For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,       And so should you, to love things nothing worth.     LET me not to the marriage of true minds    Admit impediments.  Love is not love    Which alters when it alteration finds,    Or bends with the remover to remove:    O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark    That looks on tempests and is never shaken;    It is the star to every wandering bark,    Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.    Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks    Within his bending sickle’s compass come;    Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,    But bears it out even to the edge of doom.       If this be error and upon me proved,       I never writ, nor no man ever loved.     HOW oft, when thou, my music, music play’st,    Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds    With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway’st    The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,    Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap    To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,    Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,    At the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand!    To be so tickled, they would change their state    And situation with those dancing chips,    O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,    Making dead wood more blest than living lips.       Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,       Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.     FULL many a glorious morning have I seen    Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,    Kissing with golden face the meadows green,    Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;    Anon permit the basest clouds to ride    With ugly rack on his celestial face,    And from the forlorn world his visage hide,    Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:    Even so my sun one early morn did shine    With all-triumphant splendour on my brow,    But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;    The region cloud hath masked him from me now.       Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth:       Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.     THE expense of spirit in a waste of shame    Is lust in action; and till action, lust    Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,    Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,    Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,    Past reason hunted, and no sooner had    Past reason hated, as a swallow’d bait    On purpose laid to make the taker mad;    Mad in pursuit and in possession so;    Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;    A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;    Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.       All this the world well knows; yet none knows well       To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.    FANCY      TELL me where is Fancy bred,    Or in the heart, or in the head?    How begot, how nourished?          Reply, reply.     It is engendered in the eyes;    With gazing fed; and Fancy dies    In the cradle where it lies:    Let us all ring Fancy’s knell;    I’ll begin it,—Ding, dong, bell.          Ding, dong, bell.    UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE            UNDER the greenwood tree          Who loves to lie with me,          And tune his merry note          Unto the sweet bird’s throat—    Come hither, come hither, come hither!                Here shall he see                No enemy    But winter and rough weather.           Who doth ambition shun          And loves to live i’ the sun,          Seeking the food he eats          And pleased with what he gets—    Come hither, come hither, come hither!                Here shall he see                No enemy    But winter and rough weather.    FAIRIES      COME unto these yellow sands,       And then take hands:    Courtsied when you have, and kissed,       The wild waves whist,    Foot it featly here and there;    And sweet Sprites the burthen bear.          Hark, hark!             Bow-bow.          The watch-dogs bark:             Bow-wow.          Hark, hark!  I hear    The strain of strutting chanticleer          Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow!    COME AWAY         COME away, come away, Death,    And in sad cypres let me be laid;       Fly away, fly away, breath;    I am slain by a fair cruel maid.    My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,          O prepare it!    My part of death, no one so true          Did share it.        Not a flower, not a flower sweet    On my black coffin let there be strown;       Not a friend, not a friend greet    My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown;    A thousand, thousand sighs to save,          Lay me, O where    Sad true lover ne’er may find my grave          To weep there.    FULL FATHOM FIVE      FULL fathom five thy father lies;       Of his bones are coral made;    Those are pearls that were his eyes:       Nothing of him that doth fade,    But doth suffer a sea-change    Into something rich and strange.    Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:       Hark! now I hear them,—          Ding, dong, bell.    DIRGE      FEAR no more the heat o’ the sun       Nor the furious winter’s rages;    Thou thy worldly task hast done,       Home art gone and ta’en thy wages:    Golden lads and girls all must,    As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.     Fear no more the frown o’ the great,       Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke;    Care no more to clothe and eat;       To thee the reed is as the oak:    The sceptre, learning, physic, must    All follow this, and come to dust.     Fear no more the lightning-flash       Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;    Fear not slander, censure rash;       Thou hast finished joy and moan:    All lovers young, all lovers must    Consign to thee, and come to dust.    SONG      TAKE, O take those lips away    That so sweetly were forsworn,    And those eyes, the break of day,    Lights that do mislead the morn:    But my kisses bring again,          Bring again—    Seals of love, but sealed in vain,          Sealed in vain!     Hide, O hide those hills of snow,       Which thy frozen bosom bears,    On whose tops the pinks that grow       Are of those that April wears.    But first set my poor heart free    Bound in those icy chains by thee.    SONG      How should I your true love know       From another one?    By his cockle hat and staff       And his sandal shoon.     He is dead and gone, lady,       He is dead and gone;    And at his head a green grass turf       And at his heels a stone.     White his shroud as mountain snow,       Larded with sweet showers,    Which bewept to the grave did go,       With true love showers.     ANONYMOUS   TOM O’ BEDLAM      THE morn’s my constant mistress,       And the lovely owl my marrow;          The naming drake,          And the night-crow, make       Me music to my sorrow.     I know more than Apollo;       For oft when he lies sleeping,          I behold the stars          At mortal wars,       And the rounded welkin weeping.     The moon embraces her shepherd,       And the Queen of Love her warrior;          While the first does horn          The stars of the morn,       And the next the heavenly farrier.     With a heart of furious fancies,       Whereof I am commander:          With a burning spear,          And a horse of air,       To the wilderness I wander;     With a Knight of ghosts and shadows,       I summoned am to Tourney:          Ten leagues beyond          The wide world’s end;       Methinks it is no journey.     THOMAS CAMPION _Circ._ 1567–1620   KIND ARE HER ANSWERS      KIND are her answers,    But her performance keeps no day;    Breaks time, as dancers    From their own music when they stray.    All her free favours and smooth words    Wing my hopes in vain.    O, did ever voice so sweet but only feign?       Can true love yield such delay,       Converting joy to pain?        Lost is our freedom       When we submit to women so:       Why do we need ’em       When, in their best, they work our woe?       There is no wisdom       Can alter ends by fate prefixt.    O, why is the good of man with evil mixt?       Never were days yet called two       But one night went betwixt.    LAURA      ROSE-CHEEKED Laura, come;    Sing thou smoothly with thy beauty’s    Silent music, either other          Sweetly gracing.     Lovely forms do flow    From concent divinely framed;    Heaven is music, and thy beauty’s          Birth is heavenly.     These dull notes we sing    Discords need for helps to grace them,    Only beauty purely loving          Knows no discord.     But still moves delight,    Like clear springs renewed by flowing,    Ever perfect, ever in them-          Selves eternal.    HER BACKED BOWER      WHERE she her sacred bower adorns       The rivers clearly flow,    The groves and meadows swell with flowers,       The winds all gently blow.    Her sun-like beauty shines so fair,       Her spring can never fade.    Who then can blame the life that strives       To harbour in her shade?     Her grace I sought, her love I wooed;       Her love though I obtain,    No time, no toil, no vow, no faith       Her wished grace can gain.    Yet truth can tell my heart is hers       And her will I adore;    And from that love when I depart       Let heaven view me no more!     Her roses with my prayers shall spring;       And when her trees I praise,    Their boughs shall blossom, mellow fruit       Shall straw her pleasant ways.    The words of hearty zeal have power       High wonders to effect;    O, why should then her princely ear       My words or zeal neglect?     If she my faith misdeems, or worth,       Woe worth my hapless fate!    For though time can my truth reveal,       That time will come too late.    And who can glory in the worth       That cannot yield him grace?    Content in everything is not,       Nor joy in every place.     But from her Bower of Joy since I       Must now excluded be,    And she will not relieve my cares,       Which none can help but she;    My comfort in her love shall dwell,       Her love lodge in my breast,    And though not in her bower, yet I       Shall in her temple rest.    FOLLOW      FOLLOW thy fair sun, unhappy shadow,       Though thou be black as night,       And she made all of light;    Yet follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow!     Follow her whose light thy light depriveth;       Though here thou live disgraced       And she in heaven is placed;    Yet follow her whose light the world reviveth.     Follow those pure beams whose beauty burneth       That so have scorched thee       As thou still black must be,    Till her kind beams thy black to brightness turneth.     Follow her while yet her glory shineth;       There comes a luckless night       That will dim all her light;    And this the black unhappy shade divineth.     Follow still since so thy fates ordained;       The sun must have his shade,       Till both at once do fade;    The sun still proved, the shadow still disdained.    WHEN THOU MUST HOME      WHEN thou must home to shades of underground,       And there arrived, a new admired guest,    The beauteous spirits do engird thee round,       White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,    To hear the stories of thy finished love,       From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;    Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,       Of masks and revels which sweet youth did make,    Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,       And all these triumphs for thy beauties’ sake:    When thou hast told these honours done to thee,    Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murther me.    WESTERN WIND      THE peaceful western wind       The winter storms hath tamed,    And nature in each kind       The kind heat hath inflamed:    The forward buds so sweetly breathe       Out of their earthly bowers,    That heav’n, which views their pomp beneath,       Would fain be decked with flowers.     See how the morning smiles       On her bright eastern hill,    And with soft steps beguiles       Them that lie slumbering still!    The music-loving birds are come       From cliffs and rocks unknown,    To see the trees and briars bloom       That late were overflown.     What Saturn did destroy,       Love’s Queen revives again;    And now her naked boy       Doth in the fields remain,    Where he such pleasing change doth view       In every living thing,    As if the world were born anew       To gratify the Spring.     If all things life present,       Why die my comforts then?    Why suffers my content?       Am I the worst of men?    O beauty, be not thou accus’d       Too justly in this case!    Unkindly if true love be used,       ’Twill yield thee little grace.    FOLLOW YOUR SAINT         FOLLOW your saint, follow with accents sweet!       Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet!       There, wrapped in cloud of sorrow, pity move,    And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love;       But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain,    Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne’er return again.        All that I sang still to her praise did tend,       Still she was first, still she my songs did end;       Yet she my love and music both doth fly,    The music that her echo is and beauty’s sympathy.       Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight!    It shall suffice that they were breathed and died for her delight.    CHERRY-RIPE      THERE is a garden in her face       Where roses and white lilies blow;    A heavenly paradise is that place,       Wherein all pleasant fruits do grow;    There cherries grow that none may buy,    Till Cherry-Ripe themselves do cry.     Those cherries fairly do enclose       Of orient pearl a double row,    Which when her lovely laughter shows,       They look like rosebuds filled with snow:    Yet them no peer nor prince may buy,    Till Cherry-Ripe themselves do cry.     Her eyes like angels watch them still;       Her brows like bended bows do stand,    Threat’ning with piercing frowns to kill       All that approach with eye or hand    These sacred cherries to come nigh,    Till Cherry-Ripe themselves do cry!     THOMAS NASH 1567–1601   SPRING      SPRING, the sweet Spring, is the year’s pleasant king;    Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring;    Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing,    Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, tu-witta-woo.     The palm and may make country-houses gay,    Lambs frisk and play, the shepherds pipe all day,    And hear we aye birds tune this merry lay,    Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, tu-witta-woo.     The fields breathe sweet, the daisies kiss our feet,    Young lovers meet, old wives a-sunning sit;    In every street these tunes our ears do greet,    Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, tu-witta-woo.             Spring, the sweet Spring!     JOHN DONNE 1573–1631   THIS HAPPY DREAM      DEAR love, for nothing less than thee    Would I have broke this happy dream;          It was a theme    For reason, much too strong for fantasy.    Therefore thou wak’dst me wisely; yet    My dream thou brok’st not but continu’dst it:    Thou art so true, that thoughts of thee suffice    To make dreams truth, and fables histories;    Enter these arms, for since thou thought’st it best    Not to dream all my dream, let’s act the rest.     As lightning or a taper’s light,    Thine eyes, and not thy noise, waked me.          Yet I thought thee    (For thou lov’st truth) an angel at first sight;    But when I saw thou saw’st my heart,    And knew’st my thoughts beyond an angel’s art,    When thou knew’st what I dreamt, then thou knew’st when    Excess of joy would wake me, and cam’st then;    I must confess, it could not choose but be    Profane to think thee anything but thee.     Coming and staying showed thee thee,    But rising makes me doubt, that now          Thou art not thou.    That love is weak, where fear’s as strong as he;    ’Tis not all spirit, pure and brave,    If mixture it of fear, shame, honour, have.    Perchance as torches, which must ready be,    Men light and put out, so thou deal’st with me;    Thou cam’st to kindle, goest to come: then I    Will dream that hope again, but else would die.    DEATH      DEATH, be not proud, though some have called thee    Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;    For those whom thou think’st thou dost overthrow    Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.     From rest and sleep which but thy picture be,    Much pleasure, then from thee much more must flow;    And soonest our best men with thee do go,    Rest of their bones, and soul’s delivery.     Thou ’rt slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,    And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,    And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well,    And better than thy stroke.  Why swell’st thou then?     One short sleep past, we wake eternally,    And Death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.    HYMN TO GOD THE FATHER      WILT Thou forgive that sin where I begun,       Which was my sin, though it were done before?    Wilt Thou forgive that sin through which I run,       And do run still, though still I do deplore?    When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done;             For I have more.     Wilt Thou forgive that sin, which I have won       Others to sin, and made my sins their door?    Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I did shun       A year or two and wallowed in a score?    When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done;             For I have more.     I have a sin of fear, that when I’ve spun       My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;    But swear by Thyself that at my death Thy Son       Shall shine, as He shines now and heretofore.    And having done that, Thou hast done;             I fear no more.    THE FUNERAL         WHOEVER comes to shroud me, do not harm                Nor question much       That subtle wreath of hair about mine arm;       The mystery, the sign, you must not touch,                For ’tis my outward soul,       Viceroy to that which, unto heaven being gone,                Will leave this to control    And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.        But if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall                Through every part,       Can tie those parts and make me one of all;       The hairs, which upward grew, and strength and art                Have from a better brain,       Can better do’t; except she meant that I                By this should know my pain,    As prisoners are manacled when they’re condemned to die.        Whate’er she meant by’t, bury it with me;                For since I am       Love’s martyr, it might breed idolatry       If into others’ hands these relics came.                As ’twas humility       To afford to it all that a soul can do,                So ’twas some bravery    That since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.     RICHARD BARNEFIELD 1574(?)–(?)   THE NIGHTINGALE      AS it fell upon a day    In the merry month of May,    Sitting in a pleasant shade    Which a grove of myrtles made,    Beasts did leap and birds did sing,    Trees did grow and plants did spring;    Everything did banish moan    Save the Nightingale alone.    She, poor bird, as all forlorn,    Leaned her breast up-till a thorn,    And there sung the dolefull’st ditty    That to hear it was great pity.    Fie, fie, fie, now would she cry;    Teru, teru, by and by:    That to hear her so complain    Scarce I could from tears refrain;    For her griefs so lively shown    Made me think upon mine own.    —Ah, thought I, thou mourn’st in vain,    None takes pity on thy pain:    Senseless trees, they cannot hear thee,    Ruthless beasts, they will not cheer thee;    King Pandion, he is dead,    All thy friends are lapped in lead:    All thy fellow birds do sing    Careless of thy sorrowing:    Even so, poor bird, like thee    None alive will pity me.     BEN JONSON 1574–1637   CHARIS’ TRIUMPH      SEE the chariot at hand here of Love,       Wherein my lady rideth!    Each that draws is a swan or a dove,       And well the car Love guideth.    As she goes all hearts do duty                Unto her beauty;    And enamoured do wish, so they might                But enjoy such a sight,    That they still were to run by her side,    Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.     Do but look on her eyes, they do light       All that love’s world compriseth!    Do but look on her, she is bright       As love’s star when it riseth!    Do but mark, her forehead’s smoother                Than words that soothe her!    And from her arched brows, such a grace                Sheds itself through the face,    As alone there triumphs to the life    All the gain, all the good of the elements’ strife.     Have you seen but a bright lily grow       Before rude hands have touched it?    Have you marked but the fall of the snow       Before the soil hath smutched it?    Have you felt the wool of the beaver,                Or swan’s down ever?    Or have smelled o’ the bud o’ the brier?                Or the nard in the fire?    Or have tasted the bag of the bee?    O so white!  O so soft!  O so sweet is she!    JEALOUSY      WRETCHED and foolish jealousy,    How cam’st thou thus to enter me?             I ne’er was of thy kind:    Nor have I yet the narrow mind             To vent that poor desire,    That others should not warm them at my fire:             I wish the sun should shine    On all men’s fruits and flowers as well as mine.     But under the disguise of love,    Thou say’st thou only cam’st to prove             What my affections were.    Think’st thou that love is helped by fear?             Go, get thee quickly forth,    Love’s sickness and his noted want of worth,             Seek doubting men to please.    I ne’er will owe my health to a disease.    EPITAPH ON ELIZABETH L. H.      WOULDST thou hear what many say    In a little?—reader, stay.     Underneath this stone doth lie    As much beauty as could die;    Which in life did harbour give    To more virtue than doth live.    If at all she had a fault,    Leave it buried in this vault.    One name was Elizabeth,    The other, let it sleep with death:    Fitter where it died to tell    Than that it lived at all.  Farewell!    HYMN TO DIANA      QUEEN and Huntress, chaste and fair,       Now the sun is laid to sleep,    Seated in thy silver chair       State in wonted manner keep:          Hesperus entreats thy light,          Goddess excellently bright!     Earth, let not thy envious shade       Dare itself to interpose;    Cynthia’s shining orb was made       Heaven to clear when day did close:          Bless us then with wished sight,          Goddess excellently bright!     Lay thy bow of pearl apart,       And thy crystal-shining quiver;    Give unto the flying hart       Space to breathe, how short soever:          Thou that mak’st a day of night,          Goddess excellently bright!    ON MY FIRST DAUGHTER      HERE lies to each her parent’s ruth,    Mary, the daughter of their youth:    Yet all heaven’s gifts being heaven’s due,    It makes the father less to rue.    At six months’ end she parted hence    With safety of her innocence;    Whose soul Heaven’s Queen (whose name she bears),    In comfort of her mother’s tears,    Hath placed among her virgin train:    Where, while that severed doth remain,    This grave partakes the fleshly birth,    Which cover lightly, gentle earth.    ECHO’S LAMENT FOB NARCISSUS      SLOW, slow, fresh fount, keep time with my salt tears;       Yet, slower yet; O faintly, gentle springs;    List to the heavy part the music bears;       Woe weeps out her division when she sings.                Droop herbs and flowers;                Fall grief in showers,                Our beauties are not ours;                   O, I could still,    Like melting snow upon some craggy hill,                Drop, drop, drop, drop,    Since nature’s pride is now a withered daffodil.    AN EPITAPH ON SALATHIEL PAVY, A CHILD OF QUEEN ELIZABETH’S CHAPEL      WEEP with me, all you that read       This little story;    And know, for whom a tear you shed       Death’s self is sorry.    It was a child that so did thrive       In grace and feature,    As Heaven and Nature seemed to strive       Which owned the creature.    Years he numbered scarce thirteen       When fates turned cruel,    Yet three filled zodiacs had he been       The stage’s jewel;    And did act (what now we moan)       Old men so duly,    Ah, sooth, the Parcae thought him one—       He played so truly.    So by error to his fate       They all consented,    But viewing him since, alas, too late       They have repented;    And have sought, to give new birth,       In baths to steep him;    But being much too good for earth,       Heaven vows to keep him.     JOHN FLETCHER 1579–1625   INVOCATION TO SLEEP, FROM VALENTINIAN      CARE-CHARMING Sleep, thou easer of all woes,    Brother to Death, sweetly thyself dispose    On this afflicted prince; fall like a cloud    In gentle showers; give nothing that is loud    Or painful to his slumbers;—easy, sweet,    And as a purling stream, thou son of Night,    Pass by his troubled senses; sing his pain    Like hollow murmuring wind or silver rain;    Into this prince gently, oh, gently slide    And kiss him into slumbers like a bride!    TO BACCHUS      GOD LYÆUS, ever young,    Ever honoured, ever sung;    Stained with blood of lusty grapes    In a thousand lusty shapes;    Dance upon the mazer’s brim,    In the crimson liquor swim;    From thy plenteous hand divine,    Let a river run with wine:       God of Youth, let this day here       Enter neither care nor fear.     JOHN WEBSTER (?)–1625   SONG FROM THE DUCHESS OF MALFI      HARK, now everything is still,    The screech-owl and the whistler shrill    Call upon our dame aloud,    And bid her quickly don her shroud:     Much you had of land and rent,    Your length in clay’s now competent;    A long war disturbed your mind,    Here your perfect peace is signed.    Of what is’t fools make such vain keeping?    Sin their conception, their birth weeping,    Their life a general mist of error,    Their death a hideous storm of terror.    Strew your hair with powders sweet,    Don clean linen, bathe your feet,    And (the foul fiend more to check)    A crucifix let bless your neck;    ’Tis now full tide ’tween night and day;    End your groan and come away.    SONG FROM THE DEVIL’S LAW-CASE      ALL the flowers of the spring    Meet to perfume our burying;    These have but their growing prime,    And man does flourish but his time.    Survey our progress from our birth;    We’re set, we grow, we turn to earth,    Courts adieu, and all delights,    All bewitching appetites!    Sweetest breath and clearest eye,    Like perfumes, go out and die;    And consequently this is done    As shadows wait upon the sun.    Vain the ambition of kings    Who seek by trophies and dead things    To leave a living name behind,    And weave but nets to catch the wind.    IN EARTH, DIRGE FROM VITTORIA COROMBONA      CALL for the robin-redbreast and the wren,    Since o’er shady groves they hover,    And with leaves and flowers do cover    The friendless bodies of unburied men.    Call unto his funeral dole    The ant, the field-mouse, and the mole    To rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm    And (when gay tombs are robbed) sustain no harm;    But keep the wolf far thence, that’s foe to men,    For with his nails he’ll dig them up again.     WILLIAM DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN 1585–1649   SONG      PHŒBUS, arise!    And paint the sable skies    With azure, white, and red:    Rouse Memnon’s mother from her Tithon’s bed    That she thy càreer may with roses spread:    The nightingales thy coming each-where sing:    Make an eternal Spring!    Give life to this dark world which lieth dead;    Spread forth thy golden hair    In larger locks than thou wast wont before,    And emperor-like decore    With diadem of pearl thy temples fair:    Chase hence the ugly night    Which serves but to make dear thy glorious light.     This is that happy morn,    That day, long-wished day    Of all my life so dark    (If cruel stars have not my ruin sworn    And fates not hope betray),    Which, purely white, deserves    An everlasting diamond should it mark.    This is the morn should bring unto this grove    My Love, to hear and recompense my love.    Fair king, who all preserves,    But show thy blushing beams,    And thou two sweeter eyes    Shalt see than those which by Peneus’ streams    Did once thy heart surprise.    Nay, suns, which shine as clear    As thou, when two thou didst to Rome appear.    Now, Flora, deck thyself in fairest guise:    If that ye winds would hear    A voice surpassing far Amphion’s lyre,    Your stormy chiding stay;    Let Zephyr only breathe,    And with her tresses play,    Kissing sometimes these purple ports of death.    —The winds all silent are,    And Phœbus in his chair    Ensaffroning sea and air    Makes vanish every star:    Night like a drunkard reels    Beyond the hills, to shun his flaming wheels:    The fields with flowers are decked in every hue,    The clouds with orient gold spangle their blue;    Here is the pleasant place—    And nothing wanting is, save She, alas!    SLEEP, SILENCE’ CHILD      SLEEP, Silence’ child, sweet father of soft rest,    Prince, whose approach peace to all mortals brings,    Indifferent host to shepherds and to kings,    Sole comforter of minds with grief oppressed;    Lo, by thy charming rod all breathing things    Lie slumb’ring, with forgetfulness possessed,    And yet o’er me to spread thy drowsy wings    Thou sparest, alas! who cannot be thy guest.    Since I am thine, O come, but with that face    To inward light which thou art wont to show;    With feigned solace ease a true-felt woe;    Or if, deaf god, thou do deny that grace,       Come as thou wilt, and what thou wilt bequeath:       I long to kiss the image of my death.    TO THE NIGHTINGALE      DEAR chorister, who from these shadows sends,    Ere that the blushing morn dare show her light,    Such sad lamenting strains, that night attends,    Become all ear, stars stay to hear thy plight:    If one whose grief even reach of thought transcends,    Who ne’er, not in a dream, did taste delight,    May thee importune who like care pretends,    And seems to joy in woe, in woe’s despite;    Tell me (so may thou fortune milder try,    And long, long sing) for what thou thus complains,    Sith, winter gone, the sun in dappled sky    Now smiles on meadows, mountains, woods, and plains?       The bird, as if my question did her move,       With trembling wings sobbed forth, ‘I love!  I love!’    MADRIGAL I         LIKE the Idalian queen,       Her hair about her eyne,    With neck and breast’s ripe apples to be seen,       At first glance of the morn,    In Cyprus’ gardens gathering those fair flowers       Which of her blood were born,    I saw, but fainting saw, my paramours.    The graces naked danced about the place,       The winds and trees amazed       With silence on her gazed;    The flowers did smile, like those upon her face,    And as their aspen stalks those fingers band,       That she might read my case    A hyacinth I wished me in her hand.    MADRIGAL II         THE beauty and the life    Of life’s and beauty’s fairest paragon,    O tears!  O grief! hung at a feeble thread    To which pale Atropos had set her knife;       The soul with many a groan       Had left each outward part,    And now did take its last leave of the heart;    Nought else did want, save death, even to be dead;    When the afflicted band about her bed,    Seeing so fair him come in lips, cheeks, eyes,    Cried, ‘Ah! and can death enter paradise?’     BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER 1586–1616 AND 1579–1625   I DIED TRUE      LAY a garland on my hearse       Of the dismal yew;    Maidens willow branches bear;       Say, I die true.     My love was false, but I was firm       From my hour of birth.    Upon my buried body lie       Lightly, gentle earth.     FRANCIS BEAUMONT 1586–1616   ON THE TOMBS IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY      MORTALITY, behold and fear!    What a change of flesh is here!    Think how many royal bones    Sleep within these heaps of stones;    Here they lie, had realms and lands,    Who now want strength to stir their hands;    Where from their pulpits sealed with dust    They preach, ‘In greatness is no trust.’    Here’s an acre sown indeed    With the richest royallest seed    That the earth did e’er suck in    Since the first man died for sin:    Here the bones of birth have cried,    ‘Though gods they were, as men they died!’    Here are sands, ignoble things,    Dropt from the ruined sides of kings:    Here’s a world of pomp and state    Buried in dust, once dead by fate.     SIR FRANCIS KYNASTON 1587–1642   TO CYNTHIA, ON CONCEALMENT OF HER BEAUTY      DO not conceal those radiant eyes,    The starlight of serenest skies;    Lest, wanting of their heavenly light,    They turn to chaos’ endless night!     Do not conceal those tresses fair,    The silken snares of thy curled hair    Lest, finding neither gold nor ore,    The curious silk-worm work no more.     Do not conceal those breasts of thine,    More snow-white than the Apennine;    Lest, if there be like cold and frost,    The lily be for ever lost.     Do not conceal that fragrant scent,    Thy breath, which to all flowers hath lent    Perfumes; lest, it being supprest,    No spices grow in all the rest.     Do not conceal thy heavenly voice,    Which makes the hearts of gods rejoice;    Lest, music hearing no such thing,    The nightingale forget to sing.     Do not conceal, nor yet eclipse,    Thy pearly teeth with coral lips;    Lest that the seas cease to bring forth    Gems which from thee have all thy worth.     Do not conceal no beauty, grace,    That’s either in thy mind or face;    Lest virtue overcome by vice    Make men believe no Paradise.     NATHANIEL FIELD 1587–1638   MATIN SONG      RISE, Lady Mistress, rise!       The night hath tedious been;    No sleep hath fallen into mine eyes       Nor slumbers made me sin.    Is not she a saint then, say,    Thoughts of whom keep sin away?     Rise, Madam! rise and give me light,       Whom darkness still will cover,    And ignorance, darker than night,       Till thou smile on thy lover.    All want day till thy beauty rise;    For the grey morn breaks from thine eyes.     GEORGE WITHER 1588–1667   SLEEP, BABY, SLEEP!      SLEEP, baby, sleep! what ails my dear,       What ails my darling thus to cry?    Be still, my child, and lend thine ear,       To hear me sing thy lullaby.    My pretty lamb, forbear to weep;    Be still, my dear; sweet baby, sleep.     Thou blessed soul, what canst thou fear?       What thing to thee can mischief do?    Thy God is now thy father dear,       His holy Spouse thy mother too.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     Though thy conception was in sin,       A sacred bathing thou hast had;    And though thy birth unclean hath been,       A blameless babe thou now art made.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     While thus thy lullaby I sing,       For thee great blessings ripening be;    Thine Eldest Brother is a king,       And hath a kingdom bought for thee.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     Sweet baby, sleep, and nothing fear;       For whosoever thee offends    By thy protector threaten’d are,       And God and angels are thy friends.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     When God with us was dwelling here,       In little babes He took delight;    Such innocents as thou, my dear,       Are ever precious in His sight.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     A little infant once was He;       And strength in weakness then was laid    Upon His Virgin Mother’s knee,       That power to thee might be convey’d.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     In this thy frailty and thy need       He friends and helpers doth prepare,    Which thee shall cherish, clothe, and feed,       For of thy weal they tender are.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     The King of kings, when He was born,       Had not so much for outward ease;    By Him such dressings were not worn,       Nor such like swaddling-clothes as these.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     Within a manger lodged thy Lord,       Where oxen lay and asses fed:    Warm rooms we do to thee afford,       An easy cradle or a bed.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     The wants that He did then sustain       Have purchased wealth, my babe, for thee;    And by His torments and His pain       Thy rest and ease secured be.    My baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     Thou hast, yet more, to perfect this,       A promise and an earnest got    Of gaining everlasting bliss,       Though thou, my babe, perceiv’st it not.    Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;    Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.     THOMAS CAREW 1589–1639   SONG      ASK me no more where Jove bestows,    When June is past, the fading rose;    For in your beauties, orient deep,    These flowers, as in their causes, sleep.     Ask me no more whither do stray    The golden atoms of the day;    For in pure love heaven did prepare    Those powders to enrich your hair.     Ask me no more whither doth haste    The nightingale when May is past;    For in your sweet dividing throat    She winters, and keeps warm her note.     Ask me no more if east or west    The phœnix builds her spicy nest;    For unto you at last she flies,    And in your fragrant bosom dies!    TO MY INCONSTANT MISTRESS      WHEN thou, poor Excommunicate       From all the joys of Love, shalt see    The full reward and glorious fate       Which my strong faith shall purchase me,       Then curse thine own Inconstancy.     A fairer hand than thine shall cure       That heart which thy false oaths did wound;    And to my soul a soul more pure       Than thine shall by Love’s hand be bound,       And both with equal glory crowned.     Then shalt thou weep, entreat, complain       To Love, as I did once to thee:    When all thy tears shall be as vain       As mine were then: for thou shalt be       Damned for thy false Apostacy.    AN HYMENEAL DIALOGUE      _Groom_.—TELL me, my Love, since Hymen tied       The holy knot, hast thou not felt    A new-infused spirit slide       Into thy breast, whilst mine did melt?     _Bride_.—First tell me, Sweet, whose words were those?       For though your voice the air did break,    Yet did my soul the sense compose,       And through your lips my heart did speak.     _Groom_.—Then I perceive, when from the flame       Of love my scorched soul did retire,    Your frozen heart in that place came,       And sweetly melted in that fire.     _Bride_.—’Tis true, for when that mutual change       Of souls was made, with equal gain,    I straight might feel diffused a strange       But gentle heat through every vein.     _Bride_.—Thy bosom then I’ll make my nest,       Since there my willing soul doth perch.    _Groom_.—And for my heart, in thy chaste breast,       I’ll make an everlasting search.     O blest disunion, that doth so       Our bodies from our souls divide;    As two to one, and one four grow,       Each by contraction multiplied.    INGRATEFUL BEAUTY THREATENED      KNOW, Celia (since thou art so proud),       ’Twas I that gave thee thy renown!    Thou hadst in the forgotten crowd       Of common beauties lived unknown,    Had not my verse exhaled thy name,    And with it imped the wings of fame.     That killing power is none of thine;       I gave it to thy voice and eyes;    Thy sweets, thy graces, all are mine;       Thou art my star, shin’st in my skies;    Then dart not from thy borrowed sphere    Lightning on him that fixed thee there.     Tempt me with such affrights no more,       Lest what I made I uncreate!    Let fools thy mystic forms adore;       I’ll know thee in thy mortal state.    Wise poets, that wrapped the truth in tales,    Knew her themselves through all her veils.     THOMAS DEKKER _Circa_ 1570–1641   LULLABY      GOLDEN slumbers kiss your eyes,    Smiles awake you when you rise.    Sleep, pretty wantons, do not cry,    And I will sing a lullaby.    Bock them, rock a lullaby.     Care is heavy, therefore sleep you,    You are care, and care must keep you.    Sleep, pretty wantons, do not cry,    And I will sing a lullaby.    Rock them, rock a lullaby.    SWEET CONTENT      ART thou poor, yet hast thou golden slumbers?             O sweet content!    Art thou rich, yet is thy mind perplexed?             O punishment!    Dost thou laugh to see how fools are vexed    To add to golden numbers, golden numbers?    O sweet content!  O sweet, O sweet content!       Work apace, apace, apace, apace;       Honest labour bears a lovely face;       Then hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny!     Canst drink the waters of the crisped spring?       O sweet content!    Swimm’st thou in wealth, yet sink’st in thine own tears?       O punishment!    Then he that patiently want’s burden bears    No burden bears, but is a king, a king!    O sweet content!  O sweet, O sweet content!       Work apace, apace, apace, apace;       Honest labour bears a lovely face;       Then hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny!     THOMAS HEYWOOD —1649?   GOOD-MORROW      PACK, clouds, away, and welcome day,       With night we banish sorrow;    Sweet air blow soft, mount larks aloft       To give my Love good-morrow!    Wings from the wind to please her mind,       Notes from the lark I’ll borrow;    Bird, prune thy wing, nightingale sing,       To give my Love good-morrow;       To give my Love good-morrow,       Notes from them both I’ll borrow.     Wake from thy nest, Robin-redbreast,       Sing, birds, in every furrow;    And from each hill, let music shrill       Give my fair Love good-morrow!    Blackbird and thrush in every bush,       Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow!    You pretty elves, amongst yourselves,       Sing my fair Love good-morrow;       To give my Love good-morrow       Sing, birds, in every furrow!     ROBERT HERRICK 1591–1674   TO DIANEME      SWEET, be not proud of those two eyes    Which star-like sparkle in their skies;    Nor be you proud, that you can see    All hearts your captives; yours yet free.    Be you not proud of that rich hair    Which wantons with the love-sick air;    Whenas that ruby which you wear,    Sunk from the tip of your soft ear,    Will last to be a precious stone    When all your world of beauty’s gone.    TO MEADOWS      YE have been fresh and green,       Ye have been filled with flowers;    And ye the walks have been       Where maids have spent their hours.     Ye have beheld how they       With wicker arks did come    To kiss and bear away       The richer cowslips home.     You’ve heard them sweetly sing,       And seen them in a round,    Each virgin, like a Spring,       With honeysuckles crowned.     But now we see none here       Whose silvery feet did tread,    And with dishevelled hair       Adorned this smoother mead.     Like unthrifts, having spent       Your stock, and needy grown,    You’re left here to lament       Your poor estates alone.    TO BLOSSOMS      FAIR pledges of a fruitful tree,       Why do ye fall so fast?       Your date is not so past,    But you may stay yet here awhile       To blush and gently smile,          And go at last.     What, were ye born to be       An hour or half’s delight,       And so to bid good-night?    ’Twas pity Nature brought ye forth       Merely to show your worth,          And lose you quite!     But you are lovely leaves, where we       May read how soon things have       Their end, though ne’er so brave:    And after they have shown their pride       Like you, awhile, they glide          Into the grave.    TO DAFFODILS      FAIR Daffodils, we weep to see       You haste away so soon:    As yet the early-rising Sun       Has not attained his noon.             Stay, stay,       Until the hasting day             Has run       But to the even-song;    And, having prayed together, we       Will go with you along.     We
