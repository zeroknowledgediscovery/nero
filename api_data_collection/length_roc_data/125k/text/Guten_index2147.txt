And, to signify that       peculiar musical quality of Poe’s genius which inthralls every       reader, Mr. Lowell suggested this additional verse, from the       “Haunted Palace”:     And all with pearl and ruby glowing     Was the fair palace door,    Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,     And sparkling ever more,    A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty     Was but to sing,    In voices of surpassing beauty,     The wit and wisdom of their king.        Born in poverty at Boston, January 19, 1809, dying under painful       circumstances at Baltimore, October 7, 1849, his whole literary       career of scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere       subsistence, his memory malignantly misrepresented by his       earliest biographer, Griswold, how completely has truth at last       routed falsehood and how magnificently has Poe come into his own.       For “The Raven,” first published in 1845, and, within a few       months, read, recited and parodied wherever the English language       was spoken, the half-starved poet received $10! Less than a year       later his brother poet, N. P. Willis, issued this touching appeal       to the admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author, his       dying wife and her devoted mother, then living under very       straitened circumstances in a little cottage at Fordham, N. Y.:        “Here is one of the finest scholars, one of the most original men       of genius, and one of the most industrious of the literary       profession of our country, whose temporary suspension of labor,       from bodily illness, drops him immediately to a level with the       common objects of public charity. There is no intermediate       stopping-place, no respectful shelter, where, with the delicacy       due to genius and culture, he might secure aid, till, with       returning health, he would resume his labors, and his unmortified       sense of independence.”        And this was the tribute paid by the American public to the       master who had given to it such tales of conjuring charm, of       witchery and mystery as “The Fall of the House of Usher” and       “Ligeia”; such fascinating hoaxes as “The Unparalleled Adventure       of Hans Pfaall,” “MSS. Found in a Bottle,” “A Descent Into a       Maelstrom” and “The Balloon-Hoax”; such tales of conscience as       “William Wilson,” “The Black Cat” and “The Tell-tale Heart,”       wherein the retributions of remorse are portrayed with an awful       fidelity; such tales of natural beauty as “The Island of the Fay”       and “The Domain of Arnheim”; such marvellous studies in       ratiocination as the “Gold-bug,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,”       “The Purloined Letter” and “The Mystery of Marie Roget,” the       latter, a recital of fact, demonstrating the author’s wonderful       capability of correctly analyzing the mysteries of the human       mind; such tales of illusion and banter as “The Premature Burial”       and “The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether”; such bits of       extravaganza as “The Devil in the Belfry” and “The Angel of the       Odd”; such tales of adventure as “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon       Pym”; such papers of keen criticism and review as won for Poe the       enthusiastic admiration of Charles Dickens, although they made       him many enemies among the over-puffed minor American writers so       mercilessly exposed by him; such poems of beauty and melody as       “The Bells,” “The Haunted Palace,” “Tamerlane,” “The City in the       Sea” and “The Raven.” What delight for the jaded senses of the       reader is this enchanted domain of wonder-pieces! What an       atmosphere of beauty, music, color! What resources of       imagination, construction, analysis and absolute art! One might       almost sympathize with Sarah Helen Whitman, who, confessing to a       half faith in the old superstition of the significance of       anagrams, found, in the transposed letters of Edgar Poe’s name,       the words “a God-peer.” His mind, she says, was indeed a “Haunted       Palace,” echoing to the footfalls of angels and demons.        “No man,” Poe himself wrote, “has recorded, no man has dared to       record, the wonders of his inner life.”        In these twentieth century days—of lavish recognition—artistic,       popular and material—of genius, what rewards might not a Poe       claim!        Edgar’s father, a son of General David Poe, the American       revolutionary patriot and friend of Lafayette, had married Mrs.       Hopkins, an English actress, and, the match meeting with parental       disapproval, had himself taken to the stage as a profession.       Notwithstanding Mrs. Poe’s beauty and talent the young couple had       a sorry struggle for existence. When Edgar, at the age of two       years, was orphaned, the family was in the utmost destitution.       Apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the world homeless       and friendless. But fate decreed that a few glimmers of sunshine       were to illumine his life, for the little fellow was adopted by       John Allan, a wealthy merchant of Richmond, Va. A brother and       sister, the remaining children, were cared for by others.        In his new home Edgar found all the luxury and advantages money       could provide. He was petted, spoiled and shown off to strangers.       In Mrs. Allan he found all the affection a childless wife could       bestow. Mr. Allan took much pride in the captivating, precocious       lad. At the age of five the boy recited, with fine effect,       passages of English poetry to the visitors at the Allan house.        From his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the Manor       House school, at Stoke-Newington, a suburb of London. It was the       Rev. Dr. Bransby, head of the school, whom Poe so quaintly       portrayed in “William Wilson.” Returning to Richmond in 1820       Edgar was sent to the school of Professor Joseph H. Clarke. He       proved an apt pupil. Years afterward Professor Clarke thus wrote:        “While the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses, Poe wrote       genuine poetry; the boy was a born poet. As a scholar he was       ambitious to excel. He was remarkable for self-respect, without       haughtiness. He had a sensitive and tender heart and would do       anything for a friend. His nature was entirely free from       selfishness.”        At the age of seventeen Poe entered the University of Virginia at       Charlottesville. He left that institution after one session.       Official records prove that he was not expelled. On the contrary,       he gained a creditable record as a student, although it is       admitted that he contracted debts and had “an ungovernable       passion for card-playing.” These debts may have led to his       quarrel with Mr. Allan which eventually compelled him to make his       own way in the world.        Early in 1827 Poe made his first literary venture. He induced       Calvin Thomas, a poor and youthful printer, to publish a small       volume of his verses under the title “Tamerlane and Other Poems.”       In 1829 we find Poe in Baltimore with another manuscript volume       of verses, which was soon published. Its title was “Al Aaraaf,       Tamerlane and Other Poems.” Neither of these ventures seems to       have attracted much attention.        Soon after Mrs. Allan’s death, which occurred in 1829, Poe,       through the aid of Mr. Allan, secured admission to the United       States Military Academy at West Point. Any glamour which may have       attached to cadet life in Poe’s eyes was speedily lost, for       discipline at West Point was never so severe nor were the       accommodations ever so poor. Poe’s bent was more and more toward       literature. Life at the academy daily became increasingly       distasteful. Soon he began to purposely neglect his studies and       to disregard his duties, his aim being to secure his dismissal       from the United States service. In this he succeeded. On March 7,       1831, Poe found himself free. Mr. Allan’s second marriage had       thrown the lad on his own resources. His literary career was to       begin.        Poe’s first genuine victory was won in 1833, when he was the       successful competitor for a prize of $100 offered by a Baltimore       periodical for the best prose story. “A MSS. Found in a Bottle”       was the winning tale. Poe had submitted six stories in a volume.       “Our only difficulty,” says Mr. Latrobe, one of the judges, “was       in selecting from the rich contents of the volume.”        During the fifteen years of his literary life Poe was connected       with various newspapers and magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia       and New York. He was faithful, punctual, industrious, thorough.       N. P. Willis, who for some time employed Poe as critic and       sub-editor on the “Evening Mirror,” wrote thus:        “With the highest admiration for Poe’s genius, and a willingness       to let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led       by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his       duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time       went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious.       We saw but one presentiment of the man—a quiet, patient,       industrious and most gentlemanly person.        “We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be stated in       all mention of his lamentable irregularities), that with a single       glass of wine his whole nature was reversed, the demon became       uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs of intoxication       were visible, his will was palpably insane. In this reversed       character, we repeat, it was never our chance to meet him.”        On September 22, 1835, Poe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in       Baltimore. She had barely turned thirteen years, Poe himself was       but twenty-six. He then was a resident of Richmond and a regular       contributor to the “Southern Literary Messenger.” It was not       until a year later that the bride and her widowed mother followed       him thither.        Poe’s devotion to his child-wife was one of the most beautiful       features of his life. Many of his famous poetic productions were       inspired by her beauty and charm. Consumption had marked her for       its victim, and the constant efforts of husband and mother were       to secure for her all the comfort and happiness their slender       means permitted. Virginia died January 30, 1847, when but       twenty-five years of age. A friend of the family pictures the       death-bed scene—mother and husband trying to impart warmth to her       by chafing her hands and her feet, while her pet cat was suffered       to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth.        These verses from “Annabel Lee,” written by Poe in 1849, the last       year of his life, tell of his sorrow at the loss of his       child-wife:       _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,     In a kingdom by the sea;      But we loved with a love that was more than love—     I and my Annabel Lee;      With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven     Coveted her and me.      And this was the reason that, long ago,     In this kingdom by the sea.      A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling     My beautiful Annabel Lee;      So that her high-born kinsmen came     And bore her away from me,      To shut her up in a sepulchre     In this kingdom by the sea.        Poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with       the “Southern Literary Messenger” in Richmond, Va.; “Graham’s       Magazine” and the “Gentleman’s Magazine” in Philadelphia; the       “Evening Mirror,” the “Broadway Journal,” and “Godey’s Lady’s       Book” in New York. Everywhere Poe’s life was one of unremitting       toil. No tales and poems were ever produced at a greater cost of       brain and spirit.        Poe’s initial salary with the “Southern Literary Messenger,” to       which he contributed the first drafts of a number of his       best-known tales, was $10 a week! Two years later his salary was       but $600 a year. Even in 1844, when his literary reputation was       established securely, he wrote to a friend expressing his       pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute had       agreed to pay him $20 monthly for two pages of criticism.        Those were discouraging times in American literature, but Poe       never lost faith. He was finally to triumph wherever pre-eminent       talents win admirers. His genius has had no better description       than in this stanza from William Winter’s poem, read at the       dedication exercises of the Actors’ Monument to Poe, May 4, 1885,       in New York:       He was the voice of beauty and of woe,      Passion and mystery and the dread unknown;      Pure as the mountains of perpetual snow,      Cold as the icy winds that round them moan,      Dark as the caves wherein earth’s thunders groan,      Wild as the tempests of the upper sky,      Sweet as the faint, far-off celestial tone of angel whispers,      fluttering from on high,      And tender as love’s tear when youth and beauty die.        In the two and a half score years that have elapsed since Poe’s       death he has come fully into his own. For a while Griswold’s       malignant misrepresentations colored the public estimate of Poe       as man and as writer. But, thanks to J. H. Ingram, W. F. Gill,       Eugene Didier, Sarah Helen Whitman and others these scandals have       been dispelled and Poe is seen as he actually was—not as a man       without failings, it is true, but as the finest and most original       genius in American letters. As the years go on his fame       increases. His works have been translated into many foreign       languages. His is a household name in France and England—in fact,       the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that Poe’s own       country has been slow to appreciate him. But that reproach, if it       ever was warranted, certainly is untrue.  W. H. R.     EDGAR ALLAN POE   By James Russell Lowell        The situation of American literature is anomalous. It has no       centre, or, if it have, it is like that of the sphere of Hermes.       It is divided into many systems, each revolving round its several       suns, and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of       a milk-and-water way. Our capital city, unlike London or Paris,       is not a great central heart from which life and vigor radiate to       the extremities, but resembles more an isolated umbilicus stuck       down as near as may be to the centre of the land, and seeming       rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any       present need. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, each has its       literature almost more distinct than those of the different       dialects of Germany; and the Young Queen of the West has also one       of her own, of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us       dwellers by the Atlantic.        Perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism       of contemporary literature. It is even more grateful to give       praise where it is needed than where it is deserved, and       friendship so often seduces the iron stylus of justice into a       vague flourish, that she writes what seems rather like an epitaph       than a criticism. Yet if praise be given as an alms, we could not       drop so poisonous a one into any man’s hat. The critic’s ink may       suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or of       sugar. But it is easier to be generous than to be just, and we       might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding       place of truth, did we judge from the amount of water which we       usually find mixed with it.        Remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of       imaginative men, but Mr. Poe’s biography displays a vicissitude       and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with. The       offspring of a romantic marriage, and left an orphan at an early       age, he was adopted by Mr. Allan, a wealthy Virginian, whose       barren marriage-bed seemed the warranty of a large estate to the       young poet.        Having received a classical education in England, he returned       home and entered the University of Virginia, where, after an       extravagant course, followed by reformation at the last       extremity, he was graduated with the highest honors of his class.       Then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the insurgent       Greeks, which ended at St. Petersburg, where he got into       difficulties through want of a passport, from which he was       rescued by the American consul and sent home. He now entered the       military academy at West Point, from which he obtained a       dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father,       by a second marriage, an event which cut off his expectations as       an heir. The death of Mr. Allan, in whose will his name was not       mentioned, soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard,       and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support.       Previously to this, however, he had published (in 1827) a small       volume of poems, which soon ran through three editions, and       excited high expectations of its author’s future distinction in       the minds of many competent judges.        That no certain augury can be drawn from a poet’s earliest       lispings there are instances enough to prove. Shakespeare’s first       poems, though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness,       give but a very faint promise of the directness, condensation and       overflowing moral of his maturer works. Perhaps, however,       Shakespeare is hardly a case in point, his “Venus and Adonis”       having been published, we believe, in his twenty-sixth year.       Milton’s Latin verses show tenderness, a fine eye for nature, and       a delicate appreciation of classic models, but give no hint of       the author of a new style in poetry. Pope’s youthful pieces have       all the sing-song, wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity       and eloquent irreligion of his later productions. Collins’ callow       namby-pamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original       genius which he afterward displayed. We have never thought that       the world lost more in the “marvellous boy,” Chatterton, than a       very ingenious imitator of obscure and antiquated dulness. Where       he becomes original (as it is called), the interest of ingenuity       ceases and he becomes stupid. Kirke White’s promises were       indorsed by the respectable name of Mr. Southey, but surely with       no authority from Apollo. They have the merit of a traditional       piety, which to our mind, if uttered at all, had been less       objectionable in the retired closet of a diary, and in the sober       raiment of prose. They do not clutch hold of the memory with the       drowning pertinacity of Watts; neither have they the interest of       his occasional simple, lucky beauty. Burns having fortunately       been rescued by his humble station from the contaminating society       of the “Best models,” wrote well and naturally from the first.       Had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste, we       should have had a series of poems from which, as from his       letters, we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of       chaff. Coleridge’s youthful efforts give no promise whatever of       that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest,       tenderest, most original and most purely imaginative poems of       modern times. Byron’s “Hours of Idleness” would never find a       reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity. In       Wordsworth’s first preludings there is but a dim foreboding of       the creator of an era. From Southey’s early poems, a safer augury       might have been drawn. They show the patient investigator, the       close student of history, and the unwearied explorer of the       beauties of predecessors, but they give no assurances of a man       who should add aught to stock of household words, or to the rarer       and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor. The       earliest specimens of Shelley’s poetic mind already, also, give       tokens of that ethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to       soar above the regions of words, but leaves its body, the verse,       to be entombed, without hope of resurrection, in a mass of them.       Cowley is generally instanced as a wonder of precocity. But his       early insipidities show only a capacity for rhyming and for the       metrical arrangement of certain conventional combinations of       words, a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical       organization, and an unhappy memory. An early poem is only       remarkable when it displays an effort of _reason,_ and the rudest       verses in which we can trace some conception of the ends of       poetry, are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile       versification. A school-boy, one would say, might acquire the       regular see-saw of Pope merely by an association with the motion       of the play-ground tilt.        Mr. Poe’s early productions show that he could see through the       verse to the spirit beneath, and that he already had a feeling       that all the life and grace of the one must depend on and be       modulated by the will of the other. We call them the most       remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read. We know of none       that can compare with them for maturity of purpose, and a nice       understanding of the effects of language and metre. Such pieces       are only valuable when they display what we can only express by       the contradictory phrase of _innate experience._ We copy one of       the shorter poems, written when the author was only fourteen.       There is a little dimness in the filling up, but the grace and       symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain. There       is a smack of ambrosia about it.       TO HELEN  Helen, thy beauty is to me     Like those Nicean barks of yore, That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,     The weary, way-worn wanderer bore To his own native shore.  On desperate seas long wont to roam,     Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home     To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome.  Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche     How statue-like I see thee stand! The agate lamp within thy hand,     Ah! Psyche, from the regions which Are Holy Land!        It is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us. Here is       no “withering scorn,” no heart “blighted” ere it has safely got       into its teens, none of the drawing-room sansculottism which       Byron had brought into vogue. All is limpid and serene, with a       pleasant dash of the Greek Helicon in it. The melody of the       whole, too, is remarkable. It is not of that kind which can be       demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of the fingers. It is       of that finer sort which the inner ear alone _can_ estimate. It       seems simple, like a Greek column, because of its perfection. In       a poem named “Ligeia,” under which title he intended to personify       the music of nature, our boy-poet gives us the following       exquisite picture:      Ligeia! Ligeia! My beautiful one,     Whose harshest idea Will to melody run,     Say, is it thy will, On the breezes to toss,     Or, capriciously still, Like the lone albatross,     Incumbent on night, As she on the air,     To keep watch with delight On the harmony there?        John Neal, himself a man of genius, and whose lyre has been too       long capriciously silent, appreciated the high merit of these and       similar passages, and drew a proud horoscope for their author.        Mr. Poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to       call _genius_. No man could ever tell us precisely what it is,       and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence       and its power. Let talent writhe and contort itself as it may, it       has no such magnetism. Larger of bone and sinew it may be, but       the wings are wanting. Talent sticks fast to earth, and its most       perfect works have still one foot of clay. Genius claims kindred       with the very workings of Nature herself, so that a sunset shall       seem like a quotation from Dante, and if Shakespeare be read in       the very presence of the sea itself, his verses shall but seem       nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean. Talent may make       friends for itself, but only genius can give to its creations the       divine power of winning love and veneration. Enthusiasm cannot       cling to what itself is unenthusiastic, nor will he ever have       disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a       disciple. Great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they       are possessed and carried away by their demon, while talent keeps       him, as Paracelsus did, securely prisoned in the pommel of his       sword. To the eye of genius, the veil of the spiritual world is       ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and       evil who throng continually around it. No man of mere talent ever       flung his inkstand at the devil.        When we say that Mr. Poe had genius, we do not mean to say that       he has produced evidence of the highest. But to say that he       possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal, industry,       and a reverence for the trust reposed in him, to achieve the       proudest triumphs and the greenest laurels. If we may believe the       Longinuses and Aristotles of our newspapers, we have quite too       many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them       at all desirable, whether for its hardness of attainment or its       seclusion. The highest peak of our Parnassus is, according to       these gentlemen, by far the most thickly settled portion of the       country, a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable       residence for individuals of a poetical temperament, if love of       solitude be, as immemorial tradition asserts, a necessary part of       their idiosyncrasy.        Mr. Poe has two of the prime qualities of genius, a faculty of       vigorous yet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of       imagination. The first of these faculties is as needful to the       artist in words, as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in       colors or in stone. This enables him to conceive truly, to       maintain a proper relation of parts, and to draw a correct       outline, while the second groups, fills up and colors. Both of       these Mr. Poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his       prose works, the last predominating in his earlier tales, and the       first in his later ones. In judging of the merit of an author,       and assigning him his niche among our household gods, we have a       right to regard him from our own point of view, and to measure       him by our own standard. But, in estimating the amount of power       displayed in his works, we must be governed by his own design,       and placing them by the side of his own ideal, find how much is       wanting. We differ from Mr. Poe in his opinions of the objects of       art. He esteems that object to be the creation of Beauty, and       perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we       disagree with him. But in what we shall say of his writings, we       shall take his own standard as our guide. The temple of the god       of song is equally accessible from every side, and there is room       enough in it for all who bring offerings, or seek in oracle.        In his tales, Mr. Poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in       that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of       the probable into the weird confines of superstition and       unreality. He combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties       which are seldom found united; a power of influencing the mind of       the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery, and a minuteness       of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed. Both       are, in truth, the natural results of the predominating quality       of his mind, to which we have before alluded, analysis. It is       this which distinguishes the artist. His mind at once reaches       forward to the effect to be produced. Having resolved to bring       about certain emotions in the reader, he makes all subordinate       parts tend strictly to the common centre. Even his mystery is       mathematical to his own mind. To him X is a known quantity all       along. In any picture that he paints he understands the chemical       properties of all his colors. However vague some of his figures       may seem, however formless the shadows, to him the outline is as       clear and distinct as that of a geometrical diagram. For this       reason Mr. Poe has no sympathy with Mysticism. The Mystic dwells       in the mystery, is enveloped with it; it colors all his thoughts;       it affects his optic nerve especially, and the commonest things       get a rainbow edging from it. Mr. Poe, on the other hand, is a       spectator _ab extra_. He analyzes, he dissects, he watches      “with an eye serene,      The very pulse of the machine,”        for such it practically is to him, with wheels and cogs and       piston-rods, all working to produce a certain end.        This analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical, and by       giving him the patience to be minute, enables him to throw a       wonderful reality into his most unreal fancies. A monomania he       paints with great power. He loves to dissect one of these cancers       of the mind, and to trace all the subtle ramifications of its       roots. In raising images of horror, also, he has strange success,       conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some terrible _doubt_       which is the secret of all horror. He leaves to imagination the       task of finishing the picture, a task to which only she is       competent.       “For much imaginary work was there;      Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,      That for Achilles’ image stood his spear      Grasped in an armed hand; himself behind      Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind.”        Besides the merit of conception, Mr. Poe’s writings have also       that of form.        His style is highly finished, graceful and truly classical. It       would be hard to find a living author who had displayed such       varied powers. As an example of his style we would refer to one       of his tales, “The House of Usher,” in the first volume of his       “Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque.” It has a singular charm       for us, and we think that no one could read it without being       strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty. Had its author       written nothing else, it would alone have been enough to stamp       him as a man of genius, and the master of a classic style. In       this tale occurs, perhaps, the most beautiful of his poems.        The great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the       vague and the unreal as sources of effect. They have not used       dread and horror alone, but only in combination with other       qualities, as means of subjugating the fancies of their readers.       The loftiest muse has ever a household and fireside charm about       her. Mr. Poe’s secret lies mainly in the skill with which he has       employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror. In this       his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of       art, not artifice. We cannot call his materials the noblest or       purest, but we must concede to him the highest merit of       construction.        As a critic, Mr. Poe was aesthetically deficient. Unerring in his       analysis of dictions, metres and plots, he seemed wanting in the       faculty of perceiving the profounder ethics of art. His       criticisms are, however, distinguished for scientific precision       and coherence of logic. They have the exactness, and at the same       time, the coldness of mathematical demonstrations. Yet they stand       in strikingly refreshing contrast with the vague generalisms and       sharp personalities of the day. If deficient in warmth, they are       also without the heat of partisanship. They are especially       valuable as illustrating the great truth, too generally       overlooked, that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the       critic.        On the whole, it may be considered certain that Mr. Poe has       attained an individual eminence in our literature which he will       keep. He has given proof of power and originality. He has done       that which could only be done once with success or safety, and       the imitation or repetition of which would produce weariness.     DEATH OF EDGAR A. POE   By N. P. Willis        The ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one       body, equally powerful and having the complete mastery by       turns-of one man, that is to say, inhabited by both a devil and       an angel seems to have been realized, if all we hear is true, in       the character of the extraordinary man whose name we have written       above. Our own impression of the nature of Edgar A. Poe, differs       in some important degree, however, from that which has been       generally conveyed in the notices of his death. Let us, before       telling what we personally know of him, copy a graphic and highly       finished portraiture, from the pen of Dr. Rufus W. Griswold,       which appeared in a recent number of the “Tribune”:        “Edgar Allen Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore on Sunday, October       7th. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved       by it. The poet was known, personally or by reputation, in all       this country; he had readers in England and in several of the       states of Continental Europe; but he had few or no friends; and       the regrets for his death will be suggested principally by the       consideration that in him literary art has lost one of its most       brilliant but erratic stars.        “His conversation was at times almost supramortal in its       eloquence. His voice was modulated with astonishing skill, and       his large and variably expressive eyes looked repose or shot       fiery tumult into theirs who listened, while his own face glowed,       or was changeless in pallor, as his imagination quickened his       blood or drew it back frozen to his heart. His imagery was from       the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision of       genius. Suddenly starting from a proposition, exactly and sharply       defined, in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness, he rejected       the forms of customary logic, and by a crystalline process of       accretion, built up his ocular demonstrations in forms of       gloomiest and ghastliest grandeur, or in those of the most airy       and delicious beauty, so minutely and distinctly, yet so rapidly,       that the attention which was yielded to him was chained till it       stood among his wonderful creations, till he himself dissolved       the spell, and brought his hearers back to common and base       existence, by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest       passion.        “He was at all times a dreamer dwelling in ideal realms in heaven       or hell peopled with the creatures and the accidents of his       brain. He walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips       moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate       prayer (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel,       that he was already damned, but) for their happiness who at the       moment were objects of his idolatry; or with his glances       introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish, and with a face       shrouded in gloom, he would brave the wildest storms, and all       night, with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and       rains, would speak as if the spirits that at such times only       could be evoked by him from the Aidenn, close by whose portals       his disturbed soul sought to forget the ills to which his       constitution subjected him—close by the Aidenn where were those       he loved—the Aidenn which he might never see, but in fitful       glimpses, as its gates opened to receive the less fiery and more       happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the doom of       death.        “He seemed, except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his will       and engrossed his faculties, always to bear the memory of some       controlling sorrow. The remarkable poem of ‘The Raven’ was       probably much more nearly than has been supposed, even by those       who were very intimate with him, a reflection and an echo of his       own history. _He_ was that bird’s      “‘Unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore     Of ‘Never—never more.’        “Every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his       works, whatever their design, traces of his personal character:       elements of his immortal being, in which the individual survives       the person. While we read the pages of the ‘Fall of the House of       Usher,’ or of ‘Mesmeric Revelations,’ we see in the solemn and       stately gloom which invests one, and in the subtle metaphysical       analysis of both, indications of the idiosyncrasies of what was       most remarkable and peculiar in the author’s intellectual nature.       But we see here only the better phases of his nature, only the       symbols of his juster action, for his harsh experience had       deprived him of all faith in man or woman. He had made up his       mind upon the numberless complexities of the social world, and       the whole system with him was an imposture. This conviction gave       a direction to his shrewd and naturally unamiable character.       Still, though he regarded society as composed altogether of       villains, the sharpness of his intellect was not of that kind       which enabled him to cope with villany, while it continually       caused him by overshots to fail of the success of honesty. He was       in many respects like Francis Vivian in Bulwer’s novel of ‘The       Caxtons.’ Passion, in him, comprehended many of the worst       emotions which militate against human happiness. You could not       contradict him, but you raised quick choler; you could not speak       of wealth, but his cheek paled with gnawing envy. The astonishing       natural advantages of this poor boy—his beauty, his readiness,       the daring spirit that breathed around him like a fiery       atmosphere—had raised his constitutional self-confidence into an       arrogance that turned his very claims to admiration into       prejudices against him. Irascible, envious—bad enough, but not       the worst, for these salient angles were all varnished over with       a cold, repellant cynicism, his passions vented themselves in       sneers. There seemed to him no moral susceptibility; and, what       was more remarkable in a proud nature, little or nothing of the       true point of honor. He had, to a morbid excess, that, desire to       rise which is vulgarly called ambition, but no wish for the       esteem or the love of his species; only the hard wish to       succeed—not shine, not serve—succeed, that he might have the       right to despise a world which galled his self-conceit.        “We have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes       upon his literature. It was more conspicuous in his later than in       his earlier writings. Nearly all that he wrote in the last two or       three years—including much of his best poetry—was in some sense       biographical; in draperies of his imagination, those who had       taken the trouble to trace his steps, could perceive, but       slightly concealed, the figure of himself.”        Apropos of the disparaging portion of the above well-written       sketch, let us truthfully say:        Some four or five years since, when editing a daily paper in this       city, Mr. Poe was employed by us, for several months, as critic       and sub-editor. This was our first personal acquaintance with       him. He resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles       out of town, but was at his desk in the office, from nine in the       morning till the evening paper went to press. With the highest       admiration for his genius, and a willingness to let it atone for       more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by common report to       expect a very capricious attention to his duties, and       occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time went on,       however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. With his       pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a reminder of what       genius was in him, it was impossible, of course, not to treat him       always with deferential courtesy, and, to our occasional request       that he would not probe too deep in a criticism, or that he would       erase a passage colored too highly with his resentments against       society and mankind, he readily and courteously assented—far more       yielding than most men, we thought, on points so excusably       sensitive. With a prospect of taking the lead in another       periodical, he, at last, voluntarily gave up his employment with       us, and, through all this considerable period, we had seen but       one presentment of the man—a quiet, patient, industrious, and       most gentlemanly person, commanding the utmost respect and good       feeling by his unvarying deportment and ability.        Residing as he did in the country, we never met Mr. Poe in hours       of leisure; but he frequently called on us afterward at our place       of business, and we met him often in the street—invariably the       same sad mannered, winning and refined gentleman, such as we had       always known him. It was by rumor only, up to the day of his       death, that we knew of any other development of manner or       character. We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be       stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities), that,       with a single glass of wine, his whole nature was reversed, the       demon became uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs of       intoxication were visible, his will was palpably insane.       Possessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity, at such       times, and seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and       memory, he easily seemed personating only another phase of his       natural character, and was accused, accordingly, of insulting       arrogance and bad-heartedness. In this reversed character, we       repeat, it was never our chance to see him. We know it from       hearsay, and we mention it in connection with this sad infirmity       of physical constitution; which puts it upon very nearly the       ground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity.        The arrogance, vanity, and depravity of heart, of which Mr. Poe       was generally accused, seem to us referable altogether to this       reversed phase of his character. Under that degree of       intoxication which only acted upon him by demonizing his sense of       truth and right, he doubtless said and did much that was wholly       irreconcilable with his better nature; but, when himself, and as       we knew him only, his modesty and unaffected humility, as to his       own deservings, were a constant charm to his character. His       letters, of which the constant application for autographs has       taken from us, we are sorry to confess, the greater portion,       exhibited this quality very strongly. In one of the carelessly       written notes of which we chance still to retain possession, for       instance, he speaks of “The Raven”—that extraordinary poem which       electrified the world of imaginative readers, and has become the       type of a school of poetry of its own—and, in evident earnest,       attributes its success to the few words of commendation with       which we had prefaced it in this paper. It will throw light on       his sane character to give a literal copy of the note:  “FORDHAM, _April_ 20, 1849        “MY DEAR WILLIS—The poem which I inclose, and which I am so vain       as to hope you will like, in some respects, has been just       published in a paper for which sheer necessity compels me to       write, now and then. It pays well as times go-but unquestionably       it ought to pay ten prices; for whatever I send it I feel I am       consigning to the tomb of the Capulets. The verses accompanying       this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and bring them to       light in the ‘Home Journal?’ If you can oblige me so far as to       copy them, I do not think it will be necessary to say ‘From the       ——,’ that would be too bad; and, perhaps, ‘From a late —— paper,’       would do.        “I have not forgotten how a ‘good word in season’ from you made       ‘The Raven,’ and made ‘Ulalume’ (which by-the-way, people have       done me the honor of attributing to you), therefore, I _would_       ask you (if I dared) to say something of these lines if they       please you.  “Truly yours ever, “EDGAR A. POE.”        In double proof of his earnest disposition to do the best for       himself, and of the trustful and grateful nature which has been       denied him, we give another of the only three of his notes which       we chance to retain:  “FORDHAM, _January_ 22, 1848.        “MY DEAR MR. WILLIS—I am about to make an effort at       re-establishing myself in the literary world, and _feel_ that I       may depend upon your aid.        “My general aim is to start a Magazine, to be called ‘The       Stylus,’ but it would be useless to me, even when established, if       not entirely out of the control of a publisher. I mean,       therefore, to get up a journal which shall be _my own_ at all       points. With this end in view, I must get a list of at least five       hundred subscribers to begin with; nearly two hundred I have       already. I propose, however, to go South and West, among my       personal and literary friends—old college and West Point       acquaintances—and see what I can do. In order to get the means of       taking the first step, I propose to lecture at the Society       Library, on Thursday, the 3d of February, and, that there may be       no cause of _squabbling_, my subject shall _not be literary_ at       all. I have chosen a broad text: ‘The Universe.’        “Having thus given you _the facts_ of the case, I leave all the       rest to the suggestions of your own tact and generosity.       Gratefully, _most gratefully,_  “Your friend always, “EDGAR A. POE.”        Brief and chance-taken as these letters are, we think they       sufficiently prove the existence of the very qualities denied to       Mr. Poe-humility, willingness to persevere, belief in another’s       friendship, and capability of cordial and grateful friendship!       Such he assuredly was when sane. Such only he has invariably       seemed to us, in all we have happened personally to know of him,       through a friendship of five or six years. And so much easier is       it to believe what we have seen and known, than what we hear of       only, that we remember him but with admiration and respect; these       descriptions of him, when morally insane, seeming to us like       portraits, painted in sickness, of a man we have only known in       health.        But there is another, more touching, and far more forcible       evidence that there was _goodness_ in Edgar A. Poe. To reveal it       we are obliged to venture upon the lifting of the veil which       sacredly covers grief and refinement in poverty; but we think it       may be excused, if so we can brighten the memory of the poet,       even were there not a more needed and immediate service which it       may render to the nearest link broken by his death.        Our first knowledge of Mr. Poe’s removal to this city was by a       call which we received from a lady who introduced herself to us       as the mother of his wife. She was in search of employment for       him, and she excused her errand by mentioning that he was ill,       that her daughter was a confirmed invalid, and that their       circumstances were such as compelled her taking it upon herself.       The countenance of this lady, made beautiful and saintly with an       evidently complete giving up of her life to privation and       sorrowful tenderness, her gentle and mournful voice urging its       plea, her long-forgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined       manners, and her appealing and yet appreciative mention of the       claims and abilities of her son, disclosed at once the presence       of one of those angels upon earth that women in adversity can be.       It was a hard fate that she was watching over. Mr. Poe wrote with       fastidious difficulty, and in a style too much above the popular       level to be well paid. He was always in pecuniary difficulty,       and, with his sick wife, frequently in want of the merest       necessaries of life. Winter after winter, for years, the most       touching sight to us, in this whole city, has been that tireless       minister to genius, thinly and insufficiently clad, going from       office to office with a poem, or an article on some literary       subject, to sell, sometimes simply pleading in a broken voice       that he was ill, and begging for him, mentioning nothing but that       “he was ill,” whatever might be the reason for his writing       nothing, and never, amid all her tears and recitals of distress,       suffering one syllable to escape her lips that could convey a       doubt of him, or a complaint, or a lessening of pride in his       genius and good intentions. Her daughter died a year and a half       since, but she did not desert him. She continued his ministering       angel—living with him, caring for him, guarding him against       exposure, and when he was carried away by temptation, amid grief       and the loneliness of feelings unreplied to, and awoke from his       self abandonment prostrated in destitution and suffering,       _begging_ for him still. If woman’s devotion, born with a first       love, and fed with human passion, hallow its object, as it is       allowed to do, what does not a devotion like this—pure,       disinterested and holy as the watch of an invisible spirit—say       for him who inspired it?        We have a letter before us, written by this lady, Mrs. Clemm, on       the morning in which she heard of the death of this object of her       untiring care. It is merely a request that we would call upon       her, but we will copy a few of its words—sacred as its privacy       is—to warrant the truth of the picture we have drawn above, and       add force to the appeal we wish to make for her:        “I have this morning heard of the death of my darling Eddie....       Can you give me any circumstances or particulars?... Oh! do not       desert your poor friend in his bitter affliction!... Ask Mr. ——       to come, as I must deliver a message to him from my poor       Eddie.... I need not ask you to notice his death and to speak       well of him. I know you will. But say what an affectionate son he       was to me, his poor desolate mother...”        To hedge round a grave with respect, what choice is there,       between the relinquished wealth and honors of the world, and the       story of such a woman’s unrewarded devotion! Risking what we do,       in delicacy, by making it public, we feel—other reasons       aside—that it betters the world to make known that there are such       ministrations to its erring and gifted. What we have said will       speak to some hearts. There are those who will be glad to know       how the lamp, whose light of poetry has beamed on their far-away       recognition, was watched over with care and pain, that they may       send to her, who is more darkened than they by its extinction,       some token of their sympathy. She is destitute and alone. If any,       far or near, will send to us what may aid and cheer her through       the remainder of her life, we will joyfully place it in her       hands.     THE UNPARALLELED ADVENTURES OF ONE HANS PFAAL (*1)         By late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high       state of philosophical excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there       occurred of a nature so completely unexpected—so entirely       novel—so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions—as to       leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an       uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy       together by the ears.        It appears that on the—— day of—— (I am not positive about the       date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically       mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in       the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was       warm—unusually so for the season—there was hardly a breath of air       stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and       then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration,       that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a       fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament. Nevertheless,       about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in       the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded;       and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned       toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously       from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could       be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded       long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of       Rotterdam.        The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From       behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of       cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open       area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid       substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not       to be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently       admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed       below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows and devils       in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no one       could imagine; no one—not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus       Von Underduk—had the slightest clew by which to unravel the       mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one       to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth,       and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed,       paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly—then waddled       back, grunted, paused, and finally—puffed again.        In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly       city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so       much smoke. In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be       accurately discerned. It appeared to be—yes! it was undoubtedly a       species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen       in Rotterdam before. For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon       manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers? No man in Holland       certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or       rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing       in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of       the precise material which no one had ever before known to be       used for a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the       good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the       phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible. Being little or       nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down. And this       similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer       inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its       apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of       little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a       continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse.       Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine,       there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver hat, with a       brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black       band and a silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable       that many citizens of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat       repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard       it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon       sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and       declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself. Now       this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Pfaall, with       three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about       five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and       up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of       obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be       sure, some bones which were thought to be human, mixed up with a       quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a       retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went       so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been       committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans       Pfaall and his associates. But to return.        The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to       within a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a       sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant. This       was in truth a very droll little somebody. He could not have been       more than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it       was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and       tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention       of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on       to the cords of the balloon. The body of the little man was more       than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a       rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen       at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was       occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car,       or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were       enormously large. His hair was extremely gray, and collected into       a queue behind. His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and       inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and       cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and       double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a       semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd       little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue       satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles       at the knees. His vest was of some bright yellow material; a       white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and,       to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief       enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his       bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions.        Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet       from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was       suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared       disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma. Throwing       out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he       lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant.       He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract       from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book.       This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air       of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight.       He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter       sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let       it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von       Underduk. His Excellency stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut,       still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther       business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make       busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to       discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the       half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without       taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of       them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and       rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in       the face of every man in Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed,       however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on       the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity. It is       said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his       one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than       one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to       which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to       which he intends holding fast until the day of his death.        In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far       away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud       similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus       lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of       Rotterdam. All attention was now directed to the letter, the       descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had       proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity       to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus       Von Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during       his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the       important subject of securing the packet in question, which was       seen, upon inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands,       being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in       their official capacities of President and Vice-President of the       Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was accordingly opened by       those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the       following extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communication:        “To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and       Vice-President of the States’ College of Astronomers, in the city       of Rotterdam.        “Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble       artizan, by name Hans Pfaall, and by occupation a mender of       bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam,       about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered       by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable. If,       however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this       communication, am the identical Hans Pfaall himself. It is well       known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty       years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at       the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at       the time of my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided       therein time out of mind—they, as well as myself, steadily       following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of       mending of bellows. For, to speak the truth, until of late years,       that the heads of all the people have been set agog with       politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen       of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good,       employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack       of either money or good-will. But, as I was saying, we soon began       to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism,       and all that sort of thing. People who were formerly, the very       best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to       think of us at all. They had, so they said, as much as they could       do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of       intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire wanted fanning, it       could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the government       grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired       durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was       not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of       a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state       of things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and,       having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length       became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting       upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life.       Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation.       My house was literally besieged from morning till night, so that       I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against       the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows in particular       who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about       my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I       internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so       happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in       the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from       putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing       my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to       dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair       words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of       vengeance should be afforded me.        “One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more       than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander       about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at       length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller’s       stall. Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I       threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened       the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. It       proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy,       written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of       somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of information       on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed       in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice       before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me.       By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps       toward home. But the treatise had made an indelible impression on       my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved       carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible       reasonings of the writer. There are some particular passages       which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary       manner. The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew       the interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature       of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on       subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering       me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or       inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen       in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to       imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough,       to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in       ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in       effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent       properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step       farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely       speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity       and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that       truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that,       in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek       her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found.       Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas.       In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly       that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much       precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and       undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance       in its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware       that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the       visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light       than the exterior portions of the retina. This knowledge, and       some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an       eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices       of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the       bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the epoch of       which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star       offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with       the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my       mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.        “It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed.       My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the       whole night buried in meditation. Arising early in the morning,       and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I       repaired eagerly to the bookseller’s stall, and laid out what       little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes       of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. Having arrived at home       safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal,       and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I       thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the intervals       of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three       creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally       succeeded—partly by selling enough of my household furniture to       satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of       paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I       told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited       their services. By these means—for they were ignorant men—I found       little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose.        “Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife       and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what       property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under       various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future       means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money.       With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals,       cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine;       a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of       wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary       in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary       dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as       possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the       particular method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the       twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a       hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a       spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications,       and two astronomical instruments not so generally known. I then       took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation       east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty       gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes,       three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in       length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or       semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a       very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter       materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than       myself—or at least never applied to any similar purpose. The       secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of       right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was       conditionally communicated to myself. The same individual       submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a       method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain       animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an       impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and       was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a       coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention       this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the       individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the       novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to       deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention.        “On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy       respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug       a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle       twenty-five feet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being       the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three       feet in depth. In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a       canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg       holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder. These—the       keg and canisters—I connected in a proper manner with covered       trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about       four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the       cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about       an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up the       remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their       destined situation.        “Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot,       and there secreted, one of M. Grimm’s improvements upon the       apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this       machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it       could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it       applicable. But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance,       I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My       balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than forty       thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I       calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly,       with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the       bargain. It had received three coats of varnish, and I found the       cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite       as strong and a good deal less expensive.        “Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of       secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first       visit to the bookseller’s stall; and promising, on my part, to       return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what       little money I had left, and bade her farewell. Indeed I had no       fear on her account. She was what people call a notable woman,       and could manage matters in the world without my assistance. I       believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle       boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in       the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me. It was a dark       night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as       aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much       trouble, we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements,       by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles were       deposited. We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded       immediately to business.        “It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was       dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain,       falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. But my       chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the       varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy       with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage. I       therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence,       pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid       in the others. They did not cease, however, importuning me with       questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus,       and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made       them undergo. They could not perceive, so they said, what good       was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely       to take a part in such horrible incantations. I began to get       uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe       the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the       devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing       better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of       their leaving me altogether. I contrived, however, to pacify them       by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could       bring the present business to a termination. To these speeches       they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no       doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast       quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed,       and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say       they cared very little what became of either my soul or my       carcass.        “In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently       inflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my       implements in it—not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a       copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such       as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in       comparatively little bulk. I also secured in the car a pair of       pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it       high time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on the       ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to       pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose       end, as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower       rim of one of the smaller casks. This manoeuvre was totally       unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the       car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the       earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with       all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast,       and able to have carried up as many more.        “Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards,       when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and       tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke,       and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and       blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down       in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror.       Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the       business, and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to       be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all       the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately       thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst       abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament       asunder. When I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail       to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded       myself, to its proper cause—my situation directly above it, and       in the line of its greatest power. But at the time, I thought       only of preserving my life. The balloon at first collapsed, then       furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible       velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man,       hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me       dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my       face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in       length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom       of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became       most providentially entangled. It is impossible—utterly       impossible—to form any adequate idea of the horror of my       situation. I gasped convulsively for breath—a shudder resembling       a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame—I       felt my eyes starting from their sockets—a horrible nausea       overwhelmed me—and at length I fainted away.        “How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It       must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I       partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day       breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of       ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide       within the limits of the vast horizon. My sensations, however,       upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as       might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was much of incipient       madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation.       I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and       wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of       the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingernails. I       afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and       feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying       myself that it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger       than my balloon. Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my       breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a       toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance,       and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. It now       occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of       my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to       glimmer through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither       astonished nor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it       was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was       about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and I       never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question       susceptible of doubt. For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the       profoundest meditation. I have a distinct recollection of       frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side       of my nose, and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces       common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon       matters of intricacy or importance. Having, as I thought,       sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and       deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the       large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my       inexpressibles. This buckle had three teeth, which, being       somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis. I       brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the       body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that       position. Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I       now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had to rest       several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it       was at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made       fast the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security,       tightly around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a       prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very       first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling       it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work.        “My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an       angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood       that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the       perpendicular. So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the       plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had       acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards       from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent       and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however, that when I       fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my       face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from       it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by       which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge,       instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,—I say it       may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases,       I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now       accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Pfaall would       have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason       to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too       stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of       an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making the       slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly       tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not       fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and       dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In       fact, the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head       and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with       madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper       channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my       perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the       self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness       was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came       to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and       struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length,       clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed       my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within the       car.        “It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself       sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I       then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my       great relief, uninjured. My implements were all safe, and,       fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I       had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident       was entirely out of the question. Looking at my watch, I found it       six o’clock. I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave       a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. Immediately       beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly       oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way       bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called       a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly       discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled,       and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W.       Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and       the sun, which had long arisen.        “It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies       the object of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in       mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length       driven me to the resolution of committing suicide. It was not,       however, that to life itself I had any positive disgust, but that       I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries       attending my situation. In this state of mind, wishing to live,       yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the       bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. I then finally       made up my mind. I determined to depart, yet live—to leave the       world, yet continue to exist—in short, to drop enigmas, I       resolved, let what would ensue, to force a passage, if I could,       to the moon. Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than       I actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the       considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of       this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably       full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the       confines of the possible.        “The moon’s actual distance from the earth was the first thing to       be attended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the       centres of the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth’s equatorial       radii, or only about 237,000 miles. I say the mean or average       interval, but it must be borne in mind that the form of the       moon’s orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no       less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself,       and the earth’s centre being situated in its focus, if I could,       in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its       perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially       diminished. But, to say nothing at present of this possibility,       it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I       would have to deduct the radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the       radius of the moon, say 1,080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual       interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920       miles. Now this, I reflected, was no very extraordinary distance.       Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate       of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be       anticipated. But even at this velocity, it would take me no more       than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon. There were,       however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average       rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty       miles per hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make       a deep impression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully       hereafter.        “The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater       importance. From indications afforded by the barometer, we find       that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at the       height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the       entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended       through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far       from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the       material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air       incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an       altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth’s       diameter—that is, not exceeding eighty miles—the rarefaction       would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be       sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess       of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be       inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I did not fail to       perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on       our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the       mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what       may be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of       the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted       that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of       modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface.       Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be       simply analogical. The greatest height ever reached by man was       that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of       Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a moderate altitude, even       when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I could not       help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great       latitude for speculation.        “But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given       altitude, the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any       farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional       height ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated       before), but in a ratio constantly decreasing. It is therefore       evident that, ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally       speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be       found. It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state       of infinite rarefaction.        “On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been       wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to       the atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air       whatsoever. But a circumstance which has been left out of view by       those who contend for such a limit seemed to me, although no       positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very       serious investigation. On comparing the intervals between the       successive arrivals of Encke’s comet at its perihelion, after       giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances       due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the       periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis       of the comet’s ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but       perfectly regular decrease. Now, this is precisely what ought to       be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the       comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the       regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such a medium must,       in retarding the comet’s velocity, increase its centripetal, by       weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the sun’s       attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the       comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed, there is       no other way of accounting for the variation in question. But       again:—The real diameter of the same comet’s nebulosity is       observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate       with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. Was I       not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent       condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the       same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only       denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The lenticular-shaped       phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy       of attention. This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and       which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from       the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction       of the sun’s equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature       of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the       orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther.(*2)       Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of       the comet’s ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun.       It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire       regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call       atmosphere at the planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them       modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological.        “Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further       hesitation. Granting that on my passage I should meet with       atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I       conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M.       Grimm, I should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient       quantity for the purposes of respiration. This would remove the       chief obstacle in a journey to the moon. I had indeed spent some       money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object       intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful       application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within any       reasonable period. This brings me back to the rate at which it       might be possible to travel.        “It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions       from the earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively       moderate. Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the       superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the       atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable       that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives       successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly       diminishing—I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in       this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be       accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any       recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute       rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on       account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through       balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material       than the ordinary varnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect       of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect       of some accelerating power. I now considered that, provided in my       passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it       should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate       atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at       what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it—that is to       say, in regard to my power of ascending—for the gas in the       balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially       similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer       an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion),       but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue       specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen       and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be       constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the       distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I       should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force       of the earth’s attraction would be superseded by that of the       moon. In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth       while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be       sufficient for a period of forty days.        “There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned       me some little disquietude. It has been observed, that, in       balloon ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain       attending respiration, great uneasiness is experienced about the       head and body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and       other symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more       inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained.(*3) This was       a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was it not probable       that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least       until terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their       origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the       customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and       consequent distention of the superficial blood-vessels—not in any       positive disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of       difficulty in breathing, where the atmospheric density is       chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a       ventricle of the heart. Unless for default of this renovation, I       could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained       even in a vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest,       commonly called breathing, is action purely muscular, and the       cause, not the effect, of respiration. In a word, I conceived       that, as the body should become habituated to the want of       atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually       diminish—and to endure them while they continued, I relied with       confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution.        “Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some,       though by no means all, the considerations which led me to form       the project of a lunar voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before       you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in       conception, and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in the       annals of mankind.        “Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say       three miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a       quantity of feathers, and found that I still ascended with       sufficient rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for       discharging any ballast. I was glad of this, for I wished to       retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for reasons which       will be explained in the sequel. I as yet suffered no bodily       inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain       whatever in the head. The cat was lying very demurely upon my       coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air       of nonchalance. These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent       their escape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of       rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car.        “At twenty minutes past six o’clock, the barometer showed an       elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. The       prospect seemed unbounded. Indeed, it is very easily calculated       by means of spherical geometry, what a great extent of the       earth’s area I beheld. The convex surface of any segment of a       sphere is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the       versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere. Now, in       my case, the versed sine—that is to say, the thickness of the       segment beneath me—was about equal to my elevation, or the       elevation of the point of sight above the surface. ‘As five       miles, then, to eight thousand,’ would express the proportion of       the earth’s area seen by me. In other words, I beheld as much as       a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the globe. The       sea appeared unruffled as a mirror, although, by means of the       spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent       agitation. The ship was no longer visible, having drifted away,       apparently to the eastward. I now began to experience, at       intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the       ears—still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom. The cat       and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.        “At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long       series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging       my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to       be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible       that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an       elevation. I thought it best, however, to throw out two       five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of one       hundred and sixty-five pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above       the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a       great increase in my rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my       leaving the cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end       of it to the other, and caused it to kindle up, throughout its       vast extent, like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal. This,       it must be remembered, was in the broad light of day. No fancy       may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a       similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night.       Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. Even as it       was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the       yawning abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and       stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and       red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire. I had       indeed made a narrow escape. Had the balloon remained a very       short while longer within the cloud—that is to say—had not the       inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the       ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence. Such       perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest       which must be encountered in balloons. I had by this time,       however, attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy       on this head.        “I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o’clock the barometer       indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I       began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath. My head,       too, was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a       moisture about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood,       which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears. My eyes,       also, gave me great uneasiness. Upon passing the hand over them       they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no       inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the       balloon itself, appeared distorted to my vision. These symptoms       were more than I had expected, and occasioned me some alarm. At       this juncture, very imprudently, and without consideration, I       threw out from the car three five-pound pieces of ballast. The       accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained, carried me too rapidly,       and without sufficient gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum       of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly proved fatal to my       expedition and to myself. I was suddenly seized with a spasm       which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in a       measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals,       and in a gasping manner—bleeding all the while copiously at the       nose and ears, and even slightly at the eyes. The pigeons       appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape;       while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue hanging out       of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the       influence of poison. I now too late discovered the great rashness       of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and my       agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than death,       and death in a few minutes. The physical suffering I underwent       contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any       exertion for the preservation of my life. I had, indeed, little       power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head       seemed to be greatly on the increase. Thus I found that my senses       would shortly give way altogether, and I had already clutched one       of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when       the recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors,       and the possible consequences to myself, should I return,       operated to deter me for the moment. I lay down in the bottom of       the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties. In this I so far       succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood.       Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the       operation in the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in       opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife.       The blood had hardly commenced flowing when I experienced a       sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate       basin full, most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely.       I nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on       my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as well as I       could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour. At the end of       this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of       any kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my       ascension. The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished       in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be       positively necessary to make use of my condenser. In the       meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed       away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite surprise, that she       had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light       a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition to the       number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was       pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of       bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more       than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this       ascension. I had imagined that the habitual endurance of the       atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause,       or nearly so, of the pain attending animal existence at a       distance above the surface. Should the kittens be found to suffer       uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must consider       my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as       a strong confirmation of my idea.        “By eight o’clock I had actually attained an elevation of       seventeen miles above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to       me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase,       but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight       degree even had I not discharged the ballast which I did. The       pains in my head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence,       and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose; but,       upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been       expected. I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and       more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a       troublesome spasmodic action of the chest. I now unpacked the       condensing apparatus, and got it ready for immediate use.        “The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was       beautiful indeed. To the westward, the northward, and the       southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of       apparently unruffled ocean, which every moment gained a deeper       and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight       appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the eastward,       although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great       Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a       small portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of       individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the       proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face       of the earth. From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim       speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as       the heaven is dotted with stars, spread itself out to the       eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of       waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the       horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of       the mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and       the stars were brilliantly visible.        “The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I       determined upon giving them their liberty. I first untied one of       them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the       rim of the wicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking       anxiously around him, fluttering his wings, and making a loud       cooing noise, but could not be persuaded to trust himself from       off the car. I took him up at last, and threw him to about half a       dozen yards from the balloon. He made, however, no attempt to       descend as I had expected, but struggled with great vehemence to       get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing       cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on       the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his       breast, and he fell dead within the car. The other one did not       prove so unfortunate. To prevent his following the example of his       companion, and accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with       all my force, and was pleased to find him continue his descent,       with great velocity, making use of his wings with ease, and in a       perfectly natural manner. In a very short time he was out of       sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in safety. Puss, who       seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness, now made a       hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much       apparent satisfaction. Her kittens were quite lively, and so far       evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.        “At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath       without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to       adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser.       This apparatus will require some little explanation, and your       Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the       first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a       barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was       existing, with the intention of introducing within this       barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same       atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of       respiration. With this object in view I had prepared a very       strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag. In this       bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a       manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the       whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the       outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work       is attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a       complete enclosure on all sides, and at bottom, it was now       necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material       over the hoop of the net-work—in other words, between the       net-work and the hoop. But if the net-work were separated from       the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in       the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to       the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses. I       therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving       the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a       portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I       refastened the loops—not to the hoop, for that would have been       impossible, since the cloth now intervened—but to a series of       large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet       below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons       having been made to correspond to the intervals between the       loops. This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened from       the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the       disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. In       this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the       bag between the net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the       hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight       of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely       by the strength of the buttons. This, at first sight, would seem       an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the       buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but so close       together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was       supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents       been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been       at all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering       of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by       means of three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was       done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to       preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation.       All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the       enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the       folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly       on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.        “In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had       been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass,       through which I could see without difficulty around me in every       horizontal direction. In that portion of the cloth forming the       bottom, was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and       corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car       itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having       found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on       account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there,       and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see       no objects situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a       matter of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a       window at top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making       any use of it.        “About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular       opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim       adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw. In this rim       was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the       machine being, of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic.       Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent       being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the       machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to       mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. This operation       being repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with       atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration. But in so       confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become       foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs. It       was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car—the       dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below. To       avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment       within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all       at once, but in a gradual manner—the valve being opened only for       a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from       the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the       atmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I had put the cat       and kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car       to a button at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I       could feed them at any moment when necessary. I did this at some       little risk, and before closing the mouth of the chamber, by       reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to       which a hook had been attached.        “By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled       the chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine       o’clock. During the whole period of my being thus employed, I       endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of       respiration, and bitterly did I repent the negligence or rather       fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the       last moment a matter of so much importance. But having at length       accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my       invention. Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and       ease—and indeed why should I not? I was also agreeably surprised       to find myself, in a great measure, relieved from the violent       pains which had hitherto tormented me. A slight headache,       accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the       wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly all of which I had       now to complain. Thus it seemed evident that a greater part of       the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had       actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of the pain       endured for the last two hours should have been attributed       altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration.        “At twenty minutes before nine o’clock—that is to say, a short       time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury       attained its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I       mentioned before, was one of an extended construction. It then       indicated an altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or       five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time       an extent of the earth’s area amounting to no less than the three       hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies. At nine       o’clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not       before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rap
