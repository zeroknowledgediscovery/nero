Everybody knows, in a general way, that the finest place in the       world is—or, alas, _was_—the Dutch borough of       Vondervotteimittiss. Yet as it lies some distance from any of the       main roads, being in a somewhat out-of-the-way situation, there       are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit.       For the benefit of those who have not, therefore, it will be only       proper that I should enter into some account of it. And this is       indeed the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting public       sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a       history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred       within its limits. No one who knows me will doubt that the duty       thus self-imposed will be executed to the best of my ability,       with all that rigid impartiality, all that cautious examination       into facts, and diligent collation of authorities, which should       ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian.        By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am       enabled to say, positively, that the borough of       Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely       the same condition which it at present preserves. Of the date of       this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that       species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are, at       times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae. The       date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its       antiquity, cannot be less than any assignable quantity       whatsoever.        Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I       confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault. Among a multitude       of opinions upon this delicate point—some acute, some learned,       some sufficiently the reverse—I am able to select nothing which       ought to be considered satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of       Grogswigg—nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey—is to be       cautiously preferred.—It runs:—“Vondervotteimittis—Vonder, lege       Donder—Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz—Bleitziz obsol:—pro       Blitzen.” This derivative, to say the truth, is still       countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the       summit of the steeple of the House of the Town-Council. I do not       choose, however, to commit myself on a theme of such importance,       and must refer the reader desirous of information to the       “Oratiunculae de Rebus Praeter-Veteris,” of Dundergutz. See,       also, Blunderbuzzard “De Derivationibus,” pp. 27 to 5010, Folio,       Gothic edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher;       wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of       Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell.        Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the       foundation of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name,       there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always       existed as we find it at this epoch. The oldest man in the       borough can remember not the slightest difference in the       appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion       of such a possibility is considered an insult. The site of the       village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a       mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills,       over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For       this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe       there is anything at all on the other side.        Round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved       throughout with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty       little houses. These, having their backs on the hills, must look,       of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards       from the front door of each dwelling. Every house has a small       garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and       twenty-four cabbages. The buildings themselves are so precisely       alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other.       Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is       somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly       picturesque. They are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks,       red, with black ends, so that the walls look like a chess-board       upon a great scale. The gables are turned to the front, and there       are cornices, as big as all the rest of the house, over the eaves       and over the main doors. The windows are narrow and deep, with       very tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a vast       quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The woodwork, throughout,       is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it, with but a       trifling variety of pattern for, time out of mind, the carvers of       Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two       objects—a time-piece and a cabbage. But these they do exceedingly       well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity, wherever       they find room for the chisel.        The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture       is all upon one plan. The floors are of square tiles, the chairs       and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy       feet. The mantelpieces are wide and high, and have not only       time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real       time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the       middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each       extremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the       time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach       with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the       dial-plate of a watch.        The fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking       fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot       over it, full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of       the house is always busy in attending. She is a little fat old       lady, with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a       sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress       is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and       very short in the waist—and indeed very short in other respects,       not reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat thick,       and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings       to cover them. Her shoes—of pink leather—are fastened each with a       bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In       her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right       she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork. By her side there       stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its       tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way of a quiz.        The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden       attending the pig. They are each two feet in height. They have       three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to       their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes       with big silver buckles, long surtout coats with large buttons of       mother-of-pearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little       dumpy watch in his right hand. He takes a puff and a look, and       then a look and a puff. The pig—which is corpulent and lazy—is       occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the       cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater,       which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him       look as handsome as the cat.        Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed       chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is       seated the old man of the house himself. He is an exceedingly       puffy little old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge       double chin. His dress resembles that of the boys—and I need say       nothing farther about it. All the difference is, that his pipe is       somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke. Like       them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket. To       say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch       to attend to—and what that is, I shall presently explain. He sits       with his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance,       and always keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon       a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain.        This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town       Council. The Town Council are all very little, round, oily,       intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and       have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger       than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my       sojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings,       and have adopted these three important resolutions:        “That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things:”        “That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss:”       and—        “That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”        Above the session-room of the Council is the steeple, and in the       steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of       mind, the pride and wonder of the village—the great clock of the       borough of Vondervotteimittiss. And this is the object to which       the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the       leather-bottomed arm-chairs.        The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the seven sides of       the steeple—so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its       faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There       is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty       is the most perfect of sinecures—for the clock of       Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the       matter with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a       thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of       antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have       been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was       just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the       borough. Never was such a place for keeping the true time. When       the large clapper thought proper to say “Twelve o’clock!” all its       obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and       responded like a very echo. In short, the good burghers were fond       of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks.        All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less       respect, and as the belfry—man of Vondervotteimittiss has the       most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of       any man in the world. He is the chief dignitary of the borough,       and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence.       His coat-tail is very far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his       eyes, and his stomach, very far bigger—than those of any other       old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only       double, but triple.        I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss:       alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!        There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that       “no good can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that       the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy. It       wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when       there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the       ridge of the eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted       universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a       leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of       dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the       clock in the steeple.        By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll       object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive       foreign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great       rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him. He was       really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen       in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark       snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide       mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed       anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. What       with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his       face to be seen. His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done       up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed       black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of       white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black       stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black       satin ribbon for bows. Under one arm he carried a huge       _chapeau-de-bras_, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times       as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from       which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of       fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the       greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!—here was a       sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!        To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an       audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right       into the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited       no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day       would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric       handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his       swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous       indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a       fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the       remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his       steps.        The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to       get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a       minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the       midst of them; gave a _chassez_ here, and a _balancez_ there; and       then, after a _pirouette_ and a _pas-de-zephyr_, pigeon-winged       himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town       Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a       state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at       once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big       _chapeau-de-bras_ upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes       and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it       so long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so       fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that       there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the       devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of       Vondervotteimittiss.        There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this       unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for       the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon.       The bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and       pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his       watch. It was evident, however, that just at this moment the       fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business       to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had       any time to attend to his manœuvres, for they had all to count       the strokes of the bell as it sounded.        “One!” said the clock.        “Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every       leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss. “Von!” said       his watch also; “von!” said the watch of his vrow; and “von!”       said the watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on       the tails of the cat and pig.        “Two!” continued the big bell; and        “Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.        “Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!” said the bell.        “Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin! Den!” answered the       others.        “Eleven!” said the big one.        “Eleben!” assented the little ones.        “Twelve!” said the bell.        “Dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their       voices.        “Und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up       their watches. But the big bell had not done with them yet.        “Thirteen!” said he.        “Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale,       dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from       over their left knees.        “Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—Mein Gott, it is       Dirteen o’clock!!”        Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All       Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of       uproar.        “Vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys—“I’ve been       ongry for dis hour!”        “Vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “It has       been done to rags for this hour!”        “Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen,       “Donder and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”—and       they filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in       their arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the       whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.        Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it       seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing       in the shape of a timepiece. The clocks carved upon the furniture       took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the       mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and       kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking       and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.       But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up       any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to       their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place,       scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and       caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and       running under the petticoats of the people, and creating       altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is       possible for a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters       still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the       steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost. Every now       and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the       smoke. There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was       lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the villain held the       bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising       such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. On       his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all       time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the       nincompoop! of playing “Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’Rafferty.”        Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in       disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and       fine kraut. Let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore       the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting       that little fellow from the steeple.     LIONIZING        —— all people went      Upon their ten toes in wild wonderment.                     —_Bishop Hall’s Satires_.        I am—that is to say I was—a great man; but I am neither the       author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe,       is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of       Fum-Fudge.        The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with       both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius—my father       wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I       mastered before I was breeched.        I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to       understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently       conspicuous, he might, by merely following it, arrive at a       Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories alone.       Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed       a half dozen of drams.        When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step       with him into his study.        “My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of       your existence?”        “My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”        “And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”        “Sir,” I said, “it is the science of Noses.”        “And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a       nose?”        “A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been       variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here I       pulled out my watch.] “It is now noon or thereabouts—we shall       have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To       commence then:—The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that       protuberance—that bump—that excrescence—that—”        “Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “I am       thunderstruck at the extent of your information—I am       positively—upon my soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his       hand upon his heart.] “Come here!” [Here he took me by the arm.]       “Your education may now be considered as finished—it is high time       you should scuffle for yourself—and you cannot do a better thing       than merely follow your nose—so—so—so—” [Here he kicked me       downstairs and out of the door.]—“so get out of my house, and God       bless you!”        As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this       accident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided       by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my nose. I gave it       a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology       forthwith.        All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.        “Wonderful genius!” said the Quarterly.        “Superb physiologist!” said the Westminster.        “Clever fellow!” said the Foreign.        “Fine writer!” said the Edinburgh.        “Profound thinker!” said the Dublin.        “Great man!” said Bentley.        “Divine soul!” said Fraser.        “One of us!” said Blackwood.        “Who can he be?” said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.        “What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.        “Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.—But I paid these       people no attention whatever—I just stepped into the shop of an       artist.        The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the       Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess’ poodle; the Earl of       This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness       of Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.        I approached the artist and turned up my nose.        “Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.        “Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.        “Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.        “Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.        “What will you take for it?” asked the artist.        “For his nose!” shouted her Grace.        “A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.        “A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Beautiful!” said he, entranced.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.        “I do,” said I, blowing it well.        “Is it quite original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence.        “Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.        “Has no copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a       microscope.        “None,” said I, turning it up.        “Admirable!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the       beauty of the manœuvre.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Precisely,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Just so,” said I.        “You shall have them,” said he. “What a piece of virtu!” So he       drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I       engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the       ninety-ninth edition of the “Nosology,” with a portrait of the       proboscis.—That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me       to dinner.        We were all lions and _recherchés_.        There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus,       Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.        There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgôt, Price,       Priestly, Condorcêt, De Staël, and the “Ambitious Student in Ill       Health.”        There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were       philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.        There was Æstheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms;       bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive       intelligence and homoömeria.        There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus;       heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism;       Homousios and Homouioisios.        There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned       Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with _velouté_ sauce; veal _à       la St_. Menehoult; marinade _à la_ St. Florentin; and orange       jellies _en mosaïques_.        There was Bibulus O’Bumper. He touched upon Latour and       Markbrünnen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and St.       George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and       Preignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon St.       Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told, with his       eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.        There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of       Cimabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino—of the gloom of       Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of       the frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.        There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of       opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in       Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.        There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking       that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in       the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth       was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of       green horns.        There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the       eighty-three lost tragedies of Æschylus; of the fifty-four       orations of Isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches       of Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus;       of the eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of       Pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty       tragedies of Homer Junior.        There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all       about internal fires and tertiary formations; about aëriforms,       fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist       and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about       blende and horn-blende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about       cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about       antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please.        There was myself. I spoke of myself;—of myself, of myself, of       myself;—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up       my nose, and I spoke of myself.        “Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.        “Superb!” said his guests;—and next morning her Grace of       Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.        “Will you go to Almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me       under the chin.        “Upon honor,” said I.        “Nose and all?” she asked.        “As I live,” I replied.        “Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be there?”        “Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”        “Pshaw, no!—but with all your nose?”        “Every bit of it, my love,” said I:—so I gave it a twist or two,       and found myself at Almack’s. The rooms were crowded to       suffocation.        “He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.        “He is coming!” said somebody farther up.        “He is coming!” said somebody farther still.        “He is come!” exclaimed the Duchess. “He is come, the little       love!”—and, seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice       upon the nose. A marked sensation immediately ensued.        “_Diavolo!_” cried Count Capricornutti.        “_Dios guarda!_” muttered Don Stiletto.        “_Mille tonnerres!_” ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.        “_Tousand teufel!_” growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.        It was not to be borne. I grew angry. I turned short upon       Bluddennuff.        “Sir!” said I to him, “you are a baboon.”        “Sir,” he replied, after a pause, “_Donner und Blitzen!_”        This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards. At       Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose—and then called       upon my friends.        “_Bête!_” said the first.        “Fool!” said the second.        “Dolt!” said the third.        “Ass!” said the fourth.        “Ninny!” said the fifth.        “Noodle!” said the sixth.        “Be off!” said the seventh.        At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.        “Father,” I asked, “what is the chief end of my existence?”        “My son,” he replied, “it is still the study of Nosology; but in       hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark.       You have a fine nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none.       You are damned, and he has become the hero of the day. I grant       you that in Fum-Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to       the size of his proboscis—but, good heavens! there is no       competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all.”     X-ING A PARAGRAB         As it is well known that the ‘wise men’ came ‘from the East,’ and       as Mr. Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows       that Mr. Bullet-head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of       the matter be needed, here we have it—Mr. B. was an editor.       Irascibility was his sole foible, for in fact the obstinacy of       which men accused him was anything but his foible, since he       justly considered it his forte. It was his strong point—his       virtue; and it would have required all the logic of a Brownson to       convince him that it was ‘anything else.’        I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and       the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible, was when,       abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men, the East, he       migrated to the city of Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, or some       place of a similar title, out West.        I must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made up       his mind finally to settle in that town, it was under the       impression that no newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed       in that particular section of the country. In establishing ‘The       Tea-Pot’ he expected to have the field all to himself. I feel       confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence       in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, in       Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named John       Smith (if I rightly remember), who for many years had there       quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the       ‘Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis Gazette.’ It was solely,       therefore, on account of having been misinformed, that Mr.       Bullet-head found himself in Alex—— suppose we call it Nopolis,       ‘for short’—but, as he did find himself there, he determined to       keep up his character for obst—for firmness, and remain. So       remain he did; and he did more; he unpacked his press, type,       etc., etc., rented an office exactly opposite to that of the       ‘Gazette,’ and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued       the first number of ‘The Alexan’—that is to say, of ‘The Nopolis       Tea-Pot’—as nearly as I can recollect, this was the name of the       new paper.        The leading article, I must admit, was brilliant—not to say       severe. It was especially bitter about things in general—and as       for the editor of ‘The Gazette,’ he was torn all to pieces in       particular. Some of Bullet-head’s remarks were really so fiery       that I have always, since that time, been forced to look upon       John Smith, who is still alive, in the light of a salamander. I       cannot pretend to give all the ‘Tea-Pot’s’ paragraphs verbatim,       but one of them runs thus:        ‘Oh, yes!—Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! The editor over the way       is a genius—O, my! Oh, goodness, gracious!—what is this world       coming to? Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!’        A philippic at once so caustic and so classical, alighted like a       bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of Nopolis. Groups       of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets.       Every one awaited, with heartfelt anxiety, the reply of the       dignified Smith. Next morning it appeared as follows:        ‘We quote from “The Tea-Pot” of yesterday the subjoined       paragraph: “Oh, yes! Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! Oh, my! Oh,       goodness! Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!” Why, the fellow is all O! That       accounts for his reasoning in a circle, and explains why there is       neither beginning nor end to him, nor to anything he says. We       really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasn’t       an O in it. Wonder if this O-ing is a habit of his? By-the-by, he       came away from Down-East in a great hurry. Wonder if he O’s as       much there as he does here? “O! it is pitiful.”’        The indignation of Mr. Bullet-head at these scandalous       insinuations, I shall not attempt to describe. On the       eel-skinning principle, however, he did not seem to be so much       incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have       imagined. It was the sneer at his style that drove him to       desperation. What!—he Touch-and-go Bullet-head!—not able to write       a word without an O in it! He would soon let the jackanapes see       that he was mistaken. Yes! he would let him see how much he was       mistaken, the puppy! He, Touch-and-go Bullet-head, of       Frogpondium, would let Mr. John Smith perceive that he,       Bullet-head, could indite, if it so pleased him, a whole       paragraph—aye! a whole article—in which that contemptible vowel       should not once—not even once—make its appearance. But no;—that       would be yielding a point to the said John Smith. He,       Bullet-head, would make no alteration in his style, to suit the       caprices of any Mr. Smith in Christendom. Perish so vile a       thought! The O forever; He would persist in the O. He would be as       O-wy as O-wy could be.        Burning with the chivalry of this determination, the great       Touch-and-go, in the next ‘Tea-Pot,’ came out merely with this       simple but resolute paragraph, in reference to this unhappy       affair:        ‘The editor of the “Tea-Pot” has the honor of advising the editor       of the “Gazette” that he (the “Tea-Pot”) will take an opportunity       in tomorrow morning’s paper, of convincing him (the “Gazette”)       that he (the “Tea-Pot”) both can and will be _his own master_, as       regards style;—he (the “Tea-Pot”) intending to show him (the       “Gazette”) the supreme, and indeed the withering contempt with       which the criticism of him (the “Gazette”) inspires the       independent bosom of him (the “Tea-Pot”) by composing for the       especial gratification (?) of him (the “Gazette”) a leading       article, of some extent, in which the beautiful vowel—the emblem       of Eternity—yet so offensive to the hyper-exquisite delicacy of       him (the “Gazette”) shall most certainly not be avoided by his       (the “Gazette’s”) most obedient, humble servant, the “Tea-Pot.”       “So much for Buckingham!”’        In fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather       than decidedly enunciated, the great Bullet-head, turning a deaf       ear to all entreaties for ‘copy,’ and simply requesting his       foreman to ‘go to the d——l,’ when he (the foreman) assured him       (the ‘Tea-Pot’!) that it was high time to ‘go to press’: turning       a deaf ear to everything, I say, the great Bullet-head sat up       until day-break, consuming the midnight oil, and absorbed in the       composition of the really unparalleled paragraph, which follows:—        ‘So ho, John! how now? Told you so, you know. Don’t crow, another       time, before you’re out of the woods! Does your mother know       you’re out? Oh, no, no!—so go home at once, now, John, to your       odious old woods of Concord! Go home to your woods, old owl—go!       You won’t! Oh, poh, poh, John don’t do so! You’ve _got_ to go,       you know! So go at once, and don’t go slow, for nobody owns you       here, you know! Oh! John, John, if you don’t go you’re no       homo—no! You’re only a fowl, an owl; a cow, a sow; a doll, a       poll; a poor, old, good-for-nothing-to-nobody, log, dog, hog, or       frog, come out of a Concord bog. Cool, now—cool! Do be cool, you       fool! None of your crowing, old cock! Don’t frown so—don’t! Don’t       hollo, nor howl nor growl, nor bow-wow-wow! Good Lord, John, how       you do look! Told you so, you know—but stop rolling your goose of       an old poll about so, and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl!’        Exhausted, very naturally, by so stupendous an effort, the great       Touch-and-go could attend to nothing farther that night. Firmly,       composedly, yet with an air of conscious power, he handed his MS.       to the devil in waiting, and then, walking leisurely home,       retired, with ineffable dignity to bed.        Meantime the devil, to whom the copy was entrusted, ran up stairs       to his ‘case,’ in an unutterable hurry, and forthwith made a       commencement at ‘setting’ the MS. ‘up.’        In the first place, of course,—as the opening word was ‘So,’—he       made a plunge into the capital S hole and came out in triumph       with a capital S. Elated by this success, he immediately threw       himself upon the little-o box with a blindfold impetuosity—but       who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without       the anticipated letter in their clutch? who shall paint his       astonishment and rage at perceiving, as he rubbed his knuckles,       that he had been only thumping them to no purpose, against the       bottom of an empty box. Not a single little-o was in the little-o       hole; and, glancing fearfully at the capital-O partition, he       found _that_, to his extreme terror, in a precisely similar       predicament. Awe-stricken, his first impulse was to rush to the       foreman.        ‘Sir!’ said he, gasping for breath, ‘I can’t never set up nothing       without no o’s.’        ‘What do you mean by that?’ growled the foreman, who was in a       very ill humor at being kept so late.        ‘Why, sir, there beant an o in the office, neither a big un nor a       little un!’        ‘What—what the d—l has become of all that were in the case?’        ‘I don’t know, sir,’ said the boy, ‘but one of them ere “G’zette”       devils is bin prowling ’bout here all night, and I spect he’s       gone and cabbaged ‘em every one.’        ‘Dod rot him! I haven’t a doubt of it,’ replied the foreman,       getting purple with rage ‘but I tell you what you do, Bob, that’s       a good boy—you go over the first chance you get and hook every       one of their i’s and (d——n them!) their izzards.’        ‘Jist so,’ replied Bob, with a wink and a frown—‘I’ll be into       ‘em, I’ll let ‘em know a thing or two; but in de meantime, that       ere paragrab? Mus go in to-night, you know—else there’ll be the       d—l to pay, and—’        ‘And not a bit of pitch hot,’ interrupted the foreman, with a       deep sigh, and an emphasis on the ‘bit.’ ‘Is it a long paragraph,       Bob?’        ‘Shouldn’t call it a _wery_ long paragrab,’ said Bob.        ‘Ah, well, then! do the best you can with it! We must get to       press,’ said the foreman, who was over head and ears in work;       ‘just stick in some other letter for o; nobody’s going to read       the fellow’s trash anyhow.’        ‘Wery well,’ replied Bob, ‘here goes it!’ and off he hurried to       his case, muttering as he went: ‘Considdeble vell, them ere       expressions, perticcler for a man as doesn’t swar. So I’s to       gouge out all their eyes, eh? and d-n all their gizzards! Vell!       this here’s the chap as is just able for to do it.’ The fact is       that although Bob was but twelve years old and four feet high, he       was equal to any amount of fight, in a small way.        The exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in       printing-offices; and I cannot tell how to account for it, but       the fact is indisputable, that when the exigency does occur, it       almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the       letter deficient. The true reason, perhaps, is that x is rather       the most superabundant letter in the cases, or at least was so in       the old times—long enough to render the substitution in question       an habitual thing with printers. As for Bob, he would have       considered it heretical to employ any other character, in a case       of this kind, than the x to which he had been accustomed.        ‘I shell have to x this ere paragrab,’ said he to himself, as he       read it over in astonishment, ‘but it’s jest about the awfulest       o-wy paragrab I ever did see’: so x it he did, unflinchingly, and       to press it went x-ed.        Next morning the population of Nopolis were taken all aback by       reading in ‘The Tea-Pot,’ the following extraordinary leader:        ‘Sx hx, Jxhn! hxw nxw? Txld yxu sx, yxu knxw. Dxn’t crxw, anxther       time, befxre yxu’re xut xf the wxxds! Dxes yxur mxther knxw       yxu’re xut? Xh, nx, nx!—sx gx hxme at xnce, nxw, Jxhn, tx yxur       xdixus xld wxxds xf Cxncxrd!

The first definite idea entertained by       the populace was, that some diabolical treason lay concealed in       the hieroglyphics; and there was a general rush to Bullet-head’s       residence, for the purpose of riding him on a rail; but that       gentleman was nowhere to be found. He had vanished, no one could       tell how; and not even the ghost of him has ever been seen since.        Unable to discover its legitimate object, the popular fury at       length subsided; leaving behind it, by way of sediment, quite a       medley of opinion about this unhappy affair.        One gentleman thought the whole an X-ellent joke.        Another said that, indeed, Bullet-head had shown much X-uberance       of fancy.        A third admitted him X-entric, but no more.        A fourth could only suppose it the Yankee’s design to X-press, in       a general way, his X-asperation.        ‘Say, rather, to set an X-ample to posterity,’ suggested a fifth.        That Bullet-head had been driven to an extremity, was clear to       all; and in fact, since that editor could not be found, there was       some talk about lynching the other one.        The more common conclusion, however, was that the affair was,       simply, X-traordinary and in-X-plicable. Even the town       mathematician confessed that he could make nothing of so dark a       problem. X, everybody knew, was an unknown quantity; but in this       case (as he properly observed), there was an unknown quantity of       X.        The opinion of Bob, the devil (who kept dark about his having       ‘X-ed the paragrab’), did not meet with so much attention as I       think it deserved, although it was very openly and very       fearlessly expressed. He said that, for his part, he had no doubt       about the matter at all, that it was a clear case, that Mr.       Bullet-head ‘never could be persuaded fur to drink like other       folks, but vas continually a-svigging o’ that ere blessed XXX       ale, and as a naiteral consekvence, it just puffed him up savage,       and made him X (cross) in the X-treme.’     METZENGERSTEIN        Pestis eram vivus—moriens tua mors ero.                     —_Martin Luther_        Horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. Why       then give a date to this story I have to tell? Let it suffice to       say, that at the period of which I speak, there existed, in the       interior of Hungary, a settled although hidden belief in the       doctrines of the Metempsychosis. Of the doctrines themselves—that       is, of their falsity, or of their probability—I say nothing. I       assert, however, that much of our incredulity—as La Bruyère says       of all our unhappiness—“_vient de ne pouvoir être seuls_.” {*1}        But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which       were fast verging to absurdity. They—the Hungarians—differed very       essentially from their Eastern authorities. For example, “_The       soul_,” said the former—I give the words of an acute and       intelligent Parisian—“_ne demeure qu’un seul fois dans un corps       sensible: au reste—un cheval, un chien, un homme même, n’est que       la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux._”        The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at       variance for centuries. Never before were two houses so       illustrious, mutually embittered by hostility so deadly. The       origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an       ancient prophecy—“A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as       the rider over his horse, the mortality of Metzengerstein shall       triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing.”        To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning. But       more trivial causes have given rise—and that no long while ago—to       consequences equally eventful. Besides, the estates, which were       contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs       of a busy government. Moreover, near neighbors are seldom       friends; and the inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might       look, from their lofty buttresses, into the very windows of the       palace Metzengerstein. Least of all had the more than feudal       magnificence, thus discovered, a tendency to allay the irritable       feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy Berlifitzings. What       wonder then, that the words, however silly, of that prediction,       should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two       families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of       hereditary jealousy? The prophecy seemed to imply—if it implied       anything—a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful       house; and was of course remembered with the more bitter       animosity by the weaker and less influential.        Wilhelm, Count Berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at       the epoch of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man,       remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal       antipathy to the family of his rival, and so passionate a love of       horses, and of hunting, that neither bodily infirmity, great age,       nor mental incapacity, prevented his daily participation in the       dangers of the chase.        Frederick, Baron Metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet       of age. His father, the Minister G—, died young. His mother, the       Lady Mary, followed him quickly after. Frederick was, at that       time, in his fifteenth year. In a city, fifteen years are no long       period—a child may be still a child in his third lustrum: but in       a wilderness—in so magnificent a wilderness as that old       principality, fifteen years have a far deeper meaning.        From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of       his father, the young Baron, at the decease of the former,       entered immediately upon his vast possessions. Such estates were       seldom held before by a nobleman of Hungary. His castles were       without number. The chief in point of splendor and extent was the       “Château Metzengerstein.” The boundary line of his dominions was       never clearly defined; but his principal park embraced a circuit       of fifty miles.        Upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character so       well known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was       afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct. And, indeed,       for the space of three days, the behavior of the heir out-Heroded       Herod, and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most       enthusiastic admirers. Shameful debaucheries—flagrant       treacheries—unheard-of atrocities—gave his trembling vassals       quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part—no       punctilios of conscience on his own—were thenceforward to prove       any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula.       On the night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle       Berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous       opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to       the already hideous list of the Baron’s misdemeanors and       enormities.        But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young       nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast       and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of       Metzengerstein. The rich although faded tapestry hangings which       swung gloomily upon the walls, represented the shadowy and       majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors. _Here_,       rich-ermined priests, and pontifical dignitaries, familiarly       seated with the autocrat and the sovereign, put a veto on the       wishes of a temporal king, or restrained with the fiat of papal       supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the Arch-enemy. _There_, the       dark, tall statures of the Princes Metzengerstein—their muscular       war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes—startled       the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression; and _here_,       again, the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames of days       gone by, floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the       strains of imaginary melody.        But as the Baron listened, or affected to listen, to the       gradually increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing—or       perhaps pondered upon some more novel, some more decided act of       audacity—his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an       enormous, and unnaturally colored horse, represented in the       tapestry as belonging to a Saracen ancestor of the family of his       rival. The horse itself, in the foreground of the design, stood       motionless and statue-like—while farther back, its discomfited       rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein.        On Frederick’s lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became       aware of the direction which his glance had, without his       consciousness, assumed. Yet he did not remove it. On the       contrary, he could by no means account for the overwhelming       anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses. It       was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent       feelings with the certainty of being awake. The longer he gazed       the more absorbing became the spell—the more impossible did it       appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the       fascination of that tapestry. But the tumult without becoming       suddenly more violent, with a compulsory exertion he diverted his       attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming       stables upon the windows of the apartment.        The action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned       mechanically to the wall. To his extreme horror and astonishment,       the head of the gigantic steed had, in the meantime, altered its       position. The neck of the animal, before arched, as if in       compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord, was now       extended, at full length, in the direction of the Baron. The       eyes, before invisible, now wore an energetic and human       expression, while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and       the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full       view his gigantic and disgusting teeth.        Stupefied with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door.       As he threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the       chamber, flung his shadow with a clear outline against the       quivering tapestry, and he shuddered to perceive that shadow—as       he staggered awhile upon the threshold—assuming the exact       position, and precisely filling up the contour, of the relentless       and triumphant murderer of the Saracen Berlifitzing.        To lighten the depression of his spirits, the Baron hurried into       the open air. At the principal gate of the palace he encountered       three equerries. With much difficulty, and at the imminent peril       of their lives, they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a       gigantic and fiery-colored horse.        “Whose horse? Where did you get him?” demanded the youth, in a       querulous and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware       that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very       counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes.        “He is your own property, sire,” replied one of the equerries,       “at least he is claimed by no other owner. We caught him flying,       all smoking and foaming with rage, from the burning stables of       the Castle Berlifitzing. Supposing him to have belonged to the       old Count’s stud of foreign horses, we led him back as an estray.       But the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature; which is       strange, since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow       escape from the flames.        “The letters W. V. B. are also branded very distinctly on his       forehead,” interrupted a second equerry, “I supposed them, of       course, to be the initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing—but all at       the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse.”        “Extremely singular!” said the young Baron, with a musing air,       and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words. “He is,       as you say, a remarkable horse—a prodigious horse! although, as       you very justly observe, of a suspicious and untractable       character; let him be mine, however,” he added, after a pause,       “perhaps a rider like Frederick of Metzengerstein, may tame even       the devil from the stables of Berlifitzing.”        “You are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as I think we mentioned,       is _not_ from the stables of the Count. If such had been the       case, we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence       of a noble of your family.”        “True!” observed the Baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of       the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and       a precipitate step. He whispered into his master’s ear an account       of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry,       in an apartment which he designated; entering, at the same time,       into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character; but       from the low tone of voice in which these latter were       communicated, nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of       the equerries.        The young Frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a       variety of emotions. He soon, however, recovered his composure,       and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his       countenance, as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber       should be immediately locked up, and the key placed in his own       possession.        “Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter       Berlifitzing?” said one of his vassals to the Baron, as, after       the departure of the page, the huge steed which that nobleman had       adopted as his own, plunged and curvetted, with redoubled fury,       down the long avenue which extended from the château to the       stables of Metzengerstein.        “No!” said the Baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker, “dead!       say you?”        “It is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will       be, I imagine, no unwelcome intelligence.”        A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener. “How       died he?”        “In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his       hunting stud, he has himself perished miserably in the flames.”        “I-n-d-e-e-d-!” ejaculated the Baron, as if slowly and       deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea.        “Indeed;” repeated the vassal.        “Shocking!” said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the       château.        From this date a marked alteration took place in the outward       demeanor of the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von       Metzengerstein. Indeed, his behavior disappointed every       expectation, and proved little in accordance with the views of       many a manoeuvering mamma; while his habits and manner, still       less than formerly, offered any thing congenial with those of the       neighboring aristocracy. He was never to be seen beyond the       limits of his own domain, and, in this wide and social world, was       utterly companionless—unless, indeed, that unnatural, impetuous,       and fiery-colored horse, which he henceforward continually       bestrode, had any mysterious right to the title of his friend.        Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long       time, however, periodically came in. “Will the Baron honor our       festivals with his presence?” “Will the Baron join us in a       hunting of the boar?”—“Metzengerstein does not hunt;”       “Metzengerstein will not attend,” were the haughty and laconic       answers.        These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious       nobility. Such invitations became less cordial—less frequent—in       time they ceased altogether. The widow of the unfortunate Count       Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope “that the Baron       might be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he       disdained the company of his equals; and ride when he did not       wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a horse.” This to       be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and       merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to       become, when we desire to be unusually energetic.        The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the       conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for       the untimely loss of his parents—forgetting, however, his       atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period       immediately succeeding that bereavement. Some there were, indeed,       who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity.       Others again (among them may be mentioned the family physician)       did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary       ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were       current among the multitude.        Indeed, the Baron’s perverse attachment to his lately-acquired       charger—an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from       every fresh example of the animal’s ferocious and demon-like       propensities—at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men,       a hideous and unnatural fervor. In the glare of noon—at the dead       hour of night—in sickness or in health—in calm or in tempest—the       young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that       colossal horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded       with his own spirit.        There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late       events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania       of the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed. The space       passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and       was found to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest       expectations of the most imaginative. The Baron, besides, had no       particular _name_ for the animal, although all the rest in his       collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations. His       stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with       regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the       owner in person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the       enclosure of that particular stall. It was also to be observed,       that although the three grooms, who had caught the steed as he       fled from the conflagration at Berlifitzing, had succeeded in       arresting his course, by means of a chain-bridle and noose—yet no       one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had,       during that dangerous struggle, or at any period thereafter,       actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast. Instances of       peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and       high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting       unreasonable attention—especially among men who, daily trained to       the labors of the chase, might appear well acquainted with the       sagacity of a horse—but there were certain circumstances which       intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and       phlegmatic; and it is said there were times when the animal       caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from       the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp—times when       the young Metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the       rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human-looking       eye.        Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, none were found to       doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on       the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his       horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little       page, whose deformities were in everybody’s way, and whose       opinions were of the least possible importance. He—if his ideas       are worth mentioning at all—had the effrontery to assert that his       master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and       almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from       every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of       triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance.        One tempestuous night, Metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy       slumber, descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting       in hot haste, bounded away into the mazes of the forest. An       occurrence so common attracted no particular attention, but his       return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his       domestics, when, after some hours’ absence, the stupendous and       magnificent battlements of the Chateau Metzengerstein, were       discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation, under       the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire.        As the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a       progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building       were evidently futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly       around in silent and pathetic wonder. But a new and fearful       object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude, and proved       how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings       of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony, than that brought       about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter.        Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the       main entrance of the Château Metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an       unbonneted and disordered rider, was seen leaping with an       impetuosity which outstripped the very Demon of the Tempest.        The career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part,       uncontrollable. The agony of his countenance, the convulsive       struggle of his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but       no sound, save a solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated       lips, which were bitten through and through in the intensity of       terror. One instant, and the clattering of hoofs resounded       sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the       shrieking of the winds—another, and, clearing at a single plunge       the gate-way and the moat, the steed bounded far up the tottering       staircases of the palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid       the whirlwind of chaotic fire.        The fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm       sullenly succeeded. A white flame still enveloped the building       like a shroud, and, streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere,       shot forth a glare of preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke       settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal       figure of—_a horse_.     THE SYSTEM OF DOCTOR TARR AND PROFESSOR FETHER         During the autumn of 18—, while on a tour through the extreme       southern provinces of France, my route led me within a few miles       of a certain _Maison de Santé_ or private mad-house, about which       I had heard much, in Paris, from my medical friends. As I had       never visited a place of the kind, I thought the opportunity too       good to be lost; and so proposed to my travelling companion (a       gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance a few days       before), that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look       through the establishment. To this he objected—pleading haste in       the first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the       sight of a lunatic. He begged me, however, not to let any mere       courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my       curiosity, and said that he would ride on leisurely, so that I       might overtake him during the day, or, at all events, during the       next. As he bade me good-bye, I bethought me that there might be       some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises, and       mentioned my fears on this point. He replied that, in fact,       unless I had personal knowledge of the superintendent, Monsieur       Maillard, or some credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty       might be found to exist, as the regulations of these private       mad-houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws. For       himself, he added, he had, some years since, made the       acquaintance of Maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride       up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the       subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house.        I thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a       grass-grown by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself       in a dense forest, clothing the base of a mountain. Through this       dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles, when the _Maison de       Santé_ came in view. It was a fantastic château, much       dilapidated, and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and       neglect. Its aspect inspired me with absolute dread, and,       checking my horse, I half resolved to turn back. I soon, however,       grew ashamed of my weakness, and proceeded.        As we rode up to the gate-way, I perceived it slightly open, and       the visage of a man peering through. In an instant afterward,       this man came forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him       cordially by the hand, and begged him to alight. It was Monsieur       Maillard himself. He was a portly, fine-looking gentleman of the       old school, with a polished manner, and a certain air of gravity,       dignity, and authority which was very impressive.        My friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect       the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard’s assurance       that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and I saw       him no more.        When he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and       exceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of       refined taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical       instruments. A cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth. At a piano,       singing an aria from Bellini, sat a young and very beautiful       woman, who, at my entrance, paused in her song, and received me       with graceful courtesy. Her voice was low, and her whole manner       subdued. I thought, too, that I perceived the traces of sorrow in       her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste, not       unpleasingly, pale. She was attired in deep mourning, and excited       in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and       admiration.        I had heard, at Paris, that the institution of Monsieur Maillard       was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the “system of       soothing”—that all punishments were avoided—that even confinement       was seldom resorted to—that the patients, while secretly watched,       were left much apparent liberty, and that most of them were       permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary       apparel of persons in right mind.        Keeping these impressions in view, I was cautious in what I said       before the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane;       and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her       eyes which half led me to imagine she was not. I confined my       remarks, therefore, to general topics, and to such as I thought       would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic. She       replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I said; and       even her original observations were marked with the soundest good       sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had       taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and I       continued to practise, throughout the interview, the caution with       which I commenced it.        Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit,       wine, and other refreshments, of which I partook, the lady soon       afterward leaving the room. As she departed I turned my eyes in       an inquiring manner toward my host.        “No,” he said, “oh, no—a member of my family—my niece, and a most       accomplished woman.”        “I beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion,” I replied, “but of       course you will know how to excuse me. The excellent       administration of your affairs here is well understood in Paris,       and I thought it just possible, you know—”        “Yes, yes—say no more—or rather it is myself who should thank you       for the commendable prudence you have displayed. We seldom find       so much of forethought in young men; and, more than once, some       unhappy contre-temps has occurred in consequence of       thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors. While my former       system was in operation, and my patients were permitted the       privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were often aroused       to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to       inspect the house. Hence I was obliged to enforce a rigid system       of exclusion; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose       discretion I could not rely.”        “While your former system was in operation!” I said, repeating       his words—“do I understand you, then, to say that the ‘soothing       system’ of which I have heard so much is no longer in force?”        “It is now,” he replied, “several weeks since we have concluded       to renounce it forever.”        “Indeed! you astonish me!”        “We found it, sir,” he said, with a sigh, “absolutely necessary       to return to the old usages. The danger of the soothing system       was, at all times, appalling; and its advantages have been much       overrated. I believe, sir, that in this house it has been given a       fair trial, if ever in any. We did every thing that rational       humanity could suggest. I am sorry that you could not have paid       us a visit at an earlier period, that you might have judged for       yourself. But I presume you are conversant with the soothing       practice—with its details.”        “Not altogether. What I have heard has been at third or fourth       hand.”        “I may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which       the patients were _menagés_—humored. We contradicted no fancies       which entered the brains of the mad. On the contrary, we not only       indulged but encouraged them; and many of our most permanent       cures have been thus effected. There is no argument which so       touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad       absurdum. We have had men, for example, who fancied themselves       chickens. The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact—to       accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it       to be a fact—and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week       than that which properly appertains to a chicken. In this manner       a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders.”        “But was this species of acquiescence all?”        “By no means. We put much faith in amusements of a simple kind,       such as music, dancing, gymnastic exercises generally, cards,       certain classes of books, and so forth. We affected to treat each       individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder; and the       word ‘lunacy’ was never employed. A great point was to set each       lunatic to guard the actions of all the others. To repose       confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman, is to       gain him body and soul. In this way we were enabled to dispense       with an expensive body of keepers.”        “And you had no punishments of any kind?”        “None.”        “And you never confined your patients?”        “Very rarely. Now and then, the malady of some individual growing       to a crisis, or taking a sudden turn of fury, we conveyed him to       a secret cell, lest his disorder should infect the rest, and       there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends—for with       the raging maniac we have nothing to do. He is usually removed to       the public hospitals.”        “And you have now changed all this—and you think for the better?”        “Decidedly. The system had its disadvantages, and even its       dangers. It is now, happily, exploded throughout all the _Maisons       de Santé_ of France.”        “I am very much surprised,” I said, “at what you tell me; for I       made sure that, at this moment, no other method of treatment for       mania existed in any portion of the country.”        “You are young yet, my friend,” replied my host, “but the time       will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is       going on in the world, without trusting to the gossip of others.       Believe nothing you hear, and only one-half that you see. Now       about our _Maisons de Santé_, it is clear that some ignoramus has       misled you. After dinner, however, when you have sufficiently       recovered from the fatigue of your ride, I will be happy to take       you over the house, and introduce to you a system which, in my       opinion, and in that of every one who has witnessed its       operation, is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised.”        “Your own?” I inquired—“one of your own invention?”        “I am proud,” he replied, “to acknowledge that it is—at least in       some measure.”        In this manner I conversed with Monsieur Maillard for an hour or       two, during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of       the place.        “I cannot let you see my patients,” he said, “just at present. To       a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in       such exhibitions; and I do not wish to spoil your appetite for       dinner. We will dine. I can give you some veal a la Menehoult,       with cauliflowers in _velouté_ sauce—after that a glass of Clos       de Vougeot—then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied.”        At six, dinner was announced; and my host conducted me into a       large _salle à manger_, where a very numerous company were       assembled—twenty-five or thirty in all. They were, apparently,       people of rank—certainly of high breeding—although their       habiliments, I thought, were extravagantly rich, partaking       somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the _vielle       cour_. I noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were       ladies; and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what       a Parisian would consider good taste at the present day. Many       females, for example, whose age could not have been less than       seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings,       bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms       shamefully bare. I observed, too, that very few of the dresses       were well made—or, at least, that very few of them fitted the       wearers. In looking about, I discovered the interesting girl to       whom Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but       my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale,       with high-heeled shoes, and a dirty cap of Brussels lace, so much       too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive       expression. When I had first seen her, she was attired, most       becomingly, in deep mourning. There was an air of oddity, in       short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first,       caused me to recur to my original idea of the “soothing system,”       and to fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive       me until after dinner, that I might experience no uncomfortable       feelings during the repast, at finding myself dining with       lunatics; but I remembered having been informed, in Paris, that       the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people,       with a vast number of antiquated notions; and then, too, upon       conversing with several members of the company, my apprehensions       were immediately and fully dispelled.        The dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable       and of good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about       it. For example, the floor was uncarpeted; in France, however, a       carpet is frequently dispensed with. The windows, too, were       without curtains; the shutters, being shut, were securely       fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally, after the fashion of       our ordinary shop-shutters. The apartment, I observed, formed, in       itself, a wing of the château, and thus the windows were on three       sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other. There       were no less than ten windows in all.        The table was superbly set out. It was loaded with plate, and       more than loaded with delicacies. The profusion was absolutely       barbaric. There were meats enough to have feasted the Anakim.       Never, in all my life, had I witnessed so lavish, so wasteful an       expenditure of the good things of life. There seemed very little       taste, however, in the arrangements; and my eyes, accustomed to       quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a       multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were       deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was       possible to find a place. There were several active servants in       attendance; and, upon a large table, at the farther end of the       apartment, were seated seven or eight people with fiddles, fifes,       trombones, and a drum. These fellows annoyed me very much, at       intervals, during the repast, by an infinite variety of noises,       which were intended for music, and which appeared to afford much       entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself.        Upon the whole, I could not help thinking that there was much of       the bizarre about every thing I saw—but then the world is made up       of all kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts       of conventional customs. I had travelled, too, so much, as to be       quite an adept at the nil admirari; so I took my seat very coolly       at the right hand of my host, and, having an excellent appetite,       did justice to the good cheer set before me.        The conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general. The       ladies, as usual, talked a great deal. I soon found that nearly       all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of       good-humored anecdote in himself. He seemed quite willing to       speak of his position as superintendent of a_Maison de Santé_;       and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was, much to my surprise, a       favorite one with all present. A great many amusing stories were       told, having reference to the _whims_ of the patients.        “We had a fellow here once,” said a fat little gentleman, who sat       at my right,—“a fellow that fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the       way, is it not especially singular how often this particular       crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic? There is scarcely       an insane asylum in France which cannot supply a human tea-pot.       Our gentleman was a Britannia-ware tea-pot, and was careful to       polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting.”        “And then,” said a tall man just opposite, “we had here, not long       ago, a person who had taken it into his head that he was a       donkey—which allegorically speaking, you will say, was quite       true. He was a troublesome patient; and we had much ado to keep       him within bounds. For a long time he would eat nothing but       thistles; but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon       his eating nothing else. Then he was perpetually kicking out his       heels—so—so—”        “Mr. De Kock! I will thank you to behave yourself!” here       interrupted an old lady, who sat next to the speaker. “Please       keep your feet to yourself! You have spoiled my brocade! Is it       necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?       Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this. Upon       my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate       imagined himself. Your acting is very natural, as I live.”        “Mille pardons! Ma’m’selle!” replied Monsieur De Kock, thus       addressed—“a thousand pardons! I had no intention of offending.       Ma’m’selle Laplace—Monsieur De Kock will do himself the honor of       taking wine with you.”        Here Monsieur De Kock bowed low, kissed his hand with much       ceremony, and took wine with Ma’m’selle Laplace.        “Allow me, mon ami,” now said Monsieur Maillard, addressing       myself, “allow me to send you a morsel of this veal _à la St.       Menehoult_—you will find it particularly fine.”        At this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in       depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish, or trencher,       containing what I supposed to be the “_monstrum, horrendum,       informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum_.” A closer scrutiny assured       me, however, that it was only a small calf roasted whole, and set       upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as is the English       fashion of dressing a hare.        “Thank you, no,” I replied; “to say the truth, I am not       particularly partial to veal _à la St_.—what is it?—for I do not       find that it altogether agrees with me. I will change my plate,       however, and try some of the rabbit.”        There were several side-dishes on the table, containing what       appeared to be the ordinary French rabbit—a very delicious       morceau, which I can recommend.        “Pierre,” cried the host, “change this gentleman’s plate, and       give him a side-piece of this rabbit au-chat.”        “This what?” said I.        “This rabbit _au-chat_.”        “Why, thank you—upon second thoughts, no. I will just help myself       to some of the ham.”        There is no knowing what one eats, thought I to myself, at the       tables of these people of the province. I will have none of their       rabbit _au-chat_—and, for the matter of that, none of their       _cat-au-rabbit_ either.        “And then,” said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of       the table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had       been broken off,—“and then, among other oddities, we had a       patient, once upon a time, who very pertinaciously maintained       himself to be a Cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in       his hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the       middle of his leg.”        “He was a great fool, beyond doubt,” interposed some one, “but       not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know,       with the exception of this strange gentleman. I mean the man who       took himself for a bottle of champagne, and always went off with       a pop and a fizz, in this fashion.”        Here the speaker, very rudely, as I thought, put his right thumb       in his left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the       popping of a cork, and then, by a dexterous movement of the       tongue upon the teeth, created a sharp hissing and fizzing, which       lasted for several minutes, in imitation of the frothing of       champagne. This behavior, I saw plainly, was not very pleasing to       Monsieur Maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the       conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig.        “And then there was an ignoramus,” said he, “who mistook himself       for a frog, which, by the way, he resembled in no little degree.       I wish you could have seen him, sir,”—here the speaker addressed       myself—“it would have done your heart good to see the natural       airs that he put on. Sir, if that man was not a frog, I can only       observe that it is a pity he was not. His croak       thus—o-o-o-o-gh—o-o-o-o-gh! was the finest note in the world—B       flat; and when he put his elbows upon the table thus—after taking       a glass or two of wine—and distended his mouth, thus, and rolled       up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive rapidity, thus,       why then, sir, I take it upon myself to say, positively, that you       would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man.”        “I have no doubt of it,” I said.        “And then,” said somebody else, “then there was Petit Gaillard,       who thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed       because he could not take himself between his own finger and       thumb.”        “And then there was Jules Desoulières, who was a very singular       genius, indeed, and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin.       He persecuted the cook to make him up into pies—a thing which the       cook indignantly refused to do. For my part, I am by no means       sure that a pumpkin pie _à la Desoulières_ would not have been       very capital eating indeed!”        “You astonish me!” said I; and I looked inquisitively at Monsieur       Maillard.        “Ha! ha! ha!” said that gentleman—“he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho!       ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!—very good indeed! You must not be astonished,       _mon ami;_ our friend here is a wit—a _drôle_—you must not       understand him to the letter.”        “And then,” said some other one of the party,—“then there was       Bouffon Le Grand—another extraordinary personage in his way. He       grew deranged through love, and fancied himself possessed of two       heads. One of these he maintained to be the head of Cicero; the       other he imagined a composite one, being Demosthenes’ from the       top of the forehead to the mouth, and Lord Brougham’s from the       mouth to the chin. It is not impossible that he was wrong; but he       would have convinced you of his being in the right; for he was a       man of great eloquence. He had an absolute passion for oratory,       and could not refrain from display. For example, he used to leap       upon the dinner-table thus, and—and—”        Here a friend, at the side of the speaker, put a hand upon his       shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear; upon which he       ceased talking with great suddenness, and sank back within his       chair.        “And then,” said the friend who had whispered, “there was       Boullard, the tee-totum. I call him the tee-totum because, in       fact, he was seized with the droll, but not altogether       irrational, crotchet, that he had been converted into a       tee-totum. You would have roared with laughter to see him spin.       He would turn round upon one heel by the hour, in this       manner—so—”        Here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper,       performed an exactly similar office for himself.        “But then,” cried the old lady, at the top of her voice, “your       Monsieur Boullard was a madman, and a very silly madman at best;       for who, allow me to ask you, ever heard of a human tee-totum?       The thing is absurd. Madame Joyeuse was a more sensible person,       as you know. She had a crotchet, but it was instinct with common       sense, and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her       acquaintance. She found, upon mature deliberation, that, by some       accident, she had been turned into a chicken-cock; but, as such,       she behaved with propriety. She flapped her wings with prodigious       effect—so—so—so—and, as for her crow, it was delicious!       Cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-de-doo       dooo-do-o-o-o-o-o-o!”        “Madame Joyeuse, I will thank you to behave yourself!” here       interrupted our host, very angrily. “You can either conduct       yourself as a lady should do, or you can quit the table       forthwith—take your choice.”        The lady (whom I was much astonished to hear addressed as Madame       Joyeuse, after the description of Madame Joyeuse she had just       given) blushed up to the eyebrows, and seemed exceedingly abashed       at the reproof. She hung down her head, and said not a syllable       in reply. But another and younger lady resumed the theme. It was       my beautiful girl of the little parlor.        “Oh, Madame Joyeuse was a fool!” she exclaimed, “but there was       really much sound sense, after all, in the opinion of Eugénie       Salsafette. She was a very beautiful and painfully modest young       lady, who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent, and       wished to dress herself, always, by getting outside instead of       inside of her clothes. It is a thing very easily done, after all.       You have only to do so—and then so—so—so—and then so—so—so—and       then so—so—and then—”        “Mon dieu! Ma’m’selle Salsafette!” here cried a dozen voices at       once. “What are you about?—forbear!—that is sufficient!—we see,       very plainly, how it is done!—hold! hold!” and several persons       were already leaping from their seats to withhold Ma’m’selle       Salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the Medicean       Venus, when the point was very effectually and suddenly       accomplished by a series of loud screams, or yells, from some       portion of the main body of the _château_.        My nerves were very much affected, indeed, by these yells; but       the rest of the company I really pitied. I never saw any set of       reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life. They all       grew as pale as so many corpses, and, shrinking within their       seats, sat quivering and gibbering with terror, and listening for       a repetition of the sound. It came again—louder and seemingly       nearer—and then a third time very loud, and then a fourth time       with a vigor evidently diminished. At this apparent dying away of       the noise, the spirits of the company were immediately regained,       and all was life and anecdote as before. I now ventured to       inquire the cause of the disturbance.        “A mere _bagatelle_,” said Monsieur Maillard. “We are used to       these things, and care really very little about them. The       lunatics, every now and then, get up a howl in concert; one       starting another, as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at       night. It occasionally happens, however, that the _concerto_       yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose;       when, of course, some little danger is to be apprehended.”        “And how many have you in charge?”        “At present we have not more than ten, altogether.”        “Principally females, I presume?”        “Oh, no—every one of them men, and stout fellows, too, I can tell       you.”        “Indeed! I have always understood that the majority of lunatics       were of the gentler sex.”        “It is generally so, but not always. Some time ago, there were       about twenty-seven patients here; and, of that number, no less       than eighteen were women; but, lately, matters have changed very       much, as you see.”        “Yes—have changed very much, as you see,” here interrupted the       gentleman who had broken the shins of Ma’m’selle Laplace.        “Yes—have changed very much, as you see!” chimed in the whole       company at once.        “Hold your tongues, every one of you!” said my host, in a great       rage. Whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for       nearly a minute. As for one lady, she obeyed Monsieur Maillard to       the letter, and thrusting out her tongue, which was an       excessively long one, held it very resignedly, with both hands,       until the end of the entertainment.        “And this gentlewoman,” said I, to Monsieur Maillard, bending       over and addressing him in a whisper—“this good lady who has just       spoken, and who gives us the cock-a-doodle-de-doo—she, I presume,       is harmless—quite harmless, eh?”        “Harmless!” ejaculated he, in unfeigned surprise, “why—why, what       can you mean?”        “Only slightly touched?” said I, touching my head. “I take it for       granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected,       eh?”        “_Mon dieu!_ what is it you imagine? This lady, my particular old       friend Madame Joyeuse, is as absolutely sane as myself. She has       her little eccentricities, to be sure—but then, you know, all old       women—all _very_ old women—are more or less eccentric!”        “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure—and then the rest of these       ladies and gentlemen—”        “Are my friends and keepers,” interupted Monsieur Maillard,       drawing himself up with _hauteur_,—“my very good friends and       assistants.”        “What! all of them?” I asked,—“the women and all?”        “Assuredly,” he said,—“we could not do at all without the women;       they are the best lunatic nurses in the world; they have a way of       their own, you know; their bright eyes have a marvellous       effect—something like the fascination of the snake, you know.”        “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure! They behave a little odd,       eh?—they are a little queer, eh?—don’t you think so?”        “Odd!—queer!—why, do you really think so? We are not very       prudish, to be sure, here in the South—do pretty much as we       please—enjoy life, and all that sort of thing, you know—”        “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure.”        “And then, perhaps, this Clos de Vougeot is a little heady, you       know—a little strong—you understand, eh?”        “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure. By the bye, Monsieur, did I       understand you to say that the system you have adopted, in place       of the celebrated soothing system, was one of very rigorous       severity?”        “By no means. Our confinement is necessarily close; but the       treatment—the medical treatment, I mean—is rather agreeable to       the patients than otherwise.”        “And the new system is one of your own invention?”        “Not altogether. Some portions of it are referable to Professor       Tarr, of whom you have, necessarily, heard; and, again, there are       modifications in my plan which I am happy to acknowledge as       belonging of right to the celebrated Fether, with whom, if I       mistake not, you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance.”        “I am quite ashamed to confess,” I replied, “that I have never       even heard the names of either gentleman before.”        “Good heavens!” ejaculated my host, drawing back his chair       abruptly, and uplifting his hands. “I surely do not hear you       aright! You did not intend to say, eh? that you had never heard       either of the learned Doctor Tarr, or of the celebrated Professor       Fether?”        “I am forced to acknowledge my ignorance,” I replied; “but the       truth should be held inviolate above all things. Nevertheless, I       feel humbled to the dust, not to be acquainted with the works of       these, no doubt, extraordinary men. I will seek out their       writings forthwith, and peruse them with deliberate care.       Monsieur Maillard, you have really—I must confess it—you have       really—made me ashamed of myself!”        And this was the fact.        “Say no more, my good young friend,” he said kindly, pressing my       hand,—“join me now in a glass of Sauterne.”        We drank. The company followed our example without stint. They       chatted—they jested—they laughed—they perpetrated a thousand       absurdities—the fiddles shrieked—the drum row-de-dowed—the       trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of Phalaris—and the       whole scene, growing gradually worse and worse, as the wines       gained the ascendancy, became at length a sort of pandemonium in       petto. In the meantime, Monsieur Maillard and myself, with some       bottles of Sauterne and Vougeot between us, continued our       conversation at the top of the voice. A word spoken in an       ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice       of a fish from the bottom of Niagara Falls.        “And, sir,” said I, screaming in his ear, “you mentioned       something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old       system of soothing. How is that?”        “Yes,” he replied, “there was, occasionally, very great danger       indeed. There is no accounting for the caprices of madmen; and,       in my opinion as well as in that of Dr. Tarr and Professor       Fether, it is never safe to permit them to run at large       unattended. A lunatic may be ‘soothed,’ as it is called, for a       time, but, in the end, he is very apt to become obstreperous. His       cunning, too, is proverbial and great. If he has a project in       view, he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom; and the       dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity, presents, to the       metaphysician, one of the most singular problems in the study of       mind. When a madman appears thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high       time to put him in a straitjacket.”        “But the danger, my dear sir, of which you were speaking, in your       own experience—during your control of this house—have you had       practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a       lunatic?”        “Here?—in my own experience?—why, I may say, yes. For example:—no       very long while ago, a singular circumstance occurred in this       very house. The ‘soothing system,’ you know, was then in       operation, and the patients were at large. They behaved       remarkably well—especially so—any one of sense might have known       that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact,       that the fellows behaved so remarkably well. And, sure enough,       one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and       foot, and thrown into the cells, where they were attended, as if       they were the lunatics, by the lunatics themselves, who had       usurped the offices of the keepers.”        “You don’t tell me so! I never heard of any thing so absurd in my       life!”        “Fact—it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow—a       lunatic—who, by some means, had taken it into his head that he       had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of       before—of lunatic government, I mean. He wished to give his       invention a trial, I suppose, and so he persuaded the rest of the       patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the       reigning powers.”        “And he really succeeded?”        “No doubt of it. The keepers and kept were soon made to exchange       places. Not that exactly either—for the madmen had been free, but       the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith, and treated, I am       sorry to say, in a very cavalier manner.”        “But I presume a counter-revolution was soon effected. This       condition of things could not have long existed. The country       people in the neighborhood—visitors coming to see the       establishment—would have given the alarm.”        “There you are out. The head rebel was too cunning for that. He       admitted no visitors at all—with the exception, one day, of a       very stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to       be afraid. He let him in to see the place—just by way of       variety,—to have a little fun with him. As soon as he had       gammoned him sufficiently, he let him out, and sent him about his       business.”        “And how long, then, did the madmen reign?”        “Oh, a very long time, indeed—a month certainly—how much longer I       can’t precisely say. In the meantime, the lunatics had a jolly       season of it—that you may swear. They doffed their own shabby       clothes, and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels. The       cellars of the château were well stocked with wine; and these       madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it. They lived       well, I can tell you.”        “And the treatment—what was the particular species of treatment       which the leader of the rebels put into operation?”        “Why, as for that, a madman is not necessarily a fool, as I have       already observed; and it is my honest opinion that his treatment       was a much better treatment than that which it superseded. It was       a very capital system indeed—simple—neat—no trouble at all—in       fact it was delicious—it was—”        Here my host’s observations were cut short by another series of       yells, of the same character as those which had previously       disconcerted us. This time, however, they seemed to proceed from       persons rapidly approaching.        “Gracious heavens!” I ejaculated—“the lunatics have most       undoubtedly broken loose.”        “I very much fear it is so,” replied Monsieur Maillard, now       becoming excessively pale. He had scarcely finished the sentence,       before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the       windows; and, immediately afterward, it became evident that some       persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room.       The door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledge-hammer, and       the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence.        A scene of the most terrible confusion ensued. Monsieur Maillard,       to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the side-board.       I had expected more resolution at his hands. The members of the       orchestra, who, for the last fifteen minutes, had been seemingly       too much intoxicated to do duty, now sprang all at once to their       feet and to their instruments, and, scrambling upon their table,       broke out, with one accord, into, “Yankee Doodle,” which they       performed, if not exactly in tune, at least with an energy       superhuman, during the whole of the uproar.        Meantime, upon the main dining-table, among the bottles and       glasses, leaped the gentleman who, with such difficulty, had been       restrained from leaping there before. As soon as he fairly       settled himself, he commenced an oration, which, no doubt, was a       very capital one, if it could only have been heard. At the same       moment, the man with the teetotum predilection, set himself to       spinning around the apartment, with immense energy, and with arms       outstretched at right angles with his body; so that he had all       the air of a tee-totum in fact, and knocked everybody down that       happened to get in his way. And now, too, hearing an incredible       popping and fizzing of champagne, I discovered at length, that it       proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that       delicate drink during dinner. And then, again, the frog-man       croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every       note that he uttered. And, in the midst of all this, the       continuous braying of a donkey arose over all. As for my old       friend, Madame Joyeuse, I really could have wept for the poor       lady, she appeared so terribly perplexed. All she did, however,       was to stand up in a corner, by the fireplace, and sing out       incessantly at the top of her voice, “Cock-a-doodle-de-dooooooh!”        And now came the climax—the catastrophe of the drama. As no       resistance, beyond whooping and yelling and cock-a-doodling, was       offered to the encroachments of the party without, the ten       windows were very speedily, and almost simultaneously, broken in.       But I shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with       which I gazed, when, leaping through these windows, and down       among us _pêle-mêle_, fighting, stamping, scratching, and       howling, there rushed a perfect army of what I took to be       chimpanzees, ourang-outangs, or big black baboons of the Cape of       Good Hope.        I received a terrible beating—after which I rolled under a sofa       and lay still. After lying there some fifteen minutes, during       which time I listened with all my ears to what was going on in       the room, I came to same satisfactory _dénouement_ of this       tragedy. Monsieur Maillard, it appeared, in giving me the account       of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion, had been       merely relating his own exploits. This gentleman had, indeed,       some two or three years before, been the superintendent of the       establishment, but grew crazy himself, and so became a patient.       This fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced       me. The keepers, ten in number, having been suddenly overpowered,       were first well tarred, then carefully feathered, and then shut       up in underground cells. They had been so imprisoned for more       than a month, during which period Monsieur Maillard had       generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers (which       constituted his “system”), but some bread and abundance of water.       The latter was pumped on them daily. At length, one escaping       through a sewer, gave freedom to all the rest.        The “soothing system,” with important modifications, has been       resumed at the _château;_ yet I cannot help agreeing with       Monsieur Maillard, that his own “treatment” was a very capital       one of its kind. As he justly observed, it was “simple—neat—and       gave no trouble at all—not the least.”        I have only to add that, although I have searched every library       in Europe for the works of Doctor _Tarr_ and Professor _Fether_,       I have, up to the present day, utterly failed in my endeavors at       procuring an edition.     THE LITERARY LIFE OF THINGUM BOB, ESQ.  LATE EDITOR OF THE “GOOSETHERUMFOODLE.” By Himself         I am now growing in years, and—since I understand that       Shakespeare and Mr. Emmons are deceased—it is not impossible that       I may even die. It has occurred to me, therefore, that I may as       well retire from the field of Letters and repose upon my laurels.       But I am ambitious of signalizing my abdication of the literary       sceptre by some important bequest to posterity; and, perhaps, I       cannot do a better thing than just pen for it an account of my       earlier career. My name, indeed, has been so long and so       constantly before the public eye, that I am not only willing to       admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere       excited, but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has       inspired. In fact, it is no more than the duty of him who       achieves greatness to leave behind him, in his ascent, such       landmarks as may guide others to be great. I propose, therefore,       in the present paper, (which I had some idea of calling       “Memoranda to serve for the Literary History of America,”) to       give a detail of those important, yet feeble and tottering first       steps, by which, at length, I attained the high road to the       pinnacle of human renown.        Of one’s very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say much. My       father, Thomas Bob, Esq., stood for many years at the summit of       his profession, which was that of a merchant-barber, in the city       of Smug. His warehouse was the resort of all the principal people       of the place, and especially of the editorial corps—a body which       inspires all about it with profound veneration and awe. For my       own part, I regarded them as gods, and drank in with avidity the       rich wit and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august       mouths during the process of what is styled “lather.” My first       moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that       ever-memorable epoch, when the brilliant conductor of the       “Gad-Fly,” in the intervals of the important process just       mentioned, recited aloud, before a conclave of our apprentices,       an inimitable poem in honor of the “Only Genuine Oil-of-Bob,” (so       called from its talented inventor, my father,) and for which       effusion the editor of the “Fly” was remunerated with a regal       liberality by the firm of Thomas Bob & company, merchant-barbers.        The genius of the stanzas to the “Oil-of-Bob” first breathed into       me, I say, the divine _afflatus_. I resolved at once to become a       great man, and to commence by becoming a great poet. That very       evening I fell upon my knees at the feet of my father.        “Father,” I said, “pardon me!—but I have a soul above lather. It       is my firm intention to cut the shop. I would be an editor—I       would be a poet—I would pen stanzas to the ‘Oil-of-Bob.’ Pardon       me and aid me to be great!”        “My dear Thingum,” replied my father, (I had been christened       Thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed,) “My dear Thingum,”       he said, raising me from my knees by the ears—“Thingum, my boy,       you’re a trump, and take after your father in having a soul. You       have an immense head, too, and it must hold a great many brains.       This I have long seen, and therefore had thoughts of making you a       lawyer. The business, however, has grown ungenteel, and that of a       politician don’t pay. Upon the whole you judge wisely;—the trade       of editor is best:—and if you can be a poet at the same time,—as       most of the editors are, by the by,—why you will kill two birds       with one stone. To encourage you in the beginning of things, I       will allow you a garret; pen, ink, and paper; a rhyming       dictionary; and a copy of the ‘Gad-Fly.’ I suppose you would       scarcely demand any more.”        “I would be an ungrateful villain if I did,” I replied with       enthusiasm. “Your generosity is boundless. I will repay it by       making you the father of a genius.”        Thus ended my conference with the best of men, and immediately       upon its termination, I betook myself with zeal to my poetical       labors; as upon these, chiefly, I founded my hopes of ultimate       elevation to the editorial chair.        In my first attempts at composition I found the stanzas to “The       Oil-of-Bob” rather a draw-back than otherwise. Their splendor       more dazzled than enlightened me. The contemplation of their       excellence tended, naturally, to discourage me by comparison with       my own abortions; so that for a long time I labored in vain. At       length there came into my head one of those exquisitely original       ideas which now and then _will_ permeate the brain of a man of       genius. It was this:—or, rather, thus was it carried into       execution. From the rubbish of an old book-stall, in a very       remote corner of the town, I got together several antique and       altogether unknown or forgotten volumes. The bookseller sold them       to me for a song. From one of these, which purported to be a       translation of one Dante’s “Inferno,” I copied with remarkable       neatness a long passage about a man named Ugolino, who had a       parcel of brats. From another which contained a good many old       plays by some person whose name I forget, I extracted in the same       manner, and with the same care, a great number of lines about       “angels” and “ministers saying grace,” and “goblins damned,” and       more besides of that sort. From a third, which was the       composition of some blind man or other, either a Greek or a       Choctaw—I cannot be at the pains of remembering every trifle       exactly—I took about fifty verses beginning with “Achilles’       wrath,” and “grease,” and something else. From a fourth, which I       recollect was also the work of a blind man, I selected a page or       two all about “hail” and “holy light”; and although a blind man       has no business to write about light, still the verses were       sufficiently good in their way.        Having made fair copies of these poems, I signed every one of       them “Oppodeldoc,” (a fine sonorous name,) and, doing each up       nicely in a separate envelope, I despatched one to each of the       four principal Magazines, with a request for speedy insertion and       prompt pay. The result of this well conceived plan, however, (the       success of which would have saved me much trouble in after life,)       served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled,       and gave the _coup-de-grace_ (as they say in France,) to my       nascent hopes, (as they say in the city of the transcendentals.)        The fact is, that each and every one of the Magazines in       question, gave Mr. “Oppodeldoc” a complete using-up, in the       “Monthly Notices to Correspondents.” The “Hum-Drum” gave him a       dressing after this fashion:        “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has sent us a long _tirade_       concerning a bedlamite whom he styles ‘Ugolino,’ who had a great       many children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed       without their suppers. The whole affair is exceedingly tame—not       to say _flat_. ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is entirely devoid       of imagination—and imagination, in our humble opinion, is not       only the soul of Poesy, but also its very heart. ‘Oppodeldoc,’       (whoever he is,) has the audacity to demand of us, for his       twattle, a ‘speedy insertion and prompt pay.’ We neither insert       nor purchase any stuff of the sort. There can be no doubt,       however, that he would meet with a ready sale for all the       balderdash he can scribble, at the office of either the       ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’”        All this, it must be acknowledged, was very severe upon       “Oppodeldoc”—but the unkindest cut was putting the word Poesy in       small caps. In those five pre-eminent letters what a world of       bitterness is there not involved!        But “Oppodeldoc” was punished with equal severity in the       “Rowdy-Dow,” which spoke thus:        “We have received a most singular and insolent communication from       a person (whoever he is,) signing himself ‘Oppodeldoc’—thus       desecrating the greatness of the illustrious Roman Emperor so       named. Accompanying the letter of ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,)       we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant about       ‘angels and ministers of grace’—rant such as no madman short of a       Nat Lee, or an ‘Oppodeldoc,’ could possibly perpetrate. And for       this trash of trash, we are modestly requested to ‘pay promptly.’       No sir—no! We pay for nothing of _that_ sort. Apply to the       ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’ These       _periodicals_ will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you may       send them—and as undoubtedly _promise_ to pay for it.”        This was bitter indeed upon poor “Oppodeldoc”; but, in this       instance, the weight of the satire falls upon the “Hum-drum,” the       “Lollipop,” and the “Goosetherumfoodle,” who are pungently styled       “_periodicals_”—in Italics, too—a thing that must have cut them       to the heart.        Scarcely less savage was the “Lollipop,” which thus discoursed:        “Some _individual_, who rejoices in the appellation ‘Oppodeldoc,’       (to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often       applied!) has enclosed us some fifty or sixty _verses_ commencing       after this fashion:        Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful spring       Of woes unnumbered, &c., &c., &c., &c.        “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is respectfully informed that       there is not a printer’s devil in our office who is not in the       daily habit of composing better _lines_. Those of ‘Oppodeldoc’       will not _scan_. ‘Oppodeldoc’ should learn to _count_. But why he       should have conceived the idea that _we_, (of all others, _we!_)       would disgrace our pages with his ineffable nonsense, is utterly       beyond comprehension. Why, the absurd twattle is scarcely good       enough for the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the       ‘Goosetherumfoodle’—things that are in the practice of publishing       ‘Mother Goose’s Melodies’ as original lyrics. And ‘Oppodeldoc’       (whoever he is,) has even the assurance to demand _pay_ for this       drivel. Does ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) know—is he aware that       we could not be paid to insert it?”        As I perused this I felt myself growing gradually smaller and       smaller, and when I came to the point at which the editor sneered       at the poem as “verses” there was little more than an ounce of me       left. As for “Oppodeldoc,” I began to experience _compassion_ for       the poor fellow. But the “Goosetherumfoodle” showed, if possible,       less mercy than the “Lollipop.” It was the “Goosetherumfoodle”       that said:        “A wretched poetaster, who signs himself ‘Oppodeldoc,’ is silly       enough to fancy that _we_ will print and _pay for_ a medley of       incoherent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to       us, and which commences with the following most _intelligible_       line:        ‘Hail, Holy Light! Offspring of Heaven, first born.’        “We say, ‘most _intelligible_.’ ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,)       will be kind enough to tell us, perhaps, how ‘_hail_’ can be       ‘_holy light_’ We always regarded it as _frozen rain_. Will he       inform us, also, how frozen rain can be, at one and the same       time, both ‘holy light,’ (whatever that is,) and an       ‘offspring?’—which latter term, (if we understand any thing about       English,) is only employed, with propriety, in reference to small       babies of about six weeks old. But it is preposterous to descant       upon such absurdity—although ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has       the unparalleled effrontery to suppose that we will not only       ‘insert’ his ignorant ravings, but (absolutely) _pay for them!_        “Now this is fine—it is rich!—and we have half a mind to punish       this young scribbler for his egotism, by really publishing his       effusion, _verbatim et literatim_, as he has written it. We could       inflict no punishment so severe, and we _would_ inflict it, but       for the boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing.        “Let ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) send any future _composition_       of like character to the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the       ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ _They_ will ‘insert’ it. _They_ ‘insert’ every month       just such stuff. Send it to them. WE are not to be insulted with       impunity.”        This made an end of me; and as for the “Hum-Drum,” the       “Rowdy-Dow,” and the “Lollipop,” I never could comprehend how       they survived it. The putting _them_ in the smallest possible       _minion_, (that was the rub—thereby insinuating their       lowness—their baseness,) while WE stood looking down upon them in       gigantic capitals!—oh it was _too_ bitter!—it was wormwood—it was       gall. Had I been either of these periodicals I would have spared       no pains to have the “Goosetherumfoodle” prosecuted.
