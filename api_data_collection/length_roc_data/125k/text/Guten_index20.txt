PARADISE LOST   A POEM  Written in TEN BOOKS  by John Milton           Contents                   BOOK I                 BOOK II                 BOOK III                 BOOK IV                 BOOK V                 BOOK VI                 BOOK VII                 BOOK VIII                 BOOK IX                 BOOK X           BOOK I.  Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, With loss of _Eden_, till one greater Man Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, Sing Heav’nly Muse, that on the secret top Of _Oreb_, or of _Sinai_, didst inspire That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed, In the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth Rose out of _Chaos_: Or if _Sion_ Hill Delight thee more, and _Siloa’s_ Brook that flow’d Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song, That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th’ _Aonian_ Mount, while it pursues Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime. And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer Before all Temples th’ upright heart and pure, Instruct me, for Thou know’st; Thou from the first Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss And mad’st it pregnant: What in me is dark Illumine, what is low raise and support; That to the highth of this great Argument I may assert th’ Eternal Providence, And justifie the wayes of God to men.  Say first, for Heav’n hides nothing from thy view Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause Mov’d our Grand Parents in that happy State, Favour’d of Heav’n so highly, to fall off From their Creator, and transgress his Will For one restraint, Lords of the World besides? Who first seduc’d them to that fowl revolt? Th’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv’d The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride Had cast him out from Heav’n, with all his Host Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring To set himself in Glory above his Peers, He trusted to have equal’d the most High, If he oppos’d; and with ambitious aim Against the Throne and Monarchy of God Rais’d impious War in Heav’n and Battel proud With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power Hurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie With hideous ruine and combustion down To bottomless perdition, there to dwell In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire, Who durst defie th’ Omnipotent to Arms. Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night To mortal men, he with his horrid crew Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe Confounded though immortal: But his doom Reserv’d him to more wrath; for now the thought Both of lost happiness and lasting pain Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes That witness’d huge affliction and dismay Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate: At once as far as Angels kenn he views The dismal Situation waste and wilde, A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round As one great Furnace flam’d, yet from those flames No light, but rather darkness visible Serv’d only to discover sights of woe, Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace And rest can never dwell, hope never comes That comes to all; but torture without end Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d: Such place Eternal Justice had prepar’d For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain’d In utter darkness, and their portion set As far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n As from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole. O how unlike the place from whence they fell! There the companions of his fall, o’rewhelm’d With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, He soon discerns, and weltring by his side One next himself in power, and next in crime, Long after known in _Palestine_, and nam’d _Beelzebub_.  To whom th’ Arch-Enemy, And thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words Breaking the horrid silence thus began.  If thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d From him, who in the happy Realms of Light Cloth’d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league, United thoughts and counsels, equal hope, And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize, Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest From what highth fal’n, so much the stronger provd He with his Thunder: and till then who knew The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict do I repent or change, Though chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind And high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit, That with the mightiest rais’d me to contend, And to the fierce contention brought along Innumerable force of Spirits arm’d That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring, His utmost power with adverse power oppos’d In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n, And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to be overcome? That Glory never shall his wrath or might Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee, and deifie his power Who from the terrour of this Arm so late Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed, That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods And this Empyreal substance cannot fail, Since through experience of this great event In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t, We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal Warr Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe, Who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.  So spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain, Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: And him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.  O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers, That led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds Fearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King; And put to proof his high Supremacy, Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate, Too well I see and rue the dire event, That with sad overthrow and foul defeat Hath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host In horrible destruction laid thus low, As far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains Invincible, and vigour soon returns, Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state Here swallow’d up in endless misery. But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now Of force believe Almighty, since no less Then such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours) Have left us this our spirit and strength intire Strongly to suffer and support our pains, That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, Or do him mightier service as his thralls By right of Warr, what e’re his business be Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire, Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; What can it then avail though yet we feel Strength undiminisht, or eternal being To undergo eternal punishment? Whereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.  Fall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, To do ought good never will be our task, But ever to do ill our sole delight, As being the contrary to his high will Whom we resist.  If then his Providence Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, Our labour must be to pervert that end, And out of good still to find means of evil; Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb His inmost counsels from their destind aim. But see the angry Victor hath recall’d His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit Back to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice Of Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder, Wing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage, Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. Let us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn, Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, The seat of desolation, voyd of light, Save what the glimmering of these livid flames Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend From off the tossing of these fiery waves, There rest, if any rest can harbour there, And reassembling our afflicted Powers, Consult how we may henceforth most offend Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, How overcome this dire Calamity, What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, If not what resolution from despare.  Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes That sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides Prone on the Flood, extended long and large Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, _Titanian_, or _Earth-born_, that warr’d on _Jove_, _Briarios_ or _Typhon_, whom the Den By ancient _Tarsus_ held, or that Sea-beast _Leviathan_, which God of all his works Created hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream: Him haply slumbring on the _Norway_ foam The Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff, Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay Chain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence Had ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will And high permission of all-ruling Heaven Left him at large to his own dark designs, That with reiterated crimes he might Heap on himself damnation, while he sought Evil to others, and enrag’d might see How all his malice serv’d but to bring forth Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn On Man by him seduc’t, but on himself Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d. Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld In billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale. Then with expanded wings he stears his flight Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land He lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; And such appear’d in hue, as when the force Of subterranean wind transports a Hill Torn from _Pelorus_, or the shatter’d side Of thundring _Aetna_, whose combustible And fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire, Sublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, And leave a singed bottom all involv’d With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate, Both glorying to have scap’t the _Stygian_ flood As Gods, and by their own recover’d strength, Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.  Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat That we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid What shall be right: fardest from him is best Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings A mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time. The mind is its own place, and in it self Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n. What matter where, if I be still the same, And what I should be, all but less then hee Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least We shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n. But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, Th’ associates and copartners of our loss Lye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool, And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy Mansion, or once more With rallied Arms to try what may be yet Regaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?  So _Satan_ spake, and him _Beelzebub_ Thus answer’d.  Leader of those Armies bright, Which but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld, If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge Of battel when it rag’d, in all assaults Their surest signal, they will soon resume New courage and revive, though now they lye Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, As we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d, No wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.  He scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, Behind him cast; the broad circumference Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb Through Optic Glass the _Tuscan_ Artist views At Ev’ning from the top of _Fesole_, Or in _Valdarno_, to descry new Lands, Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine Hewn on _Norwegian_ hills, to be the Mast Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, He walkt with to support uneasie steps Over the burning Marle, not like those steps On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; Nathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks In _Vallombrosa_, where th’ _Etrurian_ shades High overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge Afloat, when with fierce Winds _Orion_ arm’d Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew _Busiris_ and his _Memphian_ Chivalrie, VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d The Sojourners of _Goshen_, who beheld From the safe shore their floating Carkases And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, Under amazement of their hideous change. He call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates, Warriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost, If such astonishment as this can sieze Eternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place After the toyl of Battel to repose Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n? Or in this abject posture have ye sworn To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood With scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon His swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern Th’ advantage, and descending tread us down Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe. Awake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.  They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. Nor did they not perceave the evil plight In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod Of _Amrams_ Son in _Egypts_ evill day Wav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud Of _Locusts_, warping on the Eastern Wind, That ore the Realm of impious _Pharoah_ hung Like Night, and darken’d all the Land of _Nile_: So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell ’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; Till, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear Of their great Sultan waving to direct Thir course, in even ballance down they light On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; A multitude, like which the populous North Pour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass _Rhene_ or the _Danaw_, when her barbarous Sons Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread Beneath _Gibraltar_ to the _Lybian_ sands. Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms Excelling human, Princely Dignities, And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; Though of their Names in heav’nly Records now Be no memorial, blotted out and ras’d By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. Nor had they yet among the Sons of _Eve_ Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, By falsities and lyes the greatest part Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake God their Creator, and th’ invisible Glory of him, that made them, to transform Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold, And Devils to adore for Deities: Then were they known to men by various Names, And various Idols through the Heathen World. Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last, Rous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix Their Seats long after next the Seat of God, Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d Among the Nations round, and durst abide _Jehovah_ thundring out of _Sion_, thron’d Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines, Abominations; and with cursed things His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan’d, And with their darkness durst affront his light. First _Moloch_, horrid King besmear’d with blood Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire To his grim Idol.  Him the _Ammonite_ Worshipt in _Rabba_ and her watry Plain, In _Argob_ and in _Basan_, to the stream Of utmost _Arnon_.  Nor content with such Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart Of _Solomon_ he led by fraud to build His Temple right against the Temple of God On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove The pleasant Vally of _Hinnom_, _Tophet_ thence And black _Gehenna_ call’d, the Type of Hell. Next _Chemos_, th’ obscene dread of _Moabs_ Sons, From _Aroer_ to _Nebo_, and the wild Of Southmost _Abarim_; in _Hesebon_ And _Heronaim_, _Seons_ Realm, beyond The flowry Dale of _Sibma_ clad with Vines, And _Eleale_ to th’ _Asphaltick_ Pool. _Peor_ his other Name, when he entic’d _Israel_ in _Sittim_ on their march from _Nile_ To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove Of _Moloch_ homicide, lust hard by hate; Till good _Josiah_ drove them thence to Hell. With these came they, who from the bordring flood Of old _Euphrates_ to the Brook that parts _Egypt_ from _Syrian_ ground, had general Names Of _Baalim_ and _Ashtaroth_, those male, These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft And uncompounded is their Essence pure, Not ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb, Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose Dilated or condens’t, bright or obscure, Can execute their aerie purposes, And works of love or enmity fulfill. For those the Race of _Israel_ oft forsook Their living strength, and unfrequented left His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low Bow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear Of despicable foes.  With these in troop Came _Astoreth_, whom the _Phoenicians_ call’d _Astarte_, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns; To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon _Sidonian_ Virgins paid their Vows and Songs, In _Sion_ also not unsung, where stood Her Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, Beguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell To Idols foul. _Thammuz_ came next behind, Whose annual wound in _Lebanon_ allur’d The _Syrian_ Damsels to lament his fate In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, While smooth _Adonis_ from his native Rock Ran purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood Of _Thammuz_ yearly wounded: the Love-tale Infected _Sions_ daughters with like heat, Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch _Ezekiel_ saw, when by the Vision led His eye survay’d the dark Idolatries Of alienated _Judah_.  Next came one Who mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark Maim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, Where he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers: _Dagon_ his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high Rear’d in _Azotus_, dreaded through the Coast Of _Palestine_, in _Gath_ and _Ascalon_, And _Accaron_ and _Gaza’s_ frontier bounds. Him follow’d _Rimmon_, whose delightful Seat Was fair _Damscus_, on the fertil Banks Of _Abbana_ and _Pharphar_, lucid streams. He also against the house of God was bold: A Leper once he lost and gain’d a King, _Ahaz_ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew Gods Altar to disparage and displace For one of _Syrian_ mode, whereon to burn His odious offrings, and adore the Gods Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d A crew who under Names of old Renown, _Osiris_, _Isis_, _Orus_ and their Train With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d Fanatic _Egypt_ and her Priests, to seek Thir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms Rather then human.  Nor did _Israel_ scape Th’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d The Calf in _Oreb_: and the Rebel King Doubl’d that sin in _Bethel_ and in _Dan_, Lik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, _Jehovah_, who in one Night when he pass’d From _Egypt_ marching, equal’d with one stroke Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. _Belial_ came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood Or Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest Turns Atheist, as did _Ely’s_ Sons, who fill’d With lust and violence the house of God. In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, And injury and outrage: And when Night Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons Of _Belial_, flown with insolence and wine. Witness the Streets of _Sodom_, and that night In _Gibeah_, when hospitable Dores Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape. These were the prime in order and in might; The rest were long to tell, though far renown’d, Th’ _Ionian_ Gods, of _Javans_ Issue held Gods, yet confest later then Heav’n and Earth Thir boasted Parents; _Titan_ Heav’ns first born With his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d By younger _Saturn_, he from mightier _Jove_ His own and _Rhea’s_ Son like measure found; So _Jove_ usurping reign’d: these first in _Creet_ And _Ida_ known, thence on the Snowy top Of cold _Olympus_ rul’d the middle Air Thir highest Heav’n; or on the _Delphian_ Cliff, Or in _Dodona_, and through all the bounds Of _Doric_ Land; or who with _Saturn_ old Fled over _Adria_ to th’ _Hesperian_ Fields, And ore the _Celtic_ roam’d the utmost Isles. All these and more came flocking; but with looks Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost In loss it self; which on his count’nance cast Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d Their fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears. Then strait commands that at the warlike sound Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d _Azazel_ as his right, a Cherube tall: Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld Th’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d, Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: At which the universal Host upsent A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond Frighted the Reign of _Chaos_ and old Night. All in a moment through the gloom were seen Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air With Orient Colours waving: with them rose A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms Appear’d, and serried Shields in thick array Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move In perfect _Phalanx_ to the Dorian mood Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d To highth of noblest temper Hero’s old Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage Deliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they Breathing united force with fixed thought Mov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d Thir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now Advanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise Of Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield, Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief Had to impose: He through the armed Files Darts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse The whole Battalion views, thir order due, Thir visages and stature as of Gods, Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength Glories: For never since created man, Met such imbodied force, as nam’d with these Could merit more then that small infantry Warr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood Of _Phlegra_ with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d That fought at _Theb’s_ and _Ilium_, on each side Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds In Fable or _Romance_ of _Uthers_ Son Begirt with _British_ and _Armoric_ Knights; And all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel Jousted in _Aspramont_ or _Montalban_, _Damasco_, or _Marocco_, or _Trebisond_, Or whom _Biserta_ sent from _Afric_ shore When _Charlemain_ with all his Peerage fell By _Fontarabbia_.  Thus far these beyond Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d Thir dread Commander: he above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost All her Original brightness, nor appear’d Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess Of Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n Looks through the Horizontal misty Air Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds On half the Nations, and with fear of change Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark’n’d so, yet shon Above them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast Signs of remorse and passion to behold The fellows of his crime, the followers rather (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d For ever now to have their lot in pain, Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t Of Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire Hath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, With singed top their stately growth though bare Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar’d To speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round With all his Peers: attention held them mute. Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn, Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last Words interwove with sighs found out their way.  O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers Matchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife Was not inglorious, though th’ event was dire, As this place testifies, and this dire change Hateful to utter: but what power of mind Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth Of knowledge past or present, could have fear’d, How such united force of Gods, how such As stood like these, could ever know repulse? For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, That all these puissant Legions, whose exile Hath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend Self-rais’d, and repossess their native seat. For me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n, If counsels different, or danger shun’d By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns Monarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, Consent or custome, and his Regal State Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d, Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. Henceforth his might we know, and know our own So as not either to provoke, or dread New warr, provok’t; our better part remains To work in close design, by fraud or guile What force effected not: that he no less At length from us may find, who overcomes By force, hath overcome but half his foe. Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife There went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long Intended to create, and therein plant A generation, whom his choice regard Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: For this Infernal Pit shall never hold Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr Open or understood must be resolv’d.  He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze Far round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s Clash’d on their sounding shields the din of war, Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.  There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top Belch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing’d with speed A numerous Brigad hasten’d.  As when bands Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, Or cast a Rampart.  _Mammon_ led them on, _Mammon_, the least erected Spirit that fell From heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks & thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring more The riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold, Then aught divine or holy else enjoy’d In vision beatific: by him first Men also, and by his suggestion taught, Ransack’d the Center, and with impious hands Rifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew Op’nd into the Hill a spacious wound And dig’d out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell Of _Babel_, and the works of _Memphian_ Kings, Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, And Strength and Art are easily outdone By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour What in an age they with incessant toyle And hands innumerable scarce perform Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d, That underneath had veins of liquid fire Sluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, Severing each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross: A third as soon had form’d within the ground A various mould, and from the boyling cells By strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook, As in an Organ from one blast of wind To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, Built like a Temple, where _Pilasters_ round Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid With Golden Architrave; nor did there want Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n, The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not _Babilon_, Nor great _Alcairo_ such magnificence Equal’d in all thir glories, to inshrine _Belus_ or _Serapis_ thir Gods, or seat Thir Kings, when _Aegypt_ with _Assyria_ strove In wealth and luxurie.  Th’ ascending pile Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores Op’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide Within, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth And level pavement: from the arched roof Pendant by suttle Magic many a row Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed With Naphtha and _Asphaltus_ yeilded light As from a sky.  The hasty multitude Admiring enter’d, and the work some praise And some the Architect: his hand was known In Heav’n by many a Towred structure high, Where Scepter’d Angels held thir residence, And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. Nor was his name unheard or unador’d In ancient Greece; and in _Ausonian_ land Men call’d him _Mulciber_; and how he fell From Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry _Jove_ Sheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, A Summers day; and with the setting Sun Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, On _Lemnos_ th’ _Aegaean_ Ile: thus they relate, Erring; for he with this rebellious rout Fell long before; nor aught avail’d him now To have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape By all his Engins, but was headlong sent With his industrious crew to build in hell. Mean while the winged Haralds by command Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim A solemn Councel forthwith to be held At _Pandaemonium_, the high Capital Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d From every and Band squared Regiment By place or choice the worthiest; they anon With hundreds and with thousands trooping came Attended: all access was throng’d, the Gates And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall (Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold Wont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair Defi’d the best of Panim chivalry To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) Thick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air, Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, New rub’d with Baume, expatiate and confer Thir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd Swarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n, Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race Beyond the _Indian_ Mount, or Faerie Elves, Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms Reduc’d thir shapes immense, and were at large, Though without number still amidst the Hall Of that infernal Court.  But far within And in thir own dimensions like themselves The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim In close recess and secret conclave sat A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s, Frequent and full.  After short silence then And summons read, the great consult began.        THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK.    PARADISE LOST        BOOK II.  High on a Throne of Royal State, which far Outshon the wealth of _Ormus_ and of _Ind_, Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showrs on her Kings _Barbaric_ Pearl & Gold, Satan exalted sat, by merit rais’d To that bad eminence; and from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue Vain Warr with Heav’n, and by success untaught His proud imaginations thus displaid.  Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav’n, For since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall’n, I give not Heav’n for lost.  From this descent Celestial vertues rising, will appear More glorious and more dread then from no fall, And trust themselves to fear no second fate: Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav’n Did first create your Leader, next, free choice, With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss Thus farr at least recover’d, hath much more Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne Yeilded with full consent.  The happier state In Heav’n, which follows dignity, might draw Envy from each inferior; but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain? where there is then no good For which to strive, no strife can grow up there From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell Precedence, none, whose portion is so small Of present pain, that with ambitious mind Will covet more.  With this advantage then To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord, More then can be in Heav’n, we now return To claim our just inheritance of old, Surer to prosper then prosperity Could have assur’d us; and by what best way, Whether of open Warr or covert guile, We now debate; who can advise, may speak.  He ceas’d, and next him _Moloc_, Scepter’d King Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit That fought in Heav’n; now fiercer by despair: His trust was with th’ Eternal to be deem’d Equal in strength, and rather then be less Car’d not to be at all; with that care lost Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.  My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles, More unexpert, I boast not: them let those Contrive who need, or when they need, not now. For while they sit contriving, shall the rest, Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here Heav’ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame, The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns By our delay? no, let us rather choose Arm’d with Hell flames and fury all at once O’re Heav’ns high Towrs to force resistless way, Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see Black fire and horror shot with equal rage Among his Angels; and his Throne it self Mixt with _Tartarean_ Sulphur, and strange fire, His own invented Torments.  But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still, That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat: descent and fall To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brok’n Rear Insulting, and pursu’d us through the Deep, With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low?  Th’ ascent is easie then; Th’ event is fear’d; should we again provoke Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction: if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroy’d: what can be worse Then to dwell here, driv’n out from bliss, condemn’d In this abhorred deep to utter woe; Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge Inexorably, and the torturing houre Calls us to Penance?  More destroy’d then thus We should be quite abolisht and expire. What fear we then? what doubt we to incense His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag’d, Will either quite consume us, and reduce To nothing this essential, happier farr Then miserable to have eternal being: Or if our substance be indeed Divine, And cannot cease to be, we are at worst On this side nothing; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav’n, And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.  He ended frowning, and his look denounc’d Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous To less then Gods.  On th’ other side up rose _Belial_, in act more graceful and humane; A fairer person lost not Heav’n; he seemd For dignity compos’d and high exploit: But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear The better reason, to perplex and dash Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas’d the eare, And with perswasive accent thus began.  I should be much for open Warr, O Peers, As not behind in hate; if what was urg’d Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success: When he who most excels in fact of Arms, In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution, as the scope Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav’n are fill’d With Armed watch, that render all access Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, Scorning surprize.  Or could we break our way By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection, to confound Heav’ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted, and th’ Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire Victorious.  Thus repuls’d, our final hope Is flat despair: we must exasperate Th’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, And that must end us, that must be our cure, To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, Though full of pain, this intellectual being, Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, To perish rather, swallowd up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated night, Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, Let this be good, whether our angry Foe Can give it, or will ever? how he can Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, Belike through impotence, or unaware, To give his Enemies thir wish, and end Them in his anger, whom his anger saves To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, Reserv’d and destin’d to Eternal woe; Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? What when we fled amain, pursu’d and strook With Heav’ns afflicting Thunder, and besought The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem’d A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay Chain’d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. What if the breath that kindl’d those grim fires Awak’d should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the Flames? or from above Should intermitted vengeance Arme again His red right hand to plague us? what if all Her stores were op’n’d, and this Firmament Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire, Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall One day upon our heads; while we perhaps Designing or exhorting glorious Warr, Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl’d Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; There to converse with everlasting groans, Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. Warr therefore, open or conceal’d, alike My voice disswades; for what can force or guile With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye Views all things at one view? he from heav’ns highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides; Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav’n Thus trampl’d, thus expell’d to suffer here Chains & these Torments? better these then worse By my advice; since fate inevitable Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe, Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolv’d, If we were wise, against so great a foe Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold And vent’rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear What yet they know must follow, to endure Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov’d Not mind us not offending, satisfi’d With what is punish’t; whence these raging fires Will slack’n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour, or enur’d not feel, Or chang’d at length, and to the place conformd In temper and in nature, will receive Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future days may bring, what chance, what change Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, If we procure not to our selves more woe.  Thus _Belial_ with words cloath’d in reasons garb Counsel’d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, Not peace: and after him thus _Mammon_ spake.  Either to disinthrone the King of Heav’n We warr, if warr be best, or to regain Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild To fickle Chance, and _Chaos_ judge the strife: The former vain to hope argues as vain The latter: for what place can be for us Within Heav’ns bound, unless Heav’ns Lord supream We overpower?  Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all, on promise made Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble, and receive Strict Laws impos’d, to celebrate his Throne With warbl’d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing Forc’t Halleluiah’s; while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, Our servile offerings.  This must be our task In Heav’n, this our delight; how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue By force impossible, by leave obtain’d Unacceptable, though in Heav’n, our state Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek Our own good from our selves, and from our own Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, Free, and to none accountable, preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse We can create, and in what place so e’re Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain Through labour and endurance.  This deep world Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heav’ns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur’d, And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar Must’ring thir rage, and Heav’n resembles Hell? As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise Magnificence; and what can Heav’n shew more? Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements, these piercing Fires As soft as now severe, our temper chang’d Into their temper; which must needs remove The sensible of pain.  All things invite To peaceful Counsels, and the settl’d State Of order, how in safety best we may Compose our present evils, with regard Of what we are and where, dismissing quite All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.  He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld Th’ Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain The sound of blustring winds, which all night long Had rous’d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay After the Tempest: Such applause was heard As _Mammon_ ended, and his Sentence pleas’d, Advising peace: for such another Field They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear Of Thunder and the Sword of _Michael_ Wrought still within them; and no less desire To found this nether Empire, which might rise By pollicy, and long process of time, In emulation opposite to Heav’n. Which when _Beelzebub_ perceiv’d, then whom, _Satan_ except, none higher sat, with grave Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem’d A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and publick care; And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood With _Atlantean_ shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look Drew audience and attention still as Night Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.  Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav’n, Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now Must we renounce, and changing stile be call’d Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote Inclines, here to continue, and build up here A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, And know not that the King of Heav’n hath doom’d This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt From Heav’ns high jurisdiction, in new League Banded against his Throne, but to remaine In strictest bondage, though thus far remov’d, Under th’ inevitable curb, reserv’d His captive multitude: For he, be sure, In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part By our revolt, but over Hell extend His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav’n. What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr? Warr hath determin’d us, and foild with loss Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none Voutsaf’t or sought; for what peace will be giv’n To us enslav’d, but custody severe, And stripes, and arbitrary punishment Inflicted? and what peace can we return, But to our power hostility and hate, Untam’d reluctance, and revenge though slow, Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heav’n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find Some easier enterprize?  There is a place (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav’n Err not) another World, the happy seat Of som new Race call’d _Man_, about this time To be created like to us, though less In power and excellence, but favour’d more Of him who rules above; so was his will Pronounc’d among the Gods, and by an Oath, That shook Heav’ns whol circumference, confirm’d. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, Or substance, how endu’d, and what thir Power, And where thir weakness, how attempted best, By force or suttlety: Though Heav’n be shut, And Heav’ns high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength, this place may lye expos’d The utmost border of his Kingdom, left To their defence who hold it: here perhaps Som advantagious act may be achiev’d By sudden onset, either with Hell fire To waste his whole Creation, or possess All as our own, and drive as we were driven, The punie habitants, or if not drive, Seduce them to our Party, that thir God May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand Abolish his own works.  This would surpass Common revenge, and interrupt his joy In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise In his disturbance; when his darling Sons Hurl’d headlong to partake with us, shall curse Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss, Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth Attempting, or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain Empires.  Thus _Beelzebub_ Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis’d By _Satan_, and in part propos’d: for whence, But from the Author of all ill could Spring So deep a malice, to confound the race Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve, done all to spite The great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves His glory to augment.  The bold design Pleas’d highly those infernal States, and joy Sparkl’d in all thir eyes; with full assent They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.  Well have ye judg’d, well ended long debate, Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, Great things resolv’d; which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms And opportune excursion we may chance Re-enter Heav’n; or else in some milde Zone Dwell not unvisited of Heav’ns fair Light Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send In search of this new world, whom shall we find Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet The dark unbottom’d infinite Abyss And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight Upborn with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need All circumspection, and we now no less Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, The weight of all and our last hope relies.  This said, he sat; and expectation held His look suspence, awaiting who appeer’d To second, or oppose, or undertake The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each In others count’nance red his own dismay Astonisht: none among the choice and prime Of those Heav’n-warring Champions could be found So hardie as to proffer or accept Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last _Satan_, whom now transcendent glory rais’d Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth, unmov’d thus spake.  O Progeny of Heav’n, Empyreal Thrones, With reason hath deep silence and demurr Seis’d us, though undismaid: long is the way And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light; Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, Outrageous to devour, immures us round Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant Barr’d over us prohibit all egress. These past, if any pass, the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being Threatens him, plung’d in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into what ever world, Or unknown Region, what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, And this Imperial Sov’ranty, adorn’d With splendor, arm’d with power, if aught propos’d And judg’d of public moment, in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterre Me from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour, due alike To him who Reigns, and so much to him due Of hazard more, as he above the rest High honourd sits?  Go therfore mighty powers, Terror of Heav’n, though fall’n; intend at home, While here shall be our home, what best may ease The present misery, and render Hell More tollerable; if there be cure or charm To respite or deceive, or slack the pain Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all: this enterprize None shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose The Monarch, and prevented all reply, Prudent, least from his resolution rais’d Others among the chief might offer now (Certain to be refus’d) what erst they feard; And so refus’d might in opinion stand His rivals, winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn.  But they Dreaded not more th’ adventure then his voice Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; Thir rising all at once was as the sound Of Thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone; and as a God Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav’n: Nor fail’d they to express how much they prais’d, That for the general safety he despis’d His own: for neither do the Spirits damn’d Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, Or close ambition varnisht o’re with zeal. Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o’respread Heav’ns chearful face, the lowring Element Scowls ore the dark’nd lantskip Snow, or showre; If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet Extend his ev’ning beam, the fields revive, The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. O shame to men!  Devil with Devil damn’d Firm concord holds, men onely disagree Of Creatures rational, though under hope Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: As if (which might induce us to accord) Man had not hellish foes anow besides, That day and night for his destruction waite.  The _Stygian_ Councel thus dissolv’d; and forth In order came the grand infernal Peers, Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd Alone th’ Antagonist of Heav’n, nor less Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, And God-like imitated State; him round A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos’d With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. Then of thir Session ended they bid cry With Trumpets regal sound the great result: Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie By Haralds voice explain’d: the hollow Abyss Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell With deafning shout, return’d them loud acclaim. Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais’d By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers Disband, and wandring, each his several way Pursues, as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime Upon the wing, or in swift race contend, As at th’ Olympian Games or _Pythian_ fields; Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wag’d in the troubl’d Skie, and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms From either end of Heav’n the welkin burns. Others with vast _Typhoean_ rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when _Alcides_ from _Oealia_ Crown’d With conquest, felt th’ envenom’d robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots _Thessalian_ Pines, And _Lichas_ from the top of _Oeta_ threw Into th’ _Euboic_ Sea.  Others more milde, Retreated in a silent valley, sing With notes Angelical to many a Harp Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. Thir song was partial, but the harmony (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment The thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) Others apart sat on a Hill retir’d, In thoughts more elevate, and reason’d high Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate, Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. Of good and evil much they argu’d then, Of happiness and final misery, Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm Pain for a while or anguish, and excite Fallacious hope, or arm th’ obdured brest With stubborn patience as with triple steel. Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps Might yeild them easier habitation, bend Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; Abhorred _Styx_ the flood of deadly hate, Sad _Acheron_ of sorrow, black and deep; _Cocytus_, nam’d of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream; fierce _Phlegeton_ Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, _Lethe_ the River of Oblivion roules Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, Forthwith his former state and being forgets, Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Beyond this flood a frozen Continent Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, A gulf profound as that _Serbonian_ Bog Betwixt _Damiata_ and mount _Casius_ old, Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air Burns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of Fire. Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail’d, At certain revolutions all the damn’d Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. They ferry over this _Lethean_ Sound Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, All in one moment, and so neer the brink; But fate withstands, and to oppose th’ attempt _Medusa_ with _Gorgonian_ terror guards The Ford, and of it self the water flies All taste of living wight, as once it fled The lip of _Tantalus_.  Thus roving on In confus’d march forlorn, th’ adventrous Bands With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast View’d first thir lamentable lot, and found No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile They pass’d, and many a Region dolorous, O’re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe, Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, A Universe of death, which God by curse Created evil, for evil only good, Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable, and worse Then Fables yet have feign’d, or fear conceiv’d, _Gorgons_ and _Hydra’s_, and _Chimera’s_ dire.  Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, _Satan_ with thoughts inflam’d of highest design, Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight; som times He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares Up to the fiery concave touring high. As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri’d Hangs in the Clouds, by _Aequinoctial_ Winds Close sailing from _Bengala_, or the Iles Of _Ternate_ and _Tidore_, whence Merchants bring Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood Through the wide _Ethiopian_ to the Cape Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seem’d Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, Impenitrable, impal’d with circling fire, Yet unconsum’d.  Before the Gates there sat On either side a formidable shape; The one seem’d Woman to the waste, and fair, But ended foul in many a scaly fould Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm’d With mortal sting: about her middle round A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark’d With wide _Cerberean_ mouths full loud, and rung A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, If aught disturb’d thir noyse, into her woomb, And kennel there, yet there still bark’d and howl’d Within unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these Vex’d _Scylla_ bathing in the Sea that parts _Calabria_ from the hoarce _Trinacrian_ shore: Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call’d In secret, riding through the Air she comes Lur’d with the smell of infant blood, to dance With _Lapland_ Witches, while the labouring Moon Eclipses at thir charms.  The other shape, If shape it might be call’d that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, Or substance might be call’d that shadow seem’d, For each seem’d either; black it stood as Night, Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem’d his head The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. _Satan_ was now at hand, and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast, With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. Th’ undaunted Fiend what this might be admir’d, Admir’d, not fear’d; God and his Son except, Created thing naught vallu’d he nor shun’d; And with disdainful look thus first began.  Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, That dar’st, though grim and terrible, advance Thy miscreated Front athwart my way To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, That be assur’d, without leave askt of thee: Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav’n.  To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply’d, Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, Who first broke peace in Heav’n and Faith, till then Unbrok’n, and in proud rebellious Arms Drew after him the third part of Heav’ns Sons Conjur’d against the highest, for which both Thou And they outcast from God, are here condemn’d To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain? And reck’n’st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav’n, Hell-doomd, and breath’st defiance here and scorn, Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, Thy King and Lord?  Back to thy punishment, False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.  So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold More dreadful and deform: on th’ other side Incenc’t with indignation _Satan_ stood Unterrifi’d, and like a Comet burn’d, That fires the length of _Ophiucus_ huge In th’ Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair Shakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head Level’d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands No second stroke intend, and such a frown Each cast at th’ other, as when two black Clouds With Heav’ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on Over the _Caspian_, then stand front to front Hov’ring a space, till Winds the signal blow To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; For never but once more was either like To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds Had been achiev’d, whereof all Hell had rung, Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, Ris’n, and with hideous outcry rush’d between.  O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry’d, Against thy only Son?  What fury O Son, Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart Against thy Fathers head? and know’st for whom; For him who sits above and laughs the while At thee ordain’d his drudge, to execute What e’re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids, His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.  She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore, then these to her _Satan_ return’d:  So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange Thou interposest, that my sudden hand Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends; till first I know of thee, What thing thou art, thus double-form’d, and why In this infernal Vaile first met thou call’st Me Father, and that Fantasm call’st my Son? I know thee not, nor ever saw till now Sight more detestable then him and thee.  T’ whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply’d; Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair In Heav’n, when at th’ Assembly, and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combin’d In bold conspiracy against Heav’ns King, All on a sudden miserable pain Surpris’d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth, till on the left side op’ning wide, Likest to thee in shape and count’nance bright, Then shining heav’nly fair, a Goddess arm’d Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis’d All th’ Host of Heav’n; back they recoild affraid At first, and call’d me _Sin_, and for a Sign Portentous held me; but familiar grown, I pleas’d, and with attractive graces won The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing Becam’st enamour’d, and such joy thou took’st With me in secret, that my womb conceiv’d A growing burden.  Mean while Warr arose, And fields were fought in Heav’n; wherein remaind (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean: down they fell Driv’n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down Into this Deep, and in the general fall I also; at which time this powerful Key Into my hand was giv’n, with charge to keep These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass Without my op’ning.  Pensive here I sat Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. At last this odious offspring whom thou seest Thine own begotten, breaking violent way Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew Transform’d: but he my inbred enemie Forth issu’d, brandishing his fatal Dart Made to destroy: I fled, and cry’d out _Death_; Hell trembl’d at the hideous Name, and sigh’d From all her Caves, and back resounded _Death_. I fled, but he pursu’d (though more, it seems, Inflam’d with lust then rage) and swifter far, Me overtook his mother all dismaid, And in embraces forcible and foule Ingendring with me, of that rape begot These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv’d And hourly born, with sorrow infinite To me, for when they list into the womb That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round, That rest or intermission none I find. Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim _Death_ my Son and foe, who sets them on, And me his Parent would full soon devour For want of other prey, but that he knows His end with mine involvd; and knows that I Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc’d. But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, Though temper’d heav’nly, for that mortal dint, Save he who reigns above, none can resist.  She finish’d, and the suttle Fiend his lore Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. Dear Daughter, since thou claim’st me for thy Sire, And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heav’n, and joys Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know I come no enemie, but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain, Both him and thee, and all the heav’nly Host Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm’d Fell with us from on high: from them I go This uncouth errand sole, and one for all My self expose, with lonely steps to tread Th’ unfounded deep, & through the void immense To search with wandring quest a place foretold Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now Created vast and round, a place of bliss In the Pourlieues of Heav’n, and therein plac’t A race of upstart Creatures, to supply Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov’d, Least Heav’n surcharg’d with potent multitude Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught Then this more secret now design’d, I haste To know, and this once known, shall soon return, And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm’d With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill’d Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. He ceas’d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear His famine should be fill’d, and blest his mawe Destin’d to that good hour: no less rejoyc’d His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.  The key of this infernal Pit by due, And by command of Heav’ns all-powerful King I keep, by him forbidden to unlock These Adamantine Gates; against all force Death ready stands to interpose his dart, Fearless to be o’rematcht by living might. But what ow I to his commands above Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of _Tartarus_ profound, To sit in hateful Office here confin’d, Inhabitant of Heav’n, and heav’nlie-born, Here in perpetual agonie and pain, With terrors and with clamors compasst round Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou My being gav’st me; whom should I obey But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss, among The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.  Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew, Which but her self not all the _Stygian_ powers Could once have mov’d; then in the key-hole turns Th’ intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease Unfast’ns: on a sudden op’n flie With impetuous recoile and jarring sound Th’ infernal dores, and on thir hinges great Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook Of _Erebus_.  She op’nd, but to shut Excel’d her power; the Gates wide op’n stood, That with extended wings a Bannerd Host Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. Before thir eyes in sudden view appear The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark Illimitable Ocean without bound, Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth, And time and place are lost; where eldest Night And _Chaos_, Ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal _Anarchie_, amidst the noise Of endless warrs and by confusion stand. For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns, Light-arm’d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, Swarm populous, unnumber’d as the Sands Of _Barca_ or _Cyrene’s_ torrid soil, Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise Thir lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere, Hee rules a moment; _Chaos_ Umpire sits, And by decision more imbroiles the fray By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter _Chance_ governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss, The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt Confus’dly, and which thus must ever fight, Unless th’ Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more Worlds, Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and look’d a while, Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith He had to cross.  Nor was his eare less peal’d With noises loud and ruinous (to compare Great things with small) then when _Bellona_ storms, With all her battering Engines bent to rase Som Capital City, or less then if this frame Of Heav’n were falling, and these Elements In mutinie had from her Axle torn The stedfast Earth.  At last his Sail-broad Vannes He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets A vast vacuitie: all unawares Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour Down had been falling, had not by ill chance The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him As many miles aloft: that furie stay’d, Quencht in a Boggie _Syrtris_, neither Sea, Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, Pursues the _Arimaspian_, who by stelth Had from his wakeful custody purloind The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way, And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: At length a universal hubbub wilde Of stunning sounds and voices all confus’d Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, Undaunted to meet there what ever power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne Of _Chaos_, and his dark Pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron’d Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, The consort of his Reign; and by them stood _Orcus_ and _Ades_, and the dreaded name Of _Demogorgon_; Rumor next and Chance, And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, And Discord with a thousand various mouths.  T’ whom _Satan_ turning boldly, thus.  Ye Powers And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, _Chaos_ and _Ancient Night_, I come no Spie, With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint Wandring this darksome desart, as my way Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds Confine with Heav’n; or if som other place From your Dominion won, th’ Ethereal King Possesses lately, thither to arrive I travel this profound, direct my course; Directed, no mean recompence it brings To your behoof, if I that Region lost, All usurpation thence expell’d, reduce To her original darkness and your sway (Which is my present journey) and once more Erect the Standerd there of _Ancient Night_; Yours be th’ advantage all, mine the revenge.  Thus _Satan_; and him thus the Anarch old With faultring speech and visage incompos’d Answer’d.  I know thee, stranger, who thou art, That mighty leading Angel, who of late Made head against Heav’ns King, though overthrown. I saw and heard, for such a numerous host Fled not in silence through the frighted deep With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, Confusion worse confounded; and Heav’n Gates Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands Pursuing.  I upon my Frontieres here Keep residence; if all I can will serve, That little which is left so to defend Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World Hung ore my Realm, link’d in a golden Chain To that side Heav’n from whence your Legions fell: If that way be your walk, you have not farr; So much the neerer danger; goe and speed; Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.  He ceas’d; and _Satan_ staid not to reply, But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, With fresh alacritie and force renew’d Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock Of fighting Elements, on all sides round Environ’d wins his way; harder beset And more endanger’d, then when _Argo_ pass’d Through _Bosporus_ betwixt the justling Rocks: Or when _Ulysses_ on the Larbord shunnd _Charybdis_, and by th’ other whirlpool steard. So he with difficulty and labour hard Mov’d on, with difficulty and labour hee; But hee once past, soon after when man fell, Strange alteration!  Sin and Death amain Following his track, such was the will of Heav’n, Pav’d after him a broad and beat’n way Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf Tamely endur’d a Bridge of wondrous length From Hell continu’d reaching th’ utmost Orbe Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse With easie intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals, except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace. But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav’n Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins Her fardest verge, and _Chaos_ to retire As from her outmost works a brok’n foe With tumult less and with less hostile din, That _Satan_ with less toil, and now with ease Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold Farr off th’ Empyreal Heav’n, extended wide In circuit, undetermind square or round, With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn’d Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; And fast by hanging in a golden Chain This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.        THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK.    PARADISE LOST        BOOK III.  Hail holy light, ofspring of Heav’n first-born, Or of th’ Eternal Coeternal beam May I express thee unblam’d? since God is light, And never but in unapproached light Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee, Bright effluence of bright essence increate. Or hear’st thou rather pure Ethereal stream, Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun, Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest The rising world of waters dark and deep, Won from the void and formless infinite. Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, Escap’t the _Stygian_ Pool, though long detain’d In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight Through utter and through middle darkness borne With other notes then to th’ _Orphean_ Lyre I sung of _Chaos_ and _Eternal Night_, Taught by the heav’nly Muse to venture down The dark descent, and up to reascend, Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe, And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou Revisit’st not these eyes, that rowle in vain To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, Or dim suffusion veild.  Yet not the more Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill, Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief Thee _Sion_ and the flowrie Brooks beneath That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow, Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget Those other two equal’d with me in Fate, So were I equal’d with them in renown, Blind _Thamyris_ and blind _Maeonides_, And _Tiresias_ and _Phineus_ Prophets old. Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid Tunes her nocturnal Note.  Thus with the Year Seasons return, but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of Ev’n or Morn, Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose, Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine; But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men Cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair Presented with a Universal blanc Of Natures works to mee expung’d and ras’d, And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. So much the rather thou Celestial light Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight.  Now had the Almighty Father from above, From the pure Empyrean where he sits High Thron’d above all highth, bent down his eye, His own works and their works at once to view: About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv’d Beatitude past utterance; on his right The radiant image of his Glory sat, His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld Our two first Parents, yet the onely two Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac’t, Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love In blissful solitude; he then survey’d Hell and the Gulf between, and _Satan_ there Coasting the wall of Heav’n on this side Night In the dun Air sublime, and ready now To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet On the bare outside of this World, that seem’d Firm land imbosom’d without Firmament, Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air. Him God beholding from his prospect high, Wherein past, present, future he beholds, Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.  Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds Prescrib’d, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems On desperat revenge, that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head.  And now Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way Not farr off Heav’n, in the Precincts of light, Directly towards the new created World, And Man there plac’t, with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy, or worse, By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert; For man will heark’n to his glozing lyes, And easily transgress the sole Command, Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault? Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee All he could have; I made him just and right, Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. Such I created all th’ Ethereal Powers And Spirits, both them who stood & them who faild; Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, Where onely what they needs must do, appeard, Not what they would? what praise could they receive? What pleasure I from such obedience paid, When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice) Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, Made passive both, had servd necessitie, Not mee.  They therefore as to right belongd, So were created, nor can justly accuse Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate; As if Predestination over-rul’d Thir will, dispos’d by absolute Decree Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, Which had no less prov’d certain unforeknown. So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, They trespass, Authors to themselves in all Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formd them free, and free they must remain, Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain’d Thir freedom, they themselves ordain’d thir fall. The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, Self-tempted, self-deprav’d: Man falls deceiv’d By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace, The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, Through Heav’n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.  Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill’d All Heav’n, and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffus’d: Beyond compare the Son of God was seen Most glorious, in him all his Father shon Substantially express’d, and in his face Divine compassion visibly appeerd, Love without end, and without measure Grace, Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.  O Father, gracious was that word which clos’d Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; For which both Heav’n and Earth shall high extoll Thy praises, with th’ innumerable sound Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne Encompass’d shall resound thee ever blest. For should Man finally be lost, should Man Thy creature late so lov’d, thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd With his own folly? that be from thee farr, That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge Of all things made, and judgest onely right. Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, Or proud return though to his heavier doom, Yet with revenge accomplish’t and to Hell Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be questiond and blaspheam’d without defence.  To whom the great Creatour thus reply’d. O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, Son of my bosom, Son who art alone My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, All hast thou spok’n as my thoughts are, all As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: Man shall not quite be lost, but sav’d who will, Yet not of will in him, but grace in me Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall’d By sin to foul exorbitant desires; Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe, By me upheld, that he may know how frail His fall’n condition is, and to me ow All his deliv’rance, and to none but me. Some I have chosen of peculiar grace Elect above the rest; so is my will: The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes Th’ incensed Deitie, while offerd grace Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, What may suffice, and soft’n stonie hearts To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. To prayer, repentance, and obedience due, Though but endevord with sincere intent, Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. And I will place within them as a guide My Umpire _Conscience_, whom if they will hear, Light after light well us’d they shall attain, And to the end persisting, safe arrive. This my long sufferance and my day of grace They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; But hard be hard’nd, blind be blinded more, That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; And none but such from mercy I exclude. But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns Against the high Supremacie of Heav’n, Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, To expiate his Treason hath naught left, But to destruction sacred and devote, He with his whole posteritie must die, Die hee or Justice must; unless for him Som other able, and as willing, pay The rigid satisfaction, death for death. Say Heav’nly Powers, where shall we find such love, Which of ye will be mortal to redeem Mans mortal crime, and just th’ unjust to save, Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?  He ask’d, but all the Heav’nly Quire stood mute, And silence was in Heav’n: on mans behalf Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. And now without redemption all mankind Must have bin lost, adjudg’d to Death and Hell By doom severe, had not the Son of God, In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, His dearest mediation thus renewd.  Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, The speediest of thy winged messengers, To visit all thy creatures, and to all Comes unprevented, unimplor’d, unsought, Happie for man, so coming; he her aide Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; Attonement for himself or offering meet, Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; Account mee man; I for his sake will leave Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee Freely put off, and for him lastly die Well pleas’d, on me let Death wreck all his rage; Under his gloomie power I shall not long Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule For ever with corruption there to dwell; But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; Death his deaths wound shall then receive, & stoop Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm’d. I through the ample Air in Triumph high Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show The powers of darkness bound.  Thou at the sight Pleas’d, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, While by thee rais’d I ruin all my Foes, Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: Then with the multitude of my redeemd Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne, Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud Of anger shall remain, but peace assur’d, And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire.  His words here ended, but his meek aspect Silent yet spake, and breath’d immortal love To mortal men, above which only shon Filial obedience: as a sacrifice Glad to be offer’d, he attends the will Of his great Father.  Admiration seis’d All Heav’n, what this might mean, & whither tend Wondring; but soon th’ Almighty thus reply’d:  O thou in Heav’n and Earth the only peace Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou My sole complacence! well thou know’st how dear, To me are all my works, nor Man the least Though last created, that for him I spare Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme, Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne; And be thy self Man among men on Earth, Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, By wondrous birth: Be thou in _Adams_ room The Head of all mankind, though _Adams_ Son. As in him perish all men, so in thee As from a second root shall be restor’d, As many as are restor’d, without thee none. His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit Imputed shall absolve them who renounce Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, And live in thee transplanted, and from thee Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just, Shall satisfie for Man, be judg’d and die, And dying rise, and rising with him raise His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. So Heav’nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate, Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate So easily destroy’d, and still destroyes In those who, when they may, accept not grace. Nor shalt thou by descending to assume Mans Nature, less’n or degrade thine owne. Because thou hast, though Thron’d in highest bliss Equal to God, and equally enjoying God-like fruition, quitted all to save A World from utter loss, and hast been found By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, Found worthiest to be so by being Good, Farr more then Great or High; because in thee Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, Anointed universal King; all Power I give thee, reign for ever, and assume Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; When thou attended gloriously from Heav’n Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes The living, and forthwith the cited dead Of all past Ages to the general Doom Shall hast’n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. Then all thy Saints assembl’d, thou shalt judge Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring New Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell And after all thir tribulations long See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, For regal Scepter then no more shall need, God shall be All in All.  But all ye Gods, Adore him, who to compass all this dies, Adore the Son, and honour him as mee.  No sooner had th’ Almighty ceas’t, but all The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number, sweet As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav’n rung With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna’s fill’d Th’ eternal Regions: lowly reverent Towards either Throne they bow, & to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence To Heav’n remov’d where first it grew, there grows, And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn Rowls o’re _Elisian_ Flours her Amber stream; With these that never fade the Spirits Elect Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath’d with beams, Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon Impurpl’d with Celestial Roses smil’d. Then Crown’d again thir gold’n Harps they took, Harps ever tun’d, that glittering by their side Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet Of charming symphonie they introduce Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine Melodious part, such concord is in Heav’n.  Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, Eternal King; thee Author of all being, Fountain of Light, thy self invisible Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit’st Thron’d inaccessible, but when thou shad’st The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, Yet dazle Heav’n, that brightest Seraphim Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. Thee next they sang of all Creation first, Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, In whose conspicuous count’nance, without cloud Made visible, th’ Almighty Father shines, Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, Transfus’d on thee his ample Spirit rests. Hee Heav’n of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created, and by thee threw down Th’ aspiring Dominations: thou that day Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook Heav’ns everlasting Frame, while o’re the necks Thou drov’st of warring Angels disarraid. Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might, To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, Not so on Man; him through their malice fall’n, Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: No sooner did thy dear and onely Son Perceive thee purpos’d not to doom frail Man So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin’d, He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern’d, Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat Second to thee, offerd himself to die For mans offence.  O unexampl’d love, Love no where to be found less then Divine! Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name Shall be the copious matter of my Song Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.  Thus they in Heav’n, above the starry Sphear, Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe Of this round World, whose first convex divides The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos’d From _Chaos_ and th’ inroad of Darkness old, _Satan_ alighted walks: a Globe farr off It seem’d, now seems a boundless Continent Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night Starless expos’d, and ever-threatning storms Of _Chaos_ blustring round, inclement skie; Save on that side which from the wall of Heav’n Though distant farr som small reflection gaines Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: Here walk’d the Fiend at large in spacious field. As when a Vultur on _Imaus_ bred, Whose snowie ridge the roving _Tartar_ bounds, Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs Of _Ganges_ or _Hydaspes, Indian_ streams; But in his way lights on the barren plaines Of _Sericana_, where _Chineses_ drive With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend Walk’d up and down alone bent on his prey, Alone, for other Creature in this place Living or liveless to be found was none, None yet, but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like Aereal vapours flew Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin With vanity had filld the works of men: Both all things vain, and all who in vain things Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, Or happiness in this or th’ other life; All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; All th’ unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, Till final dissolution, wander here, Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; Those argent Fields more likely habitants, Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold Betwixt th’ Angelical and Human kinde: Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born First from the ancient World those Giants came With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: The builders next of _Babel_ on the Plain Of _Sennaar_, and still with vain designe New _Babels_, had they wherewithall, would build: Others came single; hee who to be deemd A God, leap’d fondly into _Aetna_ flames, _Empedocles_, and hee who to enjoy _Plato’s Elysium_, leap’d into the Sea, _Cleombrotus_, and many more too long, Embryo’s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. Here Pilgrims roam, that stray’d so farr to seek In _Golgotha_ him dead, who lives in Heav’n; And they who to be sure of Paradise Dying put on the weeds of _Dominic_, Or in _Franciscan_ think to pass disguis’d; They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov’d; And now Saint _Peter_ at Heav’ns Wicket seems To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot Of Heav’ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe A violent cross wind from either Coast Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry Into the devious Air; then might ye see Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft Fly o’re the backside of the World farr off Into a _Limbo_ large and broad, since calld The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown Long after, now unpeopl’d, and untrod; All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass’d, And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste His travell’d steps; farr distant hee descries Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. The Stairs were such as whereon _Jacob_ saw Angels ascending and descending, bands Of Guardians bright, when he from _Esau_ fled To _Padan-Aram_ in the field of _Luz_, Dreaming by night under the open Skie, And waking cri’d, This is the Gate of Heav’n. Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav’n somtimes Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow’d Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv’d, Wafted by Angels, or flew o’re the Lake Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. Direct against which op’nd from beneath, Just o’re the blissful seat of Paradise, A passage down to th’ Earth, a passage wide, Wider by farr then that of after-times Over Mount _Sion_, and, though that were large, Over the _Promis’d Land_ to God so dear, By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, On high behests his Angels to and fro Pass’d frequent, and his eye with choice regard From _Paneas_ the fount of _Jordans_ flood To _Beersaba_, where the _Holy Land_ Borders on _Aegypt_ and the _Arabian_ shoare; So wide the op’ning seemd, where bounds were set To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. _Satan_ from hence now on the lower stair That scal’d by steps of Gold to Heav’n Gate Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone All night; at last by break of chearful dawne Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some forein land First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. Such wonder seis’d, though after Heaven seen, The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis’d At sight of all this World beheld so faire. Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood So high above the circling Canopie Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point Of _Libra_ to the fleecie Starr that bears _Andromeda_ farr off _Atlantick_ Seas Beyond th’ _Horizon_; then from Pole to Pole He views in bredth, and without longer pause Down right into the Worlds first Region throws His flight precipitant, and windes with ease Through the pure marble Air his oblique way Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, Like those _Hesperian_ Gardens fam’d of old, Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there He stayd not to enquire: above them all The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven Allur’d his eye: Thither his course he bends Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms The Univers, and to each inward part With gentle penetration, though unseen, Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: So wondrously was set his Station bright. There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the Sun’s lucent Orbe Through his glaz’d Optic Tube yet never saw. The place he found beyond expression bright, Compar’d with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; Not all parts like, but all alike informd With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon In _Aarons_ Brest-plate, and a stone besides Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, That stone, or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought, In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde Volatil _Hermes_, and call up unbound In various shapes old _Proteus_ from the Sea, Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. What wonder then if fields and regions here Breathe forth _Elixir_ pure, and Rivers run Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch Th’ Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt Here in the dark so many precious things Of colour glorious and effect so rare? Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazl’d, farr and wide his eye commands, For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon Culminate from th’ _Aequator_, as they now Shot upward still direct, whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, No where so cleer, sharp’nd his visual ray To objects distant farr, whereby he soon Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, The same whom _John_ saw also in the Sun: His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar Circl’d his Head, nor less his Locks behind Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy’d Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope To find who might direct his wandring flight To Paradise the happie seat of Man, His journies end and our beginning woe. But first he casts to change his proper shape, Which else might work him danger or delay: And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, Not of the prime, yet such as in his face Youth smil’d Celestial, and to every Limb Sutable grace diffus’d, so well he feignd; Under a Coronet his flowing haire In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore Of many a colourd plume sprinkl’d with Gold, His habit fit for speed succinct, and held Before his decent steps a Silver wand. He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known Th’ Arch-Angel _Uriel_, one of the seav’n Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes That run through all the Heav’ns, or down to th’ Earth Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, O’re Sea and Land: him _Satan_ thus accostes;  _Uriel_, for thou of those seav’n Spirits that stand In sight of God’s high Throne, gloriously bright, The first art wont his great authentic will Interpreter through highest Heav’n to bring, Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; And here art likeliest by supream decree Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye To visit oft this new Creation round; Unspeakable desire to see, and know All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, His chief delight and favour, him for whom All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim Alone thus wandring.  Brightest Seraph tell In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; That I may find him, and with secret gaze, Or open admiration him behold On whom the great Creator hath bestowd Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; That both in him and all things, as is meet, The Universal Maker we may praise; Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss Created this new happie Race of Men To serve him better: wise are all his wayes.  So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; For neither Man nor Angel can discern Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks Invisible, except to God alone, By his permissive will, through Heav’n and Earth: And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil’d _Uriel_, though Regent of the Sun, and held The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav’n; Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule In his uprightness answer thus returnd. Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know The works of God, thereby to glorifie The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess That reaches blame, but rather merits praise The more it seems excess, that led thee hither From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps Contented with report heare onely in heav’n: For wonderful indeed are all his works, Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; But what created mind can comprehend Thir number, or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, This worlds material mould, came to a heap: Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar Stood rul’d, stood vast infinitude confin’d; Till at his second bidding darkness fled, Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav’n Flew upward, spirited with various forms, That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; Each had his place appointed, each his course, The rest in circuit walles this Universe. Look downward on that Globe whose hither side With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light His day, which else as th’ other Hemisphere Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide Timely interposes, and her monthly round Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav’n; With borrowd light her countenance triform Hence fills and empties to enlighten th’ Earth, And in her pale dominion checks the night. That spot to which I point is _Paradise_, _Adams_ abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.  Thus said, he turnd, and _Satan_ bowing low, As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, Where honour due and reverence none neglects, Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, Down from th’ Ecliptic, sped with hop’d success, Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, Nor staid, till on _Niphates_ top he lights.         THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK.    PARADISE LOST        BOOK IV.  O For that warning voice, which he who saw Th’ _Apocalyps_, heard cry in Heaven aloud, Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, Came furious down to be reveng’d on men, _Wo to the Inhabitants on Earth!_ that now, While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd The coming of thir secret foe, and scap’d Haply so scap’d his mortal snare; for now _Satan_, now first inflam’d with rage, came down, The Tempter ere th’ Accuser of man-kind, To wreck on innocent frail man his loss Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, And like a devillish Engine back recoiles Upon himself; horror and doubt distract His troubl’d thoughts, and from the bottom stirr The Hell within him, for within him Hell He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell One step no more then from himself can fly By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie Of what he was, what is, and what must be Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. Sometimes towards _Eden_ which now in his view Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, Sometimes towards Heav’n and the full-blazing Sun, Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.  O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, Look’st from thy sole Dominion like the God Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, But with no friendly voice, and add thy name O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams That bring to my remembrance from what state I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down Warring in Heav’n against Heav’ns matchless King: Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return From me, whom he created what I was In that bright eminence, and with his good Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. What could be less then to afford him praise, The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, How due! yet all his good prov’d ill in me, And wrought but malice; lifted up so high I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher Would set me highest, and in a moment quit The debt immense of endless gratitude, So burthensome, still paying, still to ow; Forgetful what from him I still receivd, And understood not that a grateful mind By owing owes not, but still pays, at once Indebted and dischargd; what burden then? O had his powerful Destiny ordaind Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais’d Ambition.  Yet why not? som other Power As great might have aspir’d, and me though mean Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great Fell not, but stand unshak’n, from within Or from without, to all temptations arm’d. Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, But Heav’ns free Love dealt equally to all? Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, To me alike, it deals eternal woe. Nay curs’d be thou; since against his thy will Chose freely what it now so justly rues. Me miserable! which way shall I flie Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; And in the lowest deep a lower deep Still threatning to devour me opens wide, To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav’n. O then at last relent: is there no place Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? None left but by submission; and that word _Disdain_ forbids me, and my dread of shame Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc’d With other promises and other vaunts Then to submit, boasting I could subdue Th’ Omnipotent.  Ay me, they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, Under what torments inwardly I groane; While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, With Diadem and Scepter high advanc’d The lower still I fall, onely Supream In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. But say I could repent and could obtaine By Act of Grace my former state; how soon Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay What feign’d submission swore: ease would recant Vows made in pain, as violent and void. For never can true reconcilement grow Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc’d so deep: Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare Short intermission bought with double smart. This knows my punisher; therefore as farr From granting hee, as I from begging peace: All hope excluded thus, behold in stead Of us out-cast, exil’d, his new delight, Mankind created, and for him this World. So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least Divided Empire with Heav’ns King I hold By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.  Thus while he spake, each passion dimm’d his face Thrice chang’d with pale, ire, envie and despair, Which marrd his borrow’d visage, and betraid Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. For heav’nly mindes from such distempers foule Are ever cleer.  Whereof hee soon aware, Each perturbation smooth’d with outward calme, Artificer of fraud; and was the first That practisd falshood under saintly shew, Deep malice to conceale, couch’t with revenge: Yet not anough had practisd to deceive _Uriel_ once warnd; whose eye pursu’d him down The way he went, and on th’ _Assyrian_ mount Saw him disfigur’d, more then could befall Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, As he suppos’d, all unobserv’d, unseen. So on he fares, and to the border comes Of _Eden_, where delicious Paradise, Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, As with a rural mound the champain head Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, Access deni’d; and over head up grew Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre Of stateliest view.  Yet higher then thir tops The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung: Which to our general Sire gave prospect large Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. And higher then that Wall a circling row Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: On which the Sun more glad impress’d his beams Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy, able to drive All sadness but despair: now gentle gales Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole Those balmie spoiles.  As when to them who saile Beyond the _Cape of Hope_, and now are past _Mozambic_, off at Sea North-East windes blow _Sabean_ Odours from the spicie shoare Of _Arabie_ the blest, with such delay Well pleas’d they slack thir course, and many a League Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas’d Then _Asmodeus_ with the fishie fume, That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse Of _Tobits_ Son, and with a vengeance sent From _Media_ post to _Aegypt_, there fast bound.  Now to th’ ascent of that steep savage Hill _Satan_ had journied on, pensive and slow; But further way found none, so thick entwin’d, As one continu’d brake, the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext All path of Man or Beast that past that way: One Gate there onely was, and that look’d East On th’ other side: which when th’ arch-fellon saw Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, At one slight bound high overleap’d all bound Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling Wolfe, Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve In hurdl’d Cotes amid the field secure, Leaps o’re the fence with ease into the Fould: Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, In at the window climbes, or o’re the tiles; So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, The middle Tree and highest there that grew, Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death To them who liv’d; nor on the vertue thought Of that life-giving Plant, but only us’d For prospect, what well us’d had bin the pledge Of immortalitie.  So little knows Any, but God alone, to value right The good before him, but perverts best things To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. Beneath him with new wonder now he views To all delight of human sense expos’d In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise Of God the Garden was, by him in the East Of _Eden_ planted; _Eden_ stretchd her Line From _Auran_ Eastward to the Royal Towrs Of great _Seleucia_, built by _Grecian_ Kings, Or where the Sons of _Eden_ long before Dwelt in _Telassar:_ in this pleasant soile His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; Out of the fertil ground he caus’d to grow All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by, Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. Southward through _Eden_ went a River large, Nor chang’d his course, but through the shaggie hill Pass’d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais’d Upon the rapid current, which through veins Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill Waterd the Garden; thence united fell Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, Which from his darksom passage now appeers, And now divided into four main Streams, Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme And Country whereof here needs no account, But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, With mazie error under pendant shades Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine, Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote The open field, and where the unpierc’t shade Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, A happy rural seat of various view; Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde Hung amiable, _Hesperian_ Fables true, If true, here onely, and of delicious taste: Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks Grasing the tender herb, were interpos’d, Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap Of som irriguous Valley spread her store, Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves Of coole recess, o’re which the mantling Vine Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams. The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune The trembling leaves, while Universal _Pan_ Knit with the _Graces_ and the _Hours_ in dance Led on th’ Eternal Spring.  Not that faire field Of _Enna_, where _Proserpin_ gathring flours Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie _Dis_ Was gatherd, which cost _Ceres_ all that pain To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove Of _Daphne_ by _Orontes_, and th’ inspir’d _Castalian_ Spring might with this Paradise Of _Eden_ strive; nor that _Nyseian_ Ile Girt with the River _Triton_, where old _Cham_, Whom Gentiles _Ammon_ call and _Libyan Jove_, Hid _Amalthea_ and her Florid Son Young _Bacchus_ from his Stepdame _Rhea’s_ eye; Nor where _Abassin_ Kings thir issue Guard, Mount _Amara_, though this by som suppos’d True Paradise under the _Ethiop_ Line By _Nilus_ head, enclos’d with shining Rock, A whole da
