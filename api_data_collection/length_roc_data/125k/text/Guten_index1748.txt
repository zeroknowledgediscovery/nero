OTHER PEOPLE’S MONEY  By Emile Gaboriau     PART I   I  There is not, perhaps, in all Paris, a quieter street than the Rue St. Gilles in the Marais, within a step of the Place Royale.  No carriages there; never a crowd.  Hardly is the silence broken by the regulation drums of the Minims Barracks near by, by the chimes of the Church of St. Louis, or by the joyous clamors of the pupils of the Massin School during the hours of recreation.  At night, long before ten o’clock, and when the Boulevard Beaumarchais is still full of life, activity, and noise, every thing begins to close.  One by one the lights go out, and the great windows with diminutive panes become dark.  And if, after midnight, some belated citizen passes on his way home, he quickens his step, feeling lonely and uneasy, and apprehensive of the reproaches of his concierge, who is likely to ask him whence he may be coming at so late an hour.  In such a street, every one knows each other: houses have no mystery; families, no secrets,--a small town, where idle curiosity has always a corner of the veil slyly raised, where gossip flourishes as rankly as the grass on the street.  Thus on the afternoon of the 27th of April, 1872 (a Saturday), a fact which anywhere else might have passed unnoticed was attracting particular attention.  A man some thirty years of age, wearing the working livery of servants of the upper class,--the long striped waistcoat with sleeves, and the white linen apron,--was going from door to door.  “Who can the man be looking for?” wondered the idle neighbors, closely watching his evolutions.  He was not looking for any one.  To such as he spoke to, he stated that he had been sent by a cousin of his, an excellent cook, who, before taking a place in the neighborhood, was anxious to have all possible information on the subject of her prospective masters.  And then, “Do you know M. Vincent Favoral?” he would ask.  Concierges and shop-keepers knew no one better; for it was more than a quarter of a century before, that M. Vincent Favoral, the day after his wedding, had come to settle in the Rue St. Gilles; and there his two children were born,--his son M. Maxence, his daughter Mlle. Gilberte.  He occupied the second story of the house.  No. 38,--one of those old-fashioned dwellings, such as they build no more, since ground is sold at twelve hundred francs the square metre; in which there is no stinting of space.  The stairs, with wrought iron balusters, are wide and easy, and the ceilings twelve feet high.  “Of course, we know M. Favoral,” answered every one to the servant’s questions; “and, if there ever was an honest man, why, he is certainly the one.  There is a man whom you could trust with your funds, if you had any, without fear of his ever running off to Belgium with them.”  And it was further explained, that M. Favoral was chief cashier, and probably, also, one of the principal stockholders, of the Mutual Credit Society, one of those admirable financial institutions which have sprung up with the second empire, and which had won at the bourse the first installment of their capital, the very day that the game of the Coup d’Etat was being played in the street.  “I know well enough the gentleman’s business,” remarked the servant; “but what sort of a man is he?  That’s what my cousin would like to know.”  The wine-man at No. 43, the oldest shop-keeper in the street, could best answer.  A couple of petits-verres politely offered soon started his tongue; and, whilst sipping his Cognac:  “M. Vincent Favoral,” he began, “is a man some fifty-two or three years old, but who looks younger, not having a single gray hair.  He is tall and thin, with neatly-trimmed whiskers, thin lips, and small yellow eyes; not talkative.  It takes more ceremony to get a word from his throat than a dollar from his pocket.  ‘Yes,’  ‘no,’ ‘good-morning,’ ‘good-evening;’ that’s about the extent of his conversation.  Summer and winter, he wears gray pantaloons, a long frock-coat, laced shoes, and lisle-thread gloves.  ‘Pon my word, I should say that he is still wearing the very same clothes I saw upon his back for the first time in 1845, did I not know that he has two full suits made every year by the concierge at No. 29, who is also a tailor.”  “Why, he must be an old miser,” muttered the servant.  “He is above all peculiar,” continued the shop-keeper, “like most men of figures, it seems.  His own life is ruled and regulated like the pages of his ledger.  In the neighborhood they call him Old Punctuality; and, when he passes through the Rue Turenne, the merchants set their watches by him.  Rain or shine, every morning of the year, on the stroke of nine, he appears at the door on the way to his office.  When he returns, you may be sure it is between twenty and twenty-five minutes past five.  At six he dines; at seven he goes to play a game of dominoes at the Cafe Turc; at ten he comes home and goes to bed; and, at the first stroke of eleven at the Church of St. Louis, out goes his candle.”  “Hem!” grumbled the servant with a look of contempt, “the question is, will my cousin be willing to live with a man who is a sort of walking clock?”  “It isn’t always pleasant,” remarked the wine-man; “and the best evidence is, that the son, M. Maxence, got tired of it.”  “He does not live with his parents any more?”  “He dines with them; but he has his own lodgings on the Boulevard du Temple.  The falling-out made talk enough at the time; and some people do say that M. Maxence is a worthless scamp, who leads a very dissipated life; but I say that his father kept him too close.  The boy is twenty-five, quite good looking, and has a very stylish mistress: I have seen her. . . . I would have done just as he did.”  “And what about the daughter, Mlle. Gilberte?”  “She is not married yet, although she is past twenty, and pretty as a rosebud.  After the war, her father tried to make her marry a stock-broker, a stylish man who always came in a two-horse carriage; but she refused him outright.  I should not be a bit surprised to hear that she has some love-affair of her own.  I have noticed lately a young gentleman about here who looks up quite suspiciously when he goes by No. 38.”  The servant did not seem to find these particulars very interesting.  “It’s the lady,” he said, “that my cousin would like to know most about.”  “Naturally.  Well, you can safely tell her that she never will have had a better mistress.  Poor Madame Favoral!  She must have had a sweet time of it with her maniac of a husband!  But she is not young any more; and people get accustomed to every thing, you know.  The days when the weather is fine, I see her going by with her daughter to the Place Royale for a walk.  That’s about their only amusement.”  “The mischief!” said the servant, laughing.  “If that is all, she won’t ruin her husband, will she?”  “That is all,” continued the shop-keeper, “or rather, excuse me, no: every Saturday, for many years, M. and Mme. Favoral receive a few of their friends: M. and Mme. Desclavettes, retired dealers in bronzes, Rue Turenne; M. Chapelain, the old lawyer from the Rue St. Antoine, whose daughter is Mlle. Gilberte’s particular friend; M. Desormeaux, head clerk in the Department of Justice; and three or four others; and as this just happens to be Saturday--”  But here he stopped short, and pointing towards the street:  “Quick,” said he, “look!  Speaking of the--you know--It is twenty minutes past five, there is M. Favoral coming home.”  It was, in fact, the cashier of the Mutual Credit Society, looking very much indeed as the shop-keeper had described him.  Walking with his head down, he seemed to be seeking upon the pavement the very spot upon which he had set his foot in the morning, that he might set it back again there in the evening.  With the same methodical step, he reached his house, walked up the two pairs of stairs, and, taking out his pass-key, opened the door of his apartment.  The dwelling was fit for the man; and every thing from the very hall, betrayed his peculiarities.  There, evidently, every piece of furniture must have its invariable place, every object its irrevocable shelf or hook.  All around were evidences, if not exactly of poverty, at least of small means, and of the artifices of a respectable economy.  Cleanliness was carried to its utmost limits: every thing shone.  Not a detail but betrayed the industrious hand of the housekeeper, struggling to defend her furniture against the ravages of time.  The velvet on the chairs was darned at the angles as with the needle of a fairy.  Stitches of new worsted showed through the faded designs on the hearth-rugs.  The curtains had been turned so as to display their least worn side.  All the guests enumerated by the shop-keeper, and a few others besides, were in the parlor when M. Favoral came in.  But, instead of returning their greeting:  “Where is Maxence?” he inquired.  “I am expecting him, my dear,” said Mme. Favoral gently.  “Always behind time,” he scolded.  “It is too trifling.”  His daughter, Mlle. Gilberte, interrupted him:  “Where is my bouquet, father?” she asked.  M. Favoral stopped short, struck his forehead, and with the accent of a man who reveals something incredible, prodigious, unheard of,  “Forgotten,” he answered, scanning the syllables: “I have for-got-ten it.”  It was a fact.  Every Saturday, on his way home, he was in the habit of stopping at the old woman’s shop in front of the Church of St. Louis, and buying a bouquet for Mlle. Gilberte.  And to-day . . .  “Ah!  I catch you this time, father!” exclaimed the girl.  Meantime, Mme. Favoral, whispering to Mme. Desclavettes:  “Positively,” she said in a troubled voice, “something serious must have happened to--my husband.  He to forget!  He to fail in one of his habits!  It is the first time in twenty-six years.”  The appearance of Maxence at this moment prevented her from going on. M. Favoral was about to administer a sound reprimand to his son, when dinner was announced.  “Come,” exclaimed M. Chapelain, the old lawyer, the conciliating man par excellence,--“come, let us to the table.”  They sat down.  But Mme. Favoral had scarcely helped the soup, when the bell rang violently.  Almost at the same moment the servant appeared, and announced:  “The Baron de Thaller!”  More pale than his napkin, the cashier stood up.  “The manager,” he stammered, “the director of the Mutual Credit Society.”    II  Close upon the heels of the servant M. de Thaller came.  Tall, thin, stiff, he had a very small head, a flat face, pointed nose, and long reddish whiskers, slightly shaded with silvery threads, falling half-way down his chest.  Dressed in the latest style, he wore a loose overcoat of rough material, pantaloons that spread nearly to the tip of his boots, a wide shirt-collar turned over a light cravat, on the bow of which shone a large diamond, and a tall hat with rolled brims.  With a blinking glance, he made a rapid estimate of the dining-room, the shabby furniture, and the guests seated around the table.  Then, without even condescending to touch his hat, with his large hand tightly fitted into a lavender glove, in a brief and imperious tone, and with a slight accent which he affirmed was the Alsatian accent:  “I must speak with you, Vincent,” said he to his cashier, “alone and at once.”  M. Favoral made visible efforts to conceal his anxiety.  “You see,”  he commenced, “we are dining with a few friends, and--”  “Do you wish me to speak in presence of everybody?” interrupted harshly the manager of the Mutual Credit.  The cashier hesitated no longer.  Taking up a candle from the table, he opened the door leading to the parlor, and, standing respectfully to one side:  “Be kind enough to pass on, sir,” said he: “I follow you.”  And, at the moment of disappearing himself,  “Continue to dine without me,” said he to his guests, with a last effort at self-control.  “I shall soon catch up with you.  This will take but a moment.  Do not be uneasy in the least.”  They were not uneasy, but surprised, and, above all, shocked at the manners of M. de Thaller.  “What a brute!” muttered Mme. Desclavettes.  M. Desormeaux, the head clerk at the Department of Justice, was an old legitimist, much imbued with reactionary ideas.  “Such are our masters,” said he with a sneer, “the high barons of financial feudality.  Ah! you are indignant at the arrogance of the old aristocracy; well, on your knees, by Jupiter! on your face, rather, before the golden crown on field of gules.”  No one replied: every one was trying his best to hear.  In the parlor, between M. Favoral and M. de Thaller, a discussion of the utmost violence was evidently going on.  To seize the meaning of it was not possible; and yet through the door, the upper panels of which were of glass, fragments could be heard; and from time to time such words distinctly reached the ear as dividend, stockholders, deficit, millions, etc.  “What can it all mean? great heaven!” moaned Mme. Favoral.  Doubtless the two interlocutors, the director and the cashier, had drawn nearer to the door of communication; for their voices, which rose more and more, had now become quite distinct.  “It is an infamous trap!” M. Favoral was saying.  “I should have been notified--”  “Come, come,” interrupted the other.  “Were you not fully warned? did I ever conceal any thing from you?”  Fear, a fear vague still, and unexplained, was slowly taking possession of the guests; and they remained motionless, their forks in suspense, holding their breath.  “Never,” M. Favoral was repeating, stamping his foot so violently that the partition shook,--“never, never!”  “And yet it must be,” declared M. de Thaller.  “It is the only, the last resource.”  “And suppose I will not!”  “Your will has nothing to do with it now.  It is twenty years ago that you might have willed, or not willed.  But listen to me, and let us reason a little.”  Here M. de Thaller dropped his voice; and for some minutes nothing was heard in the dining-room, except confused words, and incomprehensible exclamations, until suddenly,  “That is ruin,” he resumed in a furious tone: “it is bankruptcy on the last of the month.”  “Sir,” the cashier was replying,--“sir!”  “You are a forger, M. Vincent Favoral; you are a thief!”  Maxence leaped from his seat.  “I shall not permit my father to be thus insulted in his own house,”  he exclaimed.  “Maxence,” begged Mme. Favoral, “my son!”  The old lawyer, M. Chapelain, held him by the arm; but he struggled hard, and was about to burst into the parlor, when the door opened, and the director of the Mutual Credit stepped out.  With a coolness quite remarkable after such a scene, he advanced towards Mlle. Gilberte, and, in a tone of offensive protection,  “Your father is a wretch, mademoiselle,” he said; “and my duty should be to surrender him at once into the hands of justice.  On account of your worthy mother, however, of your father himself, above all, on your own account, mademoiselle, I shall forbear doing so.  But let him fly, let him disappear, and never more be heard from.”  He drew from his pocket a roll of bank-notes, and, throwing them upon the table,  “Hand him this,” he added.  “Let him leave this very night.  The police may have been notified.  There is a train for Brussels at five minutes past eleven.”  And, having bowed, he withdrew, no one addressing him a single word, so great was the astonishment of all the guests of this house, heretofore so peaceful.  Overcome with stupor, Maxence had dropped upon his chair.  Mlle. Gilberte alone retained some presence of mind.  “It is a shame,” she exclaimed, “for us to give up thus!  That man is an impostor, a wretch; he lies!  Father, father!”  M. Favoral had not waited to be called, and was standing up against the parlor-door, pale as death, and yet calm.  “Why attempt any explanations?” he said.  “The money is gone; and appearances are against me.”  His wife had drawn near to him, and taken his hand.  “The misfortune is immense,” she said, “but not irreparable.  We will sell everything we have.”  “Have you not friends?  Are we not here,” insisted the others,--M. Desclavettes, M. Desormeaux, and M. Chapelain.  Gently he pushed his wife aside, and coldly.  “All we had,” he said, “would be as a grain of sand in an ocean. But we have no longer anything; we are ruined.”  “Ruined!” exclaimed M. Desormeaux,--“ruined!  And where are the forty-five thousand francs I placed into your hands?”  He made no reply.  “And our hundred and twenty thousand francs?” groaned M. and Mme. Desclavettes.  “And my sixty thousand francs?” shouted M. Chapelain, with a blasphemous oath.  The cashier shrugged his shoulders.  “Lost,” he said, “irrevocably lost!”  Then their rage exceeded all bounds.  Then they forgot that this unfortunate man had been their friend for twenty years, that they were his guests; and they commenced heaping upon him threats and insults without name.  He did not even deign to defend himself.  “Go on,” he uttered, “go on.  When a poor dog, carried away by the current, is drowning, men of heart cast stones at him from the bank. Go on!”  “You should have told us that you speculated,” screamed M. Desclavettes.  On hearing these words, he straightened himself up, and with a gesture so terrible that the others stepped back frightened.  “What!” said he, in a tone of crushing irony, “it is this evening only, that you discover that I speculated?  Kind friends!  Where, then, and in whose pockets, did you suppose I was getting the enormous interests I have been paying you for years?  Where have you ever seen honest money, the money of labor, yield twelve or fourteen per cent?  The money that yields thus is the money of the gaming table, the money of the bourse.  Why did you bring me your funds?  Because you were fully satisfied that I knew how to handle the cards.  Ah!  If I was to tell you that I had doubled your capital, you would not ask how I did it, nor whether I had stocked the cards. You would virtuously pocket the money.  But I have lost: I am a thief.  Well, so be it.  But, then, you are all my accomplices.  It is the avidity of the dupes which induces the trickery of the sharpers.”  Here he was interrupted by the servant coming in.  “Sir,” she exclaimed excitedly, “O sir! the courtyard is full of police agents. They are speaking to the concierge.  They are coming up stairs: I hear them!”    III  According to the time and place where they are uttered, there are words which acquire a terrible significance.  In this disordered room, in the midst of these excited people, that word, the “police,”  sounded like a thunderclap.  “Do not open,” Maxence ordered; “do not open, however they may ring or knock.  Let them burst the door first.”  The very excess of her fright restored to Mme. Favoral a portion of her energy.  Throwing herself before her husband as if to protect him, as if to defend him,  “They are coming to arrest you, Vincent,” she exclaimed.  “They are coming; don’t you hear them?”  He remained motionless, his feet seemingly riveted to the floor.  “That is as I expected,” he said.  And with the accent of the wretch who sees all hope vanish, and who utterly gives up all struggle,  “Be it so,” he said.  “Let them arrest me, and let all be over at once. I have had enough anxiety, enough unbearable alternatives.  I am tired always to feign, to deceive, and to lie.  Let them arrest me!  Any misfortune will be smaller in reality than the horrors of uncertainty. I have nothing more to fear now.  For the first time in many years I shall sleep to-night.”  He did not notice the sinister expression of his guests.  “You think I am a thief,” he added: “well, be satisfied, justice shall be done.”  But he attributed to them sentiments which were no longer theirs. They had forgotten their anger, and their bitter resentment for their lost money.  The imminence of the peril awoke suddenly in their souls the memories of the past, and that strong affection which comes from long habit, and a constant exchange of services rendered.  Whatever M. Favoral might have done, they only saw in him now the friend, the host whose bread they had broken together more than a hundred times, the man whose probity, up to this fatal night, had remained far above suspicion.  Pale, excited, they crowded around him.  “Have you lost your mind?” spoke M. Desormeaux.  “Are you going to wait to be arrested, thrown into prison, dragged into a criminal court?”  He shook his head, and in a tone of idiotic obstinacy,  “Have I not told you,” he repeated, “that every thing is against me? Let them come; let them do what they please with me.”  “And your wife,” insisted M. Chapelain, the old lawyer, “and your children!”  “Will they be any the less dishonored if I am condemned by default?”  Wild with grief, Mme. Favoral was wringing her hands.  “Vincent,” she murmured, “in the name of Heaven spare us the harrowing agony to have you in prison.”  Obstinately he remained silent.  His daughter, Mlle. Gilberte, dropped upon her knees before him, and, joining her hands:  “I beseech you, father,” she begged.  He shuddered all over.  An unspeakable expression of suffering and anguish contracted his features; and, speaking in a scarcely intelligible voice:  “Ah! you are cruelly protracting my agony,” he stammered.  “What do you ask of me?”  “You must fly,” declared M. Desclavettes.  “Which way?  How?  Do you not think that every precaution has been taken, that every issue is closely watched?”  Maxence interrupted him with a gesture:  “The windows in sister’s room, father,” said he, “open upon the courtyard of the adjoining house.”  “Yes; but here we are up two pairs of stairs.”  “No matter: I have a way.”  And turning towards his sister:  “Come, Gilberte,” went on the young man, “give me a light, and let me have some sheets.”  They went out hurriedly.  Mme. Favoral felt a gleam of hope.  “We are saved!” she said.  “Saved!” repeated the cashier mechanically.  “Yes; for I guess Maxence’s idea.  But we must have an understanding.  Where will you take refuge?”  “How can I tell?”  “There is a train at five minutes past eleven,” remarked M. Desormeaux.  “Don’t let us forget that.”  “But money will be required to leave by that train,” interrupted the old lawyer.  “Fortunately, I have some.”  And, forgetting his hundred and sixty thousand francs lost, he took out his pocket-book.  Mme. Favoral stopped him.  “We have more than we need,” said she.  She took from the table, and held out to her husband, the roll of bank notes which the director of the Mutual Credit Society had thrown down before going.  He refused them with a gesture of rage.  “Rather starve to death!” he exclaimed.  “‘Tis he, ‘tis that wretch--”  But he interrupted himself, and more gently:  “Put away those bank-bills,” said he to his wife, “and let Maxence take them back to M. de Thaller to-morrow.”  The bell rang violently.  “The police!” groaned Mme. Desclavettes, who seemed on the point of fainting away.  “I am going to negotiate,” said M. Desormeaux.  “Fly, Vincent: do not lose a minute.”  And he ran to the front-door, whilst Mme. Favoral was hurrying her husband towards Mlle. Gilberte’s room.  Rapidly and stoutly Maxence had fastened four sheets together by the ends, which gave a more than sufficient length.  Then, opening the window, he examined carefully the courtyard of the adjoining house.  “No one,” said he: “everybody is at dinner.  We’ll succeed.”  M. Favoral was tottering like a drunken man.  A terrible emotion convulsed his features.  Casting a long look upon his wife and children:  “O Lord!” he murmured, “what will become of you?”  “Fear nothing, father,” uttered Maxence.  “I am here.  Neither my mother nor my sister will want for any thing.”  “My son!” resumed the cashier, “my children!”  Then, with a choking voice:  “I am worthy neither of your love nor your devotion, wretch that I am!  I made you lead a miserable existence, spend a joyless youth. I imposed upon you every trial of poverty, whilst I--And now I leave you nothing but ruin and a dishonored name.”  “Make haste, father,” interrupted Mlle. Gilberte.  It seemed as if he could not make up his mind.  “It is horrible to abandon you thus.  What a parting!  Ah! death would indeed be far preferable.  What will you think of me?  I am very guilty, certainly, but not as you think.  I have been betrayed, and I must suffer for all.  If at least you knew the whole truth. But will you ever know it?  We will never see each other again.”  Desperately his wife clung to him.  “Do not speak thus,” she said.  “Wherever you may find an asylum, I will join you.  Death alone can separate us.  What do I care what you may have done, or what the world will say?  I am your wife.  Our children will come with me.  If necessary, we will emigrate to America; we’ll change our name; we will work.”  The knocks on the outer door were becoming louder and louder; and M. Desormeaux’ voice could be heard, endeavoring to gain a few moments more.  “Come,” said Maxence, “you cannot hesitate any longer.”  And, overcoming his father’s reluctance, he fastened one end of the sheets around his waist.  “I am going to let you down, father,” said he; “and, as soon as you touch the ground, you must undo the knot.  Take care of the first-story windows; beware of the concierge; and, once in the street, don’t walk too fast.  Make for the Boulevard, where you will be sooner lost in the crowd.”  The knocks had now become violent blows; and it was evident that the door would soon be broken in, if M. Desormeaux did not make up his mind to open it.  The light was put out.  With the assistance of his daughter, M. Favoral lifted himself upon the window-sill, whilst Maxence held the sheets with both hands.  “I beseech you, Vincent,” repeated Mme. Favoral, “write to us.  We shall be in mortal anxiety until we hear of your safety.”  Maxence let the sheets slip slowly: in two seconds M. Favoral stood on the pavement below.  “All right,” he said.  The young man drew the sheets back rapidly, and threw them under the bed.  But Mlle. Gilberte remained long enough at the window to recognize her father’s voice asking the concierge to open the door, and to hear the heavy gate of the adjoining house closing behind him.  “Saved!” she said.  It was none too soon.  M. Desormeaux had just been compelled to yield; and the commissary of police was walking in.    IV  The commissaries of police of Paris, as a general thing, are no simpletons; and, if they are ever taken in, it is because it has suited them to be taken in.  Their modest title covers the most important, perhaps, of magistracies, almost the only one known to the lower classes; an enormous power, and an influence so decisive, that the most sensible statesman of the reign of Louis Philippe ventured once to say, “Give me twenty good commissaries of police in Paris, and I’ll undertake to suppress any government: net profit, one hundred millions.”  Parisian above all, the commissary has had ample time to study his ground when he was yet only a peace-officer.  The dark side of the most brilliant lives has no mysteries for him.  He has received the strangest confidences: he has listened to the most astounding confessions.  He knows how low humanity can stoop, and what aberrations there are in brains apparently the soundest.  The work woman whom her husband beats, and the great lady whom her husband cheats, have both come to him.  He has been sent for by the shop-keeper whom his wife deceives, and by the millionaire who has been blackmailed.  To his office, as to a lay confessional, all passions fatally lead.  In his presence the dirty linen of two millions of people is washed _en famille_.  A Paris commissary of police, who after ten years’ practice, could retain an illusion, believe in something, or be astonished at any thing in the world, would be but a fool.  If he is still capable of some emotion, he is a good man.  The one who had just walked into M. Favoral’s apartment was already past middle age, colder than ice, and yet kindly, but of that commonplace kindliness which frightens like the executioner’s politeness at the scaffold.  He required but a single glance of his small but clear eyes to decipher the physiognomies of all these worthy people standing around the disordered table.  And beckoning to the agents who accompanied him to stop at the door,--“Monsieur Vincent Favoral?”  he inquired.  The cashier’s guests, M. Desormeaux excepted, seemed stricken with stupor.  Each one felt as if he had a share of the disgrace of this police invasion.  The dupes who are sometimes caught in clandestine “hells” have the same humiliated attitudes.  At last, and not without an effort,  “M. Favoral is no longer here,” replied M. Chapelain, the old lawyer.  The commissary of police started.  Whilst they were discussing with him through the door, he had perfectly well understood that they were only trying to gain time; and, if he had not at once burst in the door, it was solely owing to his respect for M. Desormeaux himself, whom he knew personally, and still more for his title of head clerk at the Department of Justice.  But his suspicions did not extend beyond the destruction of a few compromising papers. Whereas, in fact:  “You have helped M. Favoral to escape, gentlemen?” said he.  No one replied.  “Silence means assent,” he added.  “Very well: which way did he get off?”  Still no answer.  M. Desclavettes would have been glad to add something to the forty-five thousand francs he had just lost, to be, together with Mme. Desclavettes, a hundred miles away.  “Where is Mme. Favoral?” resumed the commissary, evidently well informed. “Where are Mlle. Gilberte and M. Maxence Favoral?”  They continued silent.  No one in the dining-room knew what might have taken place in the other room; and a single word might be treason.  The commissary then became impatient.  “Take up a light,” said he to one of the agents who had remained at the door, “and follow me.  We shall see.”  And without a shadow of hesitation, for it seems to be the privilege of police-agents to be at home everywhere, he crossed the parlor, and reached Mlle. Gilberte’s room just as she was withdrawing from the window.  “Ah, it is that way he escaped!” he exclaimed.  He rushed to the window, and remained long enough leaning on his elbows to thoroughly examine the ground, and understand the situation of the apartment.  “It’s evident,” he said at last, “this window opens on the courtyard of the next house.”  This was said to one of his agents, who bore an unmistakable resemblance to the servant who had been asking so many questions in the afternoon.  “Instead of gathering so much useless information,” he added, “why did you not post yourself as to the outlets of the house?”  He was “sold”; and yet he manifested neither spite nor anger.  He seemed in no wise anxious to run after the fugitive.  Upon the features of Maxence and of Mlle. Gilberte, and more still in Mme. Favoral’s eyes, he had read that it would be useless for the present.  “Let us examine the papers, then,” said he.  “My husband’s papers are all in his study,” replied Mme. Favoral.  “Please lead me to it, madame.”  The room which M. Favoral called loftily his study was a small room with a tile floor, white-washed walls, and meanly lighted through a narrow transom.  It was furnished with an old desk, a small wardrobe with grated door, a few shelves upon which were piled some bandboxes and bundles of old newspapers, and two or three deal chairs.  “Where are the keys?” inquired the commissary of police.  “My father always carries them in his pocket, sir,” replied Maxence.  “Then let some one go for a locksmith.”  Stronger than fear, curiosity had drawn all the guests of the cashier of the Mutual Credit Society, M. Desormeaux, M. Chapelain, M. Desclavettes himself; and, standing within the door-frame, they followed eagerly every motion of the commissary, who, pending the arrival of the locksmith, was making a flying examination of the bundles of papers left exposed upon the desk.  After a while, and unable to hold in any longer:  “Would it be indiscreet,” timidly inquired the old bronze-merchant, “to ask the nature of the charges against that poor Favoral?”  “Embezzlement, sir.”  “And is the amount large?”  “Had it been small, I should have said theft.  Embezzling commences only when the sum has reached a round figure.”  Annoyed at the sardonic tone of the commissary:  “The fact is,” resumed M. Chapelain, “Favoral was our friend; and, if we could get him out of the scrape, we would all willingly contribute.”  “It’s a matter of ten or twelve millions, gentlemen.”  Was it possible?  Was it even likely?  Could any one imagine so many millions slipping through the fingers of M. de Thaller’s methodic cashier?  “Ah, sir!” exclaimed Mme. Favoral, “if any thing could relieve my feelings, the enormity of that sum would.  My husband was a man of simple and modest tastes.”  The commissary shook his head.  “There are certain passions,” he interrupted, “which nothing betrays externally.  Gambling is more terrible than fire.  After a fire, some charred remnants are found.  What is there left after a lost game? Fortunes may be thrown into the vortex of the bourse, without a trace of them being left.”  The unfortunate woman was not convinced.  “I could swear, sir,” she protested, “that I knew how my husband spent every hour of his life.”  “Do not swear, madame.”  “All our friends will tell you how parsimonious my husband was.”  “Here, madame, towards yourself and your children, I have no doubt; for seeing is believing: but elsewhere--”  He was interrupted by the arrival of the locksmith, who, in less than five minutes, had picked all the locks of the old desk.  But in vain did the commissary search all the drawers.  He found only those useless papers which are made relics of by people who have made order their religious faith,--uninteresting letters, grocers’ and butchers’ bills running back twenty years.  “It is a waste of time to look for any thing here,” he growled.  And in fact he was about to give up his perquisitions, when a bundle thinner than the rest attracted his attention.  He cut the thread that bound it; and almost at once:  “I knew I was right,” he said.  And holding out a paper to Mme. Favoral:  “Read, madame, if you please.”  It was a bill.  She read thus:     “Sold to M. Favoral an India Cashmere, fr. 8,500.     Received payment,           FORBE & TOWLER.”  “Is it for you, madame,” asked the commissary, “that this magnificent shawl was bought?”  Stupefied with astonishment, the poor woman still refused to admit the evidence.  “Madame de Thaller spends a great deal,” she stammered.  “My husband often made important purchases for her account.”  “Often, indeed!” interrupted the commissary of police; “for here are many other receipted bills,--earrings, sixteen thousand francs; a bracelet, three thousand francs; a parlor set, a horse, two velvet dresses.  Here is a part, at least, if not the whole, of the ten millions.”    V  Had the commissary received any information in advance? or was he guided only by the scent peculiar to men of his profession, and the habit of suspecting every thing, even that which seems most unlikely?  At any rate he expressed himself in a tone of absolute certainty.  The agents who had accompanied and assisted him in his researches were winking at each other, and giggling stupidly.  The situation struck them as rather pleasant.  The others, M. Desclavettes, M. Chapelain, and the worthy M. Desormeaux himself, could have racked their brains in vain to find terms wherein to express the immensity of their astonishments. Vincent Favoral, their old friend, paying for cashmeres, diamonds, and parlor sets!  Such an idea could not enter in their minds.  For whom could such princely gifts be intended?  For a mistress, for one of those redoubtable creatures whom fancy represents crouching in the depths of love, like monsters at the bottom of their caves!  But how could any one imagine the methodic cashier of the Mutual Credit Society carried away by one of those insane passions which knew no reason?  Ruined by gambling, perhaps, but by a woman!  Could any one picture him, so homely and so plain here, Rue St. Gilles, at the head of another establishment, and leading elsewhere in one of the brilliant quarters of Paris, a reckless life, such as strike terror in the bosom of quiet families?  Could any one understand the same man at once miserly-economical and madly-prodigal, storming when his wife spent a few cents, and robbing to supply the expenses of an adventuress, and collecting in the same drawer the jeweler’s accounts and the butcher’s bills?  “It is the climax of absurdity,” murmured good M. Desormeaux.  Maxence fairly shook with wrath.  Mlle. Gilberte was weeping.  Mme. Favoral alone, usually so timid, boldly defended, and with her utmost energy, the man whose name she bore.  That he might have embezzled millions, she admitted: that he had deceived and betrayed her so shamefully, that he had made a wretched dupe of her for so many years, seemed to her insensate, monstrous, impossible.  And purple with shame:  “Your suspicions would vanish at once, sir,” she said to the commissary, “if I could but explain to you our mode of life.”  Encouraged by his first discovery, he was proceeding more minutely with his perquisitions, undoing the strings of every bundle.  “It is useless, madame,” he answered in that brief tone which made so much impression upon M. Desclavettes.  “You can only tell me what you know; and you know nothing.”  “Never, sir, did a man lead a more regular life than M. Favoral.”  “In appearance, you are right.  Besides, to regulate one’s disorder is one of the peculiarities of our time.  We open credits to our passions, and we keep account of our infamies by double entry.  We operate with method.  We embezzle millions that we may hang diamonds to the ears of an adventuress; but we are careful, and we keep the receipted bills.”  “But, sir, I have already told you that I never lost sight of my husband.”  “Of course.”  “Every morning, precisely at nine o’clock, he left home to go to M. de Thaller’s office.”  “The whole neighborhood knows that, madame.”  “At half-past five he came home.”  “That, also, is a well-known fact.”  “After dinner he went out to play a game, but it was his only amusement; and at eleven o’clock he was always in bed.”  “Perfectly correct.”  “Well, then, sir, where could M. Favoral have found time to abandon himself to the excesses of which you accuse him?”  Imperceptibly the commissary of police shrugged his shoulders.  “Far from me, madame,” he uttered, “to doubt your good faith.  What matters it, moreover, whether your husband spent in this way or in that way the sums which he is charged with having appropriated?  But what do your objections prove?  Simply that M. Favoral was very skillful, and very much self-possessed.  Had he breakfasted when he left you at nine?  No.  Pray, then, where did he breakfast?  In a restaurant?  Which?  Why did he come home only at half-past five, when his office actually closed at three o’clock?  Are you quite sure that it was to the Cafe Turc that he went every evening? Finally, why do not you say anything of the extra work which he always had to attend to, as he pretended, once or twice a month? Sometimes it was a loan, sometimes a liquidation, or a settlement of dividends, which devolved upon him.  Did he come home then?  No. He told you that he would dine out, and that it would be more convenient for him to have a cot put up in his office; and thus you were twenty-four or forty-eight hours without seeing him. Surely this double existence must have weighed heavily upon him; but he was forbidden from breaking off with you, under penalty of being caught the very next day with his hand in the till.  It is the respectability of his official life here which made the other possible,--that which has absorbed such enormous sums.  The harsher and the closer he were here, the more magnificent he could show himself elsewhere.  His household in the Rue St. Gilles was for him a certificate of impunity.  Seeing him so economical, every one thought him rich.  People who seem to spend nothing are always trusted.  Every privation which he imposed upon you increased his reputation of austere probity, and raised him farther above suspicion.”  Big tears were rolling down Mme. Favoral’s cheeks.  “Why not tell me the whole truth?” she stammered.  “Because I do not know it,” replied the commissary; “because these are all mere presumptions.  I have seen so many instances of similar calculations!”  Then regretting, perhaps, to have said so much,  “But I may be mistaken,” he added: “I do not pretend to be infallible.”  He was just then completing a brief inventory of all the papers found in the old desk.  There was nothing left but to examine the drawer which was used for a cash drawer.  He found in it in gold, notes, and small change, seven hundred and eighteen francs.  Having counted this sum, the commissary offered it to Mme. Favoral, saying,  “This belongs to you madame.”  But instinctively she withdrew her hand.  “Never!” she said.  The commissary went on with a gesture of kindness,--“I understand your scruples, madame, and yet I must insist.  You may believe me when I tell you that this little sum is fairly and legitimately yours.  You have no personal fortune.”  The efforts of the poor woman to keep from bursting into loud sobs were but too visible.  “I possess nothing in the world, sir,” she said in a broken voice. “My husband alone attended to our business-affairs.  He never spoke to me about them; and I would not have dared to question him.  Alone he disposed of our money.  Every Sunday he handed me the amount which he thought necessary for the expenses of the week, and I rendered him an account of it.  When my children or myself were in need of any thing, I told him so, and he gave me what he thought proper.  This is Saturday: of what I received last Sunday I have five francs left: that, is our whole fortune.”  Positively the commissary was moved.  “You see, then, madame,” he said, “that you cannot hesitate: you must live.”  Maxence stepped forward.  “Am I not here, sir?” he said.  The commissary looked at him keenly, and in a grave tone,  “I believe indeed, sir,” he replied, “that you will not suffer your mother and sister to want for any thing.  But resources are not created in a day.  Yours, if I have not been deceived, are more than limited just now.”  And as the young man blushed, and did not answer, he handed the seven hundred francs to Mlle. Gilberte, saying,  “Take this, mademoiselle: your mother permits it.”  His work was done. To place his seals upon M. Favoral’s study was the work of a moment.  Beckoning, then, to his agents to withdraw, and being ready to leave himself,  “Let not the seals cause you any uneasiness, madame,” said the commissary of police to Mme. Favoral.  “Before forty-eight hours, some one will come to remove these papers, and restore to you the free use of that room.”  He went out; and, as soon as the door had closed behind him,  “Well?” exclaimed M. Desormeaux;  But no one had any thing to say.  The guests of that house where misfortune had just entered were making haste to leave.  The catastrophe was certainly terrible and unforeseen; but did it not reach them too?  Did they not lose among them more than three hundred thousand francs?  Thus, after a few commonplace protestations, and some of those promises which mean nothing, they withdrew; and, as they were going down the stairs,  “The commissary took Vincent’s escape too easy,” remarked M. Desormeaux.  “He must know some way to catch him again.”    VI  At last Mme. Favoral found herself alone with her children and free to give herself up to the most frightful despair.  She dropped heavily upon a seat; and, drawing to her bosom Maxence and Gilberte,  “O my children!” she sobbed, covering them with her kisses and her tears,--“my children, we are most unfortunate.”  Not less distressed than herself, they strove, nevertheless, to mitigate her anguish, to inspire her with sufficient courage to bear this crushing trial; and kneeling at her feet, and kissing her hands,  “Are we not with you still, mother?” they kept repeating.  But she seemed not to hear them.  “It is not for myself that I weep,” she went on.  “I! what had I still to wait or hope for in life?  Whilst you, Maxence, you, my poor Gilberte!--If, at least, I could feel myself free from blame! But no.  It is my weakness and my want of courage that have brought on this catastrophe.  I shrank from the struggle.  I purchased my domestic peace at the cost of your future in the world.  I forgot that a mother has sacred duties towards her children.”  Mme. Favoral was at this time a woman of some forty-three years, with delicate and mild features, a countenance overflowing with kindness, and whose whole being exhaled, as it were, an exquisite perfume of _noblesse_ and distinction.  Happy, she might have been beautiful still,--of that autumnal beauty whose maturity has the splendors of the luscious fruits of the later season.  But she had suffered so much!  The livid paleness of her complexion, the rigid fold of her lips, the nervous shudders that shook her frame, revealed a whole existence of bitter deceptions, of exhausting struggles, and of proudly concealed humiliations.  And yet every thing seemed to smile upon her at the outset of life.  She was an only daughter; and her parents, wealthy silk-merchants, had brought her up like the daughter of an archduchess desired to marry some sovereign prince.  But at fifteen she had lost her mother.  Her father, soon tired of his lonely fireside, commenced to seek away from home some diversion from his sorrow.  He was a man of weak mind,--one of those marked in advance to play the part of eternal dupes.  Having money, he found many friends. Having once tasted the cup of facile pleasures, he yielded readily to its intoxication.  Suppers, cards, amusements, absorbed his time, to the utter detriment of his business.  And, eighteen months after his wife’s death, he had already spent a large portion of his fortune, when he fell into the hands of an adventuress, whom, without regard for his daughter, he audaciously brought beneath his own roof.  In provincial cities, where everybody knows everybody else, such infamies are almost impossible.  They are not quite so rare in Paris, where one is, so to speak, lost in the crowd, and where the restraining power of the neighbor’s opinion is lacking.  For two years the poor girl, condemned to bear this illegitimate stepmother, endured nameless sufferings.  She had just completed her eighteenth year, when, one evening, her father took her aside.  “I have made up my mind to marry again,” he said;  “but I wish first to provide you with a husband.  I have looked for one, and found him. He is not very brilliant perhaps; but he is, it seems, a good, hard-working, economical fellow, who’ll make his way in the world. I had dreamed of something better for you; but times are hard, trade is dull: in short, having only a dowry of twenty thousand francs to give you, I have no right to be very particular.  To-morrow I’ll bring you my candidate.”  And, sure enough, the next day that excellent father introduced M. Vincent Favoral to his daughter.  She was not pleased with him; but she could hardly have said that she was displeased.  He was, at the age of twenty-five, which he had just reached, a man so utterly lacking in individuality, that he could scarcely have excited any feeling either of sympathy or affection.  Suitably dressed, he seemed timid and awkward, reserved, quite diffident, and of mediocre intelligence.  He confessed to have received a most imperfect education, and declared himself quite ignorant of life.  He had scarcely any means outside his profession. He was at this time chief accountant in a large factory of the Faubourg St. Antoine, with a salary of four thousand Francs a year.  The young girl did not hesitate a moment.  Any thing appeared to her preferable to the contact of a woman whom she abhorred and despised.  She gave her consent; and, twenty days after the first interview, she had become Mme. Favoral.  Alas!  six weeks had not elapsed, before she knew that she had but exchanged her wretched fate for a more wretched one still.  Not that her husband was in any way unkind to her (he dared not, as yet); but he had revealed himself enough to enable her to judge him. He was one of those formidably selfish men who wither every thing around them, like those trees within the shadow of which nothing can grow.  His coldness concealed a stupid obstinacy; his mildness, an iron will.  If he had married, ‘twas because he thought a wife a necessary adjunct, because he desired a home wherein to command, because, above all, he had been seduced by the dowry of twenty thousand francs.  For the man had one passion,--money.  Under his placid countenance revolved thoughts of the most burning covetousness.  He wished to be rich.  Now, as he had no illusion whatever upon his own merits, as he knew himself to be perfectly incapable of any of those daring conceptions which lead to rapid fortune, as he was in no wise enterprising, he conceived but one means to achieve wealth, that is, to save, to economize, to stint himself, to pile penny upon penny.  His profession of accountant had furnished him with a number of instances of the financial power of the penny daily saved, and invested so as to yield its maximum of interest.  If ever his blue eye became animated, it was when he calculated what would be at the present time the capital produced by a simple penny placed at five per cent interest the year of the birth of our Saviour.  For him this was sublime.  He conceived nothing beyond.  One penny! He wished, he said, he could have lived eighteen hundred years, to follow the evolutions of that penny, to see it grow tenfold, a hundred-fold, produce, swell, enlarge, and become, after centuries, millions and hundreds of millions.  In spite of all, he had, during the early months of his marriage, allowed his wife to have a young servant.  He gave her from time to time, a five-franc-piece, and took her to the country on Sundays.  This was the honeymoon; and, as he declared himself, this life of prodigalities could not last.  Under a futile pretext, the little servant was dismissed.  He tightened the strings of his purse.  The Sunday excursions were suppressed.  To mere economy succeeded the niggardly parsimony which counts the grains of salt in the _pot-au-feu_, which weighs the soap for the washing, and measures the evening’s allowance of candle.  Gradually the accountant took the habit of treating his young wife like a servant, whose honesty is suspected; or like a child, whose thoughtlessness is to be feared.  Every morning he handed her the money for the expenses of the day; and every evening he expressed his surprise that she had not made better use of it.  He accused her of allowing herself to be grossly cheated, or even to be in collusion with the dealers.  He charged her with being foolishly extravagant; which fact, however, he added, did not surprise him much on the part of the daughter of a man who had dissipated a large fortune.  To cap the climax, Vincent Favoral was on the worst possible terms with his father-in-law.  Of the twenty thousand francs of his wife’s dowry, twelve thousand only had been paid, and it was in vain that he clamored for the balance.  The silk-merchant’s business had become unprofitable; he was on the verge of bankruptcy.  The eight thousand francs seemed in imminent danger.  His wife alone he held responsible for this deception.  He repeated to her constantly that she had connived with her father to “take him in,” to fleece him, to ruin him.  What an existence!  Certainly, had the unhappy woman known where to find a refuge, she would have fled from that home where each of her days was but a protracted torture.  But where could she go?  Of whom could she beg a shelter?  She had terrible temptations at this time, when she was not yet twenty, and they called her the beautiful Mme. Favoral.  Perhaps she would have succumbed, when she discovered that she was about to become a mother.  One year, day for day, after her marriage, she gave birth to a son, who received the name of Maxence.  The accountant was but indifferently pleased at the coming of this son.  It was, above all, a cause of expense.  He had been compelled to give some thirty francs to a nurse, and almost twice as much for the baby’s clothes.  Then a child breaks up the regularity of one’s habits; and he, as he affirmed, was attached to his as much as to life itself.  And now he saw his household disturbed, the hours of his meals altered, his own importance reduced, his authority even ignored.  But what mattered now to his young wife the ill-humor which he no longer took the trouble to conceal?  Mother, she defied her tyrant.  Now, at least, she had in this world a being upon whom she could lavish all her caresses so brutally repelled.  There existed a soul within which she reigned supreme.  What troubles would not a smile of her son have made her forget?  With the admirable instinct of an egotist, M. Favoral understood so well what passed in the mind of his wife, that he dared not complain too much of what the little fellow cost.  He made up his mind bravely; and when four years later, his daughter Gilberte was born, instead of lamenting:  “Bash!” said he: “God blesses large families.”    VII  But already, at this time, M. Vincent Favoral’s situation had been singularly modified.  The revolution of 1848 had just taken place.  The factory in the Faubourg St. Antoine, where he was employed, had been compelled to close its doors.  One evening, as he came home at the usual hour, he announced that he had been discharged.  Mme. Favoral shuddered at the thought of what her husband might be, without work, and deprived of his salary.  “What is to become of us?” she murmured.  He shrugged his shoulders.  Visibly he was much excited.  His cheeks were flushed; his eyes sparkled.  “Bash!” he said: “we shan’t starve for all that.”  And, as his wife was gazing at him in astonishment:  “Well,” he went on, “what are you looking at?  It is so: I know many a one who affects to live on his income, and who are not as well off as we are.”  It was, for over six years since he was married, the first time that he spoke of his business otherwise than to groan and complain, to accuse fate, and curse the high price of living.  The very day before, he had declared himself ruined by the purchase of a pair of shoes for Maxence.  The change was so sudden and so great, that she hardly knew what to think, and wondered if grief at the loss of his situation had not somewhat disturbed his mind.  “Such are women,” he went on with a giggle.  “Results astonish them, because they know nothing of the means used to bring them about.  Am I a fool, then?  Would I impose upon myself privations of all sorts, if it were to accomplish nothing?  Parbleu!  I love fine living too, I do, and good dinners at the restaurant, and the theatre, and the nice little excursions in the country.  But I want to be rich. At the price of all the comforts which I have not had, I have saved a capital, the income of which will support us all.  Eh, eh!  That’s the power of the little penny put out to fatten!”  As she went to bed that night, Mme. Favoral felt more happy than she had done since her mother’s death.  She almost forgave her husband his sordid parsimony, and the humiliations he had heaped upon her.  “Well, be it so,” she thought.  “I shall have lived miserably, I shall have endured nameless sufferings; but my children shall be rich, their life shall be easy and pleasant.”  The next day M. Favoral’s excitement had completely abated. Manifestly he regretted his confidences.  “You must not think on that account that you can waste and pillage every thing,” he declared rudely.  “Besides, I have greatly exaggerated.”  And he started in search of a situation.  To find one was likely to be difficult.  Times of revolution are not exactly propitious to industry.  Whilst the parties discussed in the Chamber, there were on the street twenty thousand clerks, who, every morning as they rose, wondered where they would dine that day.  For want of any thing better, Vincent Favoral undertook to keep books in various places,--an hour here, an hour there, twice a week in one house, four times in another.  In this way he earned as much and more than he did at the factory; but the business did not suit him.  What he liked was the office from which one does not stir, the stove-heated atmosphere, the elbow-worn desk, the leather-cushioned chair, the black alpaca sleeves over the coat.  The idea that he should on one and the same day have to do with five or six different houses, and be compelled to walk an hour, to go and work another hour at the other end of Paris, fairly irritated him.  He found himself out of his reckoning, like a horse who has turned a mill for ten years; if he is made to trot straight before him.  So, one morning, he gave up the whole thing, swearing that he would rather remain idle until he could find a place suited to his taste and his convenience; and, in the mean time, all they would have to do would be to put a little less butter in the soup, and a little more water in the wine.  He went out, nevertheless, and remained until dinner-time.  And he did the same the next and the following days.  He started off the moment he had swallowed the last mouthful of his breakfast, came home at six o’clock, dined in haste, and disappeared again, not to return until about midnight.  He had hours of delirious joy, and moments of frightful discouragement.  Sometimes he seemed horribly uneasy.  “What can he be doing?” thought Mme. Favoral.  She ventured to ask him the question one morning, when he was in fine humor.  “Well,” he answered, “am I not the master?  I am operating at the bourse, that’s all!”  He could hardly have owned to any thing that would have frightened the poor woman as much.  “Are you not afraid,” she objected, “to lose all we have so painfully accumulated?  We have children--”  He did not allow her to proceed.  “Do you take me for a child?” he exclaimed; “or do I look to you like a man so easy to be duped?  Mind to economize in your household expenses, and don’t meddle with my business.”  And he continued.  And he must have been lucky in his operations; for he had never been so pleasant at home.  All his ways had changed. He had had clothes made at a first-class tailor’s, and was evidently trying to look elegant.  He gave up his pipe, and smoked only cigars. He got tired of giving every morning the money for the house, and took the habit of handing it to his wife every week, on Sunday.  A mark of vast confidence, as he observed to her.  And so, the first time:  “Be careful,” he said, “that you don’t find yourself penniless before Thursday.”  He became also more communicative.  Often during the dinner, he would tell what he had heard during the day, anecdotes, gossip. He enumerated the persons with whom he had spoken.  He named a number of people whom he called his friends, and whose names Mme. Favoral carefully stored away in her memory.  There was one especially, who seemed to inspire him with a profound respect, a boundless admiration, and of whom he never tired of talking.  He was, said he, a man of his age,--M. de Thaller, the Baron de Thaller.  “This one,” he kept repeating, “is really mad: he is rich, he has ideas, he’ll go far.  It would be a great piece of luck if I could get him to do something for me!”  Until at last one day:  “Your parents were very rich once?” he asked his wife.  “I have heard it said,” she answered.  “They spent a good deal of money, did they not?  They had friends: they gave dinner-parties.”  “Yes, they received a good deal of company.”  “You remember that time?”  “Surely I do.”  “So that if I should take a fancy to receive some one here, some one of note, you would know how to do things properly?”  “I think so.”  He remained silent for a moment, like a man who thinks before taking an important decision, and then:  “I wish to invite a few persons to dinner,” he said.  She could scarcely believe her ears.  He had never received at his table any one but a fellow-clerk at the factory, named Desclavettes, who had just married the daughter of a dealer in bronzes, and succeeded to his business.  “Is it possible?” exclaimed Mme. Favoral.  “So it is.  The question is now, how much would a first-class dinner cost, the best of every thing?”  “That depends upon the number of guests.”  “Say three or four persons.”  The poor woman set herself to figuring diligently for some time; and then timidly, for the sum seemed formidable to her:  “I think,” she began, “that with a hundred francs--”  Her husband commenced whistling.  “You’ll need that for the wines alone;” he interrupted.  “Do you take me for a fool?  But here, don’t let us go into figures.  Do as your parents did when they did their best; and, if it’s well, I shall not complain of the expense.  Take a good cook, hire a waiter who understands his business well.”  She was utterly confounded; and yet she was not at the end of her surprises.  Soon M. Favoral declared that their table-ware was not suitable, and that he must buy a new set.  He discovered a hundred purchases to be made, and swore that he would make them.  He even hesitated a moment about renewing the parlor furniture, although it was in tolerably good condition still, and was a present from his father-in-law.  And, having finished his inventory:  “And you,” he asked his wife: “what dress will you wear?”  “I have my black silk dress--”  He stopped her.  “Which means that you have none at all,” he said.  “Very well.  You must go this very day and get yourself one,--a very handsome, a magnificent one; and you’ll send it to be made to a fashionable dressmaker.  And at the same time you had better get some little suits for Maxence and Gilberte.  Here are a thousand francs.”  Completely bewildered:  “Who in the world are you going to invite, then?” she asked.  “The Baron and the Baroness de Thaller,” he replied with an emphasis full of conviction.  “So try and distinguish yourself.  Our fortune is at stake.”  That this dinner was a matter of considerable import, Mme. Favoral could not doubt when she saw her husband’s fabulous liberality continue without flinching for a number of days.  Ten times of an afternoon he would come home to tell his wife the name of some dish that had been mentioned before him, or to consult her on the subject of some exotic viand he had just noticed in some shop-window.  Daily he brought home wines of the most fantastic vintages,--those wines which dealers manufacture for the special use of verdant fools, and which they sell in odd-shaped bottles previously overlaid with secular dust and cobwebs.  He subjected to a protracted cross-examination the cook whom Mme. Favoral had engaged, and demanded that she should enumerate the houses where she had cooked.  He absolutely required the man who was to wait at the table to exhibit the dress-coat he was to wear.  The great day having come, he did not stir from the house, going and coming from the kitchen to the dining-room, uneasy, agitated, unable to stay in one place.  He breathed only when he had seen the table set and loaded with the new china he had purchased and the magnificent silver he had gone to hire in person.  And when his young wife made her appearance, looking lovely in her new dress, and leading by the hands the two children, Maxence and Gilberte, in their new suits:  “That’s perfect,” he exclaimed, highly delighted.  “Nothing could be better.  Now, let our four guests come!”  They arrived a few minutes before seven, in two carriages, the magnificence of which astonished the Rue St. Gilles.  And, the presentations over, Vincent Favoral had at last the ineffable satisfaction to see seated at his table the Baron and Baroness de Thaller, M. Saint Pavin, who called himself a financial editor, and M. Jules Jottras, of the house of Jottras & Brother.  It was with an eager curiosity that Mme. Favoral observed these people whom her husband called his friends, and whom she saw herself for the first time.  M. de Thaller, who could not then have been much over thirty, was already a man without any particular age.  Cold, stiff, aping evidently the English style, he expressed himself in brief sentences, and with a strong foreign accent. Nothing to surprise on his countenance.  He had the forehead prominent, the eyes of a dull blue, and the nose very thin.  His scanty hair was spread over the top of his head with labored symmetry; and his red, thick, and carefully-trimmed whiskers seemed to engross much of his attention.  M. Saint Pavin had not the same stiff manner.  Careless in his dress, he lacked breeding.  He was a robust fellow, dark and bearded, with thick lips, the eye bright and prominent, spreading upon the table-cloth broad hands ornamented at the joints with small tufts of hair, speaking loud, laughing noisily, eating much and drinking more.  By the side of him, M. Jules Jottras, although looking like a fashion-plate, did not show to much advantage.  Delicate, blonde, sallow, almost beardless, M. Jottras distinguished himself only by a sort of unconscious impudence, a harmless cynicism, and a sort of spasmodic giggle, that shook the eye-glasses which he wore stuck over his nose.  But it was above all Mme. de Thaller who excited Mme. Favoral’s apprehensions.  Dressed with a magnificence of at least questionable taste, very much _decolletee_, wearing large diamonds at her ears, and rings on all her fingers, the young baroness was insolently handsome, of a beauty sensuous even to coarseness.  With hair of a bluish black, twisted over the neck in heavy ringlets, she had skin of a pearly whiteness, lips redder than blood, and great eyes that threw flames from beneath their long, curved lashes.  It was the poetry of flesh; and one could not help admiring.  Did she speak, however, or make a gesture, all admiration vanished.  The voice was vulgar, the motion common.  Did M. Jottras venture upon a double-entendre, she would throw herself back upon her chair to laugh, stretching her neck, and thrusting her throat forward.  Wholly absorbed in the care of his guests, M. Favoral remarked nothing.  He only thought of loading the plates, and filling the glasses, complaining that they ate and drank nothing, asking anxiously if the cooking was not good, if the wines were bad, and almost driving the waiter out of his wits with questions and suggestions.  It is a fact, that neither M. de Thaller nor M. Jottras had much appetite.  But M. Saint Pavin officiated for all; and the sole task of keeping up with him caused M. Favoral to become visibly animated.  His cheeks were much flushed, when, having passed the champagne all around, he raised his froth-tipped glass, exclaiming:  “I drink to the success of the business.”  “To the success of the business,” echoed the others, touching his glass.  And a few moments later they passed into the parlor to take coffee.  This toast had caused Mme. Favoral no little uneasiness.  But she found it impossible to ask a single question; Mme. de Thaller dragging her almost by force to a seat by her side on the sofa, pretending that two women always have secrets to exchange, even when they see each other for the first time.  The young baroness was fully _au fait_ in matters of bonnets and dresses; and it was with giddy volubility that she asked Mme. Favoral the names of her milliner and her dressmaker, and to what jeweler she intrusted her diamonds to be reset.  This looked so much like a joke, that the poor housekeeper of the Rue St. Gilles could not help smiling whilst answering that she had no dressmaker, and that, having no diamonds, she had no possible use for the services of a jeweler.  The other declared she could not get over it.  No diamonds!  That was a misfortune exceeding all.  And quick she seized the opportunity charitably to enumerate the parures in her jewel-case, and laces in her drawers, and the dresses in her wardrobes.  In the first place, it would have been impossible for her, she swore, to live with a husband either miserly or poor.  Hers had just presented her with a lovely coupe, lined with yellow satin, a perfect bijou.  And she made good use of it too; for she loved to go about.  She spent her days shopping, or riding in the Bois.  Every evening she had the choice of the theatre or a ball, often both.  The genre theatres were those she preferred.  To be sure, the opera and the Italiens were more stylish; but she could not help gaping there.  Then she wished to kiss the children; and Gilberte and Maxence had to be brought in.  She adored children, she vowed: it was her weakness, her passion.  She had herself a little girl, eighteen months old, called Cesarine, to whom she was devoted; and certainly she would have brought her, had she not feared she would have been in the way.  All this verbiage sounded like a confused murmur to Mme. Favoral’s ears.  “Yes, no,” she answered, hardly knowing to what she did answer.  Her head heavy with a vague apprehension, it required her utmost attention to observe her husband and his guests.  Standing by the mantel-piece, smoking their cigars, they conversed with considerable animation, but not loud enough to enable her to hear all they said.  It was only when M. Saint Pavin spoke that she understood that they were still discussing the “business;” for he spoke of articles to publish, stocks to sell, dividends to distribute, sure profits to reap.  They all, at any rate, seemed to agree perfectly; and at a certain moment she saw her husband and M. de Thaller strike each other’s hand, as people do who exchange a pledge.  Eleven o’clock struck.  M. Favoral was insisting to make his guests accept a cup of tea or a glass of punch; but M. de Thaller declared that he had some work to do, and that, his carriage having come, he must go.  And go he did, taking with him the baroness, followed by M. Saint Pavin and M. Jottras.  And when, the door having closed upon them, M. Favoral found himself alone with his wife,  “Well,” he exclaimed, swelling with gratified vanity, “what do you think of our friends?”  “They surprised me,” she answered.  He fairly jumped at that word.  “I should like to know why?”  Then, timidly, and with infinite precautions, she commenced explaining that M. de Thaller’s face inspired her with no confidence; that M. Jottras had seemed to her a very impudent personage; that M. Saint Pavin appeared low and vulgar; and that, finally, the young baroness had given her of herself the most singular idea.  M. Favoral refused to hear more.  “It’s because you have never seen people of the best society,” he exclaimed.  “Excuse me.  Formerly, during my mother’s life--”  “Eh!  Your mother never received but shop-keepers.”  The poor woman dropped her head.  “I beg of you, Vincent,” she insisted, “before doing any thing with these new friends, think well, consult--”  He burst out laughing.  “Are you not afraid that they will cheat me?” he said,--“people ten times as rich as we are.  Here, don’t let us speak of it any more, and let us go to bed.  You’ll see what this dinner will bring us, and whether I ever have reason to regret the money we have spent.”    VIII  When, on the morning after this dinner, which was to form an era in her life, Mme. Favoral woke up, her husband was already up, pencil in hand, and busy figuring.  The charm had vanished with the fumes of the champagne; and the clouds of the worst days were gathering upon his brow.  Noticing that his wife was looking at him,  “It’s expensive work,” he said in a bluff tone, “to set a business going; and it wouldn’t do to commence over again every day.”  To hear him speak, one would have thought that Mme. Favoral alone, by dint of hard begging, had persuaded him into that expense which he now seemed to regret so much.  She quietly called his attention to the fact, reminding him that, far from urging, she had endeavored to hold him back; repeating that she augured ill of that business over which he was so enthusiastic, and that, if he would believe her, he would not venture.  “Do you even know what the project is?” he interrupted rudely.  “You have not told me.”  “Very well, then: leave me in peace with your presentiments.  You dislike my friends; and I saw very well how you treated Mme. de Thaller.  But I am the master; and what I have decided shall be. Besides, I have signed.  Once for all, I forbid you ever speaking to me again on that subject.”  Whereupon, having dressed himself with much care, he started off, saying that he was expected at breakfast by Saint Pavin, the financial editor, and by M. Jottras, of the house of Jottras & Brother.  A shrewd woman would not have given it up so easy, and, in the end, would probably have mastered the despot, whose intellect was far from brilliant.  But Mme. Favoral was too proud to be shrewd; and besides, the springs of her will had been broken by the successive oppression of an odious stepmother and a brutal master.  Her abdication of all was complete.  Wounded, she kept the secret of her wound, hung her head, and said nothing.  She did not, therefore, venture a single allusion; and nearly a week elapsed, during which the names of her late guests were not once mentioned.  It was through a newspaper, which M. Favoral had forgotten in the parlor, that she learned that the Baron de Thaller had just founded a new stock company, the Mutual Credit Society, with a capital of several millions.  Below the advertisement, which was printed in enormous letters, came a long article, in which it was demonstrated that the new company was, at the same time, a patriotic undertaking and an institution of credit of the first class; that it supplied a great public want; that it would be of inestimable benefit to industry; that its profits were assured; and that to subscribe to its stock was simply to draw short bills upon fortune.  Already somewhat re-assured by the reading of this article, Mme. Favoral became quite so when she read the names of the board of directors.  Nearly all were titled, and decorated with many foreign orders; and the remainder were bankers, office-holders, and even some ex-ministers.  “I must have been mistaken,” she thought, yielding unconsciously to the influence of printed evidence.  And no objection occurred to her, when, a few days later, her husband told her,  “I have the situation I wanted.  I am head cashier of the company of which M. de Thaller is manager.”  That was all.  Of the nature of this society, of the advantages which it offered him, not one word.  Only by the way in which he expressed himself did Mme. Favoral judge that he must have been well treated; and he further confirmed her in that opinion by granting her, of his own accord, a few additional francs for the daily expenses of the house.  “We must,” he declared on this memorable occasion, “do honor to our social position, whatever it may cost.”  For the first time in his life, he seemed heedful of public opinion. He recommended his wife to be careful of her dress and of that of the children, and re-engaged a servant.  He expressed the wish of enlarging their circle of acquaintances, and inaugurated his Saturday dinners, to which came assiduously, M. and Mme. Desclavettes, M. Chapelain the attorney, the old man Desormeaux, and a few others.  As to himself he gradually settled down into those habits from which he was nevermore to depart, and the chronometric regularity of which had secured him the nickname of Old Punctuality, of which he was proud.  In all other respects never did a man, to such a degree, become so utterly indifferent to his wife and children.  His house was for him but a mere hotel, where he slept, and took his evening meal.  He never thought of questioning his wife as to the use of her time, and what she did in his absence.  Provided she did not ask him for money, and was there when he came home, he was satisfied.  Many women, at Mme. Favoral’s age, might have made a strange use of that insulting indifference and of that absolute freedom.  If she did avail herself of it, it was solely to follow one of those inspirations which can only spring in a mother’s heart.  The increase in the budget of the household was relatively large, but so nicely calculated, that she had not one cent more that she could call her own.  With the most intense sorrow, she thought that her children might have to endure the humiliating privations which had made her own life wretched.  They were too young yet to suffer from the paternal parsimony; but they would grow; their desires would develop; and it would be impossible for her to grant them the most innocent satisfactions.  Whilst turning over and over in her mind this distressing thought, she remembered a friend of her mother’s, who kept, in the Rue St. Denis, a large establishment for the sale of hosiery and woollen goods.  There, perhaps, lay the solution of the problem.  She called to see the worthy woman, and, without even needing to confess the whole truth to her, she obtained sundry pieces of work, ill paid as a matter of course, but which, by dint of close application, might be made to yield from eight to twelve francs a week.  From this time she never lost a minute, concealing her work as if it were an evil act.  She knew her husband well enough to feel certain that he would break out, and swear that he spent money enough to enable his wife to live without being reduced to making a work woman of herself.  But what joy, the day when she hid way down at the bottom of a drawer the first twenty-franc-piece she had earned, a beautiful gold-piece, which belonged to her without contest, and which she might spend as she pleased, without having to render any account to any one!  And with what pride, from week to week, she saw her little treasure swell, despite the drafts she made upon it, sometimes to buy a toy for Maxence, sometimes to add a few ribbons or trinkets to Gilberte’s toilet!  This was the happiest time of her life, a halt in that painful journey through which she had been dragging herself for so many years.  Between her two children, the hours flew light and rapid as so many seconds.  If all the hopes of the young girl and of the woman had withered before they had blossomed, the mother’s joys at least should not fail her.  Because, whilst the present sufficed to her modest ambition, the future had ceased to cause her any uneasiness.  No reference had ever been made, between herself and her husband, to that famous dinner-party: he never spoke to her of the Mutual Credit Society; but now and then he allowed some words or exclamations to escape, which she carefully recorded, and which betrayed a prosperous state of affairs.  “That Thaller is a tough fellow!” he would exclaim, “and he has the most infernal luck!”  And at other times,  “Two or three more operations like the one we have just successfully wound up, and we can shut up shop!”  From all this, what could she conclude, if not that he was marching with rapid strides towards that fortune, the object of all his ambition?  Already in the neighborhood he had that reputation to be very rich, which is the beginning of riches itself.  He was admired for keeping his house with such rigid economy; for a man is always esteemed who has money, and does not spend it.  “He is not the man ever to squander what he has,” the neighbors repeated.  The persons whom he received on Saturdays believed him more than comfortably off.  When M. Desclavettes and M. Chapelain had complained to their hearts’ contents, the one of the shop, the other of his office, they never failed to add,  “You laugh at us, because you are engaged in large operations, where people make as much money as they like.”  They seemed to hold his financial capacities in high estimation. They consulted him, and followed his advice.  M. Desormeaux was wont to say,  “Oh! he knows what he is about.”  And Mme. Favoral tried to persuade herself, that, in this respect at least, her husband was a remarkable man.  She attributed his silence and his distractions to the grave cares that filled his mind. In the same manner that he had once announced to her that they had enough to live on, she expected him, some fine morning, to tell her that he was a millionaire.    IX  But the respite granted by fate to Mme. Favoral was drawing to an end: her trials were about to return more poignant than ever, occasioned, this time, by her children, hitherto her whole happiness and her only consolation.  Maxence was nearly twelve.  He was a good little fellow, intelligent, studious at times, but thoughtless in the extreme, and of a turbulence which nothing could tame.  At the Massin School, where he had been sent, he made his teachers’ hair turn white; and not a week went by that he did not signalize himself by some fresh misdeed.  A father like any other would have paid but slight attention to the pranks of a schoolboy, who, after all, ranked among the first of his class, and of whom the teachers themselves, whilst complaining, said,  “Bash!  What matters it, since the heart is sound and the mind sane?”  But M. Favoral took every thing tragically.  If Maxence was kept in, or otherwise punished, he pretended that it reflected upon himself, and that his son was disgracing him.  If a report came home with this remark, “execrable conduct,” he fell into the most violent passion, and seemed to lose all control of himself.  “At your age,” he would shout to the terrified boy, “I was working in a factory, and earning my livelihood.  Do you suppose that I will not tire of making sacrifices to procure you the advantages of an education which I lacked myself?  Beware.  Havre is not far off; and cabin-boys are always in demand there.”  If, at least, he had confined himself to these admonitions, which, by their very exaggeration, failed in their object!  But he favored mechanical appliances as a necessary means of sufficiently impressing reprimands upon the minds of young people; and therefore, seizing his cane, he would beat poor Maxence most unmercifully, the more so that the boy, filled with pride, would have allowed himself to be chopped to pieces rather than utter a cry, or shed a tear.  The first time that Mme. Favoral saw her son struck, she was seized with one of those wild fits of anger which do not reason, and never forgive.  To be beaten herself would have seemed to her less atrocious, less humiliating.  Hitherto she had found it impossible to love a husband such as hers: henceforth, she took him in utter aversion: he inspired her with horror.  She looked upon her son as a martyr for whom she could hardly ever do enough.  And so, after these harrowing scenes, she would press him to her heart in the most passionate embrace; she would cover with her kisses the traces of the blows; and she would strive, by the most delirious caresses, to make him forget the paternal brutalities.  With him she sobbed.  Like him, she would shake her clinched fists in the vacant space; exclaiming, “Coward, tyrant, assassin!”  The little Gilberte mingled her tears with theirs; and, pressed against each other, they deplored their destiny, cursing the common enemy, the head of the family.  Thus did Maxence spend his boyhood between equally fatal exaggerations, between the revolting brutalities of his father, and the dangerous caresses of his mother; the one depriving him of every thing, the other refusing him nothing.  For Mme. Favoral had now found a use for her humble savings.  If the idea had never come to the cashier of the Mutual Credit Society to put a few sous in his son’s pocket, the too weak mother would have suggested to him the want of money in order to have the pleasure of gratifying it.  She who had suffered so many humiliations in her life, she could not bear the idea of her son having his pride wounded, and being unable to indulge in those little trifling expenses which are the vanity of schoolboys.  “Here, take this,” she would tell him on holidays, slipping a few francs into his hands.  Unfortunately, to her present she joined the recommendation not to allow his father to know any thing about it; forgetting that she was thus training Maxence to dissimulate, warping his natural sense of right, and perverting his instincts.  No, she gave; and, to repair the gaps thus made in her treasure, she worked to the point of ruining her sight, with such eager zeal, that the worthy shop-keeper of the Rue St. Denis asked her if she did not employ working girls.  In truth, the only help she received was from Gilberte, who, at the age of eight, already knew how to make herself useful.  And this is not all.  For this son, in anticipation of growing expenses, she stooped to expedients which formerly would have seemed to her unworthy and disgraceful.  She robbed the household, cheating on her own marketing.  She went so far as to confide to her servant, and to make of the girl the accomplice of her operations.  She applied all her ingenuity to serve to M. Favoral dinners in which the excellence of the dressing concealed the want of solid substance. And on Sunday, when she rendered her weekly accounts, it was without a blush that she increased by a few centimes the price of each object, rejoicing when she had thus scraped a dozen francs, and finding, to justify herself to her own eyes, those sophisms which passion never lacks.  At first Maxence was too young to wonder from what sources his mother drew the money she lavished upon his schoolboy fancies.  She recommended him to hide from his father: he did so, and thought it perfectly natural.  As he grew older, he learned to discern.  The moment came when he opened his eyes upon the system under which the paternal household was managed.  He noticed there that anxious economy which seems to betray want, and the acrimonious discussions which arose upon the inconsiderate use of a twenty-franc-piece.  He saw his mother realize miracles of industry to conceal the shabbiness of her toilets, and resort to the most skillful diplomacy when she wished to purchase a dress for Gilberte.  And, despite all this, he had at his disposition as much money as those of his comrades whose parents had the reputation to be the most opulent and the most generous.  Anxious, he questioned his mother.  “Eh, what does it matter?” she answered, blushing and confused.  “Is that any thing to worry you?”  And, as he insisted,  “Go ahead,” she said: “we are rich enough.”  But he could hardly believe her, accustomed as he was to hear every one talk of poverty; and, as he fixed upon her his great astonished eyes,  “Yes,” she resumed, with an imprudence which fatally was to bear its fruits, “we are rich; and, if we live as you see, it is because it suits your father, who wishes to amass a still greater fortune.”  This was hardly an answer; and yet Maxence asked no further question. But he inquired here and there, with that patient shrewdness of young people possessed with a fixed idea.  Already, at this time, M. Favoral had in the neighborhood, and ever among his friends, the reputation to be worth at least a million. The Mutual Credit Society had considerably developed itself: he must, they thought, have benefitted largely by the circumstance; and the profits must have swelled rapidly in the hands of so able a man, and one so noted for his rigid economy.  Such is the substance of what Maxence heard; and people did not fail to add ironically, that he need not rely upon the paternal fortune to amuse himself.  M. Desormeaux himself, whom he had “pumped” rather cleverly, had told him, whilst patting him amicably on the shoulder,  “If you ever need money for your frolics, young man, try and earn it; for I’ll be hanged if it’s the old man who’ll ever supply it.”  Such answers complicated, instead of explaining, the problem which occupied Maxence.  He observed, he watched; and at last he acquired the certainty that the money he spent was the fruit of the joint labor of his mother and sister.  “Ah! why not have told me so?” he exclaimed, throwing his arms around his mother’s neck.  “Why have exposed me to the bitter regrets which I feel at this moment?”  By this sole word the poor woman found herself amply repaid.  She admired the _noblesse_ of her son’s feelings and the kindness of his heart.  “Do you not understand,” she told him, shedding tears of joy, “do you not see, that the labor which can promote her son’s pleasure is a happiness for his mother?”  But he was dismayed at his discovery.  “No matter!” he said.  “I swear that I shall no longer scatter to the winds, as I have been doing, the money that you give me.”  For a few weeks, indeed, he was faithful to his pledge.  But at fifteen resolutions are not very stanch.  The impressions he had felt wore off.  He became tired of the small privations which he had to impose upon himself.  He soon came to take to the letter what his mother had told him, and to prove to his own satisfaction that to deprive himself of a pleasure was to deprive her.  He asked for ten francs one day, then ten francs another, and gradually resumed his old habits.  He was at this time about leaving school.  “The moment has come,” said M. Favoral, “for him to select a career, and support himself.”    X  To think of a profession, Maxence Favoral had not waited for the paternal warnings.  Modern schoolboys are precocious: they know the strong and the weak side of life; and, when they take their degree, they already have but few illusions left.  And how could it be otherwise?  In the interior of the colleges is fatally found the echo of the thoughts, and the reflex of the manners, of the time.  Neither walls nor keepers can avail.  At the same time, as the city mud that stains their boots, the scholars bring back on their return from holidays their stock of observations and of facts.  And what have they seen during the day in their families, or among their friends?  Ardent cravings, insatiable appetites for luxuries, comforts, enjoyments, pleasures, contempt for patient labor, scorn for austere convictions, eager longing for money, the will to become rich at any cost, and the firm resolution to ravish fortune on the first favorable occasion.  To be sure, they have dissembled in their presence; but their perceptions are keen.  True, their father has told them in a grave tone, that there is nothing respectable in this world except labor and honesty; but they have caught that same father scarcely noticing a poor devil of an honest man, and bowing to the earth before some clever rascal bearing the stigma of three judgments, but worth six millions.  Conclusion?  Oh! they know very well how to conclude; for there are none such as young people to be logical, and to deduce the utmost consequences of a fact.  They know, the most of them, that they will have to do something or other; but what?  And it is then, that, during the recreations, their imagination strives to find that hitherto unknown profession which is to give them fortune without work, and freedom at the same time as a brilliant situation.  They discuss and criticise freely all the careers which are open to youthful ambition.  And how they laugh, if some simple fellow ventures upon suggesting some of those modest situations where they earn one hundred and fifty francs a month at the start!  One hundred and fifty francs!--why, it’s hardly as much as many a boy spends for his cigars, and his cab-fares when he is late.  Maxence was neither better nor worse than the rest.  Like the rest he strove to discover the ideal profession which makes a man rich, and amuses him at the same time.  Under the pretext that he drew nicely, he spoke of becoming a painter, calculating coolly what painting may yield, and reckoning, according to some newspaper, the earnings of Corot or Geroine, Ziem, Bouguereau, and some others, who are reaping at last the fruits of unceasing efforts and crushing labors.  But, in the way of pictures, M. Vincent Favoral appreciated only the blue vignettes of the Bank of France.  “I wish no artists in my family,” he said, in a tone that admitted of no reply.  Maxence would willingly have become an engineer, for it’s rather the style to be an engineer now-a-days; but the examinations for the Polytechnic School are rather steep.  Or else a cavalry officer; but the two years at Saint Cyr are not very gay.  Or chief clerk, like M. Desormeaux; but he would have to begin by being supernumerary.  Finally after hesitating for a long time between law and medicine, he made up his mind to become a lawyer, influenced above all, by the joyous legends of the Latin quarter.  That was not exactly M. Vincent Favoral’s dream.  “That’s going to cost money again,” he growled.  The fact is, he had indulged in the fallacious hope that his son, as soon as he left college, would enter at once some business-house, where he would earn enough to take care of himself.  He yielded at last, however, to the persistent entreaties of his wife, and the solicitations of his friends.  “Be it so,” he said to Maxence: “you will study law.  Only, as it cannot suit me that you should waste your days lounging in the billiard-rooms of the left bank, you shall at the same time work in an attorney’s office.  Next Saturday I shall arrange with my friend Chapelain.”  Maxence had not bargained for such an arrangement; and he came near backing out at the prospect of a discipline which he foresaw must be as exacting as that of the college.  Still, as he could think of nothing better, he persevered.  And, vacations over, he was duly entered at the law-school, and settled at a desk in M. Chapelain’s office, which was then in the Rue St. Antoine.  The first year every thing went on tolerably.  He enjoyed as much freedom as he cared to.  His father did not allow him one centime for his pocket-money; but the attorney, in his capacity of an old friend of the family, did for him what he had never done before for an amateur clerk, and allowed him twenty francs a month.  Mme. Favoral adding to this a few five-franc pieces, Maxence declared himself entirely satisfied.  Unfortunately, with his lively imagination and his impetuous temper, no one was less fit than himself for that peaceful existence, that steady toil, the same each day, without the stimulus of difficulties to overcome, or the satisfaction of results obtained.  Before long he became tired of it.  He had found at the law-school a number of his old schoolmates whose parents resided in the provinces, and who, consequently, lived as they pleased in the Latin quarter, less assiduous to the lectures than to the Spring Brewery and the Closerie des Lilas.[*]     [ * A noted dancing-garden. ]  He envied them their joyous life, their freedom without control, their facile pleasures, their furnished rooms, and even the low eating-house where they took their meals.  And, as much as possible, he lived with them and like them.  But it is not with M. Chapelain’s twenty francs that it would have been possible for him to keep up with fellows, who, with superb recklessness, took on credit everything they could get, reserving the amount of their allowance for those amusements which had to be paid for in cash.  But was not Mme. Favoral here?  She had worked so much, the poor woman, especially since Mlle. Gilberte had become almost a young lady; she had so much saved, so much stinted, that her reserve, notwithstanding repeated drafts, amounted to a good round sum.  When Maxence wanted two or three napoleons, he had but a word to say; and he said it often.  Thus, after a while, he became an excellent billiard-player; he kept his colored meerschaum in the rack of a popular brewery; he took absinthe before dinner, and spent his evenings in the laudable effort to ascertain how many mugs of beer he could “put away.”  Gaining in audacity, he danced at Bullier’s, dined at Foyd’s, and at last had a mistress.  So much so, that one afternoon, M. Favoral having to visit on business the other side of the water, found himself face to face with his son, who was coming along, a cigar in his mouth, and having on his arm a young lady, painted in superior style, and harnessed with a toilet calculated to make the cab-horses rear.  He returned to the Rue St. Gilles in a state of indescribable rage.  “A woman!” he exclaimed in a tone of offended modesty.  “A woman! --he, my son!”  And when that son made his appearance, looking quite sheepish, his first impulse was to resort to his former mode of correction.  But Maxence was now over nineteen years of age.  At the sight of the uplifted cane, he became whiter than his shirt; and, wrenching it from his father’s hands, he broke it across his knees, threw the pieces violently upon the floor, and sprang out of the house.  “He shall never again set his foot here!” screamed the cashier of the Mutual Credit, thrown beside himself by an act of resistance which seemed to him unheard of.  “I banish him.  Let his clothes be packed up, and taken to some hotel: I never want to see him again.”  For a long time Mme. Favoral and Gilberte fairly dragged themselves at his feet, before he consented to recall his determination.  “He will disgrace us all!” he kept repeating, seeming unable to understand that it was himself who had, as it were, driven Maxence on to the fatal road which he was pursuing, forgetting that the absurd severities of the father prepared the way for the perilous indulgence of the mother, unwilling to own that the head of a family has other duties besides providing food and shelter for his wife and children, and that a father has but little right to complain who has not known how to make himself the friend and the adviser of his son.  At last, after the most violent recriminations, he forgave, in appearance at least.  But the scales had dropped from his eyes.  He started in quest of information, and discovered startling enormities.  He heard from M. Chapelain that Maxence remained whole weeks at a time without appearing at the office.  If he had not complained before, it was because he had yielded to the urgent entreaties of Mme. Favoral; and he was now glad, he added, of an opportunity to relieve his conscience by a full confession.  Thus the cashier discovered, one by one, all his son’s tricks.  He heard that he was almost unknown at the law-school, that he spent his days in the cafes, and that, in the evening, when he believed him in bed and asleep, he was in fact running out to theatres and to balls.  “Ah! that’s the way, is it?” he thought.  “Ah, my wife and children are in league against me,--me, the master.  Very well, we’ll see.”    XI  From that morning war was declared.  From that day commenced in the Rue St. Gilles one of those domestic dramas which are still awaiting their Moliere,--a drama of distressing vulgarity and sickening realism, but poignant, nevertheless; for it brought into action tears, blood, and a savage energy.  M. Favoral thought himself sure to win; for did he not have the key of the cash, and is not the key of the cash the most formidable weapon in an age where every thing begins and ends with money?  Nevertheless, he was filled with irritating anxieties.  He who had just discovered so many things which he did not even suspect a few days before, he could not discover the source whence his son drew the money which flowed like water from his prodigal hands.  He had made sure that Maxence had no debts; and yet it could not be with M. Chapelain’s monthly twenty francs that he fed his frolics.  Mme. Favoral and Gilberte, subjected separately to a skillful interrogatory, had managed to keep inviolate the secret of their mercenary labor.  The servant, shrewdly questioned, had said nothing that could in any way cause the truth to be suspected.  Here was, then, a mystery; and M. Favoral’s constant anxiety could be read upon his knitted brows during his brief visits to the house; that is, during dinner.  From the manner in which he tasted his soup, it was easy to see that he was asking himself whether that was real soup, and whether he was not being imposed upon.  From the expression of his eyes, it was easy to guess this question constantly present to his mind.  “They are robbing me evidently; but how do they do it?”  And he became distrustful, fussy, and suspicious, to an extent that he had never been before.  It was with the most insulting precautions that he examined every Sunday his wife’s accounts.  He took a look at the grocer’s, and settled it himself every month: he had the butcher’s bills sent to him in duplicate.  He would inquire the price of an apple as he peeled it over his plate, and never failed to stop at the fruiterer’s and ascertain that he had not been deceived.  But it was all in vain.  And yet he knew that Maxence always had in his pocket two or three five-franc pieces.  “Where do you steal them?” he asked him one day.  “I save them out of my salary,” boldly answered the young man.  Exasperated, M. Favoral wished to make the whole world take an interest in his investigations.  And one Saturday evening, as he was talking with his friends, M. Chapelain, the worthy Desclavettes, and old man Desormeaux, pointing to his wife and daughter:  “Those d---d women rob me,” he said, “for the benefit of my son; and they do it so cleverly that I can’t find out how.  They have an understanding with the shop-keepers, who are but licensed thieves; and nothing is eaten here that they don’t make me pay double its value.”  M. Chapelain made an ill-concealed grimace; whilst M. Desclavettes sincerely admired a man who had courage enough to confess his meanness.  But M. Desormeaux never minced things.  “Do you know, friend Vincent,” he said, “that it requires a strong stomach to take dinner with a man who spends his time calculating the cost of every mouthful that his guests swallow?”  M. Favoral turned red in the face.  “It is not the expense that I deplore,” he replied, “but the duplicity.  I am rich enough, thank Heaven! not to begrudge a few francs; and I would gladly give to my wife twice as much as she takes, if she would only ask it frankly.”  But that was a lesson.  Hereafter he was careful to dissimulate, and seemed exclusively occupied in subjecting his son to a system of his invention, the excessive rigor of which would have upset a steadier one than he.  He demanded of him daily written attestations of his attendance both at the law-school and at the lawyer’s office.  He marked out the itinerary of his walks for him, and measured the time they required, within a few minutes.  Immediately after dinner he shut him up in his room, under lock and key, and never failed, when he came home at ten o’clock to make sure of his presence.  He could not have taken steps better calculated to exalt still more Mme. Favoral’s blind tenderness.  When she heard that Maxence had a mistress, she had been rudely shocked in her most cherished feelings.  It is never without a secret jealousy that a mother discovers that a woman has robbed her of her son’s heart.  She had retained a certain amount of spite against him on account of disorders, which, in her candor, she had never suspected.  She forgave him every thing when she saw of what treatment he was the object.  She took sides with him, believing him to be the victim of a most unjust persecution.  In the evening, after her husband had gone out, Gilberte and herself would take their sewing, sit in the hall outside his room, and converse with him through the door.  Never had they worked so hard for the shop-keeper in the Rue St. Denis.  Some weeks they earned as much as twenty-five or thirty francs.  But Maxence’s patience was exhausted; and one morning he declared resolutely that he would no longer attend the law-school, that he had been mistaken in his vocation, and that there was no human power capable to make him return to M. Chapelain’s.  “And where will you go?” exclaimed his father.  “Do you expect me eternally to supply your wants?”  He answered that it was precisely in order to support himself, and conquer his independence, that he had resolved to abandon a profession, which, after two years, yielded him twenty francs a month.  “I want some business where I have a chance to get rich,” he replied. “I would like to enter a banking-house, or some great financial establishment.”  Mme. Favoral jumped at the idea.  “That’s a fact,” she said to her husband.  “Why couldn’t you find a place for our son at the Mutual Credit?  There he would be under your own eyes.  Intelligent as he is, backed by M. de Thaller and yourself, he would soon earn a good salary.”  M. Favoral knit his brows.  “That I shall never do,” he uttered.  “I have not sufficient confidence in my son.  I cannot expose myself to have him compromise the consideration which I have acquired for myself.”  And, revealing to a certain extent the secret of his conduct:  “A cashier,” he added, “who like me handles immense sums cannot be too careful of his reputation.  Confidence is a delicate thing in these times, when there are so many cashiers constantly on the road to Belgium.  Who knows what would be thought of me, if I was known to have such a son as mine?”  Mme. Favoral was insisting, nevertheless, when he seemed to make up his mind suddenly.  “Enough,” he said.  “Maxence is free.  I allow him two years to establish himself in some position.  That delay over, good-by: he can find board and lodging where he please.  That’s all.  I don’t want to hear any thing more about it.”  It was with a sort of frenzy that Maxence abused that freedom; and in less than two weeks he had dissipated three months’ earnings of his mother and sister.  That time over, he succeeded, thanks to M. Chapelain, in finding a place with an architect.  This was not a very brilliant opening; and the chances were, that he might remain a clerk all his life.  But the future did not trouble him much.  For the present, he was delighted with this inferior position, which assured him each month one hundred and seventy-five francs.  One hundred and seventy-five francs!  A fortune.  And so he rushed into that life of questionable pleasures, where so many wretches have left not only the money which they had, which is nothing, but the money which they had not, which leads straight to the police-court.  He made friends with those shabby fellows who walk up and down in front of the Cafe Riche, with an empty stomach, and a tooth-pick between their teeth.  He became a regular customer at those low cafes of the Boulevards, where plastered girls smile to the men.  He frequented those suspicious table d’hotes where they play baccarat after dinner on a wine-stained table-cloth, and where the police make periodical raids.  He ate suppers in those night restaurants where people throw the bottles at each other’s heads after drinking their contents.  Often he remained twenty-four hours without coming to the Rue St. Gilles; and then Mme. Favoral spent the night in the most fearful anxiety.  Then, suddenly, at some hour when he knew his father to be absent, he would appear, and, taking his mother to one side:  “I very much want a few louis,” he would say in a sheepish tone.  She gave them to him; and she kept giving them so long as she had any, not, however, without observing timidly to him that Gilberte and herself could not earn very much.  Until finally one evening, and to a last demand:  “Alas!” she answered sorrowfully, “I have nothing left, and it is only on Monday that we are to take our work back.  Couldn’t you wait until then?”  He could not wait: he was expected for a game.  Blind devotion begets ferocious egotism.  He wanted his mother to go out and borrow the money from the grocer or the butcher.  She was hesitating.  He spoke louder.  Then Mlle. Gilberte appeared.  “Have you, then, really no heart?” she said.  “It seems to me, that, if I were a man, I would not ask my mother and sister to work for me.”    XII  Gilberte Favoral had just completed her eighteenth year.  Rather tall, slender, her every motion betrayed the admirable proportions of her figure, and had that grace which results from the harmonious blending of litheness and strength.  She did not strike at first sight; but soon a penetrating and indefinable charm arose from her whole person; and one knew not which to admire most,--the exquisite perfections of her figure, the divine roundness of her neck, her aerial carriage, or the placid ingenuousness of her attitudes.  She could not be called beautiful, inasmuch as her features lacked regularity; but the extreme mobility of her countenance, upon which could be read all the emotions of her soul, had an irresistible seduction.  Her large eyes, of velvety blue, had untold depths and an incredible intensity of expression; the imperceptible quiver of her rosy nostrils revealed an untamable pride; and the smile that played upon her lips told her immense contempt for every thing mean and small.  But her real beauty was her hair,--of a blonde so luminous that it seemed powdered with diamond-dust; so thick and so long, that to be able to twist and confine it, she had to cut off heavy locks of it to the very root.  Alone, in the house, she did not tremble at her father’s voice.  The studied despotism which had subdued Mme. Favoral had revolted her, and her energy had become tempered under the same system of oppression which had unnerved Maxence.  Whilst her mother and her brother lied with that quiet impudence of the slave, whose sole weapon is duplicity, Gilberte preserved a sullen silence.  And if complicity was imposed upon her by circumstances, if she had to maintain a falsehood, each word cost her such a painful effort, that her features became visibly altered.  Never, when her own interests were alone at stake, had she stooped to an untruth.  Fearlessly, and whatever might be the result,  “That is the fact,” she would say.  Accordingly, M. Favoral could not help respecting her to a degree; and, when he was in fine humor, he called her the Empress Gilberte. For her alone he had some deference and some attentions.  He moderated, when she looked at him, the brutality of his language. He brought her a few flowers every Saturday.  He had even allowed her a professor of music; though he was wont to declare that a woman needs but two accomplishments,--to cook and to sew.  But she had insisted so much, that he had at last discovered for her, in an attic of the Rue du Pas-de-la-Mule, an old Italian master, the Signor Gismondo Pulei, a sort of unknown genius, for whom thirty francs a month were a fortune, and who conceived a sort of religious fanaticism for his pupil.  Though he had always refused to write a note, he consented, for her sake, to fix the melodies that buzzed in his cracked brain; and some of them proved to be admirable.  He dreamed to compose for her an opera that would transmit to the most remote generations the name of Gismondo Pulei.  “The Signora Gilberte is the very goddess of music,” he said to M. Favoral, with transports of enthusiasm, which intensified still his frightful accent.  The cashier of the Mutual Credit Society shrugged his shoulders, answering that there is no harmony for a man who spends his days listening to the exciting music of golden coins.  In spite of which his vanity seemed highly gratified, when on Saturday evenings, after dinner, Mlle. Gilberte sat at the piano, and Mme. Desclavettes, suppressing a yawn, would exclaim,  “What remarkable talent the dear child has!”  The young girl had, then, a positive influence; and it was to her entreaties alone, and not to those of his wife, that he had several times forgiven Maxence.  He would have done much more for her, had she wished it; but she would have been compelled to ask, to insist, to beg.  “And it’s humiliating,” she used to say.  Sometimes Mme. Favoral scolded her gently, saying that her father would certainly not refuse her one of those pretty toilets which are the ambition and the joy of young girls.  But she:  “It is much less mortification to me to wear these rags than to meet with a refusal,” she replied.  “I am satisfied with my dresses.”  With such a character, surrounded, however, by a meek resignation, and an unalterable _sang-froid_, she inspired a certain respect to both her mother and her brother, who admired in her an energy of which they felt themselves incapable.  And when she appeared, and commenced reproaching him in an indignant tone of voice, with the baseness of his conduct, and his insatiate demands, Maxence was almost stunned.  “I did not know,” he commenced, turning as red as fire.  She crushed him with a look of mingled contempt and pity; and, in an accent of haughty irony:  “Indeed,” she said, “you do not know whence the money comes that you extort from our mother!”  And holding up her hand, still remarkably handsome, though slightly deformed by the constant handling of the needle; the fourth finger of the right hand bent by the thread, and the fore-finger of the left tattooed and lacerated by the needle:  “Indeed,” she repeated, “you do not know that my mother and myself, we spend all our days, and the greater part of our nights, working?”  Hanging his head, he said nothing.  “If it were for myself alone,” she continued, “I would not speak to you thus.  But look at our mother!  See her poor eyes, red and weak from her ceaseless labor!  If I have said nothing until now, it is because I did not as yet despair of your heart; because I hoped that you would recover some feeling of decency.  But no, nothing.  With time, your last scruples seem to have vanished.  Once you begged humbly; now you demand rudely.  How soon will you resort to blows?”  “Gilberte!” stammered the poor fellow, “Gilberte!”  She interrupted him:  “Money!” she went on, “always, and without time, you must have money; no matter whence it comes, nor what it costs.  If, at least, you had to justify your expenses, the excuse of some great passion, or of some object, were it absurd, ardently pursued!  But I defy you to confess upon what degrading pleasures you lavish our humble economies.  I defy you to tell us what you mean to do with the sum that you demand to-night,--that sum for which you would have our mother stoop to beg the assistance of a shop-keeper, to whom we would be compelled to reveal the secret of our shame.”  Touched by the frightful humiliation of her son:  “He is so unhappy!” stammered Mme. Favoral.  “He unhappy!” she exclaimed.  “What, then, shall we say of us? and, above all, what shall you say of yourself, mother? Unhappy!--he, a man, who has liberty and strength, who may undertake every thing, attempt any thing, dare any thing.  Ah, I wish I were a man!  I!  I would be a man as there are some, as I know some; and I would have avenged you, O beloved mother! long, long ago, from father; and I would have begun to repay you all the good you have done me.”  Mme. Favoral was sobbing.  “I beg of you,” she murmured, “spare him.”  “Be it so,” said the young girl.  “But you must allow me to tell him that it is not for his sake that I devote my youth to a mercenary labor.  It is for you, adored mother, that you may have the joy to give him what he asks, since it is your only joy.”  Maxence shuddered under the breath of that superb indignation.  That frightful humiliation, he felt that he deserved it only too much. He understood the justice of these cruel reproaches.  And, as his heart had not yet spoiled with the contact of his boon companions, as he was weak, rather than wicked, as the sentiments which are the honor and pride of a man were not dead within him.  “Ah! you are a brave sister, Gilberte,” he exclaimed; “and what you have just done is well.  You have been harsh, but not as much as I deserve.  Thanks for your courage, which will give me back mine. Yes, it is a shame for me to have thus cowardly abused you both.”  And, raising his mother’s hand to his lips: “Forgive, mother,” he continued, his eyes overflowing with tears; “forgive him who swears to you to redeem his past, and to become your support, instead of being a crushing burden--”  He was interrupted by the noise of steps on the stairs, and the shrill sound of a whistle.  “My husband!” exclaimed Mme. Favoral,--“your father, my children!”  “Well,” said Mlle. Gilberte coldly.  “Don’t you hear that he is whistling? and do you forget that it is a proof that he is furious?  What new trial threatens us again?”    XIII  Mme. Favoral spoke from experience.  She had learned, to her cost, that the whistle of her husband, more surely than the shriek of the stormy petrel, announces the storm.--And she had that evening more reasons than usual to fear.  Breaking from all his habits, M. Favoral had not come home to dinner, and had sent one of the clerks of the Mutual Credit Society to say that they should not wait for him.  Soon his latch-key grated in the lock; the door swung open; he came in; and, seeing his son:  “Well, I am glad to find you here,” he exclaimed with a giggle, which with him was the utmost expression of anger.  Mme. Favoral shuddered.  Still under the impression of the scene which had just taken place, his heart heavy, and his eyes full of tears, Maxence did not answer.  “It is doubtless a wager,” resumed the father, “and you wish to know how far my patience may go.”  “I do not understand you,” stammered the young man.  “The money that you used to get, I know not where, doubtless fails you now, or at least is no longer sufficient, and you go on making debts right and left--at the tailor’s, the shirt maker’s, the jeweler’s.  Of course, it’s simple enough.  We earn nothing; but we wish to dress in the latest style, to wear a gold chain across our vest, and then we make dupes.”  “I have never made any dupes, father.”  “Bah!  And what, then, do you call all these people who came this very day to present me their bills?  For they did dare to come to my office!  They had agreed to come together, expecting thus to intimidate me more easily.  I told them that you were of age, and that your business was none of mine.  Hearing this, they became insolent, and commenced speaking so loud, that their voices could be heard in the adjoining rooms.  At that very moment, the manager, M. de Thaller, happened to be passing through the hall.  Hearing the noise of a discussion, he thought that I was having some difficulty with some of our stockholders, and he came in, as he had a right to.  Then I was compelled to confess everything.”  He became excited at the sound of his words, like a horse at the jingle of his bells.  And, more and more beside himself:  “That is just what your creditors wished,” he pursued.  “They thought I would be afraid of a row, and that I would ‘come down.’ It is a system of blackmailing, like any other.  An account is opened to some young rascal; and, when the amount is reasonably large, they take it to the family, saying, ‘Money, or I make row.’ Do you think it is to you, who are penniless, that they give credit? It’s on my pocket that they were drawing,--on my pocket, because they believed me rich.  They sold you at exorbitant prices every thing they wished; and they relied on me to pay for trousers at ninety francs, shirts at forty francs, and watches at six hundred francs.”  Contrary to his habit, Maxence did not offer any denial.  “I expect to pay all I owe,” he said.  “You!”  “I give my word I will!”  “And with what, pray?”  “With my salary.”  “You have a salary, then?”  Maxence blushed.  “I have what I earn at my employer’s.”  “What employer?”  “The architect in whose office M. Chapelain helped me to find a place.”  With a threatening gesture, M. Favoral interrupted him.  “Spare me your lies,” he uttered.  “I am better posted than you suppose.  I know, that, over a month ago, your employer, tired of your idleness, dismissed you in disgrace.”  Disgrace was superfluous.  The fact was, that Maxence, returning to work after an absence of five days, had found another in his place.  “I shall find another place,” he said.  M. Favoral shrugged his shoulders with a movement of rage.  “And in the mean time,” he said, “I shall have to pay.  Do you know what your creditors threaten to do?--to commence a suit against me. They would lose it, of course, they know it; but they hope that I would yield before a scandal.  And this is not all: they talk of entering a criminal complaint.  They pretend that you have audaciously swindled them; that the articles you purchased of them were not at all for your own use, but that you sold them as fast as you got them, at any price you could obtain, to raise ready money. The jeweler has proofs, he says, that you went straight from his shop to the pawnbroker’s, and pledged a watch and chain which he had just sold you.  It is a police matter.  They said all that in presence of my superior officer--in presence of M. de Thaller.  I had to get the janitor to put them out.  But, after they had left, M. de Thaller gave me to understand that he wished me very much to settle everything.  And he is right.  My consideration could not resist another such scene.  What confidence can be placed in a cashier whose son behaves in this manner?  How can a key of a safe containing millions be left with a man whose son would have been dragged into the police-courts?  In a word, I am at your mercy. In a word, my honor, my position, my fortune, rest upon you.  As often as it may please you to make debts, you can make them, and I shall be compelled to pay.”  Gathering all his courage:  “You have been sometimes very harsh with me, father,” commenced Maxence; “and yet I will not try to justify my conduct.  I swear to you, that hereafter you shall have nothing to fear from me.”  “I fear nothing,” uttered M. Favoral with a sinister smile.  “I know the means of placing myself beyond the reach of your follies --and I shall use them.”  “I assure you, father, that I have taken a firm resolution.”  “Oh! you may dispense with your periodical repentance.”  Mlle. Gilberte stepped forward.  “I’ll stand warrant,” she said, “for Maxence’s resolutions.”  Her father did not permit her to proceed.  “Enough,” he interrupted somewhat harshly.  “Mind your own business, Gilberte!  I have to speak to you too.”  “To me, father?”  “Yes.”  He walked up and down three or four times through the parlor, as if to calm his irritation.  Then planting himself straight before his daughter, his arms folded across his breast:  “You are eighteen years of age,” he said; “that is to say, it is time to think of your marriage.  An excellent match offers itself.”  She shuddered, stepped back, and, redder than a peony:  “A match!” she repeated in a tone of immense surprise.  “Yes, and which suits me.”  “But I do not wish to marry, father.”  “All young girls say the same thing; and, as soon as a pretender offers himself, they are delighted.  Mine is a fellow of twenty-six, quite good looking, amiable, witty, and who has had the greatest success in society.”  “Father, I assure you that I do not wish to leave mother.”  “Of course not.  He is an intelligent, hard-working man, destined, everybody says, to make an immense fortune.  Although he is rich already, for he holds a controlling interest in a stock-broker’s firm, he works as hard as any poor devil.  I would not be surprised to hear that he makes half a million of francs a year.  His wife will have her carriage, her box at the opera, diamonds, and dresses as handsome as Mlle. de Thaller’s.”  “Eh!  What do I care for such things?”  “It’s understood.  I’ll present him to you on Saturday.”  But Mlle. Gilberte was not one of those young girls who allow themselves, through weakness or timidity, to become engaged, and so far engaged, that later, they can no longer withdraw.  A discussion being unavoidable, she preferred to have it out at once.  “A presentation is absolutely useless, father,” she declared resolutely.  “Because?”  “I have told you that I did not wish to marry.”  “But if it is my will?”  “I am ready to obey you in every thing except that.”  “In that as in every thing else,” interrupted the cashier of the Mutual Credit in a thundering voice.  And, casting upon his wife and children a glance full o
