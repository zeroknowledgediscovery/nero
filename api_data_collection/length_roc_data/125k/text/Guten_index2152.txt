THE KANAKA SURF                 202     ON THE MAKALOA MAT   UNLIKE the women of most warm races, those of Hawaii age well and nobly. With no pretence of make-up or cunning concealment of time’s inroads, the woman who sat under the hau tree might have been permitted as much as fifty years by a judge competent anywhere over the world save in Hawaii. Yet her children and her grandchildren, and Roscoe Scandwell who had been her husband for forty years, knew that she was sixty-four and would be sixty-five come the next twenty-second day of June.  But she did not look it, despite the fact that she thrust reading glasses on her nose as she read her magazine and took them off when her gaze desired to wander in the direction of the half-dozen children playing on the lawn.  It was a noble situation—noble as the ancient hau tree, the size of a house, where she sat as if in a house, so spaciously and comfortably house-like was its shade furnished; noble as the lawn that stretched away landward its plush of green at an appraisement of two hundred dollars a front foot to a bungalow equally dignified, noble, and costly.  Seaward, glimpsed through a fringe of hundred-foot coconut palms, was the ocean; beyond the reef a dark blue that grew indigo blue to the horizon, within the reef all the silken gamut of jade and emerald and tourmaline.  And this was but one house of the half-dozen houses belonging to Martha Scandwell.  Her town-house, a few miles away in Honolulu, on Nuuanu Drive between the first and second “showers,” was a palace.  Hosts of guests had known the comfort and joy of her mountain house on Tantalus, and of her volcano house, her _mauka_ house, and her _makai_ house on the big island of Hawaii.  Yet this Waikiki house stressed no less than the rest in beauty, in dignity, and in expensiveness of upkeep.  Two Japanese yard-boys were trimming hibiscus, a third was engaged expertly with the long hedge of night-blooming cereus that was shortly expectant of unfolding in its mysterious night-bloom.  In immaculate ducks, a house Japanese brought out the tea-things, followed by a Japanese maid, pretty as a butterfly in the distinctive garb of her race, and fluttery as a butterfly to attend on her mistress.  Another Japanese maid, an array of Turkish towels on her arm, crossed the lawn well to the right in the direction of the bath-houses, from which the children, in swimming suits, were beginning to emerge.  Beyond, under the palms at the edge of the sea, two Chinese nursemaids, in their pretty native costume of white _yee-shon_ and-straight-lined trousers, their black braids of hair down their backs, attended each on a baby in a perambulator.  And all these, servants, and nurses, and grandchildren, were Martha Scandwell’s.  So likewise was the colour of the skin of the grandchildren—the unmistakable Hawaiian colour, tinted beyond shadow of mistake by exposure to the Hawaiian sun.  One-eighth and one-sixteenth Hawaiian were they, which meant that seven-eighths or fifteen-sixteenths white blood informed that skin yet failed to obliterate the modicum of golden tawny brown of Polynesia.  But in this, again, only a trained observer would have known that the frolicking children were aught but pure-blooded white.  Roscoe Scandwell, grandfather, was pure white; Martha three-quarters white; the many sons and daughters of them seven-eighths white; the grandchildren graded up to fifteen-sixteenths white, or, in the cases when their seven-eighths fathers and mothers had married seven-eighths, themselves fourteen-sixteenths or seven-eighths white.  On both sides the stock was good, Roscoe straight descended from the New England Puritans, Martha no less straight descended from the royal chief-stocks of Hawaii whose genealogies were chanted in _meles_ a thousand years before written speech was acquired.  In the distance a machine stopped and deposited a woman whose utmost years might have been guessed as sixty, who walked across the lawn as lightly as a well-cared-for woman of forty, and whose actual calendar age was sixty-eight.  Martha rose from her seat to greet her, in the hearty Hawaiian way, arms about, lips on lips, faces eloquent and bodies no less eloquent with sincereness and frank excessiveness of emotion.  And it was “Sister Bella,” and “Sister Martha,” back and forth, intermingled with almost incoherent inquiries about each other, and about Uncle This and Brother That and Aunt Some One Else, until, the first tremulousness of meeting over, eyes moist with tenderness of love, they sat gazing at each other across their teacups.  Apparently, they had not seen nor embraced for years.  In truth, two months marked the interval of their separation. And one was sixty-four, the other sixty-eight.  But the thorough comprehension resided in the fact that in each of them one-fourth of them was the sun-warm, love-warm heart of Hawaii.  The children flooded about Aunt Bella like a rising tide and were capaciously hugged and kissed ere they departed with their nurses to the swimming beach.  “I thought I’d run out to the beach for several days—the trades had stopped blowing,” Martha explained.  “You’ve been here two weeks already,” Bella smiled fondly at her younger sister.  “Brother Edward told me.  He met me at the steamer and insisted on running me out first of all to see Louise and Dorothy and that first grandchild of his.  He’s as mad as a silly hatter about it.”  “Mercy!” Martha exclaimed.  “Two weeks!  I had not thought it that long.”  “Where’s Annie?—and Margaret?” Bella asked.  Martha shrugged her voluminous shoulders with voluminous and forgiving affection for her wayward, matronly daughters who left their children in her care for the afternoon.  “Margaret’s at a meeting of the Out-door Circle—they’re planning the planting of trees and hibiscus all along both sides of Kalakaua Avenue,” she said.  “And Annie’s wearing out eighty dollars’ worth of tyres to collect seventy-five dollars for the British Red Cross—this is their tag day, you know.”  “Roscoe must be very proud,” Bella said, and observed the bright glow of pride that appeared in her sister’s eyes.  “I got the news in San Francisco of Ho-o-la-a’s first dividend.  Remember when I put a thousand in it at seventy-five cents for poor Abbie’s children, and said I’d sell when it went to ten dollars?”  “And everybody laughed at you, and at anybody who bought a share,” Martha nodded.  “But Roscoe knew.  It’s selling to-day at twenty-four.”  “I sold mine from the steamer by wireless—at twenty even,” Bella continued.  “And now Abbie’s wildly dressmaking.  She’s going with May and Tootsie to Paris.”  “And Carl?” Martha queried.  “Oh, he’ll finish Yale all right—”  “Which he would have done anyway, and you _know_ it,” Martha charged, lapsing charmingly into twentieth-century slang.  Bella affirmed her guilt of intention of paying the way of her school friend’s son through college, and added complacently:  “Just the same it was nicer to have Ho-o-la-a pay for it.  In a way, you see, Roscoe is doing it, because it was his judgment I trusted to when I made the investment.”  She gazed slowly about her, her eyes taking in, not merely the beauty and comfort and repose of all they rested on, but the immensity of beauty and comfort and repose represented by them, scattered in similar oases all over the islands.  She sighed pleasantly and observed: “All our husbands have done well by us with what we brought them.”  “And happily . . . ” Martha agreed, then suspended her utterance with suspicious abruptness.  “And happily, all of us, except Sister Bella,” Bella forgivingly completed the thought for her.  “It was too bad, that marriage,” Martha murmured, all softness of sympathy.  “You were so young.  Uncle Robert should never have made you.”  “I was only nineteen,” Bella nodded.  “But it was not George Castner’s fault.  And look what he, out of the grave, has done for me.  Uncle Robert was wise.  He knew George had the far-away vision of far ahead, the energy, and the steadiness.  He saw, even then, and that’s fifty years ago, the value of the Nahala water-rights which nobody else valued then.  They thought he was struggling to buy the cattle range.  He struggled to buy the future of the water—and how well he succeeded you know.  I’m almost ashamed to think of my income sometimes.  No; whatever else, the unhappiness of our marriage was not due to George.  I could have lived happily with him, I know, even to this day, had he lived.” She shook her head slowly.  “No; it was not his fault.  Nor anybody’s. Not even mine.  If it was anybody’s fault—”  The wistful fondness of her smile took the sting out of what she was about to say.  “If it was anybody’s fault it was Uncle John’s.”  “Uncle John’s!” Martha cried with sharp surprise.  “If it had to be one or the other, I should have said Uncle Robert.  But Uncle John!”  Bella smiled with slow positiveness.  “But it was Uncle Robert who made you marry George Castner,” her sister urged.  “That is true,” Bella nodded corroboration.  “But it was not the matter of a husband, but of a horse.  I wanted to borrow a horse from Uncle John, and Uncle John said yes.  That is how it all happened.”  A silence fell, pregnant and cryptic, and, while the voices of the children and the soft mandatory protests of the Asiatic maids drew nearer from the beach, Martha Scandwell felt herself vibrant and tremulous with sudden resolve of daring.  She waved the children away.  “Run along, dears, run along, Grandma and Aunt Bella want to talk.”  And as the shrill, sweet treble of child voices ebbed away across the lawn, Martha, with scrutiny of the heart, observed the sadness of the lines graven by secret woe for half a century in her sister’s face.  For nearly fifty years had she watched those lines.  She steeled all the melting softness of the Hawaiian of her to break the half-century of silence.  “Bella,” she said. “We never knew. You never spoke. But we wondered, oh, often and often—”  “And never asked,” Bella murmured gratefully.  “But I am asking now, at the last.  This is our twilight.  Listen to them!  Sometimes it almost frightens me to think that they are grandchildren, _my_ grandchildren—_I_, who only the other day, it would seem, was as heart-free, leg-free, care-free a girl as ever bestrode a horse, or swam in the big surf, or gathered _opihis_ at low tide, or laughed at a dozen lovers.  And here in our twilight let us forget everything save that I am your dear sister as you are mine.”  The eyes of both were dewy moist.  Bella palpably trembled to utterance.  “We thought it was George Castner,”  Martha went on; “and we could guess the details.  He was a cold man.  You were warm Hawaiian.  He must have been cruel.  Brother Walcott always insisted he must have beaten you—”  “No!  No!” Bella broke in.  “George Castner was never a brute, a beast. Almost have I wished, often, that he had been.  He never laid hand on me. He never raised hand to me.  He never raised his voice to me.  Never—oh, can you believe it?—do, please, sister, believe it—did we have a high word nor a cross word.  But that house of his, of ours, at Nahala, was grey.  All the colour of it was grey and cool, and chill, while I was bright with all colours of sun, and earth, and blood, and birth.  It was very cold, grey cold, with that cold grey husband of mine at Nahala.  You know he was grey, Martha.  Grey like those portraits of Emerson we used to see at school.  His skin was grey.  Sun and weather and all hours in the saddle could never tan it.  And he was as grey inside as out.  “And I was only nineteen when Uncle Robert decided on the marriage.  How was I to know?  Uncle Robert talked to me.  He pointed out how the wealth and property of Hawaii was already beginning to pass into the hands of the _haoles_” (Whites).  “The Hawaiian chiefs let their possessions slip away from them.  The Hawaiian chiefesses, who married _haoles_, had their possessions, under the management of their _haole_ husbands, increase prodigiously.  He pointed back to the original Grandfather Roger Wilton, who had taken Grandmother Wilton’s poor _mauka_ lands and added to them and built up about them the Kilohana Ranch—”  “Even then it was second only to the Parker Ranch,” Martha interrupted proudly.  “And he told me that had our father, before he died, been as far-seeing as grandfather, half the then Parker holdings would have been added to Kilohana, making Kilohana first.  And he said that never, for ever and ever, would beef be cheaper.  And he said that the big future of Hawaii would be in sugar.  That was fifty years ago, and he has been more than proved right.  And he said that the young _haole_, George Castner, saw far, and would go far, and that there were many girls of us, and that the Kilohana lands ought by rights to go to the boys, and that if I married George my future was assured in the biggest way.  “I was only nineteen.  Just back from the Royal Chief School—that was before our girls went to the States for their education.  You were among the first, Sister Martha, who got their education on the mainland.  And what did I know of love and lovers, much less of marriage?  All women married.  It was their business in life.  Mother and grandmother, all the way back they had married.  It was my business in life to marry George Castner.  Uncle Robert said so in his wisdom, and I knew he was very wise.  And I went to live with my husband in the grey house at Nahala.  “You remember it.  No trees, only the rolling grass lands, the high mountains behind, the sea beneath, and the wind!—the Waimea and Nahala winds, we got them both, and the _kona_ wind as well.  Yet little would I have minded them, any more than we minded them at Kilohana, or than they minded them at Mana, had not Nahala itself been so grey, and husband George so grey.  We were alone.  He was managing Nahala for the Glenns, who had gone back to Scotland.  Eighteen hundred a year, plus beef, horses, cowboy service, and the ranch house, was what he received—”  “It was a high salary in those days,” Martha said.  “And for George Castner, and the service he gave, it was very cheap,” Bella defended.  “I lived with him for three years.  There was never a morning that he was out of his bed later than half-past four.  He was the soul of devotion to his employers.  Honest to a penny in his accounts, he gave them full measure and more of his time and energy.  Perhaps that was what helped make our life so grey.  But listen, Martha.  Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.  Think of it! The two of us lived on two hundred a year.  Luckily he did not drink or smoke.  Also, we dressed out of it as well.  I made my own dresses.  You can imagine them.  Outside of the cowboys who chored the firewood, I did the work.  I cooked, and baked, and scrubbed—”  “You who had never known anything but servants from the time you were born!” Martha pitied.  “Never less than a regiment of them at Kilohana.”  “Oh, but it was the bare, naked, pinching meagreness of it!” Bella cried out.  “How far I was compelled to make a pound of coffee go!  A broom worn down to nothing before a new one was bought!  And beef!  Fresh beef and jerky, morning, noon, and night!  And porridge!  Never since have I eaten porridge or any breakfast food.”  She arose suddenly and walked a dozen steps away to gaze a moment with unseeing eyes at the colour-lavish reef while she composed herself.  And she returned to her seat with the splendid, sure, gracious, high-breasted, noble-headed port of which no out-breeding can ever rob the Hawaiian woman.  Very _haole_ was Bella Castner, fair-skinned, fine-textured.  Yet, as she returned, the high pose of head, the level-lidded gaze of her long brown eyes under royal arches of eyebrows, the softly set lines of her small mouth that fairly sang sweetness of kisses after sixty-eight years—all made her the very picture of a chiefess of old Hawaii full-bursting through her ampleness of _haole_ blood.  Taller she was than her sister Martha, if anything more queenly.  “You know we were notorious as poor feeders,” Bella laughed lightly enough.  “It was many a mile on either side from Nahala to the next roof. Belated travellers, or storm-bound ones, would, on occasion, stop with us overnight.  And you know the lavishness of the big ranches, then and now. How we were the laughing-stock!  ‘What do we care!’ George would say. ‘They live to-day and now.  Twenty years from now will be our turn, Bella.  They will be where they are now, and they will eat out of our hand.  We will be compelled to feed them, they will need to be fed, and we will feed them well; for we will be rich, Bella, so rich that I am afraid to tell you.  But I know what I know, and you must have faith in me.’  “George was right.  Twenty years afterward, though he did not live to see it, my income was a thousand a month.  Goodness!  I do not know what it is to-day.  But I was only nineteen, and I would say to George: ‘Now! now!  We live now.  We may not be alive twenty years from now.  I do want a new broom.  And there is a third-rate coffee that is only two cents a pound more than the awful stuff we are using.  Why couldn’t I fry eggs in butter—now?  I should dearly love at least one new tablecloth.  Our linen!  I’m ashamed to put a guest between the sheets, though heaven knows they dare come seldom enough.’  “‘Be patient, Bella,’ he would reply.  ‘In a little while, in only a few years, those that scorn to sit at our table now, or sleep between our sheets, will be proud of an invitation—those of them who will not be dead.  You remember how Stevens passed out last year—free-living and easy, everybody’s friend but his own.  The Kohala crowd had to bury him, for he left nothing but debts.  Watch the others going the same pace. There’s your brother Hal.  He can’t keep it up and live five years, and he’s breaking his uncles’ hearts.  And there’s Prince Lilolilo.  Dashes by me with half a hundred mounted, able-bodied, roystering _kanakas_ in his train who would be better at hard work and looking after their future, for he will never be king of Hawaii.  He will not live to be king of Hawaii.’  “George was right.  Brother Hal died.  So did Prince Lilolilo.  But George was not _all_ right.  He, who neither drank nor smoked, who never wasted the weight of his arms in an embrace, nor the touch of his lips a second longer than the most perfunctory of kisses, who was invariably up before cockcrow and asleep ere the kerosene lamp had a tenth emptied itself, and who never thought to die, was dead even more quickly than Brother Hal and Prince Lilolilo.  “‘Be patient, Bella,’ Uncle Robert would say to me.  ‘George Castner is a coming man.  I have chosen well for you.  Your hardships now are the hardships on the way to the promised land.  Not always will the Hawaiians rule in Hawaii.  Just as they let their wealth slip out of their hands, so will their rule slip out of their hands.  Political power and the land always go together.  There will be great changes, revolutions no one knows how many nor of what sort, save that in the end the _haole_ will possess the land and the rule.  And in that day you may well be first lady of Hawaii, just as surely as George Castner will be ruler of Hawaii. It is written in the books.  It is ever so where the _haole_ conflicts with the easier races.  I, your Uncle Robert, who am half-Hawaiian and half-_haole_, know whereof I speak.  Be patient, Bella, be patient.’  “‘Dear Bella,’ Uncle John would say; and I knew his heart was tender for me.  Thank God, he never told me to be patient.  He knew.  He was very wise.  He was warm human, and, therefore, wiser than Uncle Robert and George Castner, who sought the thing, not the spirit, who kept records in ledgers rather than numbers of heart-beats breast to breast, who added columns of figures rather than remembered embraces and endearments of look and speech and touch.  ‘Dear Bella,’ Uncle John would say.  He knew. You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.  He was a true lover.  He loved but the once.  After her death they said he was eccentric.  He was.  He was the one lover, once and always.  Remember that taboo inner room of his at Kilohana that we entered only after his death and found it his shrine to her.  ‘Dear Bella,’ it was all he ever said to me, but I knew he knew.  “And I was nineteen, and sun-warm Hawaiian in spite of my three-quarters _haole_ blood, and I knew nothing save my girlhood splendours at Kilohana and my Honolulu education at the Royal Chief School, and my grey husband at Nahala with his grey preachments and practices of sobriety and thrift, and those two childless uncles of mine, the one with far, cold vision, the other the broken-hearted, for-ever-dreaming lover of a dead princess.  “Think of that grey house!  I, who had known the ease and the delights and the ever-laughing joys of Kilohana, and of the Parkers at old Mana, and of Puuwaawaa!  You remember.  We did live in feudal spaciousness in those days.  Would you, can you, believe it, Martha—at Nahala the only sewing machine I had was one of those the early missionaries brought, a tiny, crazy thing that one cranked around by hand!  “Robert and John had each given Husband George five thousand dollars at my marriage.  But he had asked for it to be kept secret.  Only the four of us knew.  And while I sewed my cheap _holokus_ on that crazy machine, he bought land with the money—the upper Nahala lands, you know—a bit at a time, each purchase a hard-driven bargain, his face the very face of poverty.  To-day the Nahala Ditch alone pays me forty thousand a year.  “But was it worth it?  I starved.  If only once, madly, he had crushed me in his arms!  If only once he could have lingered with me five minutes from his own business or from his fidelity to his employers!  Sometimes I could have screamed, or showered the eternal bowl of hot porridge into his face, or smashed the sewing machine upon the floor and danced a _hula_ on it, just to make him burst out and lose his temper and be human, be a brute, be a man of some sort instead of a grey, frozen demi-god.”  Bella’s tragic expression vanished, and she laughed outright in sheer genuineness of mirthful recollection.  “And when I was in such moods he would gravely look me over, gravely feel my pulse, examine my tongue, gravely dose me with castor oil, and gravely put me to bed early with hot stove-lids, and assure me that I’d feel better in the morning.  Early to bed!  Our wildest sitting up was nine o’clock.  Eight o’clock was our regular bed-time.  It saved kerosene.  We did not eat dinner at Nahala—remember the great table at Kilohana where we did have dinner?  But Husband George and I had supper.  And then he would sit close to the lamp on one side the table and read old borrowed magazines for an hour, while I sat on the other side and darned his socks and underclothing.  He always wore such cheap, shoddy stuff.  And when he went to bed, I went to bed.  No wastage of kerosene with only one to benefit by it.  And he went to bed always the same way, winding up his watch, entering the day’s weather in his diary, and taking off his shoes, right foot first invariably, left foot second, and placing them just so, side by side, on the floor, at the foot of the bed, on his side.  “He was the cleanest man I ever knew.  He never wore the same undergarment a second time.  I did the washing.  He was so clean it hurt. He shaved twice a day.  He used more water on his body than any _kanaka_. He did more work than any two _haoles_.  And he saw the future of the Nahala water.”  “And he made you wealthy, but did not make you happy,” Martha observed.  Bella sighed and nodded.  “What is wealth after all, Sister Martha?  My new Pierce-Arrow came down on the steamer with me.  My third in two years.  But oh, all the Pierce-Arrows and all the incomes in the world compared with a lover!—the one lover, the one mate, to be married to, to toil beside and suffer and joy beside, the one male man lover husband . . . ”  Her voice trailed off, and the sisters sat in soft silence while an ancient crone, staff in hand, twisted, doubled, and shrunken under a hundred years of living, hobbled across the lawn to them.  Her eyes, withered to scarcely more than peepholes, were sharp as a mongoose’s, and at Bella’s feet she first sank down, in pure Hawaiian mumbling and chanting a toothless _mele_ of Bella and Bella’s ancestry and adding to it an extemporized welcome back to Hawaii after her absence across the great sea to California.  And while she chanted her _mele_, the old crone’s shrewd fingers _lomied_ or massaged Bella’s silk-stockinged legs from ankle and calf to knee and thigh.  Both Bella’s and Martha’s eyes were luminous-moist, as the old retainer repeated the _lomi_ and the _mele_ to Martha, and as they talked with her in the ancient tongue and asked the immemorial questions about her health and age and great-great-grandchildren—she who had _lomied_ them as babies in the great house at Kilohana, as her ancestresses had _lomied_ their ancestresses back through the unnumbered generations.  The brief duty visit over, Martha arose and accompanied her back to the bungalow, putting money into her hand, commanding proud and beautiful Japanese housemaids to wait upon the dilapidated aborigine with _poi_, which is compounded of the roots of the water lily, with _iamaka_, which is raw fish, and with pounded kukui nut and _limu_, which latter is seawood tender to the toothless, digestible and savoury.  It was the old feudal tie, the faithfulness of the commoner to the chief, the responsibility of the chief to the commoner; and Martha, three-quarters _haole_ with the Anglo-Saxon blood of New England, was four-quarters Hawaiian in her remembrance and observance of the well-nigh vanished customs of old days.  As she came back across the lawn to the hau tree, Bella’s eyes dwelt upon the moving authenticity of her and of the blood of her, and embraced her and loved her.  Shorter than Bella was Martha, a trifle, but the merest trifle, less queenly of port; but beautifully and generously proportioned, mellowed rather than dismantled by years, her Polynesian chiefess figure eloquent and glorious under the satisfying lines of a half-fitting, grandly sweeping, black-silk _holoku_ trimmed with black lace more costly than a Paris gown.  And as both sisters resumed their talk, an observer would have noted the striking resemblance of their pure, straight profiles, of their broad cheek-bones, of their wide and lofty foreheads, of their iron-grey abundance of hair, of their sweet-lipped mouths set with the carriage of decades of assured and accomplished pride, and of their lovely slender eyebrows arched over equally lovely long brown eyes.  The hands of both of them, little altered or defaced by age, were wonderful in their slender, tapering finger-tips, love-_lomied_ and love-formed while they were babies by old Hawaiian women like to the one even then eating _poi_ and _iamaka_ and _limu_ in the house.  “I had a year of it,” Bella resumed, “and, do you know, things were beginning to come right.  I was beginning to draw to Husband George. Women are so made, I was such a woman at any rate.  For he was good.  He was just.  All the old sterling Puritan virtues were his.  I was coming to draw to him, to like him, almost, might I say, to love him.  And had not Uncle John loaned me that horse, I know that I would have truly loved him and have lived ever happily with him—in a quiet sort of way, of course.  “You see, I knew nothing else, nothing different, nothing better in the way of men.  I came gladly to look across the table at him while he read in the brief interval between supper and bed, gladly to listen for and to catch the beat of his horse’s hoofs coming home at night from his endless riding over the ranch.  And his scant praise was praise indeed, that made me tingle with happiness—yes, Sister Martha, I knew what it was to blush under his precise, just praise for the things I had done right or correctly.  “And all would have been well for the rest of our lives together, except that he had to take steamer to Honolulu.  It was business.  He was to be gone two weeks or longer, first, for the Glenns in ranch affairs, and next for himself, to arrange the purchase of still more of the upper Nahala lands.  Do you know! he bought lots of the wilder and up-and-down lands, worthless for aught save water, and the very heart of the watershed, for as low as five and ten cents an acre.  And he suggested I needed a change.  I wanted to go with him to Honolulu.  But, with an eye to expense, he decided Kilohana for me.  Not only would it cost him nothing for me to visit at the old home, but he saved the price of the poor food I should have eaten had I remained alone at Nahala, which meant the purchase price of more Nahala acreage.  And at Kilohana Uncle John said yes, and loaned me the horse.  “Oh, it was like heaven, getting back, those first several days.  It was difficult to believe at first that there was so much food in all the world.  The enormous wastage of the kitchen appalled me.  I saw waste everywhere, so well trained had I been by Husband George.  Why, out in the servants’ quarters the aged relatives and most distant hangers-on of the servants fed better than George and I ever fed.  You remember our Kilohana way, same as the Parker way, a bullock killed for every meal, fresh fish by runners from the ponds of Waipio and Kiholo, the best and rarest at all times of everything . . .  “And love, our family way of loving!  You know what Uncle John was.  And Brother Walcott was there, and Brother Edward, and all the younger sisters save you and Sally away at school.  And Aunt Elizabeth, and Aunt Janet with her husband and all her children on a visit.  It was arms around, and perpetual endearings, and all that I had missed for a weary twelvemonth.  I was thirsty for it.  I was like a survivor from the open boat falling down on the sand and lapping the fresh bubbling springs at the roots of the palms.  “And _they_ came, riding up from Kawaihae, where they had landed from the royal yacht, the whole glorious cavalcade of them, two by two, flower-garlanded, young and happy, gay, on Parker Ranch horses, thirty of them in the party, a hundred Parker Ranch cowboys and as many more of their own retainers—a royal progress.  It was Princess Lihue’s progress, of course, she flaming and passing as we all knew with the dreadful tuberculosis; but with her were her nephews, Prince Lilolilo, hailed everywhere as the next king, and his brothers, Prince Kahekili and Prince Kamalau.  And with the Princess was Ella Higginsworth, who rightly claimed higher chief blood lines through the Kauai descent than belonged to the reigning family, and Dora Niles, and Emily Lowcroft, and . . . oh, why enumerate them all!  Ella Higginsworth and I had been room-mates at the Royal Chief School.  And there was a great resting time for an hour—no _luau_, for the _luau_ awaited them at the Parkers’—but beer and stronger drinks for the men, and lemonade, and oranges, and refreshing watermelon for the women.  “And it was arms around with Ella Higginsworth and me, and the Princess, who remembered me, and all the other girls and women, and Ella spoke to the Princess, and the Princess herself invited me to the progress, joining them at Mana whence they would depart two days later.  And I was mad, mad with it all—I, from a twelvemonth of imprisonment at grey Nahala.  And I was nineteen yet, just turning twenty within the week.  “Oh, I had not thought of what was to happen.  So occupied was I with the women that I did not see Lilolilo, except at a distance, bulking large and tall above the other men.  But I had never been on a progress.  I had seen them entertained at Kilohana and Mana, but I had been too young to be invited along, and after that it had been school and marriage.  I knew what it would be like—two weeks of paradise, and little enough for another twelve months at Nahala.  “And I asked Uncle John to lend me a horse, which meant three horses of course—one mounted cowboy and a pack horse to accompany me.  No roads then.  No automobiles.  And the horse for myself!  It was Hilo.  You don’t remember him.  You were away at school then, and before you came home, the following year, he’d broken his back and his rider’s neck wild-cattle-roping up Mauna Kea.  You heard about it—that young American naval officer.”  “Lieutenant Bowsfield,” Martha nodded.  “But Hilo!  I was the first woman on his back.  He was a three-year-old, almost a four-year, and just broken.  So black and in such a vigour of coat that the high lights on him clad him in shimmering silver.  He was the biggest riding animal on the ranch, descended from the King’s Sparklingdow with a range mare for dam, and roped wild only two weeks before.  I never have seen so beautiful a horse.  He had the round, deep-chested, big-hearted, well-coupled body of the ideal mountain pony, and his head and neck were true thoroughbred, slender, yet full, with lovely alert ears not too small to be vicious nor too large to be stubborn mulish.  And his legs and feet were lovely too, unblemished, sure and firm, with long springy pasterns that made him a wonder of ease under the saddle.”  “I remember hearing Prince Lilolilo tell Uncle John that you were the best woman rider in all Hawaii,” Martha interrupted to say.  “That was two years afterward when I was back from school and while you were still living at Nahala.”  “Lilolilo said that!” Bella cried.  Almost as with a blush, her long, brown eyes were illumined, as she bridged the years to her lover near half a century dead and dust.  With the gentleness of modesty so innate in the women of Hawaii, she covered her spontaneous exposure of her heart with added panegyric of Hilo.  “Oh, when he ran with me up the long-grass slopes, and down the long-grass slopes, it was like hurdling in a dream, for he cleared the grass at every bound, leaping like a deer, a rabbit, or a fox-terrier—you know how they do.  And cut up, and prance, and high life!  He was a mount for a general, for a Napoleon or a Kitchener.  And he had, not a wicked eye, but, oh, such a roguish eye, intelligent and looking as if it cherished a joke behind and wanted to laugh or to perpetrate it.  And I asked Uncle John for Hilo.  And Uncle John looked at me, and I looked at him; and, though he did not say it, I knew he was _feeling_ ‘Dear Bella,’ and I knew, somewhere in his seeing of me, was all his vision of the Princess Naomi.  And Uncle John said yes.  That is how it happened.  “But he insisted that I should try Hilo out—myself, rather—at private rehearsal.  He was a _handful_, a glorious handful.  But not vicious, not malicious.  He got away from me over and over again, but I never let him know.  I was not afraid, and that helped me keep always a _feel_ of him that prevented him from thinking that he was even a jump ahead of me.  “I have often wondered if Uncle John dreamed of what possibly might happen.  I know I had no thought of it myself, that day I rode across and joined the Princess at Mana.  Never was there such festal time.  You know the grand way the old Parkers had of entertaining.  The pig-sticking and wild-cattle-shooting, the horse-breaking and the branding.  The servants’ quarters overflowing.  Parker cowboys in from everywhere.  And all the girls from Waimea up, and the girls from Waipio, and Honokaa, and Paauilo—I can see them yet, sitting in long rows on top the stone walls of the breaking pen and making _leis_” (flower garlands) “for their cowboy lovers.  And the nights, the perfumed nights, the chanting of the _meles_ and the dancing of the _hulas_, and the big Mana grounds with lovers everywhere strolling two by two under the trees.  “And the Prince . . . ”  Bella paused, and for a long minute her small fine teeth, still perfect, showed deep in her underlip as she sought and won control and sent her gaze vacantly out across the far blue horizon. As she relaxed, her eyes came back to her sister.  “He was a prince, Martha.  You saw him at Kilohana before . . . after you came home from seminary.  He filled the eyes of any woman, yes, and of any man.  Twenty-five he was, in all-glorious ripeness of man, great and princely in body as he was great and princely in spirit.  No matter how wild the fun, how reckless mad the sport, he never seemed to forget that he was royal, and that all his forebears had been high chiefs even to that first one they sang in the genealogies, who had navigated his double-canoes to Tahiti and Raiatea and back again.  He was gracious, sweet, kindly comradely, all friendliness—and severe, and stern, and harsh, if he were crossed too grievously.  It is hard to express what I mean.  He was all man, man, man, and he was all prince, with a strain of the merry boy in him, and the iron in him that would have made him a good and strong king of Hawaii had he come to the throne.  “I can see him yet, as I saw him that first day and touched his hand and talked with him . . . few words and bashful, and anything but a year-long married woman to a grey _haole_ at grey Nahala.  Half a century ago it was, that meeting—you remember how our young men then dressed in white shoes and trousers, white silk shirts, with slashed around the middle the gorgeously colourful Spanish sashes—and for half a century that picture of him has not faded in my heart.  He was the centre of a group on the lawn, and I was being brought by Ella Higginsworth to be presented.  The Princess Lihue had just called some teasing chaff to her which had made her halt to respond and left me halted a pace in front of her.  “His glance chanced to light on me, alone there, perturbed, embarrassed. Oh, how I see him!—his head thrown back a little, with that high, bright, imperious, and utterly care-free poise that was so usual of him.  Our eyes met.  His head bent forward, or straightened to me, I don’t know what happened.  Did he command?  Did I obey?  I do not know.  I know only that I was good to look upon, crowned with fragrant _maile_, clad in Princess Naomi’s wonderful _holoku_ loaned me by Uncle John from his taboo room; and I know that I advanced alone to him across the Mana lawn, and that he stepped forth from those about him to meet me half-way.  We came to each other across the grass, unattended, as if we were coming to each other across our lives.  “—Was I very beautiful, Sister Martha, when I was young?  I do not know. I don’t know.  But in that moment, with all his beauty and truly royal-manness crossing to me and penetrating to the heart of me, I felt a sudden sense of beauty in myself—how shall I say? as if in him and from him perfection were engendered and conjured within myself.  “No word was spoken.  But, oh, I know I raised my face in frank answer to the thunder and trumpets of the message unspoken, and that, had it been death for that one look and that one moment I could not have refrained from the gift of myself that must have been in my face and eyes, in the very body of me that breathed so high.  “Was I beautiful, very beautiful, Martha, when I was nineteen, just turning into twenty?”  And Martha, three-score and four, looked upon Bella, three-score and eight, and nodded genuine affirmation, and to herself added the appreciation of the instant in what she beheld—Bella’s neck, still full and shapely, longer than the ordinary Hawaiian woman’s neck, a pillar that carried regally her high-cheeked, high-browed, high chiefess face and head; Bella’s hair, high-piled, intact, sparkling the silver of the years, ringleted still and contrasting definitely and sharply with her clean, slim, black brows and deep brown eyes.  And Martha’s glance, in modest overwhelming of modesty by what she saw, dropped down the splendid breast of her and generously true lines of body to the feet, silken clad, high-heeled-slippered, small, plump, with an almost Spanish arch and faultlessness of instep.  “When one is young, the one young time!” Bella laughed.  “Lilolilo was a prince.  I came to know his every feature and their every phase . . . afterward, in our wonder days and nights by the singing waters, by the slumber-drowsy surfs, and on the mountain ways.  I knew his fine, brave eyes, with their straight, black brows, the nose of him that was assuredly a Kamehameha nose, and the last, least, lovable curve of his mouth.  There is no mouth more beautiful than the Hawaiian, Martha.  “And his body.  He was a king of athletes, from his wicked, wayward hair to his ankles of bronzed steel.  Just the other day I heard one of the Wilder grandsons referred to as ‘The Prince of Harvard.’  Mercy!  What would they, what could they have called my Lilolilo could they have matched him against this Wilder lad and all his team at Harvard!”  Bella ceased and breathed deeply, the while she clasped her fine small hands in her ample silken lap.  But her pink fairness blushed faintly through her skin and warmed her eyes as she relived her prince-days.  “Well—you have guessed?” Bella said, with defiant shrug of shoulders and a straight gaze into her sister’s eyes.  “We rode out from gay Mana and continued the gay progress—down the lava trails to Kiholo to the swimming and the fishing and the feasting and the sleeping in the warm sand under the palms; and up to Puuwaawaa, and more pig-sticking, and roping and driving, and wild mutton from the upper pasture-lands; and on through Kona, now _mauka_” (mountainward), “now down to the King’s palace at Kailua, and to the swimming at Keauhou, and to Kealakekua Bay, and Napoopoo and Honaunau.  And everywhere the people turning out, in their hands gifts of flowers, and fruit, and fish, and pig, in their hearts love and song, their heads bowed in obeisance to the royal ones while their lips ejaculated exclamations of amazement or chanted _meles_ of old and unforgotten days.  “What would you, Sister Martha?  You know what we Hawaiians are.  You know what we were half a hundred years ago.  Lilolilo was wonderful.  I was reckless.  Lilolilo of himself could make any woman reckless.  I was twice reckless, for I had cold, grey Nahala to spur me on.  I knew.  I had never a doubt.  Never a hope.  Divorces in those days were undreamed. The wife of George Castner could never be queen of Hawaii, even if Uncle Robert’s prophesied revolutions were delayed, and if Lilolilo himself became king.  But I never thought of the throne.  What I wanted would have been the queendom of being Lilolilo’s wife and mate.  But I made no mistake.  What was impossible was impossible, and I dreamed no false dream.  “It was the very atmosphere of love.  And Lilolilo was a lover.  I was for ever crowned with _leis_ by him, and he had his runners bring me _leis_ all the way from the rose-gardens of Mana—you remember them; fifty miles across the lava and the ranges, dewy fresh as the moment they were plucked, in their jewel-cases of banana bark; yard-long they were, the tiny pink buds like threaded beads of Neapolitan coral.  And at the _luaus_” (feasts) “the for ever never-ending _luaus_, I must be seated on Lilolilo’s Makaloa mat, the Prince’s mat, his alone and taboo to any lesser mortal save by his own condescension and desire.  And I must dip my fingers into his own _pa wai holoi_” (finger-bowl) “where scented flower petals floated in the warm water.  Yes, and careless that all should see his extended favour, I must dip into his _pa paakai_ for my pinches of red salt, and limu, and kukui nut and chili pepper; and into his _ipu kai_” (fish sauce dish) “of _kou_ wood that the great Kamehameha himself had eaten from on many a similar progress.  And it was the same for special delicacies that were for Lilolilo and the Princess alone—for his _nelu_, and the _ake_, and the _palu_, and the _alaala_.  And his _kahilis_ were waved over me, and his attendants were mine, and he was mine; and from my flower-crowned hair to my happy feet I was a woman loved.”  Once again Bella’s small teeth pressed into her underlip, as she gazed vacantly seaward and won control of herself and her memories.  “It was on, and on, through all Kona, and all Kau, from Hoopuloa and Kapua to Honuapo and Punaluu, a life-time of living compressed into two short weeks.  A flower blooms but once.  That was my time of bloom—Lilolilo beside me, myself on my wonderful Hilo, a queen, not of Hawaii, but of Lilolilo and Love.  He said I was a bubble of colour and beauty on the black back of Leviathan; that I was a fragile dewdrop on the smoking crest of a lava flow; that I was a rainbow riding the thunder cloud . . . ”  Bella paused for a moment.  “I shall tell you no more of what he said to me,” she declared gravely; “save that the things he said were fire of love and essence of beauty, and that he composed _hulas_ to me, and sang them to me, before all, of nights under the stars as we lay on our mats at the feasting; and I on the Makaloa mat of Lilolilo.  “And it was on to Kilauea—the dream so near its ending; and of course we tossed into the pit of sea-surging lava our offerings to the Fire-Goddess of _maile leis_ and of fish and hard _poi_ wrapped moist in the _ti_ leaves.  And we continued down through old Puna, and feasted and danced and sang at Kohoualea and Kamaili and Opihikao, and swam in the clear, sweet-water pools of Kalapana.  And in the end came to Hilo by the sea.  “It was the end.  We had never spoken.  It was the end recognized and unmentioned.  The yacht waited.  We were days late.  Honolulu called, and the news was that the King had gone particularly _pupule_” (insane), “that there were Catholic and Protestant missionary plottings, and that trouble with France was brewing.  As they had landed at Kawaihae two weeks before with laughter and flowers and song, so they departed from Hilo.  It was a merry parting, full of fun and frolic and a thousand last messages and reminders and jokes.  The anchor was broken out to a song of farewell from Lilolilo’s singing boys on the quarterdeck, while we, in the big canoes and whaleboats, saw the first breeze fill the vessel’s sails and the distance begin to widen.  “Through all the confusion and excitement, Lilolilo, at the rail, who must say last farewells and quip last jokes to many, looked squarely down at me.  On his head he wore my _ilima lei_, which I had made for him and placed there.  And into the canoes, to the favoured ones, they on the yacht began tossing their many _leis_.  I had no expectancy of hope . . . And yet I hoped, in a small wistful way that I know did not show in my face, which was as proud and merry as any there.  But Lilolilo did what I knew he would do, what I had known from the first he would do.  Still looking me squarely and honestly in the eyes, he took my beautiful _ilima lei_ from his head and tore it across.  I saw his lips shape, but not utter aloud, the single word _pau_” (finish).  “Still looking at me, he broke both parts of the _lei_ in two again and tossed the deliberate fragments, not to me, but down overside into the widening water.  _Pau_. It was finished . . . ”  For a long space Bella’s vacant gaze rested on the sea horizon.  Martha ventured no mere voice expression of the sympathy that moistened her own eyes.  “And I rode on that day, up the old bad trail along the Hamakua coast,” Bella resumed, with a voice at first singularly dry and harsh.  “That first day was not so hard.  I was numb.  I was too full with the wonder of all I had to forget to know that I had to forget it.  I spent the night at Laupahoehoe.  Do you know, I had expected a sleepless night. Instead, weary from the saddle, still numb, I slept the night through as if I had been dead.  “But the next day, in driving wind and drenching rain!  How it blew and poured!  The trail was really impassable.  Again and again our horses went down.  At fist the cowboy Uncle John had loaned me with the horses protested, then he followed stolidly in the rear, shaking his head, and, I know, muttering over and over that I was _pupule_.  The pack horse was abandoned at Kukuihaele.  We almost swam up Mud Lane in a river of mud. At Waimea the cowboy had to exchange for a fresh mount.  But Hilo lasted through.  From daybreak till midnight I was in the saddle, till Uncle John, at Kilohana, took me off my horse, in his arms, and carried me in, and routed the women from their beds to undress me and _lomi_ me, while he plied me with hot toddies and drugged me to sleep and forgetfulness. I know I must have babbled and raved.  Uncle John must have guessed.  But never to another, nor even to me, did he ever breathe a whisper. Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi.  “I do have fleeting memories of some of that day, all a broken-hearted mad rage against fate—of my hair down and whipped wet and stinging about me in the driving rain; of endless tears of weeping contributed to the general deluge, of passionate outbursts and resentments against a world all twisted and wrong, of beatings of my hands upon my saddle pommel, of asperities to my Kilohana cowboy, of spurs into the ribs of poor magnificent Hilo, with a prayer on my lips, bursting out from my heart, that the spurs would so madden him as to make him rear and fall on me and crush my body for ever out of all beauty for man, or topple me off the trail and finish me at the foot of the _palis_” (precipices), “writing _pau_ at the end of my name as final as the unuttered _pau_ on Lilolilo’s lips when he tore across my _ilima lei_ and dropped it in the sea. . . .  “Husband George was delayed in Honolulu.  When he came back to Nahala I was there waiting for him.  And solemnly he embraced me, perfunctorily kissed my lips, gravely examined my tongue, decried my looks and state of health, and sent me to bed with hot stove-lids and a dosage of castor oil.  Like entering into the machinery of a clock and becoming one of the cogs or wheels, inevitably and remorselessly turning around and around, so I entered back into the grey life of Nahala.  Out of bed was Husband George at half after four every morning, and out of the house and astride his horse at five.  There was the eternal porridge, and the horrible cheap coffee, and the fresh beef and jerky.  I cooked, and baked, and scrubbed.  I ground around the crazy hand sewing machine and made my cheap _holokus_.  Night after night, through the endless centuries of two years more, I sat across the table from him until eight o’clock, mending his cheap socks and shoddy underwear, while he read the years’ old borrowed magazines he was too thrifty to subscribe to.  And then it was bed-time—kerosene must be economized—and he wound his watch, entered the weather in his diary, and took off his shoes, the right shoe first, and placed them, just so, side by side, at the foot of the bed on his side.  “But there was no more of my drawing to Husband George, as had been the promise ere the Princess Lihue invited me on the progress and Uncle John loaned me the horse.  You see, Sister Martha, nothing would have happened had Uncle John refused me the horse.  But I had known love, and I had known Lilolilo; and what chance, after that, had Husband George to win from me heart of esteem or affection?  And for two years, at Nahala, I was a dead woman who somehow walked and talked, and baked and scrubbed, and mended socks and saved kerosene.  The doctors said it was the shoddy underwear that did for him, pursuing as always the high-mountain Nahala waters in the drenching storms of midwinter.  “When he died, I was not sad.  I had been sad too long already.  Nor was I glad.  Gladness had died at Hilo when Lilolilo dropped my _ilima lei_ into the sea and my feet were never happy again.  Lilolilo passed within a month after Husband George.  I had never seen him since the parting at Hilo.  La, la, suitors a many have I had since; but I was like Uncle John.  Mating for me was but once.  Uncle John had his Naomi room at Kilohana.  I have had my Lilolilo room for fifty years in my heart.  You are the first, Sister Martha, whom I have permitted to enter that room .  . . ”  A machine swung the circle of the drive, and from it, across the lawn, approached the husband of Martha.  Erect, slender, grey-haired, of graceful military bearing, Roscoe Scandwell was a member of the “Big Five,” which, by the interlocking of interests, determined the destinies of all Hawaii.  Himself pure _haole_, New England born, he kissed Bella first, arms around, full-hearty, in the Hawaiian way.  His alert eye told him that there had been a woman talk, and, despite the signs of all generousness of emotion, that all was well and placid in the twilight wisdom that was theirs.  “Elsie and the younglings are coming—just got a wireless from their steamer,” he announced, after he had kissed his wife.  “And they’ll be spending several days with us before they go on to Maui.”  “I was going to put you in the Rose Room, Sister Bella,” Martha Scandwell planned aloud.  “But it will be better for her and the children and the nurses and everything there, so you shall have Queen Emma’s Room.”  “I had it last time, and I prefer it,” Bella said.  Roscoe Scandwell, himself well taught of Hawaiian love and love-ways, erect, slender, dignified, between the two nobly proportioned women, an arm around each of their sumptuous waists, proceeded with them toward the house.  WAIKIKI, HAWAII.          _June_ 6, 1916     THE BONES OF KAHEKILI   FROM over the lofty Koolau Mountains, vagrant wisps of the trade wind drifted, faintly swaying the great, unwhipped banana leaves, rustling the palms, and fluttering and setting up a whispering among the lace-leaved algaroba trees.  Only intermittently did the atmosphere so breathe—for breathing it was, the suspiring of the languid, Hawaiian afternoon.  In the intervals between the soft breathings, the air grew heavy and balmy with the perfume of flowers and the exhalations of fat, living soil.  Of humans about the low bungalow-like house, there were many; but one only of them slept.  The rest were on the tense tiptoes of silence.  At the rear of the house a tiny babe piped up a thin blatting wail that the quickly thrust breast could not appease.  The mother, a slender _hapa-haole_ (half-white), clad in a loose-flowing _holoku_ of white muslin, hastened away swiftly among the banana and papaia trees to remove the babe’s noise by distance.  Other women, _hapa-haole_ and full native, watched her anxiously as she fled.  At the front of the house, on the grass, squatted a score of Hawaiians. Well-muscled, broad-shouldered, they were all strapping men. Brown-skinned, with luminous brown eyes and black, their features large and regular, they showed all the signs of being as good-natured, merry-hearted, and soft-tempered as the climate.  To all of which a seeming contradiction was given by the ferociousness of their accoutrement.  Into the tops of their rough leather leggings were thrust long knives, the handles projecting.  On their heels were huge-rowelled Spanish spurs.  They had the appearance of banditti, save for the incongruous wreaths of flowers and fragrant _maile_ that encircled the crowns of their flopping cowboy hats.  One of them, deliciously and roguishly handsome as a faun, with the eyes of a faun, wore a flaming double-hibiscus bloom coquettishly tucked over his ear.  Above them, casting a shelter of shade from the sun, grew a wide-spreading canopy of _Ponciana regia_, itself a flame of blossoms, out of each of which sprang pom-poms of feathery stamens.  From far off, muffled by distance, came the faint stamping of their tethered horses.  The eyes of all were intently fixed upon the solitary sleeper who lay on his back on a _lauhala_ mat a hundred feet away under the monkey-pod trees.  Large as were the Hawaiian cowboys, the sleeper was larger.  Also, as his snow-white hair and beard attested, he was much older.  The thickness of his wrist and the greatness of his fingers made authentic the mighty frame of him hidden under loose dungaree pants and cotton shirt, buttonless, open from midriff to Adam’s apple, exposing a chest matted with a thatch of hair as white as that of his head and face.  The depth and breadth of that chest, its resilience, and its relaxed and plastic muscles, tokened the knotty strength that still resided in him.  Further, no bronze and beat of sun and wind availed to hide the testimony of his skin that he was all _haole_—a white man.  On his back, his great white beard, thrust skyward, untrimmed of barbers, stiffened and subsided with every breath, while with the outblow of every exhalation the white moustache erected perpendicularly like the quills of a porcupine and subsided with each intake.  A young girl of fourteen, clad only in a single shift, or _muumuu_, herself a grand-daughter of the sleeper, crouched beside him and with a feathered fly-flapper brushed away the flies.  In her face were depicted solicitude, and nervousness, and awe, as if she attended on a god.  And truly, Hardman Pool, the sleeping whiskery one, was to her, and to many and sundry, a god—a source of life, a source of food, a fount of wisdom, a giver of law, a smiling beneficence, a blackness of thunder and punishment—in short, a man-master whose record was fourteen living and adult sons and daughters, six great-grandchildren, and more grandchildren than could he in his most lucid moments enumerate.  Fifty-one years before, he had landed from an open boat at Laupahoehoe on the windward coast of Hawaii.  The boat was the one surviving one of the whaler _Black Prince_ of New Bedford.  Himself New Bedford born, twenty years of age, by virtue of his driving strength and ability he had served as second mate on the lost whaleship.  Coming to Honolulu and casting about for himself, he had first married Kalama Mamaiopili, next acted as pilot of Honolulu Harbour, after that started a saloon and boarding house, and, finally, on the death of Kalama’s father, engaged in cattle ranching on the broad pasture lands she had inherited.  For over half a century he had lived with the Hawaiians, and it was conceded that he knew their language better than did most of them.  By marrying Kalama, he had married not merely her land, but her own chief rank, and the fealty owed by the commoners to her by virtue of her genealogy was also accorded him.  In addition, he possessed of himself all the natural attributes of chiefship: the gigantic stature, the fearlessness, the pride; and the high hot temper that could brook no impudence nor insult, that could be neither bullied nor awed by any utmost magnificence of power that walked on two legs, and that could compel service of lesser humans, not by any ignoble purchase by bargaining, but by an unspoken but expected condescending of largesse. He knew his Hawaiians from the outside and the in, knew them better than themselves, their Polynesian circumlocutions, faiths, customs, and mysteries.  And at seventy-one, after a morning in the saddle over the ranges that began at four o’clock, he lay under the monkey-pods in his customary and sacred siesta that no retainer dared to break, nor would dare permit any equal of the great one to break.  Only to the King was such a right accorded, and, as the King had early learned, to break Hardman Pool’s siesta was to gain awake a very irritable and grumpy Hardman Pool who would talk straight from the shoulder and say unpleasant but true things that no king would care to hear.  The sun blazed down.  The horses stamped remotely.  The fading trade-wind wisps sighed and rustled between longer intervals of quiescence.  The perfume grew heavier.  The woman brought back the babe, quiet again, to the rear of the house.  The monkey-pods folded their leaves and swooned to a siesta of their own in the soft air above the sleeper.  The girl, breathless as ever from the enormous solemnity of her task, still brushed the flies away; and the score of cowboys still intently and silently watched.  Hardman Pool awoke.  The next out-breath, expected of the long rhythm, did not take place.  Neither did the white, long moustache rise up. Instead, the cheeks, under the whiskers, puffed; the eyelids lifted, exposing blue eyes, choleric and fully and immediately conscious; the right hand went out to the half-smoked pipe beside him, while the left hand reached the matches.  “Get me my gin and milk,” he ordered, in Hawaiian, of the little maid, who had been startled into a tremble by his awaking.  He lighted the pipe, but gave no sign of awareness of the presence of his waiting retainers until the tumbler of gin and milk had been brought and drunk.  “Well?” he demanded abruptly, and in the pause, while twenty faces wreathed in smiles and twenty pairs of dark eyes glowed luminously with well-wishing pleasure, he wiped the lingering drops of gin and milk from his hairy lips.  “What are you hanging around for?  What do you want? Come over here.”  Twenty giants, most of them young, uprose and with a great clanking and jangling of spurs and spur-chains strode over to him.  They grouped before him in a semicircle, trying bashfully to wedge their shoulders, one behind another’s, their faces a-grin and apologetic, and at the same time expressing a casual and unconscious democraticness.  In truth, to them Hardman Pool was more than mere chief.  He was elder brother, or father, or patriarch; and to all of them he was related, in one way or another, according to Hawaiian custom, through his wife and through the many marriages of his children and grandchildren.  His slightest frown might perturb them, his anger terrify them, his command compel them to certain death; yet, on the other hand, not one of them would have dreamed of addressing him otherwise than intimately by his first name, which name, “Hardman,” was transmuted by their tongues into Kanaka Oolea.  At a nod from him, the semicircle seated itself on the _manienie_ grass, and with further deprecatory smiles waited his pleasure.  “What do you want?” demanded, in Hawaiian, with a brusqueness and sternness they knew were put on.  They smiled more broadly, and deliciously squirmed their broad shoulders and great torsos with the appeasingness of so many wriggling puppies. Hardman Pool singled out one of them.  “Well, Iliiopoi, what do _you_ want?”  “Ten dollars, Kanaka Oolea.”  “Ten dollars!” Pool cried, in apparent shock at mention of so vast a sum. “Does it mean you are going to take a second wife?  Remember the missionary teaching.  One wife at a time, Iliiopoi; one wife at a time. For he who entertains a plurality of wives will surely go to hell.”  Giggles and flashings of laughing eyes from all greeted the joke.  “No, Kanaka Oolea,” came the reply.  “The devil knows I am hard put to get _kow-kow_ for one wife and her several relations.”  “_Kow-kow_?” Pool repeated the Chinese-introduced word for food which the Hawaiians had come to substitute for their own paina.  “Didn’t you boys get _kow-kow_ here this noon?”  “Yes, Kanaka Oolea,” volunteered an old, withered native who had just joined the group from the direction of the house.  “All of them had _kow-kow_ in the kitchen, and plenty of it.  They ate like lost horses brought down from the lava.”  “And what do you want, Kumuhana?” Pool diverted to the old one, at the same time motioning to the little maid to flap flies from the other side of him.  “Twelve dollars,” said Kumuhana.  “I want to buy a Jackass and a second-hand saddle and bridle.  I am growing too old for my legs to carry me in walking.”  “You wait,” his _haole_ lord commanded.  “I will talk with you about the matter, and about other things of importance, when I am finished with the rest and they are gone.”  The withered old one nodded and proceeded to light his pipe.  “The _kow-kow_ in the kitchen was good,” Iliiopoi resumed, licking his lips.  “The _poi_ was one-finger, the pig fat, the salmon-belly unstinking, the fish of great freshness and plenty, though the _opihis_” (tiny, rock-clinging shell-fish) “had been salted and thereby made tough. Never should the _opihis_ be salted.  Often have I told you, Kanaka Oolea, that _opihis_ should never be salted.  I am full of good _kow-kow_.  My belly is heavy with it.  Yet is my heart not light of it because there is no _kow-kow_ in my own house, where is my wife, who is the aunt of your fourth son’s second wife, and where is my baby daughter, and my wife’s old mother, and my wife’s old mother’s feeding child that is a cripple, and my wife’s sister who lives likewise with us along with her three children, the father being dead of a wicked dropsy—”  “Will five dollars save all of you from funerals for a day or several?” Pool testily cut the tale short.  “Yes, Kanaka Oolea, and as well it will buy my wife a new comb and some tobacco for myself.”  From a gold-sack drawn from the hip-pocket of his dungarees, Hardman Pool drew the gold piece and tossed it accurately into the waiting hand.  To a bachelor who wanted six dollars for new leggings, tobacco, and spurs, three dollars were given; the same to another who needed a hat; and to a third, who modestly asked for two dollars, four were given with a flowery-worded compliment anent his prowess in roping a recent wild bull from the mountains.  They knew, as a rule, that he cut their requisitions in half, therefore they doubled the size of their requisitions.  And Hardman Pool knew they doubled, and smiled to himself. It was his way, and, further, it was a very good way with his multitudinous relatives, and did not reduce his stature in their esteem.  “And you, Ahuhu?” he demanded of one whose name meant “poison-wood.”  “And the price of a pair of dungarees,” Ahuhu concluded his list of needs.  “I have ridden much and hard after your cattle, Kanaka Oolea, and where my dungarees have pressed against the seat of the saddle there is no seat to my dungarees.  It is not well that it be said that a Kanaka Oolea cowboy, who is also a cousin of Kanaka Oolea’s wife’s half-sister, should be shamed to be seen out of the saddle save that he walks backward from all that behold him.”  “The price of a dozen pairs of dungarees be thine, Ahuhu,” Hardman Pool beamed, tossing to him the necessary sum.  “I am proud that my family shares my pride.  Afterward, Ahuhu, out of the dozen dungarees you will give me one, else shall I be compelled to walk backward, my own and only dungarees being in like manner well worn and shameful.”  And in laughter of love at their _haole_ chief’s final sally, all the sweet-child-minded and physically gorgeous company of them departed to their waiting horses, save the old withered one, Kumuhana, who had been bidden to wait.  For a full five minutes they sat in silence.  Then Hardman Pool ordered the little maid to fetch a tumbler of gin and milk, which, when she brought it, he nodded her to hand to Kumuhana.  The glass did not leave his lips until it was empty, whereon he gave a great audible out-breath of “A-a-ah,” and smacked his lips.  “Much _awa_ have I drunk in my time,” he said reflectively.  “Yet is the _awa_ but a common man’s drink, while the _haole_ liquor is a drink for chiefs.  The _awa_ has not the liquor’s hot willingness, its spur in the ribs of feeling, its biting alive of oneself that is very pleasant since it is pleasant to be alive.”  Hardman Pool smiled, nodded agreement, and old Kumuhana continued.  “There is a warmingness to it.  It warms the belly and the soul.  It warms the heart.  Even the soul and the heart grow cold when one is old.”  “You _are_ old,” Pool conceded.  “Almost as old as I.”  Kumuhana shook his head and murmured.  “Were I no older than you I would be as young as you.”  “I am seventy-one,” said Pool.  “I do not know ages that way,” was the reply.  “What happened when you were born?”  “Let me see,” Pool calculated.  “This is 1880.  Subtract seventy-one, and it leaves nine.  I was born in 1809, which is the year Keliimakai died, which is the year the Scotchman, Archibald Campbell, lived in Honolulu.”  “Then am I truly older than you, Kanaka Oolea.  I remember the Scotchman well, for I was playing among the grass houses of Honolulu at the time, and already riding a surf-board in the _wahine_” (woman) “surf at Waikiki.  I can take you now to the spot where was the Scotchman’s grass house.  The Seaman’s Mission stands now on the very ground.  Yet do I know when I was born.  Often my grandmother and my mother told me of it. I was born when Madame Pele” (the Fire Goddess or Volcano Goddess) “became angry with the people of Paiea because they sacrificed no fish to her from their fish-pool, and she sent down a flow of lava from Huulalai and filled up their pond.  For ever was the fish-pond of Paiea filled up. That was when I was born.”  “That was in 1801, when James Boyd was building ships for Kamehameha at Hilo,” Pool cast back through the calendar; “which makes you seventy-nine, or eight years older than I.  You are very old.”  “Yes, Kanaka Oolea,” muttered Kumuhana, pathetically attempting to swell his shrunken chest with pride.  “And you are very wise.”  “Yes, Kanaka Oolea.”  “And you know many of the secret things that are known only to old men.”  “Yes, Kanaka Oolea.”  “And then you know—” Hardman Pool broke off, the more effectively to impress and hypnotize the other ancient with the set stare of his pale-washed blue eyes.  “They say the bones of Kahekili were taken from their hiding-place and lie to-day in the Royal Mausoleum.  I have heard it whispered that you alone of all living men truly know.”  “I know,” was the proud answer.  “I alone know.”  “Well, do they lie there?  Yes or no?”  “Kahekili was an _alii_” (high chief).  “It is from this straight line that your wife Kalama came.  She is an _alii_.”  The old retainer paused and pursed his lean lips in meditation.  “I belong to her, as all my people before me belonged to her people before her.  She only can command the great secrets of me.  She is wise, too wise ever to command me to speak this secret.  To you, O Kanaka Oolea, I do not answer yes, I do not answer no.  This is a secret of the _aliis_ that even the _aliis_ do not know.”  “Very good, Kumuhana,” Hardman Pool commanded.  “Yet do you forget that I am an _alii_, and that what my good Kalama does not dare ask, I command to ask.  I can send for her, now, and tell her to command your answer. But such would be a foolishness unless you prove yourself doubly foolish. Tell me the secret, and she will never know.  A woman’s lips must pour out whatever flows in through her ears, being so made.  I am a man, and man is differently made.  As you well know, my lips suck tight on secrets as a squid sucks to the salty rock.  If you will not tell me alone, then will you tell Kalama and me together, and her lips will talk, her lips will talk, so that the latest _malahini_ will shortly know what, otherwise, you and I alone will know.”  Long time Kumuhana sat on in silence, debating the argument and finding no way to evade the fact-logic of it.  “Great is your _haole_ wisdom,” he conceded at last.  “Yes? or no?” Hardman Pool drove home the point of his steel.  Kumuhana looked about him first, then slowly let his eyes come to rest on the fly-flapping maid.  “Go,” Pool commanded her.  “And come not back without you hear a clapping of my hands.”  Hardman Pool spoke no further, even after the flapper had disappeared into the house; yet his face adamantly looked: “Yes or no?”  Again Kumuhana looked carefully about him, and up into the monkey-pod boughs as if to apprehend a lurking listener.  His lips were very dry. With his tongue he moistened them repeatedly.  Twice he essayed to speak, but was inarticulately husky.  And finally, with bowed head, he whispered, so low and solemnly that Hardman Pool bent his own head to hear: “No.”  Pool clapped his hands, and the little maid ran out of the house to him in tremulous, fluttery haste.  “Bring a milk and gin for old Kumuhana, here,” Pool commanded; and, to Kumuhana: “Now tell me the whole story.”  “Wait,” was the answer.  “Wait till the little _wahine_ has come and gone.”  And when the maid was gone, and the gin and milk had travelled the way predestined of gin and milk when mixed together, Hardman Pool waited without further urge for the story.  Kumuhana pressed his hand to his chest and coughed hollowly at intervals, bidding for encouragement; but in the end, of himself, spoke out.  “It was a terrible thing in the old days when a great _alii_ died. Kahekili was a great _alii_.  He might have been king had he lived.  Who can tell?  I was a young man, not yet married.  You know, Kanaka Oolea, when Kahekili died, and you can tell me how old I was.  He died when Governor Boki ran the Blonde Hotel here in Honolulu.  You have heard?”  “I was still on windward Hawaii,” Pool answered.  “But I have heard. Boki made a distillery, and leased Manoa lands to grow sugar for it, and Kaahumanu, who was regent, cancelled the lease, rooted out the cane, and planted potatoes.  And Boki was angry, and prepared to make war, and gathered his fighting men, with a dozen whaleship deserters and five brass six-pounders, out at Waikiki—”  “That was the very time Kahekili died,” Kumuhana broke in eagerly.  “You are very wise.  You know many things of the old days better than we old _kanakas_.”  “It was 1829,” Pool continued complacently.  “You were twenty-eight years old, and I was twenty, just coming ashore in the open boat after the burning of the _Black Prince_.”  “I was twenty-eight,” Kumuhana resumed.  “It sounds right.  I remember well Boki’s brass guns at Waikiki.  Kahekili died, too, at the time, at Waikiki.  The people to this day believe his bones were taken to the _Hale o Keawe_” (mausoleum) “at Honaunau, in Kona—”  “And long afterward were brought to the Royal Mausoleum here in Honolulu,” Pool supplemented.  “Also, Kanaka Oolea, there are some who believe to this day that Queen Alice has them stored with the rest of her ancestral bones in the big jars in her taboo room.  All are wrong.  I know.  The sacred bones of Kahekili are gone and for ever gone.  They rest nowhere.  They have ceased to be.  And many _kona_ winds have whitened the surf at Waikiki since the last man looked upon the last of Kahekili.  I alone remain alive of those men.  I am the last man, and I was not glad to be at the finish.  “For see!  I was a young man, and my heart was white-hot lava for Malia, who was in Kahekili’s household.  So was Anapuni’s heart white-hot for her, though the colour of his heart was black, as you shall see.  We were at a drinking that night—Anapuni and I—the night that Kahekili died. Anapuni and I were only commoners, as were all of us _kanakas_ and _wahines_ who were at the drinking with the common sailors and whaleship men from before the mast.  We were drinking on the mats by the beach at Waikiki, close to the old _heiau_” (temple) “that is not far from what is now the Wilders’ beach place.  I learned then and for ever what quantities of drink _haole_ sailormen can stand.  As for us _kanakas_, our heads were hot and light and rattly as dry gourds with the whisky and the rum.  “It was past midnight, I remember well, when I saw Malia, whom never had I seen at a drinking, come across the wet-hard sand of the beach.  My brain burned like red cinders of hell as I looked upon Anapuni look upon her, he being nearest to her by being across from me in the drinking circle.  Oh, I know it was whisky and rum and youth that made the heat of me; but there, in that moment, the mad mind of me resolved, if she spoke to him and yielded to dance with him first, that I would put both my hands around his throat and throw him down and under the _wahine_ surf there beside us, and drown and choke out his life and the obstacle of him that stood between me and her.  For know, that she had never decided between us, and it was because of him that she was not already and long since mine.  “She was a grand young woman with a body generous as that of a chiefess and more wonderful, as she came upon us, across the wet sand, in the shimmer of the moonlight.  Even the _haole_ sailormen made pause of silence, and with open mouths stared upon her.  Her walk!  I have heard you talk, O Kanaka Oolea, of the woman Helen who caused the war of Troy. I say of Malia that more men would have stormed the walls of hell for her than went against that old-time city of which it is your custom to talk over much and long when you have drunk too little milk and too much gin.  “Her walk!  In the moonlight there, the soft glow-fire of the jelly-fishes in the surf like the kerosene-lamp footlights I have seen in the new _haole_ theatre!  It was not the walk of a girl, but a woman. She did not flutter forward like rippling wavelets on a reef-sheltered, placid beach.  There was that in her manner of walk that was big and queenlike, like the motion of the forces of nature, like the rhythmic flow of lava down the slopes of Kau to the sea, like the movement of the huge orderly trade-wind seas, like the rise and fall of the four great tides of the year that may be like music in the eternal ear of God, being too slow of occurrence in time to make a tune for ordinary quick-pulsing, brief-living, swift-dying man.  “Anapuni was nearest.  But she looked at me.  Have you ever heard a call, Kanaka Oolea, that is without sound yet is louder than the conches of God?  So called she to me across that circle of the drinking.  I half arose, for I was not yet full drunken; but Anapuni’s arm caught her and drew her, and I sank back on my elbow and watched and raged.  He was for making her sit beside him, and I waited.  Did she sit, and, next, dance with him, I knew that ere morning Anapuni would be a dead man, choked and drowned by me in the shallow surf.  “Strange, is it not, Kanaka Oolea, all this heat called ‘love’?  Yet it is not strange.  It must be so in the time of one’s youth, else would mankind not go on.”  “That is why the desire of woman must be greater than the desire of life,” Pool concurred.  “Else would there be neither men nor women.”  “Yes,” said Kumuhana.  “But it is many a year now since the last of such heat has gone out of me.  I remember it as one remembers an old sunrise—a thing that was.  And so one grows old, and cold, and drinks gin, not for madness, but for warmth.  And the milk is very nourishing.  “But Malia did not sit beside him.  I remember her eyes were wild, her hair down and flying, as she bent over him and whispered in his ear.  And her hair covered him about and hid him as she whispered, and the sight of it pounded my heart against my ribs and dizzied my head till scarcely could I half-see.  And I willed myself with all the will of me that if, in short minutes, she did not come over to me, I would go across the circle and get her.  “It was one of the things never to be.  You remember Chief Konukalani? Himself he strode up to the circle.  His face was black with anger.  He gripped Malia, not by the arm, but by the hair, and dragged her away behind him and was gone.  Of that, even now, can I understand not the half.  I, who was for slaying Anapuni because of her, raised neither hand nor voice of protest when Konukalani dragged her away by the hair—nor did Anapuni.  Of course, we were common men, and he was a chief.  That I know.  But why should two common men, mad with desire of woman, with desire of woman stronger in them than desire of life, let any one chief, even the highest in the land, drag the woman away by the hair?  Desiring her more than life, why should the two men fear to slay then and immediately the one chief?  Here is something stronger than life, stronger than woman, but what is it? and why?”  “I will answer you,” said Hardman Pool.  “It is so because most men are fools, and therefore must be taken care of by the few men who are wise. Such is the secret of chiefship.  In all the world are chiefs over men. In all the world that has been have there ever been chiefs, who must say to the many fool men: ‘Do this; do not do that.  Work, and work as we tell you or your bellies will remain empty and you will perish.  Obey the laws we set you or you will be beasts and without place in the world. You would not have been, save for the chiefs before you who ordered and regulated for your fathers.  No seed of you will come after you, except that we order and regulate for you now.  You must be peace-abiding, and decent, and blow your noses.  You must be early to bed of nights, and up early in the morning to work if you would heave beds to sleep in and not roost in trees like the silly fowls.  This is the season for the yam-planting and you must plant now.  We say now, to-day, and not picnicking and hulaing to-day and yam-planting to-morrow or some other day of the many careless days.  You must not kill one another, and you must leave your neighbours’ wives alone.  All this is life for you, because you think but one day at a time, while we, your chiefs, think for you all days and for days ahead.’”  “Like a cloud on the mountain-top that comes down and wraps about you and that you dimly see is a cloud, so is your wisdom to me, Kanaka Oolea,” Kumuhana murmured.  “Yet is it sad that I should be born a common man and live all my days a common man.”  “That is because you were of yourself common,” Hardman Pool assured him. “When a man is born common, and is by nature uncommon, he rises up and overthrows the chiefs and makes himself chief over the chiefs.  Why do you not run my ranch, with its many thousands of cattle, and shift the pastures by the rain-fall, and pick the bulls, and arrange the bargaining and the selling of the meat to the sailing ships and war vessels and the people who live in the Honolulu houses, and fight with lawyers, and help make laws, and even tell the King what is wise for him to do and what is dangerous?  Why does not any man do this that I do?  Any man of all the men who work for me, feed out of my hand, and let me do their thinking for them—me, who work harder than any of them, who eats no more than any of them, and who can sleep on no more than one _lauhala_ mat at a time like any of them?”  “I am out of the cloud, Kanaka Oolea,” said Kumuhana, with a visible brightening of countenance.  “More clearly do I see.  All my long years have the _aliis_ I was born under thought for me.  Ever, when I was hungry, I came to them for food, as I come to your kitchen now.  Many people eat in your kitchen, and the days of feasts when you slay fat steers for all of us are understandable.  It is why I come to you this day, an old man whose labour of strength is not worth a shilling a week, and ask of you twelve dollars to buy a jackass and a second-hand saddle and bridle.  It is why twice ten fool men of us, under these monkey-pods half an hour ago, asked of you a dollar or two, or four or five, or ten or twelve.  We are the careless ones of the careless days who will not plant the yam in season if our _alii_ does not compel us, who will not think one day for ourselves, and who, when we age to worthlessness, know that our _alii_ will think _kow-kow_ into our bellies and a grass thatch over our heads.”  Hardman Pool bowed his appreciation, and urged:  “But the bones of Kahekili.  The Chief Konukalani had just dragged away Malia by the hair of the head, and you and Anapuni sat on without protest in the circle of drinking.  What was it Malia whispered in Anapuni’s ear, bending over him, her hair hiding the face of him?”  “That Kahekili was dead.  That was what she whispered to Anapuni.  That Kahekili was dead, just dead, and that the chiefs, ordering all within the house to remain within, were debating the disposal of the bones and meat of him before word of his death should get abroad.  That the high priest Eoppo was deciding them, and that she had overheard no less than Anapuni and me chosen as the sacrifices to go the way of Kahekili and his bones and to care for him afterward and for ever in the shadowy other world.”  “The _moepuu_, the human sacrifice,” Pool commented.  “Yet it was nine years since the coming of the missionaries.”  “And it was the year before their coming that the idols were cast down and the taboos broken,” Kumuhana added.  “But the chiefs still practised the old ways, the custom of _hunakele_, and hid the bones of the _aliis_ where no men should find them and make fish-hooks of their jaws or arrow heads of their long bones for the slaying of little mice in sport. Behold, O Kanaka Oolea!”  The old man thrust out his tongue; and, to Pool’s amazement, he saw the surface of that sensitive organ, from root to tip, tattooed in intricate designs.  “That was done after the missionaries came, several years afterward, when Keopuolani died.  Also, did I knock out four of my front teeth, and half-circles did I burn over my body with blazing bark.  And whoever ventured out-of-doors that night was slain by the chiefs.  Nor could a light be shown in a house or a whisper of noise be made.  Even dogs and hogs that made a noise were slain, nor all that night were the ships’ bells of the _haoles_ in the harbour allowed to strike.  It was a terrible thing in those days when an _alii_ died.  “But the night that Kahekili died.  We sat on in the drinking circle after Konukalani dragged Malia away by the hair.  Some of the _haole_ sailors grumbled; but they were few in the land in those days and the _kanakas_ many.  And never was Malia seen of men again.  Konukalani alone knew the manner of her slaying, and he never told.  And in after years what common men like Anapuni and me should dare to question him?  “Now she had told Anapuni before she was dragged away.  But Anapuni’s heart was black.  Me he did not tell.  Worthy he was of the killing I had intended for him.  There was a giant harpooner in the circle, whose singing was like the bellowing of bulls; and, gazing on him in amazement while he roared some song of the sea, when next I looked across the circle to Anapuni, Anapuni was gone.  He had fled to the high mountains where he could hide with the bird-catchers a week of moons.  This I learned afterward.  “I?  I sat on, ashamed of my desire of woman that had not been so strong as my slave-obedience to a chief.  And I drowned my shame in large drinks of rum and whisky, till the world went round and round, inside my head and out, and the Southern Cross danced a _hula_ in the sky, and the Koolau Mountains bowed their lofty summits to Waikiki and the surf of Waikiki kissed them on their brows.  And the giant harpooner was still roaring, his the last sounds in my ear, as I fell back on the _lauhala_ mat, and was to all things for the time as one dead.  “When I awoke was at the faint first beginning of dawn.  I was being kicked by a hard naked heel in the ribs.  What of the enormousness of the drink I had consumed, the feelings aroused in me by the heel were not pleasant.  The _kanakas_ and _wahines_ of the drinking were gone.  I alone remained among the sleeping sailormen, the giant harpooner snoring like a whale, his head upon my feet.  “More heel-kicks, and I sat up and was sick.  But the one who kicked was impatient, and demanded to know where was Anapuni.  And I did not know, and was kicked, this time from both sides by two impatient men, because I did not know.  Nor did I know that Kahekili was dead.  Yet did I guess something serious was afoot, for the two men who kicked me were chiefs, and no common men crouched behind them to do their bidding.  One was Aimoku, of Kaneche; the other Humuhumu, of Manoa.  “They commanded me to go with them, and they were not kind in their commanding; and as I uprose, the head of the giant harpooner was rolled off my feet, past the edge of the mat, into the sand.  He grunted like a pig, his lips opened, and all of his tongue rolled out of his mouth into the sand.  Nor did he draw it back.  For the first time I knew how long was a man’s tongue.  The sight of the sand on it made me sick for the second time.  It is a terrible thing, the next day after a night of drinking.  I was afire, dry afire, all the inside of me like a burnt cinder, like _aa_ lava, like the harpooner’s tongue dry and gritty with sand.  I bent for a half-drunk drinking coconut, but Aimoku kicked it out of my shaking fingers, and Humuhumu smote me with the heel of his hand on my neck.  “They walked before me, side by side, their faces solemn and black, and I walked at their heels.  My mouth stank of the drink, and my head was sick with the stale fumes of it, and I would have cut off my right hand for a drink of water, one drink, a mouthful even.  And, had I had it, I know it would have sizzled in my belly like water spilled on heated stones for the roasting.  It is terrible, the next day after the drinking.  All the life-time of many men who died young has passed by me since the last I was able to do such mad drinking of youth when youth knows not capacity and is undeterred.  “But as we went on, I began to know that some _alii_ was dead.  No _kanakas_ lay asleep in the sand, nor stole home from their love-making; and no canoes were abroad after the early fish most catchable then inside the reef at the change of the tide.  When we came, past the _hoiau_” (temple), “to where the Great Kamehameha used to haul out his brigs and schooners, I saw, under the canoe-sheds, that the mat-thatches of Kahekili’s great double canoe had been taken off, and that even then, at low tide, many men were launching it down across the sand into the water. But all these men were chiefs.  And, though my eyes swam, and the inside of my head went around and around, and the inside of my body was a cinder athirst, I guessed that the _alii_ who was dead was Kahekili.  For he was old, and most likely of the _aliis_ to be dead.”  “It was his death, as I have heard it, more than the intercession of Kekuanaoa, that spoiled Governor Boki’s rebellion,” Hardman Pool observed.  “It was Kahekili’s death that spoiled it,” Kumuhana confirmed.  “All commoners, when the word slipped out that night of his death, fled into the shelter of the grass houses, nor lighted fire nor pipes, nor breathed loudly, being therein and thereby taboo from use for sacrifice.  And all Governor Boki’s commoners of fighting men, as well as the _haole_ deserters from ships, so fled, so that the brass guns lay unserved and his handful of chiefs of themselves could do nothing.  “Aimoku and Humuhumu made me sit on the sand to the side from the launching of the great double-canoe.  And when it was afloat all the chiefs were athirst, not being used to such toil; and I was told to climb the palms beside the canoe-sheds and throw down drink-coconuts.  They drank and were refreshed, but me they refused to let drink.  “Then they bore Kahekili from his house to the canoe in a _haole_ coffin, oiled and varnished and new.  It had been made by a ship’s carpenter, who thought he was making a boat that must not leak.  It was very tight, and over where the face of Kahekili lay was nothing but thin glass.  The chiefs had not screwed on the outside plank to cover the glass.  Maybe they did not know the manner of _haole_ coffins; but at any rate I was to be glad they did not know, as you shall see.  “‘There is but one _moepuu_,’ said the priest Eoppo, looking at me where I sat on the coffin in the bottom of the canoe.  Already the chiefs were paddling out through the reef.  “‘The other has run into hiding,’ Aimoku answered.  ‘This one was all we could get.’  “And then I knew.  I knew everything.  I was to be sacrificed.  Anapuni had been planned for the other sacrifice.  That was what Malia had whispered to Anapuni at the drinking.  And she had been dragged away before she could tell me.  And in his blackness of heart he had not told me.  “‘There should be two,’ said Eoppo.  ‘It is the law.’  “Aimoku stopped paddling and looked back shoreward as if to return and get a second sacrifice.  But several of the chiefs contended no, saying that all commoners were fled to the mountains or were lying taboo in their houses, and that it might take days before they could catch one. In the end Eoppo gave in, though he grumbled from time to time that the law required two _moepuus_.  “We paddled on, past Diamond Head and abreast of Koko Head, till we were in the midway of the Molokai Channel.  There was quite a sea running, though the trade wind was blowing light.  The chiefs rested from their paddles, save for the steersmen who kept the canoes bow-on to the wind and swell.  And, ere they proceeded further in the matter, they opened more coconuts and drank.  “‘I do not mind so much being the _moepuu_,’ I said to Humuhumu; ‘but I should like to have a drink before I am slain.’  I got no drink.  But I spoke true.  I was too sick of the much whisky and rum to be afraid to die.  At least my mouth would stink no more, nor my head ache, nor the inside of me be as dry-hot sand.  Almost worst of all, I suffered at thought of the harpooner’s tongue, as last I had seen it lying on the sand and covered with sand.  O Kanaka Oolea, what animals young men are with the drink!  Not until they have grown old, like you and me, do they control their wantonness of thirst and drink sparingly, like you and me.”  “Because we have to,” Hardman Pool rejoined.  “Old stomachs are worn thin and tender, and we drink sparingly because we dare not drink more.  We are wise, but the wisdom is bitter.”  “The priest Eoppo sang a long _mele_ about Kahekili’s mother and his mother’s mother, and all their mothers all the way back to the beginning of time,” Kumuhana resumed.  “And it seemed I must die of my sand-hot dryness ere he was done.  And he called upon all the gods of the under world, the middle world and the over world, to care for and cherish the dead _alii_ about to be consigned to them, and to carry out the curses—they were terrible curses—he laid upon all living men and men to live after who might tamper with the bones of Kahekili to use them in sport of vermin-slaying.  “Do you know, Kanaka Oolea, the priest talked a language largely different, and I know it was the priest language, the old language.  Maui he did not name Maui, but Maui-Tiki-Tiki and Maui-Po-Tiki.  And Hina, the goddess-mother of Maui, he named Ina.  And Maui’s god-father he named sometimes Akalana and sometimes Kanaloa.  Strange how one about to die and very thirsty should remember such things!  And I remember the priest named Hawaii as Vaii, and Lanai as Ngangai.”  “Those were the Maori names,” Hardman Pool explained, “and the Samoan and Tongan names, that the priests brought with them in their first voyages from the south in the long ago when they found Hawaii and settled to dwell upon it.”  “Great is your wisdom, O Kanaka Oolea,” the old man accorded solemnly. “Ku, our Supporter of the Heavens, the priest named Tu, and also Ru; and La, our God of the Sun, he named Ra—”  “And Ra was a sun-god in Egypt in the long ago,” Pool interrupted with a sparkle of interest.  “Truly, you Polynesians have travelled far in time and space since first you began.  A far cry it is from Old Egypt, when Atlantis was still afloat, to Young Hawaii in the North Pacific.  But proceed, Kumuhana.  Do you remember anything also of what the priest Eoppo sang?”  “At the very end,” came the confirming nod, “though I was near dead myself, and nearer to die under the priest’s knife, he sang what I have remembered every word of.  Listen!  It was thus.”  And in quavering falsetto, with the customary broken-notes, the old man sang.  “A Maori death-chant unmistakable,” Pool exclaimed, “sung by an Hawaiian with a tattooed tongue!  Repeat it once again, and I shall say it to you in English.”  And when it had been repeated, he spoke it slowly in English:      “But death is nothing new.     Death is and has been ever since old Maui died.     Then Pata-tai laughed loud     And woke the goblin-god,     Who severed him in two, and shut him in,     So dusk of eve came on.”  “And at the last,” Kumuhana resumed, “I was not slain.  Eoppo, the killing knife in hand and ready to lift for the blow, did not lift.  And I?  How did I feel and think?  Often, Kanaka Oolea, have I since laughed at the memory of it.  I felt very thirsty.  I did not want to die.  I wanted a drink of water.  I knew I was going to die, and I kept remembering the thousand waterfalls falling to waste down the _palis_” (precipices) “of the windward Koolau Mountains.  I did not think of Anapuni.  I was too thirsty.  I did not think of Malia.  I was too thirsty.  But continually, inside my head, I saw the tongue of the harpooner, covered dry with sand, as I had last seen it, lying in the sand.  My tongue was like that, too.  And in the bottom of the canoe rolled about many drinking nuts.  Yet I did not attempt to drink, for these were chiefs and I was a common man.  “‘No,’ said Eoppo, commanding the chiefs to throw overboard the coffin. ‘There are not two _moepuus_, therefore there shall be none.’  “‘Slay the one,’ the chiefs cried.  “But Eoppo shook his head, and said: ‘We cannot send Kahekili on his way with only the tops of the taro.’  “‘Half a fish is better than none,’ Aimoku said the old saying.  “‘Not at the burying of an _alii_,’ was the priest’s quick reply.  ‘It is the law.  We cannot be niggard with Kahekili and cut his allotment of sacrifice in half.’  “So, for the moment, while the coffin went overside, I was not slain. And it was strange that I was glad immediately that I was to live.  And I began to remember Malia, and to begin to plot a vengeance on Anapuni. And with the blood of life thus freshening in me, my thirst multiplied on itself tenfold and my tongue and mouth and throat seemed as sanded as the tongue of the harpooner.  The coffin being overboard, I was sitting in the bottom of the canoe.  A coconut rolled between my legs and I closed them on it.  But as I picked it up in my hand, Aimoku smote my hand with the paddle-edge.  Behold!”  He held up the hand, showing two fingers crooked from never having been set.  “I had no time to vex over my pain, for worse things were upon me.  All the chiefs were crying out in horror.  The coffin, head-end up, had not sunk.  It bobbed up and down in the sea astern of us.  And the canoe, without way on it, bow-on to sea and wind, was drifted down by sea and wind upon the coffin.  And the glass of it was to us, so that we could see the face and head of Kahekili through the glass; and he grinned at us through the glass and seemed alive already in the other world and angry with us, and, with other-world power, about to wreak his anger upon us. Up and down he bobbed, and the canoe drifted closer upon him.  “‘Kill him!’  ‘Bleed him!’  ‘Thrust to the heart of him!’  These things the chiefs were crying out to Eoppo in their fear.  ‘Over with the taro tops!’  ‘Let the _alii_ have the half of a fish!’  “Eoppo, priest though he was, was likewise afraid, and his reason weakened before the sight of Kahekili in his _haole_ coffin that would not sink.  He seized me by the hair, drew me to my feet, and lifted the knife to plunge to my heart.  And there was no resistance in me.  I knew again only that I was very thirsty, and before my swimming eyes, in mid-air and close up, dangled the sanded tongue of the harpooner.  “But before the knife could fall and drive in, the thing happened that saved me.  Akai, half-brother to Governor Boki, as you will remember, was steersman of the canoe, and, therefore, in the stern, was nearest to the coffin and its dead that would not sink.  He was wild with fear, and he thrust out with the point of his paddle to fend off the coffined _alii_ that seemed bent to come on board.  The point of the paddle struck the glass.  The glass broke—”  “And the coffin immediately sank,” Hardman Pool broke in; “the air that floated it escaping through the broken glass.”  “The coffin immediately sank, being builded by the ship’s carpenter like a boat,” Kumuhana confirmed.  “And I, who was a _moepuu_, became a man once more.  And I lived, though I died a thousand deaths from thirst before we gained back to the beach at Waikiki.  “And so, O Kanaka Oolea, the bones of Kahekili do not lie in the Royal Mausoleum.  They are at the bottom of Molokai Channel, if not, long since, they have become floating dust of slime, or, builded into the bodies of the coral creatures dead and gone, are builded into the coral reef itself.  Of men I am the one living who saw the bones of Kahekili sink into the Molokai Channel.”  In the pause that followed, wherein Hardman Pool was deep sunk in meditation, Kumuhana licked his dry lips many times.  At the last he broke silence:  “The twelve dollars, Kanaka Oolea, for the jackass and the second-hand saddle and bridle?”  “The twelve dollars would be thine,” Pool responded, passing to the ancient one six dollars and a half, “save that I have in my stable junk the very bridle and saddle for you which I shall give you.  These six dollars and a half will buy you the perfectly suitable jackass of the _pake_” (Chinese) “at Kokako who told me only yesterday that such was the price.”  They sat on, Pool meditating, conning over and over to himself the Maori death-chant he had heard, and especially the line, “So dusk of eve came on,” finding in it an intense satisfaction of beauty; Kumuhana licking his lips and tokening that he waited for something more.  At last he broke silence.  “I have talked long, O Kanaka Oolea.  There is not the enduring moistness in my mouth that was when I was young.  It seems that afresh upon me is the thirst that was mine when tormented by the visioned tongue of the harpooner.  The gin and milk is very good, O Kanaka Oolea, for a tongue that is like the harpooner’s.”  A shadow of a smile flickered across Pool’s face.  He clapped his hands, and the little maid came running.  “Bring one glass of gin and milk for old Kumuhana,” commanded Hardman Pool.  WAIKIKI, HONOLULU.          _June_ 28, 1916.     WHEN ALICE TOLD HER SOUL   THIS, of Alice Akana, is an affair of Hawaii, not of this day, but of days recent enough, when Abel Ah Yo preached his famous revival in Honolulu and persuaded Alice Akana to tell her soul.  But what Alice told concerned itself with the earlier history of the then surviving generation.  For Alice Akana was fifty years old, had begun life early, and, early and late, lived it spaciously.  What she knew went back into the roots and foundations of families, businesses, and plantations.  She was the one living repository of accurate information that lawyers sought out, whether the information they required related to land-boundaries and land gifts, or to marriages, births, bequests, or scandals.  Rarely, because of the tight tongue she kept behind her teeth, did she give them what they asked; and when she did was when only equity was served and no one was hurt.  For Alice had lived, from early in her girlhood, a life of flowers, and song, and wine, and dance; and, in her later years, had herself been mistress of these revels by office of mistress of the _hula_ house.  In such atmosphere, where mandates of God and man and caution are inhibited, and where woozled tongues will wag, she acquired her historical knowledge of things never otherwise whispered and rarely guessed.  And her tight tongue had served her well, so that, while the old-timers knew she must know, none ever heard her gossip of the times of Kalakaua’s boathouse, nor of the high times of officers of visiting warships, nor of the diplomats and ministers and councils of the countries of the world.  So, at fifty, loaded with historical dynamite sufficient, if it were ever exploded, to shake the social and commercial life of the Islands, still tight of tongue, Alice Akana was mistress of the hula house, manageress of the dancing girls who _hula_’d for royalty, for _luaus_ (feasts), house-parties, _poi_ suppers, and curious tourists.  And, at fifty, she was not merely buxom, but short and fat in the Polynesian peasant way, with a constitution and lack of organic weakness that promised incalculable years.  But it was at fifty that she strayed, quite by chance of time and curiosity, into Abel Ah Yo’s revival meeting.  Now Abel Ah Yo, in his theology and word wizardry, was as much mixed a personage as Billy Sunday.  In his genealogy he was much more mixed, for he was compounded of one-fourth Portuguese, one-fourth Scotch, one-fourth Hawaiian, and one-fourth Chinese.  The Pentecostal fire he flamed forth was hotter and more variegated than could any one of the four races of him alone have flamed forth.  For in him were gathered together the cannyness and the cunning, the wit and the wisdom, the subtlety and the rawness, the passion and the philosophy, the agonizing spirit-groping and the legs up to the knees in the dung of reality, of the four radically different breeds that contributed to the sum of him.  His, also, was the clever self-deceivement of the entire clever compound.  When it came to word wizardry, he had Billy Sunday, master of slang and argot of one language, skinned by miles.  For in Abel Ah Yo were the five verbs, and nouns, and adjectives, and metaphors of four living languages. Intermixed and living promiscuously and vitally together, he possessed in these languages a reservoir of expression in which a myriad Billy Sundays could drown.  Of no race, a mongrel _par excellence_, a heterogeneous scrabble, the genius of the admixture was superlatively Abel Ah Yo’s. Like a chameleon, he titubated and scintillated grandly between the diverse parts of him, stunning by frontal attack and surprising and confouding by flanking sweeps the mental homogeneity of the more simply constituted souls who came in to his revival to sit under him and flame to his flaming.  Abel Ah Yo believed in himself and his mixedness, as he believed in the mixedness of his weird concept that God looked as much like him as like any man, being no mere tribal god, but a world god that must look equally like all races of all the world, even if it led to piebaldness.  And the concept worked.  Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hawaiian, Porto Rican, Russian, English, French—members of all races—knelt without friction, side by side, to his revision of deity.  Himself in his tender youth an apostate to the Church of England, Abel Ah Yo had for years suffered the lively sense of being a Judas sinner. Essentially religious, he had foresworn the Lord.  Like Judas therefore he was.  Judas was damned.  Wherefore he, Abel Ah Yo, was damned; and he did not want to be damned.  So, quite after the manner of humans, he squirmed and twisted to escape damnation.  The day came when he solved his escape.  The doctrine that Judas was damned, he concluded, was a misinterpretation of God, who, above all things, stood for justice. Judas had been God’s servant, specially selected to perform a particularly nasty job.  Therefore Judas, ever faithful, a betrayer only by divine command, was a saint.  Ergo, he, Abel Ah Yo, was a saint by very virtue of his apostasy to a particular sect, and he could have access with clear grace any time to God.  This theory became one of the major tenets of his preaching, and was especially efficacious in cleansing the consciences of the back-sliders from all other faiths who else, in the secrecy of their subconscious selves, were being crushed by the weight of the Judas sin.  To Abel Ah Yo, God’s plan was as clear as if he, Abel Ah Yo, had planned it himself. All would be saved in the end, although some took longer than others, and would win only to backseats.  Man’s place in the ever-fluxing chaos of the world was definite and pre-ordained—if by no other token, then by denial that there was any ever-fluxing chaos.  This was a mere bugbear of mankind’s addled fancy; and, by stinging audacities of thought and speech, by vivid slang that bit home by sheerest intimacy into his listeners’ mental processes, he drove the bugbear from their brains, showed them the loving clarity of God’s design, and, thereby, induced in them spiritual serenity and calm.  What chance had Alice Akana, herself pure and homogeneous Hawaiian, against his subtle, democratic-tinged, four-race-engendered, slang-munitioned attack?  He knew, by contact, almost as much as she about the waywardness of living and sinning—having been singing boy on the passenger-ships between Hawaii and California, and, after that, bar boy, afloat and ashore, from the Barbary Coast to Heinie’s Tavern.  In point of fact, he had left his job of Number One Bar Boy at the University Club to embark on his great preachment revival.  So, when Alice Akana strayed in to scoff, she remained to pray to Abel Ah Yo’s god, who struck her hard-headed mind as the most sensible god of which she had ever heard.  She gave money into Abel Ah Yo’s collection plate, closed up the _hula_ house, and dismissed the _hula_ dancers to more devious ways of earning a livelihood, shed her bright colours and raiments and flower garlands, and bought a Bible.  It was a time of religious excitement in the purlieus of Honolulu.  The thing was a democratic movement of the people toward God.  Place and caste were invited, but never came.  The stupid lowly, and the humble lowly, only, went down on its knees at the penitent form, admitted its pathological weight and hurt of sin, eliminated and purged all its bafflements, and walked forth again upright under the sun, child-like and pure, upborne by Abel Ah Yo’s god’s arm around it.  In short, Abel Ah Yo’s revival was a clearing house for sin and sickness of spirit, wherein sinners were relieved of their burdens and made light and bright and spiritually healthy again.  But Alice was not happy.  She had not been cleared.  She bought and dispersed Bibles, contributed more money to the plate, contralto’d gloriously in all the hymns, but would not tell her soul.  In vain Abel Ah Yo wrestled with her.  She would not go down on her knees at the penitent form and voice the things of tarnish within her—the ill things of good friends of the old days.  “You cannot serve two masters,” Abel Ah Yo told her.  “Hell is full of those who have tried.  Single of heart and pure of heart must you make your peace with God.  Not until you tell your soul to God right out in meeting will you be ready for redemption.  In the meantime you will suffer the canker of the sin you carry about within you.”  Scientifically, though he did not know it and though he continually jeered at science, Abel Ah Yo was right.  Not could she be again as a child and become radiantly clad in God’s grace, until she had eliminated from her soul, by telling, all the sophistications that had been hers, including those she shared with others.  In the Protestant way, she must bare her soul in public, as in the Catholic way it was done in the privacy of the confessional.  The result of such baring would be unity, tranquillity, happiness, cleansing, redemption, and immortal life.  “Choose!”  Abel Ah Yo thundered.  “Loyalty to God, or loyalty to man.” And Alice could not choose.  Too long had she kept her tongue locked with the honour of man.  “I will tell all my soul about myself,” she contended.  “God knows I am tired of my soul and should like to have it clean and shining once again as when I was a little girl at Kaneohe—”  “But all the corruption of your soul has been with other souls,” was Abel Ah Yo’s invariable reply.  “When you have a burden, lay it down.  You cannot bear a burden and be quit of it at the same time.”  “I will pray to God each day, and many times each day,” she urged.  “I will approach God with humility, with sighs and with tears.  I will contribute often to the plate, and I will buy Bibles, Bibles, Bibles without end.”  “And God will not smile upon you,” God’s mouthpiece retorted.  “And you will remain weary and heavy-laden.  For you will not have told all your sin, and not until you have told all will you be rid of any.”  “This rebirth is difficult,” Alice sighed.  “Rebirth is even more difficult than birth.”  Abel Ah Yo did anything but comfort her.  “‘Not until you become as a little child . . . ’”  “If ever I tell my soul, it will be a big telling,” she confided.  “The bigger the reason to tell it then.”  And so the situation remained at deadlock, Abel Ah Yo demanding absolute allegiance to God, and Alice Akana flirting on the fringes of paradise.  “You bet it will be a big telling, if Alice ever begins,” the beach-combing and disreputable _kamaainas_ (old-timers) gleefully told one another over their Palm Tree gin.  In the clubs the possibility of her telling was of more moment.  The younger generation of men announced that they had applied for front seats at the telling, while many of the older generation of men joked hollowly about the conversion of Alice.  Further, Alice found herself abruptly popular with friends who had forgotten her existence for twenty years.  One afternoon, as Alice, Bible in hand, was taking the electric street car at Hotel and Fort, Cyrus Hodge, sugar factor and magnate, ordered his chauffeur to stop beside her.  Willy nilly, in excess of friendliness, he had her into his limousine beside him and went three-quarters of an hour out of his way and time personally to conduct her to her destination.  “Good for sore eyes to see you,” he burbled.  “How the years fly!  You’re looking fine.  The secret of youth is yours.”  Alice smiled and complimented in return in the royal Polynesian way of friendliness.  “My, my,” Cyrus Hodge reminisced.  “I was such a boy in those days!”  “_Some_ boy,” she laughed acquiescence.  “But knowing no more than the foolishness of a boy in those long-ago days.”  “Remember the night your hack-driver got drunk and left you—”  “S-s-sh!” he cautioned.  “That Jap driver is a high-school graduate and knows more English than either of us.  Also, I think he is a spy for his Government.  So why should we tell him anything?  Besides, I was so very young.  You remember . . . ”  “Your cheeks were like the peaches we used to grow before the Mediterranean fruit fly got into them,” Alice agreed.  “I don’t think you shaved more than once a week then.  You were a pretty boy.  Don’t you remember the _hula_ we composed in your honour, the—”  “S-s-sh!” he hushed her.  “All that’s buried and forgotten.  May it remain forgotten.”  And she was aware that in his eyes was no longer any of the ingenuousness of youth she remembered.  Instead, his eyes were keen and speculative, searching into her for some assurance that she would not resurrect his particular portion of that buried past.  “Religion is a good thing for us as we get along into middle age,” another old friend told her.  He was building a magnificent house on Pacific Heights, but had recently married a second time, and was even then on his way to the steamer to welcome home his two daughters just graduated from Vassar.  “We need religion in our old age, Alice.  It softens, makes us more tolerant and forgiving of the weaknesses of others—especially the weaknesses of youth of—of others, when they played high and low and didn’t know what they were doing.”  He waited anxiously.  “Yes,” she said.  “We are all born to sin and it is hard to grow out of sin.  But I grow, I grow.”  “Don’t forget, Alice, in those other days I always played square.  You and I never had a falling out.”  “Not even the night you gave that _luau_ when you were twenty-one and insisted on breaking the glassware after every toast.  But of course you paid for it.”  “Handsomely,” he asserted almost pleadingly.  “Handsomely,” she agreed.  “I replaced more than double the quantity with what you paid me, so that at the next _luau_ I catered one hundred and twenty plates without having to rent or borrow a dish or glass.  Lord Mainweather gave that _luau_—you remember him.”  “I was pig-sticking with him at Mana,” the other nodded.  “We were at a two weeks’ house-party there.  But say, Alice, as you know, I think this religion stuff is all right and better than all right.  But don’t let it carry you off your feet.  And don’t get to telling your soul on me.  What would my daughters think of that broken glassware!”  “I always did have an _aloha_” (warm regard) “for you, Alice,” a member of the Senate, fat and bald-headed, assured her.  And another, a lawyer and a grandfather: “We were always friends, Alice. And remember, any legal advice or handling of business you may require, I’ll do for you gladly, and without fees, for the sake of our old-time friendship.”  Came a banker to her late Christmas Eve, with formidable, legal-looking envelopes in his hand which he presented to her.  “Quite by chance,” he explained, “when my people were looking up land-records in Iapio Valley, I found a mortgage of two thousand on your holdings there—that rice land leased to Ah Chin.  And my mind drifted back to the past when we were all young together, and wild—a bit wild, to be sure.  And my heart warmed with the memory of you, and, so, just as an _aloha_, here’s the whole thing cleared off for you.”  Nor was Alice forgotten by her own people.  Her house became a Mecca for native men and women, usually performing pilgrimage privily after darkness fell, with presents always in their hands—squid fresh from the reef, _opihis_ and _limu_, baskets of alligator pears, roasting corn of the earliest from windward Cahu, mangoes and star-apples, taro pink and royal of the finest selection, sucking pigs, banana _poi_, breadfruit, and crabs caught the very day from Pearl Harbour.  Mary Mendana, wife of the Portuguese Consul, remembered her with a five-dollar box of candy and a mandarin coat that would have fetched three-quarters of a hundred dollars at a fire sale.  And Elvira Miyahara Makaena Yin Wap, the wife of Yin Wap the wealthy Chinese importer, brought personally to Alice two entire bolts of _piña_ cloth from the Philippines and a dozen pairs of silk stockings.  The time passed, and Abel Ah Yo struggled with Alice for a properly penitent heart, and Alice struggled with herself for her soul, while half of Honolulu wickedly or apprehensively hung on the outcome.  Carnival week was over, polo and the races had come and gone, and the celebration of Fourth of July was ripening, ere Abel Ah Yo beat down by brutal psychology the citadel of her reluctance.  It was then that he gave his famous exhortation which might be summed up as Abel Ah Yo’s definition of eternity.  Of course, like Billy Sunday on certain occasions, Abel Ah Yo had cribbed the definition.  But no one in the Islands knew it, and his rating as a revivalist uprose a hundred per cent.  So successful was his preaching that night, that he reconverted many of his converts, who fell and moaned about the penitent form and crowded for room amongst scores of new converts burnt by the pentecostal fire, including half a company of negro soldiers from the garrisoned Twenty-Fifth Infantry, a dozen troopers from the Fourth Cavalry on its way to the Philippines, as many drunken man-of-war’s men, divers ladies from Iwilei, and half the riff-raff of the beach.  Abel Ah Yo, subtly sympathetic himself by virtue of his racial admixture, knowing human nature like a book and Alice Akana even more so, knew just what he was doing when he arose that memorable night and exposited God, hell, and eternity in terms of Alice Akana’s comprehension.  For, quite by chance, he had discovered her cardinal weakness.  First of all, like all Polynesians, an ardent lover of nature, he found that earthquake and volcanic eruption were the things of which Alice lived in terror.  She had been, in the past, on the Big Island, through cataclysms that had slacken grass houses down upon her while she slept, and she had beheld Madame Pele (the Fire or Volcano Goddess) fling red-fluxing lava down the long slopes of Mauna Loa, destroying fish-ponds on the sea-brim and licking up droves of beef cattle, villages, and humans on her fiery way.  The night before, a slight earthquake had shaken Honolulu and given Alice Akana insomnia.  And the morning papers had stated that Mauna Kea had broken into eruption, while the lava was rising rapidly in the great pit of Kilauea.  So, at the meeting, her mind vexed between the terrors of this world and the delights of the eternal world to come, Alice sat down in a front seat in a very definite state of the “jumps.”  And Abel Ah Yo arose and put his finger on the sorest part of her soul. Sketching the nature of God in the stereotyped way, but making the stereotyped alive again with his gift of tongues in Pidgin-English and Pidgin-Hawaiian, Abel Ah Yo described the day when the Lord, even His infinite patience at an end, would tell Peter to close his day book and ledgers, command Gabriel to summon all souls to Judgment, and cry out with a voice of thunder: “_Welakahao_!”  This anthromorphic deity of Abel Ah Yo thundering the modern Hawaiian-English slang of _welakahao_ at the end of the world, is a fair sample of the revivalist’s speech-tools of discourse.  _Welakahao_ means literally “hot iron.”  It was coined in the Honolulu Iron-works by the hundreds of Hawaiian men there employed, who meant by it “to hustle,” “to get a move on,” the iron being hot meaning that the time had come to strike.  “And the Lord cried ‘_Welakahao_,’ and the Day of Judgment began and was over _wiki-wiki_” (quickly) “just like that; for Peter was a better bookkeeper than any on the Waterhouse Trust Company Limited, and, further, Peter’s books were true.”  Swiftly Abel Ah Yo divided the sheep from the goats, and hastened the latter down into hell.  “And now,” he demanded, perforce his language on these pages being properly Englished, “what is hell like?  Oh, my friends, let me describe to you, in a little way, what I have beheld with my own eyes on earth of the possibilities of hell.  I was a young man, a boy, and I was at Hilo. Morning began with earthquakes.  Throughout the day the mighty land continued to shake and tremble, till strong men became seasick, and women clung to trees to escape falling, and cattle were thrown down off their feet.  I beheld myself a young calf so thrown.  A night of terror indescribable followed.  The land was in motion like a canoe in a Kona gale.  There was an infant crushed to death by its fond mother stepping upon it whilst fleeing her falling house.  “The heavens were on fire above us.  We read our Bibles by the light of the heavens, and the print was fine, even for young eyes.  Those missionary Bibles were always too small of print.  Forty miles away from us, the heart of hell burst from the lofty mountains and gushed red-blood of fire-melted rock toward the sea.  With the heavens in vast conflagration and the earth _hulaing_ beneath our feet, was a scene too awful and too majestic to be enjoyed.  We could think only of the thin bubble-skin of earth between us and the everlasting lake of fire and brimstone, and of God to whom we prayed to save us.  There were earnest and devout souls who there and then promised their pastors to give not their shaved tithes, but five-tenths of their all to the church, if only the Lord would let them live to contribute.  “Oh, my friends, God saved us.  But first he showed us a foretaste of that hell that will yawn for us on the last day, when he cries ‘_Welakahao_!’ in a voice of thunder.  When the iron is hot!  Think of it!  When the iron is hot for sinners!  “By the third day, things being much quieter, my friend the preacher and I, being calm in the hand of God, journeyed up Mauna Loa and gazed into the awful pit of Kilauea.  We gazed down into the fathomless abyss to the lake of fire far below, roaring and dashing its fiery spray into billo
