THE BLOODLESS HEX
By Ellison Grimm
Chapter One: The Red Thread

Fog hung like gauze over the crooked spires of Hallowmere, as if the town itself were trying to hide from the dawn. A bell tolled somewhere, though the hour was wrong and the sound too thin, too distant, as if it passed through layers of cotton before reaching the ear. In the uppermost room of an ancient, leaning townhouse, a warlock sat rigidly still, watching a single drop of blood inch down the side of a porcelain teacup.

It was not his blood.

“Out,” whispered Elric, voice barely audible above the ticking of the long-dead grandfather clock in the corner. His hands trembled, long fingers curled with restraint. “Out, you damned thing.”

The drop persisted, defying his command. It meandered lazily toward the lip of the saucer, thick and glistening. It didn’t matter that the blood came from a clumsy cut on the apprentice’s finger. It was blood. And Elric Varn was very, very afraid of blood.

“Master Varn?” The girl’s voice pierced his dread. “Should I fetch a cloth?”

“Out,” he repeated. “Just—go. Fetch nothing. Take the cup with you. All of it.”

Marla hesitated. She had only arrived in Hallowmere two weeks ago, a curious, sharp-eyed girl of fifteen who claimed her dreams were haunted by books that whispered incantations. She’d come to study magic under Elric, unaware of his peculiar affliction. Or perhaps she had known and was testing him—she had the look of someone who enjoyed unraveling things.

“I’ll take it,” she said finally, and gathered the teacup, her own bleeding finger wrapped hastily in her sleeve. The door shut behind her with a tired creak.

Elric exhaled sharply, realizing he had been holding his breath.

He rose with effort and moved to the window. Outside, the fog was giving way to the sallow light of morning, casting everything in an off-kilter pallor. The cobbled streets gleamed with moisture, and here and there the figures of early risers moved like shadows caught in amber.

Elric touched his temple. The flesh there throbbed faintly, an echo of some deeper pain. The visions were returning. Blood in cups. Blood on mirrors. A well filled with blood. And always the laughter—mocking, lilting, impossible to locate.

He had to do something.

In the town square, a procession was forming. Black banners, embroidered with silver vines, flapped without wind. A group of cloaked figures gathered near the base of the old gallows, now draped in white silk. They were the Silents, members of a reclusive order that spoke only through gestures. Their presence here was rare, and never good.

Marla watched from the edge of the crowd. Her bandaged finger pulsed where the needle had pricked her. She scanned the square for Elric, but the warlock was not one for public appearances. Especially not at ceremonies that might involve even the slightest bloodletting.

The Mayor, a tall woman with a face like a stern candle, raised her hands. “Citizens of Hallowmere,” she began. “This day marks the tenth year since the Crimson Collapse. Let us bow our heads in remembrance.”

Heads lowered. Marla did not bow. Her eyes flicked toward the platform where a man in iron manacles knelt. He was young, perhaps nineteen, and his eyes were glassy with either drug or despair.

“By decree of the Ninefold Tribunal, Elias Quarn is condemned,” the Mayor continued. “His blood bears the Mark of the Splinter, and shall be spilt to cleanse the air and warn the dark.”

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Elias struggled against his bonds. The Silents stepped forward, a silver knife cradled like a holy relic between two palms.

Marla felt sick.

Then the fog thickened. Not mist. Not weather.

Magic.

A gust scattered the banners. People gasped and stumbled. And with a sound like a page tearing from a book, Elric Varn appeared atop the gallows platform.

“Stop,” he said, voice flat.

The Silents froze, the knife suspended in air. The Mayor looked outraged.

“This is Tribunal business, Varn,” she snapped. “You will not interfere.”

“I will,” Elric said, “because the blood of this boy is corrupted, yes—but not by choice. Something has returned. Something from the old wood.”

The crowd shifted uneasily. Even the Silents looked to one another.

Elric walked forward carefully, his eyes on the knife. “Let me take him.”

“On whose authority?”

“Mine.” He extended his hand. “And by pact with the Diaphanous Covenant.”

Gasps again. The Mayor turned pale.

“You haven’t invoked that name in a decade,” she said.

“I know,” Elric replied, and winced. The throb in his temple surged. “But it’s come again. The Thread is bleeding.”

Elias Quarn sat in Elric’s study later that night, wrapped in a blanket and silence. He had not spoken since his release. Marla watched him from a stool by the hearth, her curiosity tempered by caution. The boy’s eyes flicked constantly toward the corners of the room, as if something waited just beyond the candlelight.

“Who gave you the mark?” Elric asked.

Elias didn’t answer.

“Elric,” Marla said quietly. “Look at this.”

She held up a sliver of parchment she’d found in Elias’s boot. It was old, brittle, and written in a cramped, spiraling hand. The letters twisted as if alive.

Elric’s lips pressed thin. “Where did you get this?” he asked Elias.

“I don’t remember,” the boy whispered. “I found it, maybe. Or it found me. There was a well. North of the Karklin pass. I heard… something.”

Marla’s fingers went cold. “You heard whispering?”

Elias nodded. “It said my blood was a gate. It showed me a face—no eyes, only mouths. I thought I dreamed it.”

Elric took the parchment and studied it. His skin went visibly pale.

“This is a bloodcall,” he said. “Old magic. Forbidden magic. It shouldn’t exist anymore.”

“But it does,” Marla said.

Elric turned to the fire and threw the parchment in. Flames swallowed it greedily, flickering green for a moment.

“I will take you north,” he told Elias. “To the well. If it’s speaking again, we must hear what it says.”

“But you hate blood,” Marla said.

“I do,” Elric replied. “But I hate what comes from blood left unlistened to even more.”

The road to Karklin wound through fields of pale wheat and gnarled black trees. The three travelers moved quietly, each preoccupied. Elias murmured in his sleep, though he never remembered doing so. Marla wrote in her journal, recording symbols she didn’t understand. And Elric felt the pressure behind his eyes grow worse with every mile.

They reached the well at dusk.

It was hidden in a copse of dead ash trees, the stones around it sunk with time and moss. A rope still hung from the beam above, though the bucket had long since rotted away. Flies buzzed, though there was no water to attract them.

Elias stepped forward and knelt beside the well. “It’s down there,” he said.

Marla held her breath.

Elric looked. At first, only darkness. Then—a glint. Red. Moving.

“Back,” Elric said. “Now.”

But it was too late. The rope lashed out like a living thing and wrapped around Elias’s wrist. Blood spurted as the skin split. He screamed, but did not resist. His eyes were wide and unblinking.

“Elric!” Marla shouted.

The warlock moved forward, mouth already shaping a spell. “Unbind the tether, break the thread, silence what should not have fled—”

The well howled.

A sound like a thousand mouths moaning. Wind surged from the pit. Symbols burst into light around its rim, written in blood, not ink. Elias was pulled to the edge, his feet dragging grooves in the dirt.

Then—Elric cut the rope with a blade of raw glyph-light. The tether snapped. Elias fell back, unconscious. The well screamed one final time, then fell silent.

Only then did Elric notice the blood on his hands. Thick, warm, real.

He stumbled away, retching.

Elric Varn did not sleep that night. He sat in the farthest corner of the small cabin they had taken shelter in, a threadbare wool blanket wrapped tight around his shoulders like armor. Outside, the wind muttered through the skeleton trees, and the dying embers of the fire cast sickly shadows that crawled like fingers across the walls. His gaze fixed on his palms—scrubbed raw and red, the skin nearly torn from the effort of cleansing them. Still he saw it: blood, gleaming and persistent, a memory that clung to his flesh like smoke.

The whispering had not stopped. Even now, it dripped between the cracks of his thoughts, curling behind his ears, murmuring in a tongue older than bone. Not words, not truly—more like impressions, emotion wrapped in the shape of language. It had started the moment he touched the blood on Elias’s arm. And now it would not let go.

He thought of running. Of disappearing back into the winding alleys of Hallowmere or deeper still, into the wildlands where magic could be muffled and minds forgotten. But the rope—the bloodcall—the well—these things had returned. That meant the seal had weakened. The old seals. And that meant something was pushing from the other side.

“Are you hearing it too?”

Marla’s voice was low, but not hesitant. She stood in the doorway to the cabin, her frame outlined by moonlight. Her long coat was dusted with frost, and a satchel bulged at her hip. She had gone out for firewood, but the bundle in her arms was sparse—more bark than branches.

Elric nodded slowly, his mouth dry. “You shouldn’t be able to yet.”

“I’m not like you.” She crossed the room and dropped the wood into the hearth, scattering ash. “Or like him.”

Elric raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.

Marla crouched, striking a flint to spark the tinder. The fire hissed and flared, throwing the light back into Elric’s face. He winced. “What do you mean?”

“I dream in runes,” she said without turning. “Not words. Shapes. Symbols. When Elias screamed, I saw one of them flash in my head. Bright and hot. The same symbol that burned around the well.”

“You should have told me this before,” Elric said, rubbing his temple. “Those are signs of attunement. Dangerous signs.”

“Dangerous to who?” Marla asked, a sharp note in her voice. “You? Or to whatever’s leaking through that crack in the world?”

Elric stood, slowly. His legs ached with fatigue, but the firelight made him feel steadier. “To you, child. Attunement means the veil is thinner for you. Easier for things to slip through. Once they learn your name, they can wear your face.”

Marla stood too, her eyes locked to his. “Then teach me how to stop them.”

He looked away, jaw tense. “You assume it can be stopped.”

Behind them, Elias stirred on his pallet. A hoarse sound escaped his lips—half-moan, half-whisper. His eyes fluttered beneath closed lids, and sweat ran in small rivers down his cheeks. Marla crossed the room quickly and knelt beside him.

“He’s burning,” she said. “Do you have anything—feverroot, shadeleaf—”

Elric moved closer, examining the boy’s face. He was pale beneath the flush, the veins in his neck beginning to darken. Elric’s breath caught.

“He’s marked.”

Marla frowned. “What does that mean?”

Elric didn’t answer immediately. He reached into his satchel and pulled out a slender bone wand, etched with tiny glyphs. With careful precision, he touched the tip to Elias’s brow. The mark flared to life—a sigil in deep crimson, shaped like an eye with thorns for lashes. The skin beneath it cracked slightly, as if scorched from within.

“He was touched. Not just spoken to. They’ve laid claim.”

“Can you break it?”

Elric shook his head. “No. Not alone. This kind of sigil—it predates the Four Schools. Pre-Root magic. I’d need a circle, a conduit, and a tether to his memory. And even then, I’d only be scraping it off the surface. Not cleansing it.”

Marla sat back on her heels, frustration etched into every angle of her posture. “So what do we do? Leave him to rot?”

“No,” Elric said. “We bring him to the Wane.”

Marla blinked. “The Wane is a myth.”

“And so is a rope that drinks blood,” Elric replied. “But you saw that.”

By morning, the frost had stiffened into ice. The trees groaned under its weight, their limbs bending toward the earth as though supplicating. Elric wrapped Elias in thick quilts and secured him to the back of a small donkey they’d bartered from a hill farmer weeks prior. The animal blinked lazily, unaware it was now burdened with the fate of something ancient and terrible.

Marla walked ahead, guiding the way. She had taken to carving runes in the trunks of trees as they passed, claiming it helped her focus. Elric didn’t argue. The truth was, her symbols calmed him too. As though each carving disrupted the invisible net stretching over their path.

It took them three days to reach the edge of the Bone Forest, where the trees grew tall and pale and creaked even when there was no wind. The ground here was soft and black, and the smell of iron hung in the air like a warning. The Wane was said to lie within. Not a place, exactly, but a presence—a tear in the world, sealed long ago by a coven of witches who had traded their eyes for the spell.

They entered at dusk. The forest swallowed them whole.

Inside the Bone Forest, the rules changed.

Sound behaved oddly—echoing without cause, vanishing mid-note, returning minutes later as whispers behind their ears. Light bent and splintered through the trees, casting patterns that looked suspiciously like faces. And the paths—there were too many of them. Branching, doubling back, disappearing entirely when they turned to look again.

Elias mumbled continuously now. His fever had worsened, and his skin was taking on a bluish tint. The mark on his brow pulsed faintly, as if breathing.

“We’re being followed,” Marla said on the second night.

Elric nodded. “I know.”

He had sensed it since they entered—something old and aware, keeping pace just beyond sight. It did not make noise. It simply watched, and waited. If they stopped for too long, the trees leaned in.

“We need to find the hollow.”

Marla stared at him. “You said the Wane was just a tear. A spell.”

“It’s both,” Elric said. “And it sleeps in the hollow. Beneath the oldest tree. If the stories are true, the witches left a guardian there.”

“A guardian of a forbidden rift in reality,” she muttered. “Lovely.”

By midday on the fourth day, they found it.

The tree stood in a clearing devoid of wind, birds, or even insects. It was vast—its trunk wide enough to house a cottage, and its bark white as chalk. Around its base, carved into the ground itself, was a spiral of runes etched in silver.

Elric approached slowly, eyes wary.

“You sure?” Marla asked, holding Elias’s reins.

“No,” Elric admitted. “But we’re out of time.”

He stepped into the circle.

The runes flared, not with light—but with absence. A coldness so pure it erased warmth. Elric fell to his knees, teeth chattering. Then—it spoke.

You fear the river. But the river knows you.

Elric closed his eyes. “I seek release for the marked.”

You seek to unmake a thread already spun. It frays. It sings. It bleeds.

A figure emerged from behind the tree.

It was not human. Not anymore. Its skin was bark, eyes hollow, voice like wind between teeth.

“The Wane accepts,” it said aloud, and held out a hand. “But payment is blood.”

Elric’s heart seized.

Marla stepped forward. “Take mine.”

The guardian looked at her. “Yours is too loud.”

Elric stood shakily. “Then take mine. But don’t show it to me.”

The guardian nodded once.

And with a blade of light so thin it cast no shadow, it made the cut.

Elric did not scream.

He could not.

His world had turned red.

Chapter Two: Names in the Dark

The pain left him hollow.

Elric came back to himself sometime after the bleeding stopped. The world swam in and out of focus, wrapped in waves of nausea and shivering cold. He lay on his side at the base of the ancient tree, the wound across his palm bandaged in moss that pulsed faintly with magic. Above him, the canopy had shifted—it was no longer made of leaves but threads, crisscrossing like the weaving of some great loom. They glistened in a color he could not name, and shimmered when he tried to focus on any single one. The Wane had accepted the offering. For now.

He sat up slowly, feeling as though his limbs were filled with broken glass. A fire crackled nearby, small but steady, casting enough light to keep the shadows from slithering too close. Marla was seated on a rock with her knees drawn up to her chest, watching him intently. Her eyes were ringed with exhaustion, but her posture was tense, alert.

“You’re alive,” she said, voice flat.

“Disappointed?”

“No.” She stood and dusted her coat. “Relieved. Just trying not to act like it.”

Elric smiled weakly. “Good instinct.”

He turned to check on Elias. The boy lay still, wrapped in his quilt, the fever receded. The mark on his brow had faded, replaced by a faint scar that throbbed rhythmically, as if breathing.

“It worked?” Elric asked.

“For now,” Marla said. “The guardian said the mark is buried, not broken. You gave it a price it couldn’t refuse.”

Elric nodded, though the idea made his stomach twist. “Magic that demands blood always wants more. This buys us time. That’s all.”

“We need more than time,” she said. “We need answers. What is this thing that’s calling from the other side? And why Elias?”

Elric reached for his pack and pulled out a folded map, fingers fumbling. His hands were still trembling. “We go east. To Glaiveport. There’s a woman there—Irabeth Crow. She studies forbidden cartography.”

Marla tilted her head. “Maps?”

“Maps of things that no longer exist,” he said. “Or that shouldn’t exist. If the bloodcall is tied to a forgotten place—or a sealed one—she’ll know where to look.”

They set off before dawn. The Bone Forest let them leave.

Glaiveport was not a city so much as a carcass repurposed into commerce. Built on the back of a colossal beast that had died in ancient times—some said a leviathan, others a god—the city’s spires grew from bones, its alleys twisted between ribs, and its markets sprawled across the broad flat planes of vertebrae.

Elric, Marla, and Elias arrived beneath a sky choked with gulls and coal smoke. The air stank of salt, sweat, and fish. Glaiveport pulsed with movement—sailors shouting in five languages, tinkers dragging carts filled with whispering stones, priests in bone masks handing out blessings for coin. Elias kept his hood pulled low and clutched Marla’s arm with white-knuckled fingers. He had not spoken since the forest.

They made their way through the Skullward—the northern district where scholars, outlaws, and those with no taste for daylight kept their rooms. Irabeth’s shop sat nestled between a shuttered plague apothecary and a brothel that catered exclusively to ghosts.

The door bore a sigil of reversal—an inverted compass with a crack through its center. Marla paused before it.

“Should I knock?” she asked.

“No,” Elric said, and pushed it open.

The shop smelled of parchment and mildew. Every wall was covered with maps: tattered ones, stitched ones, maps painted on animal hides and inscribed on plates of silver. Some pulsed faintly, as if remembering places now swallowed by time.

A woman with hair like a candle’s flame emerged from behind a curtain. Her left eye was glass, the right glittered with too much knowledge.

“Elric Varn,” she said, the corners of her mouth quirking. “You look like someone who’s seen the inside of a bone.”

“I have,” he replied, pulling off his gloves. “And it stared back.”

She squinted past him at Marla and Elias. “These your new apprentices? That one looks cracked.”

Elric nodded. “He’s marked. Was marked.”

“Unmarking always leaves splinters,” Irabeth muttered. She gestured them into the back room—a space half-lit by blue candles, where the air shimmered with latent wards.

Marla sat beside Elias while Elric handed Irabeth a sealed bone token—the price of consultation. She turned it in her fingers, sniffed it, then bit down.

“Genuine,” she said. “Pain-etched. What do you want?”

Elric unfolded a sketch Marla had made from memory—the symbol from Elias’s brow. “We’re looking for this. And where it came from.”

Irabeth studied it for a long moment. Then she reached into a drawer and pulled out a scroll bound in sinew. “You’re lucky. One of the last seekers came to me with the same mark.”

Elric froze. “When?”

“Three months ago. Didn’t give a name. Just a coin that screamed when I touched it. He left with a map that led to the Red Hollow, out past the Wyrmclutch hills.”

“The Hollow again,” Marla whispered. “It keeps coming up.”

Irabeth handed Elric the scroll. “He said the voices started after a dream. Said the blood was pulling him toward something older than history. I told him not to go. I doubt he listened.”

“Did he mention the Splinter?” Elric asked.

Irabeth shook her head. “But he bled when he spoke.”

That night, they stayed in a crumbling inn built into the curve of an old ribcage. The windows rattled when the tide changed, and the walls sweated salt. Marla sat near Elias’s bed, turning the scroll over in her lap. It was old—older than the seal on it—and yet the ink looked fresh, the leather warm.

“I don’t like this place,” she said.

“You don’t like most places,” Elric replied. He was brewing a mild sleep-draught in a cracked porcelain cup.

Marla scowled. “This place knows things. It watches.”

He passed her the cup. “Everything does, if you look long enough.”

Elias stirred.

He sat up abruptly, eyes wide. “I saw it again.”

Marla leaned forward. “What did you see?”

“It was… behind the threads. A shape. No eyes. Just… mouths. But not screaming. Praying.”

“To what?”

Elias shook his head. “To me. They were chanting my name. Over and over.”

Elric crossed the room in two strides. “That’s not possible.”

“They were holding something. A book, I think. The cover was wet.”

Marla’s voice was quiet. “Was it red?”

Elias nodded slowly.

The scroll snapped open of its own accord.

Runes flared across its surface, shifting like oil on water. Lines redrew themselves, roads reshaping into a spiral that led—not to the Red Hollow—but beneath it.

Elric stared at the map, throat dry.

“This isn’t a guide,” he said. “It’s a summoning.”

Marla looked at Elias.

Elias looked at nothing.

And the candlelight bent toward him, like gravity in reverse.

The innkeeper was gone by morning.

No trace, no note, not even a wrinkle in the rumpled bedsheets of the front room where he had slept each night. The only sign that he had ever existed was the small collection of keys left on the front counter, neatly stacked and warm to the touch as though someone had only just placed them there. Elric stared at the keys a moment longer than necessary. It was not that he cared particularly for the man himself—he had exchanged no more than ten words with him—but rather that the absence itself felt... constructed. As if someone had written him out of the space.

“We need to leave,” he muttered.

Marla was already packing her satchel. “Back to the Hollow?”

“No. We go to the Spiral Vein first. If this map is what I think it is, the Vein will tell us if the route has been altered.”

Elias stood at the window, motionless. The sky was overcast, and the sea looked bruised beneath the light. He hadn’t spoken since the dream—if it could be called that—and now simply watched the horizon with the blank stillness of someone waiting for an answer they were terrified to hear.

Marla joined Elric by the map scroll. “You said it was a summoning. Who is it calling?”

“Not who,” Elric said, rolling the parchment up tightly. “What.”

The Spiral Vein lay east of Glaiveport, hidden beneath the overgrown ruins of an old cathedral swallowed by ivy and erosion. The stones had once been white, but centuries of wind and salt had left them green and gray, blotched with creeping moss and the faint outlines of warding glyphs worn to obscurity.

They descended the spiral stair at midday. Each step creaked, though the stone itself was whole. The air grew cold, damp, thick with something that clung to the inside of the lungs. Elias coughed and rubbed his arms as they walked, the veins along his neck throbbing in slow, deliberate pulses.

“It’s down here,” he said suddenly, breaking his silence. “I can feel it.”

Marla looked to Elric. He nodded, urging them on.

The stair ended in a narrow chamber shaped like a funnel—walls curving up and in, as though trying to close over them. At its center was the Vein: a column of black stone carved in spirals so tight they seemed to move, even in stillness. Light didn’t reflect off its surface. It sank into it.

Elric approached it cautiously, reaching into his cloak for a small mirror etched with words in broken Latin. He held it out toward the Vein.

Nothing happened.

Then the mirror cracked.

A spiderweb fracture ran through the glass from corner to corner. Elric hissed, pulled his hand back, and dropped the mirror into his satchel.

“It’s already been opened,” he said grimly.

Marla touched the edge of the spiral. “What does that mean?”

“It means we’re not alone on this thread. Someone has gone ahead and laid claim to the path. We’ll be following a trail that doesn’t want to be followed.”

“Do we have a choice?”

Elric turned to her. “No. But I want you to understand what that means.”

“It means the road wants blood,” Marla said. “Same as everything else these days.”

Elias stepped forward. “They’ll be waiting for us at the Hollow.”

“Who?” Marla asked.

“The things that wear names. The ones who found me.”

They made camp that night in the broken archway of what might have once been a chapel. The stars above were unfamiliar—blotted by moving clouds and the faint shimmer of northern lights in shades of violet and gold. Marla slept with her dagger unsheathed beside her. Elric sat awake, feeding the fire as if its glow could keep the thoughts from rising.

Elias stirred again, twitching in his sleep. His lips moved, whispering syllables that didn’t belong to any human language. Elric recognized them all the same—tones from the Spiral, words not meant for the waking world.

He moved to the boy’s side and placed two fingers on his temple.

A sharp intake of breath—and suddenly, he was inside.

Not in Elias’s mind exactly, but near it. Close enough to feel the pull of the mark buried beneath his skin. It glowed now, fully visible in this shared dream-space, and spun slowly like a wheel made of bone. Around it danced figures, mouthless and eyeless, draped in robes that writhed independently from any breeze. Their hands held sigils, inverted from what Elric knew. These were not just invocations. They were un-namings—glyphs meant to undo, to unravel.

“You should not be here.”

The voice came from behind him, female, and hollow with age. Elric turned slowly.

She stood alone in the darkness, her eyes stitched shut with golden thread. Her mouth had been sealed with wax. But her voice echoed, pure and clear.

“You carry the stain of the Covenant. The Diaphanous will not protect you here.”

Elric stood straighter. “You’re a Remnant.”

“I am what remains when names are peeled away.”

“You were a Seer once. One of the Wane.”

She did not deny it. Instead, she stepped forward and extended a hand. “You seek to cut the thread. But the thread is you now.”

Elric felt his knees begin to buckle. The pressure behind his eyes pulsed, a familiar pain now with a new texture—like teeth gnawing gently on the inside of his skull.

“What is it they want?” he asked.

“Not want,” she whispered. “Need.”

The scene buckled. The dream shattered.

He woke gasping beside a cold fire. Marla was staring at him, eyes wide.

“You screamed.”

“I was elsewhere,” Elric said, wiping blood from his nose. “And not alone.”

Elias sat up, blinking. “I felt it too.”

By dawn, they resumed their path northeast.

The Red Hollow was not marked on any modern map. It existed in stories, whispered by waykeepers and cursed mariners—a place where threads unraveled and paths were eaten. Irabeth’s scroll showed it hidden beyond the salt flats of Quereen’s Mouth, nestled between the Shorn Hills and a fracture in the earth known as the Bleeding Ridge.

The terrain turned to ash-colored stone, dotted with spines of petrified trees. The further they traveled, the more distorted the land became. Hills curved in impossible ways, and shadows fell in directions that made no sense given the sun’s position.

On the second night, they found a cairn that had not been there before.

A ring of white stones, each bearing a different name.

Marla bent to read one. “It says ‘Varn.’”

Elric’s stomach turned. He checked another. “Marla.”

Another. “Elias.”

“These were laid by something watching us,” he said. “Not to guide. To warn.”

Or to promise, he thought, but did not say.

By the fourth day, they arrived.

The Red Hollow yawned before them like the mouth of a buried beast. It was not a place, not exactly. More a cavity in the world, where the laws of nature had frayed and folded inward. The ground here was not earth, but scar tissue. The wind carried voices that did not echo. The air was thick with colorless light.

In the center of the Hollow stood a pillar of flesh.

It pulsed, and from its base grew roots—veins, too many to count—spreading across the basin and digging deep into the ground. Elric stared in horror.

“It’s a heart,” he said. “A living heart.”

Elias moved toward it, trance-like.

“Elric!” Marla shouted, but the boy was already running.

Elric reached for a spell, fingers scribing a glyph of restraint in the air, but the sigil shattered as it formed.

The ground beneath Elias split open—and he fell.

Marla screamed.

Elric ran to the edge. Below, there was only darkness, and the sound of names being spoken by mouths that had no breath.

Chapter Three: The Mouth Below

The fall did not kill him.

Elias struck the darkness as though it were water, though there was no splash, no weightless drift. The light from above dwindled almost instantly, shrinking to a distant pinhole that pulsed like a weak star. He floated—no, hung—in an endless space with no gravity, no temperature, no boundary to speak of. Only the sound remained. A constant murmur of voices, layered and indistinct, as if hundreds of mouths were pressed just behind a veil, chanting names in the wrong direction.

His name.

Elias Quarn. Elias Quarn. Elias...

He tried to scream but his throat only produced silence. Not even the rasp of breath reached his ears. His body convulsed, not in pain, but in recoil—every nerve rebelling against the idea of existing in such a space. He clawed at the air, trying to find anything solid, but his limbs moved too slowly, dragged by invisible tendrils.

Then, something touched him.

Not skin. Not bone. But presence—a sensation like fingers, brushing gently across the back of his mind. He could feel it attempting to part him, to read him, not as a mind or a soul but as a scroll: a message written in blood, waiting to be unsealed.

The chanting stopped.

A single voice replaced it.

You are the ink. The page. The hand.

It had no tone, no gender, and it did not come from a location. It simply was. Around him, things began to stir—massive shapes twisting in the dark, things whose contours made his brain flinch. A jaw unhinged beneath him, wider than a cathedral, lined with teeth shaped like runes. It did not open. It was open, and always had been.

We found you.

Elias felt a warmth trickle down his brow. He reached up instinctively. Blood. The mark had reopened, and it burned as if something were pushing its way out.

Above, Marla paced the perimeter of the Hollow like a caged animal. Her face was pale, her lips drawn tight. The rope she had tied to her waist dangled into the chasm, but it had met no bottom. She knew Elric was thinking the same thing she was—if there was no bottom, then where had Elias gone?

Elric stood still, eyes closed, one hand hovering above the wound on his palm. He was attempting a tracing spell—one that would bind his own blood to Elias’s and draw a line between them. It was dangerous magic. The kind that didn’t simply find but joined. And if Elias was gone—truly gone—it might pull Elric in after him.

“You sure about this?” Marla asked.

“No,” he said, and let the drop of blood fall from his hand into the Hollow.

At first, nothing.

Then the rope tensed. Not tugged. Pulled.

Marla grabbed it instinctively. “He’s there.”

“No,” Elric said grimly. “Something’s there.”

The rope began to rise—not from being retrieved, but as though it were being returned. When it reached the edge, a bundle lay coiled at the end.

It was a book.

Leather-bound, stained. Still warm.

Marla bent to touch it but Elric stopped her. “Let me.”

He opened it carefully.

Inside, written in thick, looping script, was a single repeated line: I am the vessel. I am the thread. I am the gate.

Each line followed the last, but each was in a different hand. Some childlike, others ancient and scrawled with maddening precision. The final page was empty—except for a single smear of blood across its center.

“He’s still alive,” Elric said.

“You’re sure?”

“This blood hasn’t dried yet. It’s his. He’s writing now. Or being written.”

Marla looked back at the Hollow. “Then we need to go in after him.”

Elric’s silence stretched.

“You’re going, right?” she asked, voice rising. “You’re not going to leave him down there—”

“I didn’t say that.”

“Then what are we waiting for?”

Elric looked back at the beating heart in the center of the Hollow. “We need an anchor.”

The ritual took hours.

Elric carved runes in a circle around the lip of the Hollow, each drawn with his own blood diluted in ashwater. Marla stood at the center, eyes closed, chanting a binding litany to keep their spirits tethered. Elric would descend, but not physically. To send his flesh would be to feed it to whatever ruled the pit. Instead, he would send his mind—the thread of his soul—along the vein already formed between himself and Elias.

“Don’t break the circle,” he warned her. “No matter what you see. No matter what I say.”

She nodded.

He sat cross-legged, palms up, breath slow. The wind died. The Hollow quieted.

Then he was falling.

This time, he did not enter the same place Elias had. His descent was filtered by intent, sharpened by purpose. The void did not swallow him—it invited him, recognizing the blood pact.

He arrived in a library.

No walls. No floor. Only endless shelves of books, suspended in void. The air smelled of wax and mildew. Each book whispered. Pages turned on their own. Shapes moved between the stacks—readers, perhaps, or keepers. They wore robes like woven shadow, faces covered in blank masks of copper.

Elric moved forward, following the whisper of Elias’s name.

A shelf opened before him, revealing a staircase that wound downward, deeper than sight. He followed.

At the base, he found a room.

Circular. Lined with mirrors. At its center stood Elias, eyes vacant, hands open at his sides. The mark on his brow had grown—no longer a scar, but a living glyph, pulsing with breath.

“Elric,” Elias said, but did not turn. “They gave me a name.”

“What name?”

“I can’t say it. My mouth won’t let me. But it’s mine now.”

Elric moved closer. The mirrors reflected neither of them. Instead, each showed a different version of Elias—young, old, monstrous, weeping, crowned, skeletal. Each mirror offered a different fate. Each a possible thread.

“Choose one,” said a voice that seemed to come from every mirror at once.

“Don’t,” Elric warned. “It’s a trap.”

“They said I could leave if I picked one.”

“They’re lying.”

“They said you picked already,” Elias whispered. “Long ago.”

The words hit Elric like a blow.

The mirrors flickered. In each one, he saw himself—casting a spell, walking away, cutting a thread, closing a door.

“You were one of us once,” the voice said.

“I was nothing,” Elric snapped. “And I chose to be.”

The voice laughed—a dry, papery sound like pages burning.

“You feared blood because it led you here. You were always afraid of what it would show you.”

Elric reached for Elias. “Come with me.”

But the boy didn’t move. “If I leave, they’ll follow.”

“Then let them,” Elric said, and grabbed Elias’s wrist.

The room fractured.

Mirrors shattered inward. The glyph on Elias’s forehead burst into threads of red light. The voices howled. The library shook.

And then—Elric opened his eyes.

He was back at the edge of the Hollow. The sun had risen. Marla was kneeling beside him.

He turned—Elias was there, breathing, eyes open. No mark on his brow.

“You pulled him out,” she said.

Elric didn’t respond immediately. He stood and walked to the edge of the chasm.

The Hollow was no longer empty.

At its bottom stood a tower of bone. It hadn’t been there before. But it was there now. And at its pinnacle, something watched them.

Elric turned to Marla.

“We’ve changed the thread,” he said.

“Is that good?”

He shook his head.

“It means we’re part of the story now.”

The climb out of the Hollow was harder than the descent. The world resisted their return. Stones slipped beneath their boots. The rope swayed as if breathed on by unseen lungs. Several times Elric felt a pressure at his back, subtle but constant, like someone leaning in just behind his shoulder, whispering in a voice he could no longer distinguish from his own thoughts. Marla climbed just ahead of Elias, her fingers bleeding from the rough hemp, but she never let go. Not once. Not even when the wind howled and the rocks began to hum with the same chant that had echoed through Elias’s dreams.

By the time they reached the lip, the sun was nearly swallowed by cloud. The basin of the Hollow stretched behind them in silence. No wind. No voices. No pulse. Even the tower of bone had vanished, as though retreating into a fold in space they could no longer perceive. Marla was the first to stand upright. She turned to look back only once before she spat into the dirt and tied the rope off with shaking hands.

“I want to burn this place,” she muttered.

“So do I,” Elric replied, already reaching for the satchel that held the map. “But some wounds don’t burn. They just fester.”

Elias didn’t speak. He sat quietly beside a stone, his knees drawn up, his face buried in his arms. The mark on his forehead was gone—truly gone—but something had taken its place in his eyes. Not a presence exactly, but an awareness. The kind Elric had only seen in seers after their first trances, and in soldiers after their first kill.

“Can you walk?” Elric asked.

Elias nodded without raising his head.

They walked until nightfall, putting as much distance between themselves and the Hollow as the terrain allowed. The Bleeding Ridge loomed to the north—crimson cliffs etched by ancient rainfall and streaked with rusted minerals. The ground began to change beneath their feet. Softer. Less brittle. They found shelter in the ruins of what had once been a signal tower, now a hollowed-out rib cage of stone and shattered glass. They lit no fire. They spoke in whispers. Not from fear of being heard, but from the simple recognition that this part of the world did not tolerate arrogance.

Marla finally broke the silence.

“What was that place really?”

Elric sighed. He had asked himself the same question every hour since they left it behind.

“It was a fracture,” he said. “A point where the pattern of things—of reality—was weakened. They appear where blood has been spilled over time with purpose. Where ritual goes wrong. Where magic sinks too deeply and forgets how to climb out.”

“You knew,” she said. “You’ve been there before.”

He didn’t deny it.

“I was taken there,” he admitted. “Years ago. Before I renounced the Covenant. I wasn’t marked like Elias, but I was meant to become a vessel.”

“And you escaped?”

“I made a trade.”

Marla didn’t press further. But her expression was heavy with the questions she didn’t ask.

Later that night, after Elias fell into a twitching, dreamless sleep, Elric pulled the book from his satchel—the one that had returned with the rope. He hadn’t dared open it since. The pages were still warm. Still breathing.

He opened to the first.

The writing had changed.

No longer a single phrase repeated in countless hands. Instead, the ink twisted into dense, clustered lines of prose—scraps of prophecy, curses in forgotten dialects, invocations spelled backward and bound with glyphs of silence. And beneath it all, the faint outline of a map. Not drawn, but grown—etched into the parchment like veins under skin.

He held it closer to the firelight and saw that the map didn’t lead to a place. It led to a person.

A name scrawled in delicate crimson: Nheraval, the Weaver Beneath.

He didn’t know the name, but the weight of it was unbearable. It pressed into his lungs, into the marrow of his bones. The script curled at the edges of the page, and the ink flared with a heat that had no source.

He quickly closed the book.

Marla stirred nearby. “What did it say?”

“Nothing useful,” he lied.

She didn’t challenge him.

In the early hours of the morning, when sleep became impossible and time seemed to bend unnaturally, Elric crept from the ruins and walked to the edge of the ridge. From here, he could see the outline of the Hollow, distant but persistent. He closed his eyes and tried to forget the taste of the place, the hum of its voice in his blood. But it clung to him. The price of entry was always return.

And worse still—he feared this was only the threshold.

They arrived in a village called Brackenfold two days later, a farming settlement known for its silence and its moss-covered roofs. The people did not greet strangers warmly, but they offered no hostility either—only sidelong glances and tight-lipped nods.

Elric knew why.

Brackenfold sat on the seam between worlds. Not one of the major ley points, but a subtle thread—a resonance point where magic echoed longer than it should. Birds flew in strange spirals above the rooftops. Wells never ran dry. Children occasionally spoke in tongues they couldn’t remember learning.

They took a room at the edge of the village, in a squat timber house with a crooked chimney and a goat that refused to blink.

Marla watched the villagers through a crack in the shutters as Elric examined the map again. He traced the paths with gloved fingers, careful not to let his skin touch the parchment. It reacted even to proximity now. The lines shifted, reformed, pointing southward toward the Drowned Border—a flooded expanse where a city had once stood before the river rebelled.

“What are we looking for there?” Marla asked.

“A name,” Elric said.

“I thought we already found one.”

“That was a warning.”

She leaned against the wall. “What’s this one?”

“A key.”

They left the next morning with a guide—an old man named Farris who claimed he had once seen the edge of the Drowned Border during a particularly cruel winter, when the ice cracked and the city’s bones surfaced. He spoke little, but he never lost his pace. His eyes, milky with age, saw things none of them did. More than once, he raised a hand to stop them just before a sinkhole revealed itself, or veered left when the ground began to moan beneath their feet.

“Most don’t come this way,” he said as they passed beneath the remains of a collapsed aqueduct. “Something lives in the water.”

“What kind of something?” Marla asked.

“Something that remembers.”

They reached the edge of the Drowned Border on the fifth day.

The world ended in a flat sheet of dark, rippling water. Dead trees jutted from the surface like spears. Beneath the reflection, shapes moved—slow, deliberate, too large to be fish. The remains of spires and towers protruded from the lakebed in the distance, their forms warped by algae and years.

“This was once Caer Vassa,” Elric said. “Before the flood.”

“You’ve been here?” Elias asked, his voice rough from disuse.

“No,” Elric said. “But I know its name.”

He held up the map. The veins within had turned crimson, spreading in all directions from a single point in the water. It pulsed like a heartbeat.

“We’re close.”

“Close to what?” Marla asked.

Elric didn’t answer.

Instead, he stepped into the water.

Chapter Four: The Drowned Name

The water of the Drowned Border was colder than thought, colder than memory. It clung to Elric's skin like oil, slow and deliberate, leeching heat and sound. Every step sent ripples into the stillness, but they returned oddly delayed, as if time hesitated to continue their echo. Behind him, Marla called out, her voice warping against the low hum that began the moment he entered the lake. Elias remained at the edge, unmoving, his eyes fixed on the submerged ruins beyond.

Elric moved forward with deliberate pace. The water deepened quickly, and by the time it reached his ribs, he could feel the pull of something beneath, not strong enough to drag but persistent, like fingers brushing his ankles. The map was sealed in wax and tied to his chest beneath his tunic. Its warmth had gone, replaced by a quiet pressure that felt like it was waiting.

The remains of Caer Vassa rose before him, spires cracked and half-submerged, their stone surfaces overtaken by long black vines that grew in slow, pulsing knots. Windows stared blankly, some shattered, others blinking faintly as though eyes watched from within. As he neared what had once been the outer wall, a gate materialized below the surface—its arch broken but still intact enough to mark a passage.

He paused.

The glyph in his palm flared.

Above the water, the air changed. He heard it in the way the birds stopped calling, in the sudden absence of the breeze that had followed them for days. Even the insects fell silent. A stillness as dense as fog rolled in from nowhere.

Marla shouted again.

“Elric!”

He turned but could not see her. A wall of mist had risen between them, thick and opalescent, shimmering with colors that weren’t visible elsewhere in the world.

Too late to go back now.

He dove.

Beneath the water, silence took shape.

Not absence of sound, but the presence of silence—an active thing, pressing in on his ears, squeezing at his lungs. Light fractured oddly, bending around shapes that should not have existed: staircases descending into darkness, doors framed in bone-white coral, statues whose faces had been scratched away.

Elric swam downward, following the pulse he felt through the wax-sealed map. His mind swam with impressions—voices half-remembered, warnings whispered long ago in the halls of the Covenant, tales of drowned cities and the spells that sleep within them.

He saw it then.

A chapel.

Its roof long gone, walls partially collapsed, but the altar still stood, preserved by magic or by reverence. Behind it, a mural stretched across stone—barely visible, etched in pale green light. He moved closer.

The image was familiar. A figure with no eyes and too many mouths, arms outstretched. From its hands, threads unraveled in all directions, weaving through the spines of kneeling humans below.

At the bottom of the mural, a name had been scratched in blood-rust.

Nheraval.

Elric reached into his tunic and pulled free the waxed packet. It broke open at his touch, not with force, but like fruit rotting under its own weight. Inside was the book, and the map now shone with eerie light, its veins vibrating softly. A line extended from its heart, pointing toward the altar.

He approached.

The moment his foot touched the cracked stone step, the chapel breathed.

Water shuddered. Columns groaned. The mural shimmered—and the figure moved. Just slightly, a twitch of one hand, but Elric saw it. A ripple ran through the image as though painted on water rather than stone.

He placed the map on the altar.

Immediately, a mouth opened in the floor.

Not metaphor. Not magic in metaphor. A real, fleshy, circular maw, ringed with teeth like keys. No sound emerged. No suction. It simply waited, gaping.

A voice filled the chapel, not heard with ears, but inside the body, echoing through ribs and bones.

You carry the name. You feared it. You buried it. But you are stitched to the thread.

Elric dropped to his knees. His head ached. Blood trickled from his nose. His eyes burned with pressure, and suddenly the truth came to him—not spoken, not taught, but remembered. He knew why he feared blood.

Because once, long ago, he had spilled it to bind a name.

His name.

He had not simply encountered the Hollow. He had not merely brushed the old forces.

He had served them.

And the name they gave him then, the name he tore from his own soul to bury in a secret rite, was rising again.

A shape emerged from the mouth.

Long. Thin. Unfolding as though it had no end. A thread of something neither flesh nor spirit. It hovered before Elric and touched his forehead.

His mind fractured.

He awoke choking.

Marla knelt over him, drenched, her face ashen. Elias stood behind her, arms crossed tight over his chest, eyes flicking between them and the lake.

“You stopped breathing,” she said.

“You were under for ten minutes,” Elias added, voice trembling. “You were… not alone.”

Elric coughed and rolled to his side. His skin felt burned, but no wound showed. The map lay beside him, completely dry, though no longer warm. The book was closed, sealed with a fresh wax sigil shaped like a mouth sewn shut.

“Did you find the name?” Marla asked.

“I remembered it,” he whispered.

“What is it?”

He hesitated. The syllables swam just beneath his tongue, begging to be spoken. But he knew the cost. Names had power. Spoken names had direction. A thing with a name could be called—and a thing called would come.

Instead, he turned to Elias. “I saw the Chapel of Threads. I saw your place in it. You were meant to be a vessel for what comes next.”

Elias nodded slowly. “I felt it. That something is inside me still. Watching.”

Marla looked from one to the other. “What do we do now?”

Elric sat up. The pain in his head ebbed, replaced with clarity. He looked toward the south, where the mountains loomed like knives on the horizon.

“We follow the thread. But we don’t run from it anymore.”

“To where?” she asked.

“To the Sanctum of Pale,” he said. “To the last place the blood rites were ever stopped.”

Marla didn’t ask how he knew. She only helped him to his feet, and together, the three of them walked from the Drowned Border, leaving behind the mouth in the lake, which slowly closed itself again—smiling.

They traveled under cloud for the next four days, heading south by paths that had not seen travelers in years. The air thickened the closer they came to the edge of the Pale—a lowland stretch of haunted wind and crumbling pilgrim stones that predated any map still recognized by the living. The Sanctum lay beyond the western reach of the Churned Peaks, built into a hollowed cliff face where only dry lichens dared grow. No one had entered the place in centuries, not since the rites were sealed by the Trine Accord and blood magic cast into disfavor by those who feared what the covenant had once summoned.

Elric remembered the path. He should not have. But it unspooled before them like a road recalled from dreams, lined with half-formed thoughts and names he'd worked a lifetime to forget. Each night he woke sweating, not from nightmares, but from the absence of them—the silence where dreams should have stirred. The memory of the chapel under the lake, of the speaking mural, of the thread that touched his brow—it was not fading. If anything, it grew sharper, more insistent with each passing hour.

Marla noticed.

“You’re quieter than usual,” she said one evening, as they camped beneath a leaning stone arch pocked with ancient glyphs.

“Thinking,” Elric replied.

“About what happens when we reach the Sanctum?”

“Yes.”

Marla crouched beside the fire, twisting a flatbread over the coals with steady fingers. Her face was calm, but her eyes flicked toward him too often to be casual.

“You remember too much,” she said after a moment. “More than you let on.”

Elric looked up sharply, but she didn’t flinch. “You knew the path to the Hollow before we found the map. You knew the way to Caer Vassa. You knew the name before it spoke.”

“You’re saying I’m part of this,” Elric said, “more than I admit.”

“I’m saying you were always part of it.”

He said nothing.

She didn’t press. She didn’t need to.

They reached the outer edge of the Sanctum on the fifth evening, just before dusk turned the cliffs to fire. The entrance was nearly gone, collapsed inward with the weight of years, but Elric found the original markings buried beneath wind-scoured stone. They were faint but legible: a spiraled triskelion with a bleeding eye at its center—the ancient symbol of the Diaphanous Covenant.

Marla traced the shape with one gloved hand. “You belonged to them once.”

“I was trained by them. I didn’t belong.”

“Then why did you leave?”

He hesitated, watching the sky for a long moment before answering. “Because I didn’t want to become what they made.”

“And yet here we are,” she whispered.

Elias stepped forward then, the ever-present quiet between his words seeming to carry more weight than the words themselves when they finally came.

“What do we find inside?”

Elric turned to him. “The truth. If we’re strong enough to name it.”

Inside the Sanctum, the dust hung motionless in the air. The outer hall was shaped like a crescent, its ceiling cracked but holding, its walls carved with long-forgotten sigils. The light from Marla’s lantern cast narrow shadows across old offerings—bones wrapped in cloth, silver trinkets dulled with age, dried bundles of crimson herbs bound with twine.

They passed beneath an archway etched in script so old even Elric had to sound out the syllables under his breath.

Here end the names that bind. Beyond lies the name unspoken.

The inner chambers were worse.

Here the air was not still but stagnant, thick with memory and reek. The sanctum had been a site of final rites—where magic born of blood was meant to be ended, sealed, cut from the lineage of the living world. Elric could feel the scars left behind by that sealing—deep gouges in the fabric of magic itself, like torn seams hastily stitched shut.

In the chamber of judgment, the walls were lined with thrones. All empty. Above each was carved a single rune, not of power, but of cessation. Glyphs of silencing, severing, oblivion.

Elias moved toward one, staring up at it with wide eyes.

“I’ve seen this before,” he said. “In the dream. These marks. They were on the mouths of the ones who watched.”

Elric nodded. “They were the ones who cast away their voices to end the covenant. The last of the Silents. They gave their names to the seal. That’s how the ritual held. That’s why the Hollow was closed. For a time.”

Marla touched the edge of one empty throne. “But not forever.”

“No,” Elric said. “The seal was never perfect. It was a sacrifice, not a solution. And sacrifices rot. Especially when the world forgets the cost.”

At the center of the room was a well—dry now, but stained at the rim with old sigils and older blood. Elric approached it carefully. He unwrapped the book from its wax covering and placed it on the lip.

The pages opened on their own.

The script was not the same as before. It had changed again. The map was gone. In its place: a question.

Do you remember the shape of your name?

Elric leaned over the well. It was not empty. Not truly.

Reflected in its depth was not his face, but another—familiar and alien. A younger version of himself, eyes too wide, hands stained red, whispering words he no longer knew the sound of. The image smiled.

“I do,” Elric said aloud.

The room shook.

Marla grabbed Elias, pulling him back toward the wall as dust fell in curtains from the ceiling. Light flared in the glyphs above the thrones. The book burst into flame, not fire, but memory—sheets curling with scenes from the past, words spoken in darkness, names carved in the flesh of the willing.

Elric stood taller.

“I was named once. They gave me a name to open the path. I cast it off. But it was never gone. It found Elias. It found the thread again.”

“Then what do we do?” Marla asked, shouting over the rising hum.

“We end it properly.”

The well glowed. The image of his younger self reached upward. Elric met it, his palm pressing to the reflection.

The air folded.

He stood in a room of thread.

It went on forever, ceilingless, wall-less, floorless—just thread, hanging in every direction. Some were thin and black. Some red and pulsing. Some gold and trembling. Each hummed with energy, a life, a choice. A name.

He walked through them like one walking through rain.

And at the center, he found it: the knot.

A massive tangle of threads—bleeding, snarled, and singing in dozens of voices at once. Names wrapped around it like barbed wire. Faces blinked from its mass: Elias, Marla, himself, others unknown. The knot pulsed.

It spoke.

You came to sever. You came to forget. But you are the needle.

Elric stepped closer.

He reached into his coat and pulled the silver blade he had carried since his covenant days. A blade of oaths. A blade meant to unmake.

“I didn’t come to forget,” he said. “I came to end.”

The knot recoiled. Threads snapped. Faces screamed. The room began to unravel.

And Elric raised the blade.

When he opened his eyes, he lay beside the well, the book a pile of ash at his feet. Marla and Elias knelt beside him. The thrones were empty once more, the glyphs dim.

“It’s done,” he whispered.

“Are you sure?” Marla asked.

“I cut the knot. The thread is still there, but it no longer leads back to them.”

Elias looked down at his hands. “Then what happens now?”

Elric closed his eyes.

“Now we walk forward,” he said. “With names of our own.”

They left the Sanctum under a red morning sky, the sun bleeding through thick clouds like a wound barely stitched. The silence of the cliffs gave way to distant wind as they descended the winding path carved generations ago into the pale stone. Marla walked slightly ahead, quiet, her shoulders hunched in a posture Elric recognized not as fatigue, but calculation. She was turning something over in her mind, again and again, a habit she’d developed since the Hollow—ever since the first time she saw a name burn itself into the air.

Elias followed behind, eyes wide but no longer vacant. Whatever spell the Hollow had pressed into his spirit was not undone, but it no longer governed him. He walked with purpose now, his silence less haunted and more deliberate. Each movement he made was controlled. Intentional. As though he was waiting for the right moment to say something that had taken shape far beneath the surface.

They made camp that night beneath an overhang of shale overlooking a dry gulch. The moon was full, but the light bent strangely through the mist clinging to the valley. They ate in near silence. Elric didn’t press for conversation. He had his own questions still boiling behind his ribs, but he was learning to let them simmer.

Marla finally broke the stillness.

“You changed something in there,” she said, her voice low and even.

Elric looked up. “The knot. The name at the root. It had to be unmade.”

“No, I mean you. You changed yourself. You remembered something, or… let go of something. And now you’re quieter. Heavier.”

Elric nodded. “I remembered who I was before the Covenant. And more importantly, why I left it.”

“That knot—it wasn’t just names, was it?” she asked. “It was choices. All of them. All the threads that led to now.”

“Yes. And the blade I carried… it wasn’t for cutting the world. It was for cutting myself out of it.”

Elias spoke then, his voice a whisper nearly swallowed by the wind. “Then why didn’t you vanish?”

Elric looked at him for a long moment. “Because I chose not to. I could’ve cut myself from the thread entirely. Let my name vanish. Become nothing. But I stayed. Because of you. Both of you.”

Marla frowned. “We didn’t ask for that kind of responsibility.”

“No,” Elric agreed. “But you’ve carried it all the same.”

They sat in silence after that, the fire crackling between them.

Much later, while the others slept, Elric took the last fragment of the book—the waxed seal that had survived the burning—and buried it under the shale. He spoke no words over it. Words were dangerous things. It was enough that it was hidden. No more names would be summoned from that ash.

They crossed into the Whispering Vale two days later, where the wind itself carried echoes of things long dead. The path wound between hollow trees that bent not with weather, but with the weight of watching. Here, they encountered the first real travelers since Glaiveport—pilgrims, pale and mumbling, wrapped in gray linen from head to toe. They walked barefoot. None carried weapons. All bore marks on their palms that glowed faintly under shadow.

“They’re marked,” Elias whispered.

“Yes,” Elric said, pulling his cloak tighter. “But not by blood rites. These are the Threadsworn.”

Marla looked at him. “Followers of Nheraval?”

“Not worshippers,” he said. “They think if they walk long enough, if they strip themselves of thought and speak only in names, they’ll find a place beyond the threads. A freedom from pattern.”

“Does it work?”

“No,” he said. “But sometimes they vanish anyway.”

They passed without incident. The Threadsworn never turned their heads, never shifted their steps. They murmured as they walked, each syllable disjointed, fragile, the way a name sounds when spoken underwater. One woman, barely taller than a child, reached out as they passed. Her fingers brushed Elias’s wrist.

He flinched.

Elric turned sharply, but the woman had already turned away, rejoining the slow procession. No change in her expression. No falter in her chant.

“What did she do?” Marla asked.

“She gave me something,” Elias murmured, rubbing his wrist.

Elric studied the skin. A faint pattern glowed there—briefly—a new mark, not of blood or magic, but something deeper. A trace of memory. A recognition.

“She recognized you,” Elric said, his tone unreadable.

“But I didn’t know her.”

“You didn’t have to.”

The road turned jagged as they left the Vale and entered the fringe of the southern steppes, where wind no longer carried voices and even the sky seemed to mute its color. They made camp in a ravine just beyond a jagged ridge of broken ironwood trees, and for the first time in weeks, Marla laughed—just once, sharp and short and unexpected.

“You know,” she said, prodding a smoldering ember, “I was supposed to be a seamstress. My mother trained me to sew, patch, cut cloth. I was terrible at it. I stitched everything too tight.”

Elric raised an eyebrow. “That’s hard to imagine.”

“I wanted to learn runes instead,” she went on, voice lighter now. “Not the fancy ones the guilds teach, but the ones you’re not supposed to write. My grandfather had a book. He let me look when my mother wasn’t watching.”

“You read pre-Root glyphs at ten?”

“I traced them. Didn’t know what they meant until later.”

Elias looked up from the small game bird he was roasting. “And you still chose to follow a man afraid of blood?”

“You weren’t there,” Marla said, smiling faintly. “He wasn’t afraid. Not in the way most people are. It was like he knew what it cost and couldn’t bear to owe it again.”

Elric shifted. He didn’t meet her gaze. But he didn’t correct her either.

By the end of the week, they reached the Shifting Gate—a standing circle of stones that rotated slowly in place, grinding against each other in patterns that never repeated. It was said to be the last true entrance to the forgotten spaces. The lands beyond were unmapped, unspoken, buried beneath the silence of unthreaded names.

Here, Elric paused.

“We cross, and there’s no returning,” he said.

“I wasn’t planning to,” Marla replied.

Elias looked at the stones. “Will they know we’re coming?”

“They already do.”

They stepped into the circle together.

The world rippled.

And something answered.

Chapter Five: The Unthreaded Path

Crossing the Shifting Gate was not like stepping through a door. It was more like stepping into a question, the kind of question that unraveled the moment it was asked, taking all certainty with it. The circle of stones rotated more rapidly as Elric, Marla, and Elias passed through. Light fractured. Sound flattened. For an instant, the world turned inside out, and they each experienced something private, something unspeakable.

Marla saw her mother’s face, lined with disappointment, but her mouth moved in a language Marla had never heard. Elias was a child again, hiding beneath a staircase, listening to someone scream his name from the end of a long, dark hall. Elric felt warmth—sunlight on his face in a garden that no longer existed, and the weight of a promise he had broken before it was ever spoken aloud.

Then it was over.

They stood on a plain of white dust beneath a sky with no sun, only a pale orb that hovered low, casting no shadow. The ground stretched out flat and empty in every direction, yet when Elric looked behind them, the Gate was gone. No stones. No rotation. Just blankness.

“This is it,” he murmured. “The space between threads.”

Marla turned in a slow circle. “Is this even real?”

“It’s real enough to kill you,” he said. “But not enough to mourn you.”

They walked.

There was no sense of time here. No wind. No passage of sun or stars. Just the dull throb of existence, the muted hum beneath the skin. Occasionally, they would pass remnants—objects half-formed and rusting: a silver spoon twisted into a spiral, a doorframe standing in isolation with no wall, a boot filled with dust and containing a child’s tooth.

“These are leftovers,” Elric explained. “Things discarded by the pattern. Cast out when no thread could hold them.”

Elias crouched beside a pile of shattered mirrors. None of them reflected anything at all.

“If this is where unthreaded things go,” he asked, “what happens if we stay too long?”

Elric didn’t answer. He didn’t need to.

They kept walking until the horizon changed.

It wasn’t that something appeared. Rather, the texture of the air grew thick, tinged with violet. The dust gave way to stone. The silence began to... listen. It leaned in. It pressed against their thoughts.

Ahead, a structure loomed—impossibly tall and narrow, shaped like a spindle or a coiled needle rising from the earth. Its surface was woven from thousands of thin strands, not metal or wood, but something living that shimmered like wet silk.

“The Loom,” Elric whispered.

Marla inhaled sharply. “This is where they make names.”

“No,” Elric said. “This is where names are unmade.”

They approached with caution. No doorway marked its base. No gate. Yet the threads parted for them, sensing their passage. The moment they stepped through, they were engulfed in a tunnel of interwoven fibers, humming with quiet resonance.

Inside, it was dark. Not empty-dark, but crowded dark—filled with thoughts, memories, impressions that weren’t theirs. Echoes without speakers. The further they walked, the more fragmented the ground became. At first smooth, then fissured, then broken into floating slivers suspended in midair by nothing Elric could explain.

“Keep your mind still,” he said. “Do not speak your own name. Do not think your own name.”

Marla looked at him. “Why?”

“Because here,” Elric said, “names are magnets. And something is always listening.”

At the Loom’s heart, they found a chamber.

It pulsed, slowly, like a breathing lung. The walls writhed with threads that had no end, stretching out into darkness. And in the center—hanging between four great columns of bone and crystal—was a figure.

Or something like one.

It had no face. No mouth. Only long limbs and a body stitched from folds of veils and whispers. It hung motionless, arms outstretched, threads spilling from its palms in every direction.

Elric dropped to one knee. Not in reverence—but in necessity. The presence radiated weight. Not physical, but metaphysical. To stand fully in its presence was to feel the burden of every name you’d ever carried—every lie, every mask, every title whispered behind closed doors.

“Is it... alive?” Marla asked.

Elias moved closer, drawn despite himself.

“Yes,” Elric said. “And no. That is the Weaver Beneath. Not Nheraval. The Weaver. The first. The one who unthreaded the gods.”

As they stood, a sound began.

Not a voice. A note. A tremor.

It entered their ears, then their blood, then their bones.

A thread reached down from the Weaver’s hand, stopping inches from Elias’s chest.

“Don’t move,” Elric warned.

But Elias stepped forward.

The thread touched his sternum.

And everything broke.

They were not in the Loom anymore.

They were in a storm of names.

Torrents of syllables screamed around them, each name a shard of memory slicing the air. Elric saw his true name flash past—twice. It cut his skin without bleeding. Marla screamed as her childhood name tore at her arms, unraveling pieces of her she had hidden long ago. Elias stood at the center, untouched. The thread from the Weaver’s hand now wrapped around his chest, and he glowed—not with light, but with meaning.

The storm stilled.

A voice, vast and feminine, echoed through the ruin of silence.

He was always meant to carry the silence. He is the seal. He is the mouth unspoken.

Marla crawled to her feet. “What does that mean?”

Elric’s voice cracked. “Elias wasn’t a vessel. He’s the thread itself. A name that loops and loops, tying the world shut.”

Elias’s eyes were white. “They showed me... everything. The places between words. The syllables that came before the first tongue.”

“Can you close the Hollow?” Marla asked.

“No,” he said. “But I can close me. If I choose to stop existing, if I sever my thread, then they can’t come through. No vessel. No gate.”

Elric moved toward him, fast. “No. There’s always another way. You don’t have to—”

Elias smiled, calm. “I was never supposed to survive this, Elric. I was born because the thread wanted to forget itself.”

The storm raged again.

The Weaver moved for the first time—one long arm lowering, fingers extended, a single blade of thread held between its tips.

Elias took it.

He turned to Marla. “Tell them I wasn’t afraid.”

Then he cut the thread.

The Loom screamed.

Not a sound, but an absence that tore the air. Threads snapped across the chamber. The Weaver shuddered. The structure groaned as names began to dissolve. A light exploded from Elias’s chest, filling the dark with pure silence. Then he was gone. Not dead—erased. As though he had never walked, never spoken, never breathed.

Elric and Marla fell backward, the wave of nothing passing over them like fire without heat.

And then...

Stillness.

Later, outside the Loom, Elric knelt in the dust.

Marla stood beside him, eyes hollow.

“He’s gone,” she said.

“No,” Elric said. “He’s free.”

She looked at him. “Is it over?”

Elric looked toward the horizon, where threads still shimmered faintly in the sky.

“Not over,” he said. “But the gate is sealed. For now.”

They turned. They walked.

And behind them, in the silence, the world began to remember how to forget.


The plain beyond the Loom was not the same as the one they had crossed before. It pulsed subtly beneath their feet, the ground no longer entirely solid but softened by the aftermath of Elias’s severance. The air shimmered where he had once stood, like a memory that refused to fade. Marla walked in silence, one hand closed tightly around a strip of cloth that had belonged to Elias—his wrist binding, charred at the edges where the unthreading had begun.

Elric carried no keepsake. There was no ritual he could perform, no words sacred enough to name what Elias had become. He had walked willingly into myth, into sacrifice not just of life but of history. A complete erasure. And yet, the hollow inside Elric’s chest bore his absence more sharply than any death he had ever witnessed. It was a wound that couldn’t be sutured by time or magic.

They crested a low hill and paused. The sky above them churned, not with weather, but with shifting memory—ribbons of vapor flickering with half-seen places, faces, symbols. Marla tilted her head.

“Something’s still wrong,” she said.

Elric didn’t answer immediately. He watched the sky with narrowed eyes, then drew a small brass disc from his coat pocket and held it aloft. The surface remained dull and inert.

“No resonance,” he muttered.

“Isn’t that good?”

“It should be. The disc listens to names. After the severance, it should be still. But it’s not silent. It’s deaf.”

Marla frowned. “What’s the difference?”

“If the world were healing, the disc would hear peace. The names would settle. But this—” He turned slowly, scanning the landscape. “This feels like something absorbed the severance.”

Marla stiffened. “You’re saying Elias didn’t destroy the thread… just passed it along?”

“Not him,” Elric said. “Something else took it. Consumed what he gave up.”

She stepped away from him, face tightening. “Then it isn’t over.”

“No,” he said, voice low. “It’s changed form.”

They descended into a narrow valley filled with bones—clean, white, and ancient. Not all were human. Some were twisted in ways that made no sense: spines with extra ribs, skulls with too many eye sockets, femurs fused into crescents. Marla stepped carefully between them, avoiding eye contact with the larger remains.

“What happened here?” she whispered.

“The place remembers,” Elric said. “This is what’s left when a name is eaten, but the shape remains. Something once walked here that took more than life—it took definition.”

They crossed into the shadow of a ruined arch. Faint etchings lined the keystone—glyphs that shimmered when touched by breath. Marla traced one, then recoiled.

“I know this symbol,” she said. “It’s a voidcall.”

Elric knelt and examined the base of the arch. There, carved in tighter, more desperate strokes, was a long sequence of sigils—uncurled, defensive, meant to trap rather than summon. He recognized the structure immediately.

“A sealing script,” he said grimly. “Old Covenant design. They tried to contain whatever this place became.”

Marla's voice dropped. “And failed.”

The disc in Elric’s palm began to warm. Slowly, painfully.

Marla glanced at it. “You said it was deaf.”

“I thought it was. But maybe it was only waiting.”

A low vibration rumbled through the valley. Bones clattered against each other, echoing like a chorus of hollow chimes. The air tasted of metal. Then, from beneath the dust and bone, a voice rose—not spoken, not heard, but felt, the way one feels the approach of a thunderclap in the gut.

He fed us unknowing. We drink the name beneath the name.

Elric dropped the disc. It clattered on the stone, split, and bled black smoke. Marla backed away from the arch, her hand at her belt where her runes were etched in ink along lengths of cloth, ready to cast.

The air in the center of the valley warped, folding like paper. Something emerged—a shape that flickered at the edge of perception. Its outline shifted as it moved: first man, then spire, then serpent, then silence. It did not walk. It arrived.

“I know you,” Elric said, breath catching. “You were sealed in the Knot.”

It did not respond directly. The shape twisted again, resolving into the suggestion of a face—blank, eyeless, lips sealed with gold thread. It raised one hand.

Behind them, the arch snapped in two.

Names make the gate. But broken names make the key.

“Elias gave himself freely,” Marla said. “He closed the passage.”

And the door took its shape. We are now the lock.

Elric stepped forward, pulling the severing blade from his belt. “Then we cut the key from the lock.”

The air shrieked. The being expanded, threads of itself unraveling like wings made of absence. A single thread shot toward Elric, slicing through the space between them. He parried, barely, the impact throwing him backward into the bone-field.

Marla shouted a glyph and threw a ribbon forward. It struck the figure and exploded in violet flame. For a moment, the shape scattered—dispersed like fog. But it reformed almost instantly, stronger now, its limbs too long, its shape pressing against the limits of the world.

“This thing is bound to the Loom now!” Marla cried. “It didn’t die—it became the Loom’s memory! A new thread tied to the Weaver itself!”

“Then we burn the memory,” Elric said, pushing to his feet. “Not the thread.”

He stabbed the blade into the ground. The soil cracked. Light bled from the fissures—not bright, but clean. Not magic, but intent. His name—the one he had buried, broken, and refused to claim—rose from the blade’s point like a smoke made of letters.

The creature paused.

“You want to consume names,” Elric growled, “then take mine. Take it whole.”

He shouted the name aloud.

Not Elric.

Not Varn.

But the one from before: Tarellos.

The true name.

The creature rushed forward.

Elric stood firm.

Marla added her voice to the air—not her true name, but her defiant one, the name she had made for herself when she’d first burned a forbidden glyph into her palm at age thirteen.

Together, their words struck the creature like lashes.

It howled in no language, unraveling not from force, but from contradiction.

Elias’s sacrifice had left a void. But Elric’s name—Tarellos—filled it. Not as a vessel. Not as a seal. But as an identity chosen.

Names had power.

But will gave them shape.

The creature shattered.

It fell not in pieces, but in concept, breaking across time and memory like a shattered oath. The air cleared. The bones lay still.

Elric dropped to one knee. The blade pulsed once, then dulled.

Marla knelt beside him.

“You gave it back,” she said.

“My name?”

“No,” she said. “Yourself.”

He looked up at her.

“Is it done?” she asked.

He listened. Felt. The thread was quiet.

“Yes,” he said softly. “Now, it’s done.”

And the wind, for the first time in what felt like years, carried no names at all.

Chapter Six: What the Thread Forgot

The wind that followed had no voice. It stirred no memories, carried no whispers. It simply moved, like it had before names were ever spoken, before stories were born to hold meaning. Elric stood at the edge of the valley where the unthreaded had gathered, his boots pressed into bone-dusted soil, and let the stillness wrap around him like a shroud that did not suffocate. Marla stood beside him, her cloak torn at the hem, a thin sheen of ash clinging to her skin. She had not spoken since the creature's collapse. Not because she lacked words, but because she seemed to sense that speech might reawaken something that had finally gone to rest.

They made no camp that night. There was no night to speak of, not here. The land beyond the broken arch had been changed, as though the act of naming, un-naming, and re-naming had folded the landscape into a soft, permanent twilight. Time bled slowly here, indistinct, like ink soaking into wet cloth. Days passed, or perhaps only hours. Marla once asked what the date was, and Elric had laughed—not bitterly, just as a man who had finally found humor in the fact that he no longer needed to know.

They walked.

Through forestless expanses, across silver plains where the ground glittered with ancient dust that pulsed faintly in their footprints. Sometimes they passed ruins, but not of buildings or settlements—ruins of thought, old ideas left behind in physical form: a stairway that ended in the sky; a table set for four where no one had ever eaten; a mirror that only reflected what you feared you had once become.

They stopped once, in a clearing of monoliths. Each stone bore a name in a language neither of them recognized. When Elric reached out to touch one, it warmed beneath his fingers, and a voice said softly, “Do not be afraid to forget.”

He drew his hand back, fingers trembling.

“Is that what this place is?” Marla asked, stepping carefully between the monoliths. “A cemetery of forgotten truths?”

“No,” Elric said. “This is what’s left when truths are no longer needed.”

Marla turned to him. “Then what are we still doing here?”

He didn’t answer, because he didn’t know. Or maybe he did, and the answer was too large to hold in words. He had once feared blood because of what it revealed—because in blood was lineage, memory, the weight of inheritance. But now he feared forgetting more. There had to be something beyond this unthreaded quiet, something waiting past the silence.

They crested a ridge on what may have been the sixth or seventh day and found a structure unlike any they’d encountered.

It wasn’t ancient. It wasn’t crumbling. It was being built, slowly, strand by strand, thread by careful thread. But no hands worked it. The material wove itself—impossibly fine fibers that danced in patterns only half-seen. At the structure’s center stood a tall frame, empty save for one suspended thread that shimmered gold in the quiet light.

Elric stepped forward.

Marla followed, eyes narrowed. “This isn’t part of the Loom.”

“No,” Elric said. “This is new.”

He reached out, slowly, toward the gold thread, and it pulsed. A whisper brushed against his ear, delicate and bright:

You may begin again.

Marla turned sharply. “That voice—was it Elias?”

Elric nodded, not trusting his voice.

She reached forward as well. The thread flickered, then split into two, hovering like strands of a lyre, vibrating gently in time with their breaths.

“It’s a loom,” she said. “But it’s not for names.”

Elric’s mouth was dry. “It’s for stories.”

They stood together, their fingers nearly touching the threads. He had expected a choice. Some riddle. A final severance. But there was only invitation. Not to end something, but to start something else.

“I’m not a warlock anymore,” he said.

“No,” Marla replied. “You’re a weaver.”

He looked at her—really looked. The dirt under her nails, the fresh scar across her cheek, the steady fire still alive behind her eyes despite everything they had seen. She would not run from power the way he had. She had walked beside it, learned its voice, and never let it consume her.

“You should thread the first line,” he said.

She hesitated. “What if I ruin it?”

“You won’t,” he said. “You’re too stubborn to ruin anything.”

She smirked faintly, then stepped forward.

Marla took the gold thread between her fingers and pulled gently.

A single spark lit the air.

The thread sang.

And a story began.

They built a life in the unnamed land, not because they were trapped, but because they had nowhere else left to go. Others came, drawn by echoes that shouldn’t have existed—wanderers, broken spellbinders, oathless witches, nameless children. Some came with fragments of stories; others arrived as blank pages, waiting for something to be written across them.

Marla kept the loom alive. She tended it like a garden, coaxing new strands to form from the air, shaping tales not of power or conquest but of survival, of becoming. She taught others to weave—not spells, not bindings, but narratives, self-made and honest. She called it the Circle of the First Telling.

Elric grew older. His hands ached when the seasons shifted, though there were no true seasons in that place. He taught the children how to read the old glyphs, not to use them, but to understand what had been buried beneath their power. He still carried the severing blade, dulled now, used only to carve patterns into wood.

Once, years later, a girl asked him what a name was for.

He answered without thinking.

“To hold the story, but not to end it.”

And that night, beneath a sky that finally showed stars again, he dreamed of Elias.

The boy stood beside the gold thread, watching it spin.

“You did it,” Elric whispered.

Elias smiled, but did not speak.

He didn’t need to.

The thread sang on.

As the years passed, the land itself began to remember—not the fractured echoes of magic gone wrong, but the calm recollection of a place learning to be again. What had once been threadless void now bore texture: meadows of pale grass that sang softly when wind passed through, stone groves where stories were carved not in words but in woven patterns only the fingertips could read, pools of still water where the moon’s reflection always appeared, no matter the time of day.

The settlement that grew around the Loom had no walls. It needed none. Its people came not in fear, but in seeking. There were no kings, no councils, no formal rites. Instead, there were tellings—shared each dusk in a circle around the hearth they built from sunstone and sand-glass. People came forward, one by one, and spoke their names not as declarations of lineage, but as choices. They told what they had been called, what they had survived, what they wished to become.

Marla presided over these evenings with quiet grace. She had grown, not in power, but in shape. She moved with the ease of one no longer fighting the world’s rhythm, but dancing with it. Her threads were no longer woven only in gold. She experimented with twilight hues, bone-white strands, and even silence, creating tapestries that shimmered with half-truth and dream logic. She called them memory-cloths, and hung them across the outer stones of the Loom.

Elric watched all this with quiet satisfaction. He did not speak at every gathering. When he did, his words came with weight—not authority, but lived texture. The children called him the Threadfather, a name he pretended to grumble at, but never corrected. They asked him questions he didn’t always have answers for. Why some stars flickered and others did not. Why birds sometimes circled in threes. Whether a story could die if no one remembered it.

He answered the last one with a firm no.

“A story only ends,” he told them, “when the telling ends.”

He taught them how to mend with words, not just cloth. How to repair the story of a friend who had forgotten how to hope. How to listen to the things a silence was trying to say. In time, they began composing soft spells—woven declarations that didn’t compel or command, but invited. An old woman once wept for three hours after hearing a boy’s soft spell that asked her to dream again.

Still, not all days were gentle.

Some nights the wind returned with a bite, bringing with it shadows shaped like questions long ignored. The Loom would hum unevenly. Threads would tangle. Once, a storm tore through the grasslands and left behind a single silver thorn rooted in the earth where nothing should have grown.

Marla examined it, studied its resonance, and bound it into a new kind of thread—one that carried warning without weight. She called it a threshold thread, and placed one at each approach to the Loom, not to repel, but to prepare.

Elric felt the old names stir on those nights. The ones he’d cast off, the ones he’d severed. They never came close, but they circled. They watched. He carried the blade still, now worn to the hilt and dulled to uselessness. He kept it not as a weapon, but as a reminder: that cutting a thread was the last answer, never the first.

Sometimes he saw Elias in dreams, unchanged, watching from the edge of the Loom’s light. Never speaking. Always smiling. One night, Elric walked out into the meadow and stood beneath the stars.

“I know you’re not gone,” he said softly. “But I don’t need you to return. I just want you to know... we kept weaving.”

There was no answer.

But a breeze stirred the grass in reply.

The boy who would become the next weaver arrived in the seventh year of the Loom’s settlement. He was no older than nine, barefoot, eyes sharp, and lips stained with ink. No one saw him arrive. He was simply there, sitting on one of the outer stones, watching as Marla threaded the frame with a dusk-colored strand.

Elric found him curious but not unnerving. He had learned long ago that the world made its own invitations.

“What’s your name?” he asked the boy gently.

“I haven’t chosen yet,” the boy replied. “But I know yours.”

Elric raised an eyebrow. “Do you?”

The boy nodded. “Tarellos. That was the name you buried. But now you walk in it.”

Elric took a slow breath. “You’re from beyond the Gate.”

“I’m not from anywhere,” the boy said. “I’m just... arriving.”

Marla joined them. She crouched to meet the boy’s eyes and asked, “Why have you come?”

“To give something back,” he replied, pulling a small woven shape from his pocket—a thread figure, coiled tightly in the form of a spiral. Its color shifted as they watched: gold, then gray, then red.

Marla reached for it, but paused. “What is it?”

The boy looked at Elric. “It’s the knot. The last one.”

Elric’s hand moved instinctively to the old scar at his chest.

“It’s not dangerous anymore,” the boy said. “It just wants to rest.”

They took the knot.

Together, Elric and Marla wove it into the Loom—not at the center, but at its edge. Not as a core, but as a memory. It became a small pattern in the greater whole, part of the telling, no longer a threat, but a footnote. A beginning.

That night, the Loom hummed softly. And in the wind, a new thread grew.

It glowed not with prophecy, not with silence, but with possibility.

Elric sat beside the loom, watching the stars.

No fear in his blood.

Only quiet.

And hope.

Chapter Seven: The Thread Beyond the Map

The morning came like a breath held too long—slow, hesitant, but unmistakably new. Pale light crept over the soft ridges beyond the Loom’s outer stones, glancing across the settlement in ribbons of warmth that carried no urgency. The world here had learned patience. The trees did not grow taller for it, nor did the sky press any harder on their heads. It was simply morning, and that was enough.

Elric rose before most others. His joints creaked as they always did, but the ache felt earned. A stiffness he had not yet grown tired of. He took his usual path along the eastern edge, where the threads of yesterday's tellings were still soft in the air. He liked to feel them before they hardened into memory. There was something sacred in the way stories still shimmered before setting.

At the edge of the field sat the boy again—the one who had brought the final knot. He was older now, though only by months, and still unclaimed by name. The settlement had learned not to ask, not to press. Some people carried their stories tightly wound, and the Loom, in its own way, respected that.

The boy turned when Elric approached.

“I dreamed of rivers last night,” he said.

“Were they running forward or back?” Elric asked.

The boy shrugged. “They didn’t care.”

Elric chuckled and lowered himself to sit beside him. “That’s a good answer.”

They sat in companionable silence for a while. The grass stirred gently around them, tickled by wind and thread-light.

“I want to ask you something,” the boy said.

“Go on.”

“When you were unthreaded, before the Knot was cut—what did it feel like?”

Elric didn’t answer at first. The question wasn’t new. Others had asked in more cautious terms. But this boy asked without fear. And that made the answer more important.

“It felt like standing in a house made of your own memories,” he said slowly. “And then watching the roof cave in, and knowing you laid the beams yourself. It wasn’t pain. It was... revelation. I saw the lie I’d built around my fear. And the moment I let that go, I saw what was underneath.”

“And what was it?”

Elric looked at the horizon. “A child afraid of who he might become.”

The boy nodded. “That’s what I thought.”

He rose, brushing dust from his knees. “I’m going to the far ridge. They say it hasn’t been mapped.”

Elric raised an eyebrow. “That’s true. We stopped drawing maps after the fourth year.”

“Why?”

“Because we didn’t want to define everything. Some things are better discovered than described.”

The boy grinned. “Then I’m going to go discover something.”

Elric watched him go, the threads in the grass parting slightly as the boy moved. He walked as if he’d always known the path.

That evening, Marla sat before the Loom, weaving a ribbon of deep blue. It glimmered with starlight and river glyphs, shaped by her hands into a long, undulating line. A narrative of something not yet lived.

Elric approached and watched silently.

“Ridge-walker thread,” she said without turning.

“He told you?”

“He told the Loom.”

Elric sat beside her, watching her fingers work. “He asked me what it felt like. The Knot.”

Marla nodded. “He’ll be tested.”

“We all are.”

She glanced at him. “Not like him.”

The thread pulsed slightly beneath her hands.

“Do you think it’ll return?” she asked.

He knew what she meant. Not the boy. Not the past.

It. The presence behind the threads. The hunger that had once tried to wear names like cloaks. The thing Elias had severed and that they had woven into a footnote.

Elric considered.

“No. Not the same way. It knows this place now. It understands we’re not afraid of names anymore.”

Marla tightened a knot. “But fear isn’t the only way it grows.”

“No,” Elric said. “Sometimes it grows in comfort. In the slow return of assumption. Of forgetting why the thread was ever frayed.”

Marla’s fingers paused. “Then we must remember.”

He smiled. “That’s why we keep telling.”

They worked together in silence for a time, the ribbon weaving itself into a spiral at the edge of the loom.

The boy did not return that night, nor the next. A few of the newer settlers grew worried, but none acted. The rules here were not built on urgency. People returned when the thread allowed.

On the third day, Elric climbed the ridge himself. The journey was not long, but it was steep. His breath came harder now, but he welcomed it. The sky above him opened as he crested the hill, and there—on the far side—he found the boy, sitting with his legs dangling over the edge of the world.

Below stretched a vast field of light. Not grass. Not stone. A landscape composed entirely of threads, glistening and immense, layered upon one another in chaotic elegance. They moved slowly, like rivers, weaving themselves without hands.

The boy looked back. “It’s a place that’s still telling itself.”

Elric joined him. “A new loom.”

“No frame, though,” the boy said. “No center. Just thread.”

“That’s how the first stories were told,” Elric said. “Without edge. Without end.”

“I think I want to stay here,” the boy said. “Not forever. But for now.”

Elric nodded. “When you're ready to return, bring a thread back. One no one's heard before.”

“I will.”

They sat together for a long time, watching the landscape shift.

Before Elric left, the boy spoke once more.

“I think I know my name.”

Elric turned.

“But I won’t speak it yet,” the boy said. “I’m still choosing what story it deserves.”

And Elric, heart steady, eyes full, replied, “Take all the time you need.”

And so the thread moved forward, unwritten. Unbound.

Unafraid.

The boy stayed at the ridge for seven more days.

Each day he awoke with the hum of the unmapped threads in his bones, and each night he slept beneath stars that flickered in rhythms he swore were not random. He did not weave. He did not record. He only watched. The threads below moved in silence, their convergence and dispersal reminding him of breath, of the heartbeat of something vast and dreaming.

On the eighth day, he finally rose.

Not because he was finished—he wasn’t sure one could ever be finished in a place like this—but because he felt a pull, not physical, not urgent, but insistent. A call not to act, but to return. And more than that, to rejoin. He began the walk back with slow, deliberate steps, humming a tune without melody. The earth seemed to steady beneath him, as if glad for his decision.

By the time he reached the Loom, dusk had claimed the day.

Elric was already waiting, seated on the lower edge of the stone platform, carving a new spindle with a small obsidian knife. The man’s beard had grown longer. He looked more like a hill than a man—quiet, unmoving, patient. He looked up only when the boy’s shadow fell across his feet.

“You saw the field,” Elric said, not as a question, but as acknowledgment.

The boy nodded.

“And?”

“I understand now why we don’t draw maps.”

Elric chuckled softly. “Sometimes knowing the shape of a place ruins what it can become.”

The boy sat. He held a small object in his hand—an irregularly woven ring made of pale, whisper-thin thread. He handed it to Elric, who examined it with reverence.

“It’s not a beginning or an end,” the boy said. “It’s just a part.”

Elric ran a finger across the weave. “Good. Stories are made of pieces, not conclusions.”

The boy looked toward the horizon. “I still haven’t chosen.”

Elric nodded. “Names aren’t doors. They’re windows. Wait until you like the view.”

From the far side of the Loom, Marla approached. Her sleeves were rolled to her elbows, her hands stained with thread ink. A group of children trailed behind her, giggling and shushing one another. When they saw the boy had returned, they paused, hesitant. Something about his presence felt different. As though he had returned with something invisible, yet unmistakably carried.

Marla caught Elric’s gaze. “He brought it back.”

“He did,” Elric said.

The boy stood. He turned to face the circle of gathered children, who now watched him with wide eyes. One stepped forward—a girl with short hair and green paint smeared across her cheeks.

“Did you find a story out there?” she asked.

The boy nodded.

“Can you tell it?”

The boy was silent for a long time. Then he looked to Elric, who offered only a slight smile, and to Marla, who said nothing but held his gaze with steady warmth.

Finally, the boy spoke.

“It begins with a name no one says anymore. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s tired. It rests now. And in its place, there are voices—many of them. They walk on threads that have no end, and their footsteps make stories. Not big ones. Small ones. Ones you can tuck in your sleeve. Or keep in your shoe.”

He paused.

“And it’s about someone who went looking for silence but found a loom. Not to record what had happened—but to choose what came next.”

The children leaned in, quiet as morning.

“And?”

The boy smiled.

“And it never ends. Not because no one finishes it, but because someone is always beginning.”

There was no applause. No grand reaction. Only breath. Only stillness. And the certainty that something had changed—not loudly, not dramatically, but truthfully.

Later that night, Elric sat beside the Loom alone, watching the newest threads glow with gentle pulses of soft green and dusklight gold. The spindle he had carved now held the boy’s woven ring. It hung beside other tokens—ribbons of early settlers, cloth-wrapped stories, fragments of bone etched with laughter.

He ran his fingers along each one and whispered their beginnings. He didn’t need to remember the ends.

Behind him, Marla joined him with two cups of steamleaf tea. She handed him one, then sat cross-legged, facing the loom.

“He’s ready,” she said.

Elric nodded. “He’s always been.”

“And you?” she asked.

Elric sipped his tea, the steam curling past his beard. “I was only ever waiting for someone to walk farther than I did.”

They sat in silence.

Above them, the stars blinked in new constellations. The threads of the Loom swayed gently in the wind. And somewhere at the edge of the mapless field, another story began—unwitnessed, unnamed, but no less real.

Because stories, like threads, do not need watchers to exist.

They only need to be woven.

In the weeks that followed the boy’s return, something subtle changed across the settlement—something not spoken aloud, but understood in the cadence of footsteps, the tone of dusk gatherings, the way people paused when standing before the Loom. There was an air of readiness. Not in the sense of preparing for hardship or defense, but of acceptance. As though the act of choosing stories over fear had finally taken root deep enough to grow its own momentum.

The Loom continued its work, threads weaving not just in response to the hands of its keepers, but sometimes unbidden—threads that hummed themselves into being in the stillest hours, when even the wind slept. Marla once found an entire story etched in pale silver across the north side of the structure, with no memory of having woven it. She ran her fingers along its curve, found it whispered her name in a tone she didn’t recognize, and smiled.

“Even the Loom dreams now,” she said.

Elric stood nearby, watching her as he had for years now—not with the gaze of an overseer or teacher, but as one who has become a witness to something that no longer needs his guidance to flourish.

“The dreamers have caught up to the telling,” he replied.

A new weaving was underway that day. Not for protection, not for ritual. It was simply a story about a storm that had once passed over a laughing house—an invented tale, a parable with no purpose but beauty. A young girl named Renna had asked to weave it, and her fingers moved with the tentative grace of someone not yet sure whether her story would be welcome. But the thread bent to her, soft and responsive, as if it had been waiting all along.

Marla watched her. “She reminds me of me.”

Elric smiled. “You’ve become a mirror.”

“Better than a blade.”

He said nothing, but his eyes flicked briefly to the worn hilt that still rested at the base of the Loom. Not to be used, only remembered.

Later that night, Elric walked alone to the old perimeter stones—the ones placed in the early days when they still feared what might follow. The wind was colder out here, touched by the broader stillness of the wider world. He often came to listen, not for danger, but for absence. For the assurance that silence had remained silence.

This night, however, he heard something new.

A thread, faint, singing in a register that only someone who had once known its opposite could truly perceive. It came from beyond the ridge—not the same one the boy had walked, but a further curve, past even the newest settlers’ paths. A place that, for all their freedom, no one had yet felt called to approach.

The sound was not ominous. It was tender. An invitation, not a summons.

Still, Elric hesitated.

He turned back toward the Loom, saw its light pulsing in gentle rhythm, and made a choice.

In the morning, he packed.

Marla met him at the edge of the settlement as he fastened his cloak.

“You’re leaving,” she said.

He nodded. “Not away. Just outward.”

“You know there’s nothing you have to fix anymore.”

“I’m not going to fix,” he replied. “I’m going to listen.”

She pressed something into his hand: a ribbon, tightly coiled, threaded with colors he didn’t recognize.

“What is it?”

“A story you haven’t heard yet,” she said. “For company.”

He tucked it into his coat, smiled.

“You’ll come back?” she asked.

Elric looked to the horizon. “Maybe. But whether I do or not, this will keep weaving.”

She watched him leave, a slow figure moving into the threadless edge. Behind him, the settlement breathed. The Loom shone. Children ran between lines of new tapestries. Stories were spoken beneath the wide sky.

And in every whisper of wind, in the hush of evening light, there was no fear of blood, no shadow of the Knot, no echo of the old hunger—only the quiet promise of a world still being written.

Elric walked on, alone but not lonely, into a place unmapped.

Where even his name had become, at last, simply one thread among many.

Elric's journey beyond the known edge was unlike any he had undertaken before. In his youth, he had walked for necessity—fleeing, hunting, seeking. Later, he had walked for ritual, for answers, for unmaking. But this time, he walked simply to be present, to find what waited when there was nothing left to solve.

The landscape shifted subtly as he moved farther from the Loom. The land had not become hostile, but it had become curious. The grass grew taller and stranger, rising in elegant spirals that unraveled when stepped through, leaving no trace behind. Trees bore fruit in the shape of letters—soft husks that fell open to reveal empty parchment that sometimes filled itself with words as he passed.

By the third day, he found a river.

It flowed not with water, but with a kind of liquid thread—thin strands, glimmering with pale light, weaving in a braided current that split around the stones and rejoined downstream without ever tangling. Elric sat by the edge, watching it for a long time. He dipped his hand in once, and though it did not wet his skin, he felt something pass into him—a calmness, yes, but layered with something more elusive. The sense that someone had passed this way before.

He camped beside the river and dreamt of faces he could no longer name. Not nightmares, not even memories. Just expressions, drifting past in the dark.

In the morning, he walked upstream.

On the fifth day, the sky changed.

It no longer followed day or night. Instead, it pulsed in long gradients of color—first ochre, then a deep lavender, then a shade of blue so faint it seemed more imagined than real. The ground became less defined, more like pages left blank on purpose. Elric found that he left no footprints anymore. His breath made no mist. He was not fading, but he was fitting—being allowed, rather than carving his space.

And that was when he found the door.

It stood in the middle of an open field, unconnected to any structure. Just a simple wooden frame, carved with unfamiliar glyphs that shimmered when he blinked. There was no handle. No hinge. Just a plane of woven light stretched taut within the frame like fabric.

He stood before it for a long time.

Then he opened the ribbon Marla had given him.

Unwinding it slowly, he saw that it held no picture, no phrase, no narrative he could decipher. Just color, gradient, motion—a story told in breath and absence. He held it to his chest.

And the door opened.

Inside was not another room.

It was a version of the Loom—but different. Taller. Still forming. Not the product of hands, but of memory. It grew and unraveled at once, threads reaching both downward and outward, into places unnamed. A hum filled the air, but it was no longer the gentle song of weaving. It was a chord—long, continuous, unresolved.

At the center stood a figure.

He recognized it instantly.

Not for its appearance, which shifted with each breath, but for its stillness. Its clarity. It was Elias.

Not a boy.

Not entirely human.

A shape of will and sacrifice, drawn back into being by the echo of a life once surrendered.

“You made it,” Elias said.

Elric’s throat tightened. “Is this… you?”

“Yes. And no,” Elias replied. “It’s what was left. The silence that didn’t die when I did.”

Elric stepped forward slowly. “Why show yourself now?”

“Because the world is ready again,” Elias said. “The story no longer needs endings. It needs weavers.”

He gestured to the forming Loom. “This place isn’t memory. It’s a model. A rehearsal for the next world.”

Elric looked around. “So what do I do?”

“You add your thread,” Elias said. “Not as penance. Not to fix. But to join.”

Elric took the ribbon from his coat and held it out.

Elias smiled, and the room filled with golden wind.

Together, they wove it in.

And the chord resolved.

Not with finality.

But with welcome.

Back in the Loom settlement, Marla stood at the edge of the circle, eyes fixed on the horizon. She had not seen him return, but she felt the thread complete itself.

She smiled, took up her spindle, and began weaving a new story.

A story that did not begin with blood.

But with arrival.

Chapter Eight: The Thread That Remembers

It began with footsteps. Not heavy. Not hurried. Just steady—pressing softly into the loam at the edge of the Loom settlement where no path had been laid, only walked. A dozen figures came, cloaked in traveling garb stitched with unfamiliar patterns. They moved like those who had walked far without fear, but not without purpose. At their head was a woman with hair the color of weathered parchment and eyes that saw too much and named too little.

Marla was the first to meet them.

She stood beneath the northern arch, arms folded, a length of dusk-thread still looped around her forearm. The wind carried the scent of river pollen and chalkfire blossoms, both in bloom. When the woman at the head of the travelers saw Marla, she stopped and offered no greeting—only a brief, silent gesture. A palm to the chest. A finger to the lips. Then down.

Marla returned it.

The others behind the woman bowed their heads slightly and waited.

“You’ve come from the edge?” Marla asked, already sensing the answer.

The woman nodded. “From beyond it. We followed a path written in storylight. One that only appeared once we chose not to record it.”

Marla’s eyes narrowed. “That means you’re Threadbound.”

“No,” the woman said calmly. “We were. Now we are Threadfree.”

The word hadn’t been spoken aloud before, at least not here. It rippled across the woven structures like a breath caught between two thoughts. Behind Marla, the Loom shimmered slightly, as if adjusting itself in response.

“You’ve remembered something,” Marla said.

“We’ve remembered enough,” the woman replied.

Marla gestured them forward. “Then tell it.”

The gathering that night was unlike any the settlement had seen in years. The central circle brimmed with newcomers and longtime weavers alike, seated among lines of hanging threads and fire-glass bowls filled with glowing coals. Children pressed in with wide eyes. Elders leaned close, not with suspicion, but with a hunger that only long peace can bring—hunger not for conflict, but for new meaning.

The Threadfree woman—who later gave her name as Eriven—stood at the center. She held no tool, no blade, no loomstick. She simply spoke.

“There is a place beyond the edge of forgetting,” she said, “where old names gather not to return, but to observe. Where the echoes of unmade stories drift and seed themselves, hoping to become something again. We reached it by following the noise of silence. And we did not find an enemy. We found a choice.”

Marla stepped forward from the circle. “What choice?”

“To keep telling only stories of peace,” Eriven said, “or to let the stories remember their scars.”

A stillness fell over the firelight.

Elric, seated now with a cane of redwood and a spindle tucked beneath one arm, raised his head. “Scars don’t undo healing. They define where it started.”

Eriven turned to him. “Then it’s time we let the Loom weave them.”

She opened her satchel and withdrew a thread unlike any they had seen. It was black—but not void-black. It shimmered with depth, with contour. It was shadow woven not from absence but from understanding.

She laid it across the Loom’s edge.

Marla stepped forward and touched it. Her breath caught. The thread thrummed softly, and in that sound she heard the memory of the Hollow, the shriek of names unspoken, the moment Elias vanished into light.

She did not pull away.

Elric stood, slowly.

“This is memorythread,” he said. “Raw. Untempered.”

“Yes,” Eriven replied. “But ready.”

He turned to Marla.

“We’ve been weaving futures,” he said. “Now we need to let the past speak again.”

And so, for the first time since the severing of the Knot, the Loom shifted not only forward but backward. Weavers from both the settlement and the Threadfree took up the new strand, joining it with gentleness. They didn’t pull it into dominance. They let it braid itself alongside the golds and greens and riverlight blues, finding its place not as wound, but as witness.

That night, as the sky turned silver with early stars, a new tapestry emerged.

It bore no name.

But everyone who saw it recognized it.

The boy at the ridge saw it glowing from afar and smiled.

The days that followed saw a blending. The Threadfree taught the settlement how to walk backwards through memory without being trapped by it. They showed the art of echo-weaving—where a strand held not one meaning, but a chorus of old truths, layered and soft. In return, Marla taught them how to bind stories without sealing them, how to keep a narrative open like a window rather than closed like a vault.

And Elric?

Elric wove less.

He taught more.

He sat with weavers in training, showing them how to listen to the thread rather than impose on it. He taught that no story truly began in ink or cloth—it began when someone made space to hear it.

One afternoon, a young girl asked him if he ever missed his fear.

He smiled. “No,” he said. “Fear is a poor companion. But a very good teacher.”

She asked if that meant she should be afraid.

“Sometimes,” he said. “But never quietly.”

Years passed.

The Loom grew—not in size, but in memory. New arches were raised not for shelter, but for reflection. People came not only to weave, but to witness—to see what others had laid down, and to feel part of something larger than themselves.

The Loom never again unraveled.

But it continued to shift.

It remembered now.

And in that memory, it made room for everything the thread had once tried to forget.

The memorythread wove slowly. It did not move like the other strands—graceful and quick, fluid with joy or curiosity. It moved deliberately, as if testing the weight of each memory it carried before surrendering to the Loom. There were nights when it paused entirely, refusing to bend, and days when it surged with sudden clarity, demanding hands to shape it before its momentum faded. The weavers adapted. They learned to work with patience, to let the past speak in its own rhythm.

Marla became the thread’s interpreter.

It wasn’t a title she chose, but one that emerged from how people began to approach her. When the thread grew tangled or cold, she was the one they sought. Her fingers could coax it open like a locked door, revealing what lay inside without disturbing what it had meant. And she never rushed it. Sometimes she would sit for hours with a single loop between her fingers, eyes half-closed, listening with a stillness that came from years of learning when not to act.

One evening, as she unwound a knot too tight to see through, she found a symbol hidden deep in the fibers: a spiral pierced by a thorn.

Her breath caught.

She had seen that mark before.

“Elric,” she said the next morning, holding the thread between her palms, “the Hollow left something behind.”

He took it carefully, studying the mark in the light. “It’s not a threat,” he said slowly. “But it’s not done, either.”

Marla’s voice was quiet. “It’s a memory that wants to stay.”

Elric walked to the outer ridge of the Loom, where older threads were archived in spiral vaults—woven pockets suspended like stars just above the ground. He placed the memorythread inside the largest of them, the one they called The First Remembering. It was the place where Elias’s echo was strongest, where the original thread had been sealed not as a warning, but as a foundation.

“We can’t unmake what we’ve lived,” he said aloud, not to anyone in particular. “But we can learn how to hold it.”

A season turned.

Not in weather—seasons here did not follow temperature or moon—but in thread. The Loom began to produce more dawn-colored strands, pale oranges and translucent yellows. People laughed more during weaving, and the tellings around the hearth began to include songs again—verses reclaimed from old fragments, sung in rounds that seemed to harmonize with the very air.

During one such night, a new visitor arrived.

She was tall and thin, clad in gray traveling robes with no markings. Her face was ageless, not from youth, but from something beyond time’s reach. She did not speak at first, only stood at the edge of the firelight until Marla approached and offered her a cup of tea and a place by the coals.

“Are you a weaver?” Marla asked.

“No,” the woman said, voice low. “I am a Keeper.”

Marla frowned. “Of what?”

“Of the Unspun,” she replied.

The word carried weight.

Elric turned from his seat and stepped closer. “That’s a word I haven’t heard since the Diaphanous.”

The woman inclined her head. “Because the Diaphanous feared what could not be wound.”

Marla looked between them. “The Unspun?”

“Stories not yet told. Futures too fragile to name,” the Keeper said. “We gather them. Protect them. And now… we bring them to you.”

She reached into her robe and revealed a small orb wrapped in what looked like soft mist. It pulsed faintly with shifting colors, never the same for more than a moment.

“This contains a thread that must not be woven until the world forgets how to predict,” she said. “Will you guard it?”

Elric glanced at Marla.

She nodded.

“We will.”

The Keeper bowed once. “Then the Loom is complete.”

And she left.

In the days that followed, the orb was housed in the Loom’s heart—where no hand reached without reason, and no thread twisted without the story’s consent. It was called The Waiting Thread, and its presence changed things.

People grew quieter before they wove. More intentional. Less eager to fill space with story and more willing to let silence breathe first. Children stopped asking “what happens next?” and instead began asking “what wants to happen?”

The Loom listened.

And changed.

Some threads began to weave themselves in circles. Others grew into shapes that no one recognized—braids of possibility that shimmered without purpose. These were not discarded. They were honored. Placed near the orb in a circle of still-becoming.

And through it all, Elric watched.

His hands wove less now, his strength ebbing gently like a tide retreating with grace. But his eyes remained sharp, and his voice—when he chose to use it—still wove quiet understanding into the spaces between questions.

One night, he called Marla to the loom’s edge.

“It’s time,” he said simply.

She didn’t ask for what.

He handed her a thin thread—silver, old, nearly invisible.

“What is it?” she asked.

“The last of me,” he said.

Her fingers trembled.

“I don’t want to lose you,” she whispered.

“You won’t,” he said. “This thread isn’t for forgetting. It’s for remembering without repeating.”

She nodded.

Together, they wove it.

A single line at the edge of the Loom, just beneath the first story ever told.

It shimmered once, briefly, then quieted.

Elric sat down.

He closed his eyes.

And in the morning, his thread remained—warm, steady, unbroken.

Not an ending.

A memory.

Woven into the world.

The morning after Elric’s final thread was woven, the Loom glowed differently—not brighter, not louder, but deeper. The change was not visible to all. It did not sing to every weaver or shimmer under every palm. But those who had touched the Loom’s earliest threads, who had spoken the names of stories not to command but to remember, felt it resonate in their bones.

Elric was gone in the way that mattered most and least. His body, carefully wrapped in the robe he’d worn when he first arrived at the Loom, was laid not in the earth but in the center of the First Remembering. His spindle, worn smooth by time and the press of stories, was left beside him. Not as a grave marker—there were no graves here—but as a thread placed down, waiting to be picked up by someone ready to ask the right questions.

Marla did not speak at the ceremony. Instead, she wove.

With each pass of the thread, she offered no explanation. No titles. No declarations. Just rhythm. Movement. A silent acknowledgment of everything Elric had chosen not to carry forward, and everything he had chosen to leave behind.

When it was done, she stood, turned to the gathering, and said only, “The thread continues.”

And so it did.

In the months that followed, the Loom grew not in height or breadth, but in texture. New kinds of thread began to emerge—strands of windwoven clarity, of stone-bound resolve, of quiet, flickering intuition. Stories unfolded without shape for days, then suddenly bloomed whole in an instant, as though the threads had been waiting for the right breath to animate them.

Marla watched the settlement with eyes that had seen too many edges. She now wore her loomblade at her back—not to sever, but to carve space for silence where silence was needed. When new weavers came, she no longer instructed them. Instead, she offered them a question.

“What do you think the Loom is waiting for?”

Their answers varied. Some said truth. Others said laughter. A few said redemption.

Only one ever said you.

And that was the one she chose as her apprentice.

His name was Mier. Not given, but chosen. He was quiet in a way that wasn’t shy. He listened like someone who expected the world to answer if he waited long enough. Marla taught him not by lesson but by rhythm. She let him sit with her through unweavings—moments when stories needed to be undone, threads gently coaxed back into silence. She taught him how to let go, how to listen with his hands.

In time, he asked her the question that Elric had once feared.

“What do we do when the Loom tells a story we’re not ready to hear?”

Marla paused a long time.

Then she said, “We make ourselves ready.”

On the day the Loom began to shimmer with a new color—one that pulsed like a heartbeat but couldn’t be seen by the eye—an elder from the Threadfree returned. Eriven was slower now, but her eyes had lost none of their knowing. She came not with an offering, but with a warning.

“There is a pattern forming beyond the north winds,” she said. “A story too fast, too hungry.”

Marla took her hand. “You came because you want us to stop it?”

Eriven shook her head. “I came because I want to know if we should.”

Together, they walked to the First Remembering. They stood before the place where Elric’s thread had been woven. It was still steady. Still whole. But the edges around it had begun to ripple, as though the Loom were preparing to answer a question not yet asked.

Marla ran her fingers across the threads.

“I don’t feel danger,” she said.

“No,” Eriven agreed. “Only momentum.”

Then Mier arrived.

He stood beside them, eyes wide. In his hands was a ribbon he hadn’t woven, but found near the river—its color the same as Elric’s final thread, but speckled with black, like a sky just beginning to remember its stars.

“I think,” Mier said softly, “it’s a story that doesn’t know if it wants to be told.”

Marla reached out and touched the ribbon.

It trembled in her palm.

Then she smiled.

“Then we wait. Not to decide for it. But to make room when it does.”

They placed the ribbon in the Loom.

No one tried to weave it.

Not yet.

Because some stories only begin when the thread is ready to speak its own name.

Chapter Nine: The Name That Named Itself

The ribbon remained untouched for nine days.

In that time, the settlement adjusted around its presence—not with fear, but with a collective breath held in mutual respect. It hung within the Loom’s central chamber like a single note suspended in the middle of a song, waiting for a singer brave enough to join it. Children dared one another to stand near it with open palms; older weavers walked by it with a bowed head and a whisper they couldn’t quite explain.

Mier visited it every morning. He never tried to thread it, never spoke to it aloud, but always brought a small offering—a folded shape of fiber, a pebble from the river, once a feather marked with three silver lines. He placed each beneath the ribbon and left without ceremony. On the tenth day, when he approached with an empty hand, the ribbon twitched. A single twist, a gentle sway, then stilled.

He told no one.

Instead, he sat beside the thread for hours, letting the wind settle into the folds of his cloak, watching as the late-day light refracted across the Loom’s woven arches. He thought of Elric. Of how silence had been his teacher, and fear his first loom. Mier had no bloodline like Elric’s, no scarred memory of warlocks or hollow hunger, but he carried something else: a memory of choice.

That evening, the ribbon began to unravel itself.

No hand touched it. No blade cut it free. It simply unspooled, strand by strand, and folded itself into a spiral shape on the Loom’s lower rung. Marla was the first to notice. She came quietly, followed by Eriven and three younger weavers. They did not rush forward. They only watched.

“What’s it doing?” one of the children whispered.

Marla tilted her head. “Writing itself.”

The ribbon formed a loose glyph—circular, recursive, unfinished. Not a word. Not yet. But a gesture.

“It wants to speak,” Mier said.

Marla looked at him, saw the certainty in his eyes. “Then let it speak through you.”

He stepped forward slowly, knelt beside the glyph, and placed one hand at its center. The spiral warmed beneath his palm.

And then he saw it.

Not with his eyes.

But within.

He stood at the center of a place that wasn’t place—light curling around him in threads of thought. Stories passed him in loops, unfinished scenes stitched from forgot
