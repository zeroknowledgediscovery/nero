The dates of their writing are far apart, their       origins are various. None of them are connected directly with personal       experiences. In all of them the facts are inherently true, by which I mean       that they are not only possible but that they have actually happened. For       instance, the last story in the volume, the one I call Pathetic, whose       first title is Il Conde (misspelt by-the-by) is an almost verbatim       transcript of the tale told me by a very charming old gentleman whom I met       in Italy. I don&rsquo;t mean to say it is only that. Anybody can see that it is       something more than a verbatim report, but where he left off and where I       began must be left to the acute discrimination of the reader who may be       interested in the problem. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that the problem is worth       the trouble. What I am certain of, however, is that it is not to be       solved, for I am not at all clear about it myself by this time. All I can       say is that the personality of the narrator was extremely suggestive quite       apart from the story he was telling me. I heard a few years ago that he       had died far away from his beloved Naples where that &ldquo;abominable       adventure&rdquo; did really happen to him.     </p>     <p>       Thus the genealogy of Il Conde is simple. It is not the case with the       other stories. Various strains contributed to their composition, and the       nature of many of those I have forgotten, not having the habit of making       notes either before or after the fact. I mean the fact of writing a story.       What I remember best about Gaspar Ruiz is that it was written, or at any       rate begun, within a month of finishing Nostromo; but apart from the       locality, and that a pretty wide one (all the South American Continent),       the novel and the story have nothing in common, neither mood, nor       intention and, certainly, not the style. The manner for the most part is       that of General Santierra, and that old warrior, I note with satisfaction,       is very true to himself all through. Looking now dispassionately at the       various ways in which this story could have been presented I can&rsquo;t       honestly think the General superfluous. It is he, an old man talking of       the days of his youth, who characterizes the whole narrative and gives it       an air of actuality which I doubt whether I could have achieved without       his help. In the mere writing his existence of course was of no help at       all, because the whole thing had to be carefully kept within the frame of       his simple mind. But all this is but a laborious searching of memories. My       present feeling is that the story could not have been told otherwise. The       hint for Gaspar Ruiz the man I found in a book by Captain Basil Hall,       R.N., who was for some time, between the years 1824 and 1828, senior       officer of a small British Squadron on the West Coast of South America.       His book published in the thirties obtained a certain celebrity and I       suppose is to be found still in some libraries. The curious who may be       mistrusting my imagination are referred to that printed document, Vol. II,       I forget the page, but it is somewhere not far from the end. Another       document connected with this story is a letter of a biting and ironic kind       from a friend then in Burma, passing certain strictures upon &ldquo;the       gentleman with the gun on his back&rdquo; which I do not intend to make       accessible to the public. Yet the gun episode did really happen, or at       least I am bound to believe it because I remember it, described in an       extremely matter-of-fact tone, in some book I read in my boyhood; and I am       not going to discard the beliefs of my boyhood for anybody on earth.     </p>     <p>       The Brute, which is the only sea-story in the volume, is, like Il Conde,       associated with a direct narrative and based on a suggestion gathered on       warm human lips. I will not disclose the real name of the criminal ship       but the first I heard of her homicidal habits was from the late Captain       Blake, commanding a London ship in which I served in 1884 as Second       Officer. Captain Blake was, of all my commanders, the one I remember with       the greatest affection. I have sketched in his personality, without       however mentioning his name, in the first paper of The Mirror of the Sea.       In his young days he had had a personal experience of the brute and it is       perhaps for that reason that I have put the story into the mouth of a       young man and made of it what the reader will see. The existence of the       brute was a fact. The end of the brute as related in the story is also a       fact, well-known at the time though it really happened to another ship, of       great beauty of form and of blameless character, which certainly deserved       a better fate. I have unscrupulously adapted it to the needs of my story       thinking that I had there something in the nature of poetical justice. I       hope that little villainy will not cast a shadow upon the general honesty       of my proceedings as a writer of tales.     </p>     <p>       Of The Informer and An Anarchist I will say next to nothing. The pedigree       of these tales is hopelessly complicated and not worth disentangling at       this distance of time. I found them and here they are. The discriminating       reader will guess that I have found them within my mind; but how they or       their elements came in there I have forgotten for the most part; and for       the rest I really don&rsquo;t see why I should give myself away more than I have       done already.     </p>     <p>       It remains for me only now to mention The Duel, the longest story in the       book. That story attained the dignity of publication all by itself in a       small illustrated volume, under the title, &ldquo;The Point of Honour.&rdquo; That was       many years ago. It has been since reinstated in its proper place, which is       the place it occupies in this volume, in all the subsequent editions of my       work. Its pedigree is extremely simple. It springs from a ten-line       paragraph in a small provincial paper published in the South of France.       That paragraph, occasioned by a duel with a fatal ending between two       well-known Parisian personalities, referred for some reason or other to       the &ldquo;well-known fact&rdquo; of two officers in Napoleon&rsquo;s Grand Army having       fought a series of duels in the midst of great wars and on some futile       pretext. The pretext was never disclosed. I had therefore to invent it;       and I think that, given the character of the two officers which I had to       invent, too, I have made it sufficiently convincing by the mere force of       its absurdity. The truth is that in my mind the story is nothing but a       serious and even earnest attempt at a bit of historical fiction. I had       heard in my boyhood a good deal of the great Napoleonic legend. I had a       genuine feeling that I would find myself at home in it, and The Duel is       the result of that feeling, or, if the reader prefers, of that       presumption. Personally I have no qualms of conscience about this piece of       work. The story might have been better told of course. All one&rsquo;s work       might have been better done; but this is the sort of reflection a worker       must put aside courageously if he doesn&rsquo;t mean every one of his       conceptions to remain for ever a private vision, an evanescent reverie.       How many of those visions have I seen vanish in my time! This one,       however, has remained, a testimony, if you like, to my courage or a proof       of my rashness. What I care to remember best is the testimony of some       French readers who volunteered the opinion that in those hundred pages or       so I had managed to render &ldquo;wonderfully&rdquo; the spirit of the whole epoch.       Exaggeration of kindness no doubt; but even so I hug it still to my       breast, because in truth that is exactly what I was trying to capture in       my small net: the Spirit of the Epoch&mdash;never purely militarist in the       long clash of arms, youthful, almost childlike in its exaltation of       sentiment&mdash;naively heroic in its faith.     </p>     <p>       1920.

The names of a few leaders       alone survive the end of armed strife and are further preserved in       history; so that, vanishing from men&rsquo;s active memories, they still exist       in books.     </p>     <p>       The name of General Santierra attained that cold paper-and-ink       immortality. He was a South American of good family, and the books       published in his lifetime numbered him amongst the liberators of that       continent from the oppressive rule of Spain.     </p>     <p>       That long contest, waged for independence on one side and for dominion on       the other, developed in the course of years and the vicissitudes of       changing fortune the fierceness and inhumanity of a struggle for life. All       feelings of pity and compassion disappeared in the growth of political       hatred. And, as is usual in war, the mass of the people, who had the least       to gain by the issue, suffered most in their obscure persons and their       humble fortunes.     </p>     <p>       General Santierra began his service as lieutenant in the patriot army       raised and commanded by the famous San Martin, afterwards conqueror of       Lima and liberator of Peru. A great battle had just been fought on the       banks of the river Bio-Bio. Amongst the prisoners made upon the routed       Royalist troops there was a soldier called Gaspar Ruiz. His powerful build       and his big head rendered him remarkable amongst his fellow-captives. The       personality of the man was unmistakable. Some months before he had been       missed from the ranks of Republican troops after one of the many       skirmishes which preceded the great battle. And now, having been captured       arms in hand amongst Royalists, he could expect no other fate but to be       shot as a deserter.     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz, however, was not a deserter; his mind was hardly active       enough to take a discriminating view of the advantages or perils of       treachery. Why should he change sides? He had really been made a prisoner,       had suffered ill-usage and many privations. Neither side showed tenderness       to its adversaries. There came a day when he was ordered, together with       some other captured rebels, to march in the front rank of the Royal       troops. A musket had been thrust into his hands. He had taken it. He had       marched. He did not want to be killed with circumstances of peculiar       atrocity for refusing to march. He did not understand heroism but it was       his intention to throw his musket away at the first opportunity. Meantime       he had gone on loading and firing, from fear of having his brains blown       out at the first sign of unwillingness, by some non-commissioned officer       of the King of Spain. He tried to set forth these elementary       considerations before the sergeant of the guard set over him and some       twenty other such deserters, who had been condemned summarily to be shot.     </p>     <p>       It was in the quadrangle of the fort at the back of the batteries which       command the roadstead of Valparaiso. The officer who had identified him       had gone on without listening to his protestations. His doom was sealed;       his hands were tied very tightly together behind his back; his body was       sore all over from the many blows with sticks and butts of muskets which       had hurried him along on the painful road from the place of his capture to       the gate of the fort. This was the only kind of systematic attention the       prisoners had received from their escort during a four days&rsquo; journey       across a scantily watered tract of country. At the crossings of rare       streams they were permitted to quench their thirst by lapping hurriedly       like dogs. In the evening a few scraps of meat were thrown amongst them as       they dropped down dead-beat upon the stony ground of the halting-place.     </p>     <p>       As he stood in the courtyard of the castle in the early morning, after       having been driven hard all night, Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s throat was parched, and       his tongue felt very large and dry in his mouth.     </p>     <p>       And Gaspar Ruiz, besides being very thirsty, was stirred by a feeling of       sluggish anger, which he could not very well express, as though the vigour       of his spirit were by no means equal to the strength of his body.     </p>     <p>       The other prisoners in the batch of the condemned hung their heads,       looking obstinately on the ground. But Gaspar Ruiz kept on repeating:       &ldquo;What should I desert for to the Royalists? Why should I desert? Tell me,       Estaban!&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       He addressed himself to the sergeant, who happened to belong to the same       part of the country as himself. But the sergeant, after shrugging his       meagre shoulders once, paid no further attention to the deep murmuring       voice at his back. It was indeed strange that Gaspar Ruiz should desert.       His people were in too humble a station to feel much the disadvantages of       any form of government. There was no reason why Gaspar Ruiz should wish to       uphold in his own person the rule of the King of Spain. Neither had he       been anxious to exert himself for its subversion. He had joined the side       of Independence in an extremely reasonable and natural manner. A band of       patriots appeared one morning early, surrounding his father&rsquo;s ranche,       spearing the watch-dogs and ham-stringing a fat cow all in the twinkling       of an eye, to the cries of &ldquo;Viva la Libertad!&rdquo; Their officer discoursed of       Liberty with enthusiasm and eloquence after a long and refreshing sleep.       When they left in the evening, taking with them some of Ruiz, the       father&rsquo;s, best horses to replace their own lamed animals, Gaspar Ruiz went       away with them, having been invited pressingly to do so by the eloquent       officer.     </p>     <p>       Shortly afterwards a detachment of Royalist troops coming to pacify the       district, burnt the ranche, carried off the remaining horses and cattle,       and having thus deprived the old people of all their worldly possessions,       left them sitting under a bush in the enjoyment of the inestimable boon of       life.     </p>     <p>       II     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz, condemned to death as a deserter, was not thinking either of       his native place or of his parents, to whom he had been a good son on       account of the mildness of his character and the great strength of his       limbs. The practical advantage of this last was made still more valuable       to his father by his obedient disposition. Gaspar Ruiz had an acquiescent       soul.     </p>     <p>       But it was stirred now to a sort of dim revolt by his dislike to die the       death of a traitor. He was not a traitor. He said again to the sergeant:       &ldquo;You know I did not desert, Estaban. You know I remained behind amongst       the trees with three others to keep the enemy back while the detachment       was running away!&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       Lieutenant Santierra, little more than a boy at the time, and unused as       yet to the sanguinary imbecilities of a state of war, had lingered near       by, as if fascinated by the sight of these men who were to be shot       presently&mdash;&ldquo;for an example&rdquo;&mdash;as the Commandante had said.     </p>     <p>       The sergeant, without deigning to look at the prisoner, addressed himself       to the young officer with a superior smile.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Ten men would not have been enough to make him a prisoner, mi teniente.       Moreover, the other three rejoined the detachment after dark. Why should       he, unwounded and the strongest of them all, have failed to do so?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;My strength is as nothing against a mounted man with a lasso,&rdquo; Gaspar       Ruiz protested, eagerly. &ldquo;He dragged me behind his horse for half a mile.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       At this excellent reason the sergeant only laughed contemptuously. The       young officer hurried away after the Commandante.     </p>     <p>       Presently the adjutant of the castle came by. He was a truculent,       raw-boned man in a ragged uniform. His spluttering voice issued out of a       flat yellow face. The sergeant learned from him that the condemned men       would not be shot till sunset. He begged then to know what he was to do       with them meantime.     </p>     <p>       The adjutant looked savagely round the courtyard and, pointing to the door       of a small dungeon-like guardroom, receiving light and air through one       heavily barred window, said: &ldquo;Drive the scoundrels in there.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The sergeant, tightening his grip upon the stick he carried in virtue of       his rank, executed this order with alacrity and zeal. He hit Gaspar Ruiz,       whose movements were slow, over his head and shoulders. Gaspar Ruiz stood       still for a moment under the shower of blows, biting his lip thoughtfully       as if absorbed by a perplexing mental process&mdash;then followed the       others without haste. The door was locked, and the adjutant carried off       the key.     </p>     <p>       By noon the heat of that vaulted place crammed to suffocation had become       unbearable. The prisoners crowded towards the window, begging their guards       for a drop of water; but the soldiers remained lying in indolent attitudes       wherever there was a little shade under a wall, while the sentry sat with       his back against the door smoking a cigarette, and raising his eyebrows       philosophically from time to time. Gaspar Ruiz had pushed his way to the       window with irresistible force. His capacious chest needed more air than       the others; his big face, resting with its chin on the ledge, pressed       close to the bars, seemed to support the other faces crowding up for       breath. From moaned entreaties they had passed to desperate cries, and the       tumultuous howling of those thirsty men obliged a young officer who was       just then crossing the courtyard to shout in order to make himself heard.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give some water to these prisoners?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The sergeant, with an air of surprised innocence, excused himself by the       remark that all those men were condemned to die in a very few hours.     </p>     <p>       Lieutenant Santierra stamped his foot. &ldquo;They are condemned to death, not       to torture,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Give them some water at once.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       Impressed by this appearance of anger, the soldiers bestirred themselves,       and the sentry, snatching up his musket, stood to attention.     </p>     <p>       But when a couple of buckets were found and filled from the well, it was       discovered that they could not be passed through the bars, which were set       too close. At the prospect of quenching their thirst, the shrieks of those       trampled down in the struggle to get near the opening became very       heartrending. But when the soldiers who had lifted the buckets towards the       window put them to the ground again helplessly, the yell of disappointment       was still more terrible.     </p>     <p>       The soldiers of the army of Independence were not equipped with canteens.       A small tin cup was found, but its approach to the opening caused such a       commotion, such yells of rage and pain in the vague mass of limbs behind       the straining faces at the window, that Lieutenant Santierra cried out       hurriedly, &ldquo;No, no&mdash;you must open the door, sergeant.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The sergeant, shrugging his shoulders, explained that he had no right to       open the door even if he had had the key. But he had not the key. The       adjutant of the garrison kept the key. Those men were giving much       unnecessary trouble, since they had to die at sunset in any case. Why they       had not been shot at once early in the morning he could not understand.     </p>     <p>       Lieutenant Santierra kept his back studiously to the window. It was at his       earnest solicitations that the Commandante had delayed the execution. This       favour had been granted to him in consideration of his distinguished       family and of his father&rsquo;s high position amongst the chiefs of the       Republican party. Lieutenant Santierra believed that the General       commanding would visit the fort some time in the afternoon, and he       ingenuously hoped that his naive intercession would induce that severe man       to pardon some, at least, of those criminals. In the revulsion of his       feeling his interference stood revealed now as guilty and futile meddling.       It appeared to him obvious that the general would never even consent to       listen to his petition. He could never save those men, and he had only       made himself responsible for the sufferings added to the cruelty of their       fate.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Then go at once and get the key from the adjutant,&rdquo; said Lieutenant       Santierra.     </p>     <p>       The sergeant shook his head with a sort of bashful smile, while his eyes       glanced sideways at Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s face, motionless and silent, staring       through the bars at the bottom of a heap of other haggard, distorted,       yelling faces.     </p>     <p>       His worship the adjutant de Plaza, the sergeant murmured, was having his       siesta; and supposing that he, the sergeant, would be allowed access to       him, the only result he expected would be to have his soul flogged out of       his body for presuming to disturb his worship&rsquo;s repose. He made a       deprecatory movement with his hands, and stood stock-still, looking down       modestly upon his brown toes.     </p>     <p>       Lieutenant Santierra glared with indignation, but hesitated. His handsome       oval face, as smooth as a girl&rsquo;s, flushed with the shame of his       perplexity. Its nature humiliated his spirit. His hairless upper lip       trembled; he seemed on the point of either bursting into a fit of rage or       into tears of dismay.     </p>     <p>       Fifty years later, General Santierra, the venerable relic of revolutionary       times, was well able to remember the feelings of the young lieutenant.       Since he had given up riding altogether, and found it difficult to walk       beyond the limits of his garden, the general&rsquo;s greatest delight was to       entertain in his house the officers of the foreign men-of-war visiting the       harbour. For Englishmen he had a preference, as for old companions in       arms. English naval men of all ranks accepted his hospitality with       curiosity, because he had known Lord Cochrane and had taken part, on board       the patriot squadron commanded by that marvellous seaman, in the cutting       out and blockading operations before Callao&mdash;an episode of unalloyed       glory in the wars of Independence and of endless honour in the fighting       tradition of Englishmen. He was a fair linguist, this ancient survivor of       the Liberating armies. A trick of smoothing his long white beard whenever       he was short of a word in French or English imparted an air of leisurely       dignity to the tone of his reminiscences.     </p>     <p>       III     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Yes, my friends,&rdquo; he used to say to his guests, &ldquo;what would you have? A       youth of seventeen summers, without worldly experience, and owing my rank       only to the glorious patriotism of my father, may God rest his soul. I       suffered immense humiliation, not so much from the disobedience of that       subordinate, who, after all, was responsible for those prisoners; but I       suffered because, like the boy I was, I myself dreaded going to the       adjutant for the key. I had felt, before, his rough and cutting tongue.       Being quite a common fellow, with no merit except his savage valour, he       made me feel his contempt and dislike from the first day I joined my       battalion in garrison at the fort. It was only a fortnight before! I would       have confronted him sword in hand, but I shrank from the mocking brutality       of his sneers.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember having been so miserable in my life before or since. The       torment of my sensibility was so great that I wished the sergeant to fall       dead at my feet, and the stupid soldiers who stared at me to turn into       corpses; and even those wretches for whom my entreaties had procured a       reprieve I wished dead also, because I could not face them without shame.       A mephitic heat like a whiff of air from hell came out of that dark place       in which they were confined. Those at the window who had heard what was       going on jeered at me in very desperation: one of these fellows, gone mad       no doubt, kept on urging me volubly to order the soldiers to fire through       the window. His insane loquacity made my heart turn faint. And my feet       were like lead. There was no higher officer to whom I could appeal. I had       not even the firmness of spirit to simply go away.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Benumbed by my remorse, I stood with my back to the window. You must not       suppose that all this lasted a long time. How long could it have been? A       minute? If you measured by mental suffering it was like a hundred years; a       longer time than all my life has been since. No, certainly, it was not so       much as a minute. The hoarse screaming of those miserable wretches died       out in their dry throats, and then suddenly a voice spoke, a deep voice       muttering calmly. It called upon me to turn round.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;That voice, senores, proceeded from the head of Gaspar Ruiz. Of his body       I could see nothing. Some of his fellow-captives had clambered upon his       back. He was holding them up. His eyes blinked without looking at me. That       and the moving of his lips was all he seemed able to manage in his       overloaded state. And when I turned round, this head, that seemed more       than human size resting on its chin under a multitude of other heads,       asked me whether I really desired to quench the thirst of the captives.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; eagerly, and came up quite close to the window. I was       like a child, and did not know what would happen. I was anxious to be       comforted in my helplessness and remorse.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Have you the authority, Senor teniente, to release my wrists from their       bonds?&rsquo; Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s head asked me.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;His features expressed no anxiety, no hope; his heavy eyelids blinked       upon his eyes that looked past me straight into the courtyard.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;As if in an ugly dream, I spoke, stammering: &lsquo;What do you mean? And how       can I reach the bonds on your wrists?&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;I will try what I can do,&rsquo; he said; and then that large staring head       moved at last, and all the wild faces piled up in that window disappeared,       tumbling down. He had shaken his load off with one movement, so strong he       was.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;And he had not only shaken it off, but he got free of the crush and       vanished from my sight. For a moment there was no one at all to be seen at       the window. He had swung about, butting and shouldering, clearing a space       for himself in the only way he could do it with his hands tied behind his       back.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Finally, backing to the opening, he pushed out to me between the bars his       wrists, lashed with many turns of rope. His hands, very swollen, with       knotted veins, looked enormous and unwieldy. I saw his bent back. It was       very broad. His voice was like the muttering of a bull.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Cut, Senor teniente. Cut!&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I drew my sword, my new unblunted sword that had seen no service as yet,       and severed the many turns of the hide rope. I did this without knowing       the why and the wherefore of my action, but as it were compelled by my       faith in that man. The sergeant made as if to cry out, but astonishment       deprived him of his voice, and he remained standing with his mouth open as       if overtaken by sudden imbecility.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I sheathed my sword and faced the soldiers. An air of awestruck       expectation had replaced their usual listless apathy. I heard the voice of       Gaspar Ruiz shouting inside, but the words I could not make out plainly. I       suppose that to see him with his arms free augmented the influence of his       strength: I mean by this, the spiritual influence that with ignorant       people attaches to an exceptional degree of bodily vigour. In fact, he was       no more to be feared than before, on account of the numbness of his arms       and hands, which lasted for some time.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The sergeant had recovered his power of speech. &lsquo;By all the saints!&rsquo; he       cried, &lsquo;we shall have to get a cavalry man with a lasso to secure him       again, if he is to be led to the place of execution. Nothing less than a       good enlazador on a good horse can subdue him. Your worship was pleased to       perform a very mad thing.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I had nothing to say. I was surprised myself, and I felt a childish       curiosity to see what would happen next. But the sergeant was thinking of       the difficulty of controlling Gaspar Ruiz when the time for making an       example would come.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Or perhaps,&rsquo; the sergeant pursued, vexedly, &lsquo;we shall be obliged to       shoot him down as he dashes out when the door is opened.&rsquo; He was going to       give further vent to his anxieties as to the proper carrying out of the       sentence; but he interrupted himself with a sudden exclamation, snatched a       musket from a soldier, and stood watchful with his eyes fixed on the       window.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       IV     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Gaspar Ruiz had clambered up on the sill, and sat down there with his       feet against the thickness of the wall and his knees slightly bent. The       window was not quite broad enough for the length of his legs. It appeared       to my crestfallen perception that he meant to keep the window all to       himself. He seemed to be taking up a comfortable position. Nobody inside       dared to approach him now he could strike with his hands.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Por Dios!&rsquo; I heard the sergeant muttering at my elbow, &lsquo;I shall shoot       him through the head now, and get rid of that trouble. He is a condemned       man.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;At that I looked at him angrily. &lsquo;The general has not confirmed the       sentence,&rsquo; I said&mdash;though I knew well in my heart that these were but       vain words. The sentence required no confirmation. &lsquo;You have no right to       shoot him unless he tries to escape,&rsquo; I added, firmly.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;But sangre de Dios!&rsquo; the sergeant yelled out, bringing his musket up to       the shoulder, &lsquo;he is escaping now. Look!&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;But I, as if that Gaspar Ruiz had cast a spell upon me, struck the musket       upward, and the bullet flew over the roofs somewhere. The sergeant dashed       his arm to the ground and stared. He might have commanded the soldiers to       fire, but he did not. And if he had he would not have been obeyed, I       think, just then.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;With his feet against the thickness of the wall and his hairy hands       grasping the iron bar, Gaspar sat still. It was an attitude. Nothing       happened for a time. And suddenly it dawned upon us that he was       straightening his bowed back and contracting his arms. His lips were       twisted into a snarl. Next thing we perceived was that the bar of forged       iron was being bent slowly by the mightiness of his pull. The sun was       beating full upon his cramped, unquivering figure. A shower of sweat-drops       burst out of his forehead. Watching the bar grow crooked, I saw a little       blood ooze from under his finger-nails. Then he let go. For a moment he       remained all huddled up, with a hanging head, looking drowsily into the       upturned palms of his mighty hands. Indeed he seemed to have dozed off.       Suddenly he flung himself backwards on the sill, and setting the soles of       his bare feet against the other middle bar, he bent that one, too, but in       the opposite direction from the first.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Such was his strength, which in this case relieved my painful feelings.       And the man seemed to have done nothing. Except for the change of position       in order to use his feet, which made us all start by its swiftness, my       recollection is that of immobility. But he had bent the bars wide apart.       And now he could get out if he liked; but he dropped his legs inwards, and       looking over his shoulder beckoned to the soldiers. &lsquo;Hand up the water,&rsquo;        he said. &lsquo;I will give them all a drink.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He was obeyed. For a moment I expected man and bucket to disappear,       overwhelmed by the rush of eagerness; I thought they would pull him down       with their teeth. There was a rush, but holding the bucket on his lap he       repulsed the assault of those wretches by the mere swinging of his feet.       They flew backwards at every kick, yelling with pain; and the soldiers       laughed, gazing at the window.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;They all laughed, holding their sides, except the sergeant, who was       gloomy and morose. He was afraid the prisoners would rise and break out&mdash;which       would have been a bad example. But there was no fear of that, and I stood       myself before the window with my drawn sword. When sufficiently tamed by       the strength of Gaspar Ruiz they came up one by one, stretching their       necks and presenting their lips to the edge of the bucket which the strong       man tilted towards them from his knees with an extraordinary air of       charity, gentleness, and compassion. That benevolent appearance was of       course the effect of his care in not spilling the water and of his       attitude as he sat on the sill; for, if a man lingered with his lips glued       to the rim of the bucket after Gaspar Ruiz had said &lsquo;You have had enough,&rsquo;        there would be no tenderness or mercy in the shove of the foot which would       send him groaning and doubled up far into the interior of the prison,       where he would knock down two or three others before he fell himself. They       came up to him again and again; it looked as if they meant to drink the       well dry before going to their death; but the soldiers were so amused by       Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s systematic proceedings that they carried the water up to the       window cheerfully.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;When the adjutant came out after his siesta there was some trouble over       this affair, I can assure you. And the worst of it was that the general       whom we expected never came to the castle that day.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The guests of General Santierra unanimously expressed their regret that       the man of such strength and patience had not been saved.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He was not saved by my interference,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;The prisoners       were led to execution half an hour before sunset. Gaspar Ruiz, contrary to       the sergeant&rsquo;s apprehensions, gave no trouble. There was no necessity to       get a cavalry man with a lasso in order to subdue him, as if he were a       wild bull of the campo. I believe he marched out with his arms free       amongst the others who were bound. I did not see. I was not there. I had       been put under arrest for interfering with the prisoner&rsquo;s guard. About       dusk, sitting dismally in my quarters, I heard three volleys fired, and       thought that I should never hear of Gaspar Ruiz again. He fell with the       others. But we were to hear of him nevertheless, though the sergeant       boasted that as he lay on his face expiring or dead in the heap of the       slain, he had slashed his neck with a sword. He had done this, he said, to       make sure of ridding the world of a dangerous traitor.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I confess to you, senores, that I thought of that strong man with a sort       of gratitude, and with some admiration. He had used his strength       honourably. There dwelt, then, in his soul no fierceness corresponding to       the vigour of his body.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       V     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz, who could with ease bend apart the heavy iron bars of the       prison, was led out with others to summary execution. &ldquo;Every bullet has       its billet,&rdquo; runs the proverb. All the merit of proverbs consists in the       concise and picturesque expression. In the surprise of our minds is found       their persuasiveness. In other words, we are struck and convinced by the       shock.     </p>     <p>       What surprises us is the form, not the substance. Proverbs are art&mdash;cheap       art. As a general rule they are not true; unless indeed they happen to be       mere platitudes, as for instance the proverb, &ldquo;Half a loaf is better than       no bread,&rdquo; or &ldquo;A miss is as good as a mile.&rdquo; Some proverbs are simply       imbecile, others are immoral. That one evolved out of the naive heart of       the great Russian people, &ldquo;Man discharges the piece, but God carries the       bullet,&rdquo; is piously atrocious, and at bitter variance with the accepted       conception of a compassionate God. It would indeed be an inconsistent       occupation for the Guardian of the poor, the innocent, and the helpless,       to carry the bullet, for instance, into the heart of a father.     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz was childless, he had no wife, he had never been in love. He       had hardly ever spoken to a woman, beyond his mother and the ancient       negress of the household, whose wrinkled skin was the colour of cinders,       and whose lean body was bent double from age. If some bullets from those       muskets fired off at fifteen paces were specifically destined for the       heart of Gaspar Ruiz, they all missed their billet. One, however, carried       away a small piece of his ear, and another a fragment of flesh from his       shoulder.     </p>     <p>       A red and unclouded sun setting into a purple ocean looked with a fiery       stare upon the enormous wall of the Cordilleras, worthy witnesses of his       glorious extinction. But it is inconceivable that it should have seen the       ant-like men busy with their absurd and insignificant trials of killing       and dying for reasons that, apart from being generally childish, were also       imperfectly understood. It did light up, however, the backs of the firing       party and the faces of the condemned men. Some of them had fallen on their       knees, others remained standing, a few averted their heads from the       levelled barrels of muskets. Gaspar Ruiz, upright, the burliest of them       all, hung his big shock head. The low sun dazzled him a little, and he       counted himself a dead man already.     </p>     <p>       He fell at the first discharge. He fell because he thought he was a dead       man. He struck the ground heavily. The jar of the fall surprised him. &ldquo;I       am not dead apparently,&rdquo; he thought to himself, when he heard the       execution platoon reloading its arms at the word of command. It was then       that the hope of escape dawned upon him for the first time. He remained       lying stretched out with rigid limbs under the weight of two bodies       collapsed crosswise upon his back.     </p>     <p>       By the time the soldiers had fired a third volley into the slightly       stirring heaps of the slain, the sun had gone out of sight, and almost       immediately with the darkening of the ocean dusk fell upon the coasts of       the young Republic. Above the gloom of the lowlands the snowy peaks of the       Cordilleras remained luminous and crimson for a long time. The soldiers       before marching back to the fort sat down to smoke.     </p>     <p>       The sergeant with a naked sword in his hand strolled away by himself along       the heap of the dead. He was a humane man, and watched for any stir or       twitch of limb in the merciful idea of plunging the point of his blade       into any body giving the slightest sign of life. But none of the bodies       afforded him an opportunity for the display of this charitable intention.       Not a muscle twitched amongst them, not even the powerful muscles of       Gaspar Ruiz, who, deluged with the blood of his neighbours and shamming       death, strove to appear more lifeless than the others.     </p>     <p>       He was lying face down. The sergeant recognized him by his stature, and       being himself a very small man, looked with envy and contempt at the       prostration of so much strength. He had always disliked that particular       soldier. Moved by an obscure animosity, he inflicted a long gash across       the neck of Gaspar Ruiz, with some vague notion of making sure of that       strong man&rsquo;s death, as if a powerful physique were more able to resist the       bullets. For the sergeant had no doubt that Gaspar Ruiz had been shot       through in many places. Then he passed on, and shortly afterwards marched       off with his men, leaving the bodies to the care of crows and vultures.     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz had restrained a cry, though it had seemed to him that his       head was cut off at a blow; and when darkness came, shaking off the dead,       whose weight had oppressed him, he crawled away over the plain on his       hands and knees. After drinking deeply, like a wounded beast, at a shallow       stream, he assumed an upright posture, and staggered on light-headed and       aimless, as if lost amongst the stars of the clear night. A small house       seemed to rise out of the ground before him. He stumbled into the porch       and struck at the door with his fist. There was not a gleam of light.       Gaspar Ruiz might have thought that the inhabitants had fled from it, as       from many others in the neighbourhood, had it not been for the shouts of       abuse that answered his thumping. In his feverish and enfeebled state the       angry screaming seemed to him part of a hallucination belonging to the       weird, dreamlike feeling of his unexpected condemnation to death, of the       thirst suffered, of the volleys fired at him within fifteen paces, of his       head being cut off at a blow. &ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Open in the name       of God!&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       An infuriated voice from within jeered at him: &ldquo;Come in, come in. This       house belongs to you. All this land belongs to you. Come and take it.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;For the love of God,&rdquo; Gaspar Ruiz murmured.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Does not all the land belong to you patriots?&rdquo; the voice on the other       side of the door screamed on. &ldquo;Are you not a patriot?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz did not know. &ldquo;I am a wounded man,&rdquo; he said, apathetically.     </p>     <p>       All became still inside. Gaspar Ruiz lost the hope of being admitted, and       lay down under the porch just outside the door. He was utterly careless of       what was going to happen to him. All his consciousness seemed to be       concentrated in his neck, where he felt a severe pain. His indifference as       to his fate was genuine. The day was breaking when he awoke from a       feverish doze; the door at which he had knocked in the dark stood wide       open now, and a girl, steadying herself with her outspread arms, leaned       over the threshold. Lying on his back, he stared up at her. Her face was       pale and her eyes were very dark; her hair hung down black as ebony       against her white cheeks; her lips were full and red. Beyond her he saw       another head with long grey hair, and a thin old face with a pair of       anxiously clasped hands under the chin.     </p>     <p>       VI     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I knew those people by sight,&rdquo; General Santierra would tell his guests at       the dining-table. &ldquo;I mean the people with whom Gaspar Ruiz found shelter.       The father was an old Spaniard, a man of property ruined by the       revolution. His estates, his house in town, his money, everything he had       in the world had been confiscated by proclamation, for he was a bitter foe       of our independence. From a position of great dignity and influence on the       Viceroy&rsquo;s Council he became of less importance than his own negro slaves       made free by our glorious revolution. He had not even the means to flee       the country, as other Spaniards had managed to do. It may be that,       wandering ruined and houseless, and burdened with nothing but his life,       which was left to him by the clemency of the Provisional Government, he       had simply walked under that broken roof of old tiles. It was a lonely       spot. There did not seem to be even a dog belonging to the place. But       though the roof had holes, as if a cannon-ball or two had dropped through       it, the wooden shutters were thick and tight-closed all the time.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;My way took me frequently along the path in front of that miserable       rancho. I rode from the fort to the town almost every evening, to sigh at       the window of a lady I was in love with, then. When one is young, you       understand. . . . She was a good patriot, you may believe. Caballeros,       credit me or not, political feeling ran so high in those days that I do       not believe I could have been fascinated by the charms of a woman of       Royalist opinions. . . .&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       Murmurs of amused incredulity all round the table interrupted the General;       and while they lasted he stroked his white beard gravely.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Senores,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;a Royalist was a monster to our overwrought       feelings. I am telling you this in order not to be suspected of the       slightest tenderness towards that old Royalist&rsquo;s daughter. Moreover, as       you know, my affections were engaged elsewhere. But I could not help       noticing her on rare occasions when with the front door open she stood in       the porch.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;You must know that this old Royalist was as crazy as a man can be. His       political misfortunes, his total downfall and ruin, had disordered his       mind. To show his contempt for what we patriots could do, he affected to       laugh at his imprisonment, at the confiscation of his lands, the burning       of his houses, and at the misery to which he and his womenfolk were       reduced. This habit of laughing had grown upon him, so that he would begin       to laugh and shout directly he caught sight of any stranger. That was the       form of his madness.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I, of course, disregarded the noise of that madman with that feeling of       superiority the success of our cause inspired in us Americans. I suppose I       really despised him because he was an old Castilian, a Spaniard born, and       a Royalist. Those were certainly no reasons to scorn a man; but for       centuries Spaniards born had shown their contempt of us Americans, men as       well descended as themselves, simply because we were what they called       colonists. We had been kept in abasement and made to feel our inferiority       in social intercourse. And now it was our turn. It was safe for us       patriots to display the same sentiments; and I being a young patriot, son       of a patriot, despised that old Spaniard, and despising him I naturally       disregarded his abuse, though it was annoying to my feelings. Others       perhaps would not have been so forbearing.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He would begin with a great yell&mdash;&lsquo;I see a patriot. Another of       them!&rsquo; long before I came abreast of the house. The tone of his senseless       revilings, mingled with bursts of laughter, was sometimes piercingly       shrill and sometimes grave. It was all very mad; but I felt it incumbent       upon my dignity to check my horse to a walk without even glancing towards       the house, as if that man&rsquo;s abusive clamour in the porch were less than       the barking of a cur. Always I rode by preserving an expression of haughty       indifference on my face.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;It was no doubt very dignified; but I should have done better if I had       kept my eyes open. A military man in war time should never consider       himself off duty; and especially so if the war is a revolutionary war,       when the enemy is not at the door, but within your very house. At such       times the heat of passionate convictions passing into hatred, removes the       restraints of honour and humanity from many men and of delicacy and fear       from some women. These last, when once they throw off the timidity and       reserve of their sex, become by the vivacity of their intelligence and the       violence of their merciless resentment more dangerous than so many armed       giants.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The General&rsquo;s voice rose, but his big hand stroked his white beard twice       with an effect of venerable calmness. &ldquo;Si, Senores! Women are ready to       rise to the heights of devotion unattainable by us men, or to sink into       the depths of abasement which amazes our masculine prejudices. I am       speaking now of exceptional women, you understand. . . .&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       Here one of the guests observed that he had never met a woman yet who was       not capable of turning out quite exceptional under circumstances that       would engage her feelings strongly. &ldquo;That sort of superiority in       recklessness they have over us,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;makes of them the more       interesting half of mankind.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The General, who bore the interruption with gravity, nodded courteous       assent. &ldquo;Si. Si. Under circumstances. . . . Precisely. They can do an       infinite deal of mischief sometimes in quite unexpected ways. For who       could have imagined that a young girl, daughter of a ruined Royalist whose       life was held only by the contempt of his enemies, would have had the       power to bring death and devastation upon two flourishing provinces and       cause serious anxiety to the leaders of the revolution in the very hour of       its success!&rdquo; He paused to let the wonder of it penetrate our minds.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Death and devastation,&rdquo; somebody murmured in surprise: &ldquo;how shocking!&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The old General gave a glance in the direction of the murmur and went on.       &ldquo;Yes. That is, war&mdash;calamity. But the means by which she obtained the       power to work this havoc on our southern frontier seem to me, who have       seen her and spoken to her, still more shocking. That particular thing       left on my mind a dreadful amazement which the further experience of life,       of more than fifty years, has done nothing to diminish.&rdquo; He looked round       as if to make sure of our attention, and, in a changed voice: &ldquo;I am, as       you know, a republican, son of a Liberator,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;My incomparable       mother, God rest her soul, was a Frenchwoman, the daughter of an ardent       republican. As a boy I fought for liberty; I&rsquo;ve always believed in the       equality of men; and as to their brotherhood, that, to my mind, is even       more certain. Look at the fierce animosity they display in their       differences. And what in the world do you know that is more bitterly       fierce than brothers&rsquo; quarrels?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       All absence of cynicism checked an inclination to smile at this view of       human brotherhood. On the contrary, there was in the tone the melancholy       natural to a man profoundly humane at heart who from duty, from       conviction, and from necessity, had played his part in scenes of ruthless       violence.     </p>     <p>       The General had seen much of fratricidal strife. &ldquo;Certainly. There is no       doubt of their brotherhood,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;All men are brothers, and as       such know almost too much of each other. But&rdquo;&mdash;and here in the old       patriarchal head, white as silver, the black eyes humorously twinkled&mdash;&ldquo;if       we are all brothers, all the women are not our sisters.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       One of the younger guests was heard murmuring his satisfaction at the       fact. But the General continued, with deliberate earnestness: &ldquo;They are so       different! The tale of a king who took a beggar-maid for a partner of his       throne may be pretty enough as we men look upon ourselves and upon love.       But that a young girl, famous for her haughty beauty and, only a short       time before, the admired of all at the balls in the Viceroy&rsquo;s palace,       should take by the hand a guasso, a common peasant, is intolerable to our       sentiment of women and their love. It is madness. Nevertheless it       happened. But it must be said that in her case it was the madness of hate&mdash;not       of love.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       After presenting this excuse in a spirit of chivalrous justice, the       General remained silent for a time. &ldquo;I rode past the house every day       almost,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;and this was what was going on within. But how       it was going on no mind of man can conceive. Her desperation must have       been extreme, and Gaspar Ruiz was a docile fellow. He had been an obedient       soldier. His strength was like an enormous stone lying on the ground,       ready to be hurled this way or that by the hand that picks it up.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;It is clear that he would tell his story to the people who gave him the       shelter he needed. And he needed assistance badly. His wound was not       dangerous, but his life was forfeited. The old Royalist being wrapped up       in his laughing madness, the two women arranged a hiding-place for the       wounded man in one of the huts amongst the fruit trees at the back of the       house. That hovel, an abundance of clear water while the fever was on him,       and some words of pity were all they could give. I suppose he had a share       of what food there was. And it would be but little: a handful of roasted       corn, perhaps a dish of beans, or a piece of bread with a few figs. To       such misery were those proud and once wealthy people reduced.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       VII     </p>     <p>       General Santierra was right in his surmise. Such was the exact nature of       the assistance which Gaspar Ruiz, peasant son of peasants, received from       the Royalist family whose daughter had opened the door of their miserable       refuge to his extreme distress. Her sombre resolution ruled the madness of       her father and the trembling bewilderment of her mother.     </p>     <p>       She had asked the strange man on the doorstep, &ldquo;Who wounded you?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The soldiers, senora,&rdquo; Gaspar Ruiz had answered, in a faint voice.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Patriots?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Si.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Deserter,&rdquo; he gasped, leaning against the wall under the scrutiny of her       black eyes. &ldquo;I was left for dead over there.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       She led him through the house out to a small hut of clay and reeds, lost       in the long grass of the overgrown orchard. He sank on a heap of maize       straw in a corner, and sighed profoundly.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;No one will look for you here,&rdquo; she said, looking down at him. &ldquo;Nobody       comes near us. We, too, have been left for dead&mdash;here.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       He stirred uneasily on his heap of dirty straw, and the pain in his neck       made him groan deliriously.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I shall show Estaban some day that I am alive yet,&rdquo; he mumbled.     </p>     <p>       He accepted her assistance in silence, and the many days of pain went by.       Her appearances in the hut brought him relief and became connected with       the feverish dreams of angels which visited his couch; for Gaspar Ruiz was       instructed in the mysteries of his religion, and had even been taught to       read and write a little by the priest of his village. He waited for her       with impatience, and saw her pass out of the dark hut and disappear in the       brilliant sunshine with poignant regret. He discovered that, while he lay       there feeling so very weak, he could, by closing his eyes, evoke her face       with considerable distinctness. And this discovered faculty charmed the       long, solitary hours of his convalescence. Later on, when he began to       regain his strength, he would creep at dusk from his hut to the house and       sit on the step of the garden door.     </p>     <p>       In one of the rooms the mad father paced to and fro, muttering to himself       with short, abrupt laughs. In the passage, sitting on a stool, the mother       sighed and moaned. The daughter, in rough threadbare clothing, and her       white haggard face half hidden by a coarse manta, stood leaning against       the side of the door. Gaspar Ruiz, with his elbows propped on his knees       and his head resting in his hands, talked to the two women in an       undertone.     </p>     <p>       The common misery of destitution would have made a bitter mockery of a       marked insistence on social differences. Gaspar Ruiz understood this in       his simplicity. From his captivity amongst the Royalists he could give       them news of people they knew. He described their appearance; and when he       related the story of the battle in which he was recaptured the two women       lamented the blow to their cause and the ruin of their secret hopes.     </p>     <p>       He had no feeling either way. But he felt a great devotion for that young       girl. In his desire to appear worthy of her condescension, he boasted a       little of his bodily strength. He had nothing else to boast of. Because of       that quality his comrades treated him with as great a deference, he       explained, as though he had been a sergeant, both in camp and in battle.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I could always get as many as I wanted to follow me anywhere, senorita. I       ought to have been made an officer, because I can read and write.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       Behind him the silent old lady fetched a moaning sigh from time to time;       the distracted father muttered to himself, pacing the sala; and Gaspar       Ruiz would raise his eyes now and then to look at the daughter of these       people.     </p>     <p>       He would look at her with curiosity because she was alive, and also with       that feeling of familiarity and awe with which he had contemplated in       churches the inanimate and powerful statues of the saints, whose       protection is invoked in dangers and difficulties. His difficulty was very       great.     </p>     <p>       He could not remain hiding in an orchard for ever and ever. He knew also       very well that before he had gone half a day&rsquo;s journey in any direction,       he would be picked up by one of the cavalry patrols scouring the country,       and brought into one or another of the camps where the patriot army       destined for the liberation of Peru was collected. There he would in the       end be recognized as Gaspar Ruiz&mdash;the deserter to the Royalists&mdash;and       no doubt shot very effectually this time. There did not seem any place in       the world for the innocent Gaspar Ruiz anywhere. And at this thought his       simple soul surrendered itself to gloom and resentment as black as night.     </p>     <p>       They had made him a soldier forcibly. He did not mind being a soldier. And       he had been a good soldier as he had been a good son, because of his       docility and his strength. But now there was no use for either. They had       taken him from his parents, and he could no longer be a soldier&mdash;not       a good soldier at any rate. Nobody would listen to his explanations. What       injustice it was! What injustice!     </p>     <p>       And in a mournful murmur he would go over the story of his capture and       recapture for the twentieth time. Then, raising his eyes to the silent       girl in the doorway, &ldquo;Si, senorita,&rdquo; he would say with a deep sigh,       &ldquo;injustice has made this poor breath in my body quite worthless to me and       to anybody else. And I do not care who robs me of it.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       One evening, as he exhaled thus the plaint of his wounded soul, she       condescended to say that, if she were a man, she would consider no life       worthless which held the possibility of revenge.     </p>     <p>       She seemed to be speaking to herself. Her voice was low. He drank in the       gentle, as if dreamy sound with a consciousness of peculiar delight of       something warming his breast like a draught of generous wine.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;True, Senorita,&rdquo; he said, raising his face up to hers slowly: &ldquo;there is       Estaban, who must be shown that I am not dead after all.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The mutterings of the mad father had ceased long before; the sighing       mother had withdrawn somewhere into one of the empty rooms. All was still       within as well as without, in the moonlight bright as day on the wild       orchard full of inky shadows. Gaspar Ruiz saw the dark eyes of Dona       Erminia look down at him.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Ah! The sergeant,&rdquo; she muttered, disdainfully.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Why! He has wounded me with his sword,&rdquo; he protested, bewildered by the       contempt that seemed to shine livid on her pale face.     </p>     <p>       She crushed him with her glance. The power of her will to be understood       was so strong that it kindled in him the intelligence of unexpressed       things.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;What else did you expect me to do?&rdquo; he cried, as if suddenly driven to       despair. &ldquo;Have I the power to do more? Am I a general with an army at my       back?&mdash;miserable sinner that I am to be despised by you at last.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       VIII     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Senores,&rdquo; related the General to his guests, &ldquo;though my thoughts were of       love then, and therefore enchanting, the sight of that house always       affected me disagreeably, especially in the moonlight, when its close       shutters and its air of lonely neglect appeared sinister. Still I went on       using the bridle-path by the ravine, because it was a short cut. The mad       Royalist howled and laughed at me every evening to his complete       satisfaction; but after a time, as if wearied with my indifference, he       ceased to appear in the porch. How they persuaded him to leave off I do       not know. However, with Gaspar Ruiz in the house there would have been no       difficulty in restraining him by force. It was now part of their policy in       there to avoid anything which could provoke me. At least, so I suppose.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Notwithstanding my infatuation with the brightest pair of eyes in Chile,       I noticed the absence of the old man after a week or so. A few more days       passed. I began to think that perhaps these Royalists had gone away       somewhere else. But one evening, as I was hastening towards the city, I       saw again somebody in the porch. It was not the madman; it was the girl.       She stood holding on to one of the wooden columns, tall and white-faced,       her big eyes sunk deep with privation and sorrow. I looked hard at her,       and she met my stare with a strange, inquisitive look. Then, as I turned       my head after riding past, she seemed to gather courage for the act, and       absolutely beckoned me back.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I obeyed, senores, almost without thinking, so great was my astonishment.       It was greater still when I heard what she had to say. She began by       thanking me for my forbearance of her father&rsquo;s infirmity, so that I felt       ashamed of myself. I had meant to show disdain, not forbearance! Every       word must have burnt her lips, but she never departed from a gentle and       melancholy dignity which filled me with respect against my will. Senores,       we are no match for women. But I could hardly believe my ears when she       began her tale. Providence, she concluded, seemed to have preserved the       life of that wronged soldier, who now trusted to my honour as a caballero       and to my compassion for his sufferings.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Wronged man,&rsquo; I observed, coldly. &lsquo;Well, I think so, too: and you have       been harbouring an enemy of your cause.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;He was a poor Christian crying for help at our door in the name of God,       senor,&rsquo; she answered, simply.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I began to admire her. &lsquo;Where is he now?&rsquo; I asked, stiffly.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;But she would not answer that question. With extreme cunning, and an       almost fiendish delicacy, she managed to remind me of my failure in saving       the lives of the prisoners in the guardroom, without wounding my pride.       She knew, of course, the whole story. Gaspar Ruiz, she said, entreated me       to procure for him a safe-conduct from General San Martin himself. He had       an important communication to make to the commander-in-chief.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Por Dios, senores, she made me swallow all that, pretending to be only       the mouthpiece of that poor man. Overcome by injustice, he expected to       find, she said, as much generosity in me as had been shown to him by the       Royalist family which had given him a refuge.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Ha! It was well and nobly said to a youngster like me. I thought her       great. Alas! she was only implacable.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;In the end I rode away very enthusiastic about the business, without       demanding even to see Gaspar Ruiz, who I was confident was in the house.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;But on calm reflection I began to see some difficulties which I had not       confidence enough in myself to encounter. It was not easy to approach a       commander-in-chief with such a story. I feared failure. At last I thought       it better to lay the matter before my general-of-division, Robles, a       friend of my family, who had appointed me his aide-de-camp lately.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He took it out of my hands at once without any ceremony.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;In the house! of course he is in the house,&rsquo; he said contemptuously.       &lsquo;You ought to have gone sword in hand inside and demanded his surrender,       instead of chatting with a Royalist girl in the porch. Those people should       have been hunted out of that long ago. Who knows how many spies they have       harboured right in the very midst of our camps? A safe-conduct from the       Commander-in-Chief! The audacity of the fellow! Ha! ha! Now we shall catch       him to-night, and then we shall find out, without any safe-conduct, what       he has got to say, that is so very important. Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;General Robles, peace to his soul, was a short, thick man, with round,       staring eyes, fierce and jovial. Seeing my distress he added:     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Come, come, chico. I promise you his life if he does not resist. And       that is not likely. We are not going to break up a good soldier if it can       be helped. I tell you what! I am curious to see your strong man. Nothing       but a general will do for the picaro&mdash;well, he shall have a general       to talk to. Ha! ha! I shall go myself to the catching, and you are coming       with me, of course.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;And it was done that same night. Early in the evening the house and the       orchard were surrounded quietly. Later on the General and I left a ball we       were attending in town and rode out at an easy gallop. At some little       distance from the house we pulled up. A mounted orderly held our horses. A       low whistle warned the men watching all along the ravine, and we walked up       to the porch softly. The barricaded house in the moonlight seemed empty.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The General knocked at the door. After a time a woman&rsquo;s voice within       asked who was there. My chief nudged me hard. I gasped.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;It is I, Lieutenant Santierra,&rsquo; I stammered out, as if choked. &lsquo;Open the       door.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;It came open slowly. The girl, holding a thin taper in her hand, seeing       another man with me, began to back away before us slowly, shading the       light with her hand. Her impassive white face looked ghostly. I followed       behind General Robles. Her eyes were fixed on mine. I made a gesture of       helplessness behind my chief&rsquo;s back, trying at the same time to give a       reassuring expression to my face. None of us three uttered a sound.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;We found ourselves in a room with bare floor and walls. There was a rough       table and a couple of stools in it, nothing else whatever. An old woman       with her grey hair hanging loose wrung her hands when we appeared. A peal       of loud laughter resounded through the empty house, very amazing and       weird. At this the old woman tried to get past us.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Nobody to leave the room,&rsquo; said General Robles to me.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I swung the door to, heard the latch click, and the laughter became faint       in our ears.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Before another word could be spoken in that room I was amazed by hearing       the sound of distant thunder.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I had carried in with me into the house a vivid impression of a beautiful       clear moonlight night, without a speck of cloud in the sky. I could not       believe my ears. Sent early abroad for my education, I was not familiar       with the most dreaded natural phenomenon of my native land. I saw, with       inexpressible astonishment, a look of terror in my chief&rsquo;s eyes. Suddenly       I felt giddy. The General staggered against me heavily; the girl seemed to       reel in the middle of the room, the taper fell out of her hand and the       light went out; a shrill cry of &lsquo;Misericordia!&rsquo; from the old woman pierced       my ears. In the pitchy darkness I heard the plaster off the walls falling       on the floor. It is a mercy there was no ceiling. Holding on to the latch       of the door, I heard the grinding of the roof-tiles cease above my head.       The shock was over.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Out of the house! The door! Fly, Santierra, fly!&rsquo; howled the General.       You know, senores, in our country the bravest are not ashamed of the fear       an earthquake strikes into all the senses of man. One never gets used to       it. Repeated experience only augments the mastery of that nameless terror.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;It was my first earthquake, and I was the calmest of them all. I       understood that the crash outside was caused by the porch, with its wooden       pillars and tiled roof projection, falling down. The next shock would       destroy the house, maybe. That rumble as of thunder was approaching again.       The General was rushing round the room, to find the door perhaps. He made       a noise as though he were trying to climb the walls, and I heard him       distinctly invoke the names of several saints. &lsquo;Out, out, Santierra!&rsquo; he       yelled.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s voice was the only one I did not hear.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;General,&rsquo; I cried, I cannot move the door. We must be locked in.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I did not recognize his voice in the shout of malediction and despair he       let out. Senores, I know many men in my country, especially in the       provinces most subject to earthquakes, who will neither eat, sleep, pray,       nor even sit down to cards with closed doors. The danger is not in the       loss of time, but in this&mdash;that the movement of the walls may prevent       a door being opened at all. This was what had happened to us. We were       trapped, and we had no help to expect from anybody. There is no man in my       country who will go into a house when the earth trembles. There never was&mdash;except       one: Gaspar Ruiz.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He had come out of whatever hole he had been hiding in outside, and had       clambered over the timbers of the destroyed porch. Above the awful       subterranean groan of coming destruction I heard a mighty voice shouting       the word &lsquo;Erminia!&rsquo; with the lungs of a giant. An earthquake is a great       leveller of distinctions. I collected all my resolution against the terror       of the scene. &lsquo;She is here,&rsquo; I shouted back. A roar as of a furious wild       beast answered me&mdash;while my head swam, my heart sank, and the sweat       of anguish streamed like rain off my brow.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He had the strength to pick up one of the heavy posts of the porch.       Holding it under his armpit like a lance, but with both hands, he charged       madly the rocking house with the force of a battering-ram, bursting open       the door and rushing in, headlong, over our prostrate bodies. I and the       General picking ourselves up, bolted out together, without looking round       once till we got across the road. Then, clinging to each other, we beheld       the house change suddenly into a heap of formless rubbish behind the back       of a man, who staggered towards us bearing the form of a woman clasped in       his arms. Her long black hair hung nearly to his feet. He laid her down       reverently on the heaving earth, and the moonlight shone on her closed       eyes.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Senores, we mounted with difficulty. Our horses getting up plunged madly,       held by the soldiers who had come running from all sides. Nobody thought       of catching Gaspar Ruiz then. The eyes of men and animals shone with wild       fear. My general approached Gaspar Ruiz, who stood motionless as a statue       above the girl. He let himself be shaken by the shoulder without detaching       his eyes from her face.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Que guape!&rsquo; shouted the General in his ear. &lsquo;You are the bravest man       living. You have saved my life. I am General Robles. Come to my quarters       to-morrow if God gives us the grace to see another day.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He never stirred&mdash;as if deaf, without feeling, insensible.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;We rode away for the town, full of our relations, of our friends, of       whose fate we hardly dared to think. The soldiers ran by the side of our       horses. Everything was forgotten in the immensity of the catastrophe       overtaking a whole country.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       . . . . . . .     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz saw the girl open her eyes. The raising of her eyelids seemed       to recall him from a trance. They were alone; the cries of terror and       distress from homeless people filled the plains of the coast remote and       immense, coming like a whisper into their loneliness.     </p>     <p>       She rose swiftly to her feet, darting fearful glances on all sides. &ldquo;What       is it?&rdquo; she cried out low, and peering into his face. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       He bowed his head sadly, without a word.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;. . . Who are you?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       He knelt down slowly before her, and touched the hem of her coarse black       baize skirt. &ldquo;Your slave,&rdquo; he said.     </p>     <p>       She caught sight then of the heap of rubbish that had been the house, all       misty in the cloud of dust. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried, pressing her hand to her       forehead.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I carried you out from there,&rdquo; he whispered at her feet.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;And they?&rdquo; she asked in a great sob.     </p>     <p>       He rose, and taking her by the arms, led her gently towards the shapeless       ruin half overwhelmed by a landslide. &ldquo;Come and listen,&rdquo; he said.     </p>     <p>       The serene moon saw them clambering over that heap of stones, joists and       tiles, which was a grave. They pressed their ears to the interstices,       listening for the sound of a groan, for a sigh of pain.     </p>     <p>       At last he said, &ldquo;They died swiftly. You are alone.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       She sat down on a piece of broken timber and put one arm across her face.       He waited&mdash;then approaching his lips to her ear: &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; he       whispered.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Never&mdash;never from here,&rdquo; she cried out, flinging her arms above her       head.     </p>     <p>       He stooped over her, and her raised arms fell upon his shoulders. He       lifted her up, steadied himself and began to walk, looking straight before       him.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; she asked, feebly.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I am escaping from my enemies,&rdquo; he said, never once glancing at his light       burden.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;With me?&rdquo; she sighed, helplessly.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Never without you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are my strength.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       He pressed her close to him. His face was grave and his footsteps steady.       The conflagrations bursting out in the ruins of destroyed villages dotted       the plain with red fires; and the sounds of distant lamentations, the       cries of Misericordia! Misericordia! made a desolate murmur in his ears.       He walked on, solemn and collected, as if carrying something holy,       fragile, and precious.     </p>     <p>       The earth rocked at times under his feet.     </p>     <p>       IX     </p>     <p>       With movements of mechanical care and an air of abstraction old General       Santierra lighted a long and thick cigar.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;It was a good many hours before we could send a party back to the       ravine,&rdquo; he said to his guests. &ldquo;We had found one-third of the town laid       low, the rest shaken up; and the inhabitants, rich and poor, reduced to       the same state of distraction by the universal disaster. The affected       cheerfulness of some contrasted with the despair of others. In the general       confusion a number of reckless thieves, without fear of God or man, became       a danger to those who from the downfall of their homes had managed to save       some valuables. Crying &lsquo;Misericordia&rsquo; louder than any at every tremor, and       beating their breast with one hand, these scoundrels robbed the poor       victims with the other, not even stopping short of murder.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;General Robles&rsquo; division was occupied entirely in guarding the destroyed       quarters of the town from the depredations of these inhuman monsters.       Taken up with my duties of orderly officer, it was only in the morning       that I could assure myself of the safety of my own family. My mother and       my sisters had escaped with their lives from that ballroom, where I had       left them early in the evening. I remember those two beautiful young women&mdash;God       rest their souls&mdash;as if I saw them this moment, in the garden of our       destroyed house, pale but active, assisting some of our poor neighbours,       in their soiled ball-dresses and with the dust of fallen walls on their       hair. As to my mother, she had a stoical soul in her frail body.       Half-covered by a costly shawl, she was lying on a rustic seat by the side       of an ornamental basin whose fountain had ceased to play for ever on that       night.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I had hardly had time to embrace them all with transports of joy when my       chief, coming along, dispatched me to the ravine with a few soldiers, to       bring in my strong man, as he called him, and that pale girl.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;But there was no one for us to bring in. A landslide had covered the       ruins of the house; and it was like a large mound of earth with only the       ends of some timbers visible here and there&mdash;nothing more.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Thus were the tribulations of the old Royalist couple ended. An enormous       and unconsecrated grave had swallowed them up alive, in their unhappy       obstinacy against the will of a people to be free. And their daughter was       gone.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;That Gaspar Ruiz had carried her off I understood very well. But as the       case was not foreseen, I had no instructions to pursue them. And certainly       I had no desire to do so. I had grown mistrustful of my interference. It       had never been successful, and had not even appeared creditable. He was       gone. Well, let him go. And he had carried off the Royalist girl! Nothing       better. Vaya con Dios. This was not the time to bother about a deserter       who, justly or unjustly, ought to have been dead, and a girl for whom it       would have been better to have never been born.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;So I marched my men back to the town.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;After a few days, order having been re-established, all the principal       families, including my own, left for Santiago. We had a fine house there.       At the same time the division of Robles was moved to new cantonments near       the capital. This change suited very well the state of my domestic and       amorous feelings.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;One night, rather late, I was called to my chief. I found General Robles       in his quarters, at ease, with his uniform off, drinking neat brandy out       of a tumbler&mdash;as a precaution, he used to say, against the       sleeplessness induced by the bites of mosquitoes. He was a good soldier,       and he taught me the art and practice of war. No doubt God has been       merciful to his soul; for his motives were never other than patriotic, if       his character was irascible. As to the use of mosquito nets, he considered       it effeminate, shameful&mdash;unworthy of a soldier. I noticed at the       first glance that his face, already very red, wore an expression of high       good-humour.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Aha! Senor teniente,&rsquo; he cried, loudly, as I saluted at the door.       &lsquo;Behold! Your strong man has turned up again.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He extended to me a folded letter, which I saw was superscribed &lsquo;To the       Commander-in-Chief of the Republican Armies.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;This,&rsquo; General Robles went on in his loud voice, &lsquo;was thrust by a boy       into the hand of a sentry at the Quartel General, while the fellow stood       there thinking of his girl, no doubt&mdash;for before he could gather his       wits together the boy had disappeared amongst the market people, and he       protests he could not recognize him to save his life.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;My chief told me further that the soldier had given the letter to the       sergeant of the guard, and that ultimately it had reached the hands of our       generalissimo. His Excellency had deigned to take cognizance of it with       his own eyes. After that he had referred the matter in confidence to       General Robles.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The letter, senores, I cannot now recollect textually. I saw the       signature of Gaspar Ruiz. He was an audacious fellow. He had snatched a       soul for himself out of a cataclysm, remember. And now it was that soul       which had dictated the terms of his letter. Its tone was very independent.       I remember it struck me at the time as noble&mdash;dignified. It was, no       doubt, her letter. Now I shudder at the depth of its duplicity. Gaspar       Ruiz was made to complain of the injustice of which he had been a victim.       He invoked his previous record of fidelity and courage. Having been saved       from death by the miraculous interposition of Providence, he could think       of nothing but of retrieving his character. This, he wrote, he could not       hope to do in the ranks as a discredited soldier still under suspicion. He       had the means to give a striking proof of his fidelity. He had ended by       proposing to the General-in-Chief a meeting at midnight in the middle of       the Plaza before the Moneta. The signal would be to strike fire with flint       and steel three times, which was not too conspicuous and yet distinctive       enough for recognition.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;San Martin, the great Liberator, loved men of audacity and courage.       Besides, he was just and compassionate. I told him as much of the man&rsquo;s       story as I knew, and was ordered to accompany him on the appointed night.       The signals were duly exchanged. It was midnight, and the whole town was       dark and silent. Their two cloaked figures came together in the centre of       the vast Plaza, and, keeping discreetly at a distance, I listened for an       hour or more to the murmur of their voices. Then the General motioned me       to approach; and as I did so I heard San Martin, who was courteous to       gentle and simple alike, offer Gaspar Ruiz the hospitality of the       headquarters for the night. But the soldier refused, saying that he would       be not worthy of that honour till he had done something.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;You cannot have a common deserter for your guest, Excellency,&rsquo; he       protested with a low laugh, and stepping backwards merged slowly into the       night.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The Commander-in-Chief observed to me, as we turned away: &lsquo;He had       somebody with him, our friend Ruiz. I saw two figures for a moment. It was       an unobtrusive companion.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I, too, had observed another figure join the vanishing form of Gaspar       Ruiz. It had the appearance of a short fellow in a poncho and a big hat.       And I wondered stupidly who it could be he had dared take into his       confidence. I might have guessed it could be no one but that fatal girl&mdash;alas!     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Where he kept her concealed I do not know. He had&mdash;it was known       afterwards&mdash;an uncle, his mother&rsquo;s brother, a small shopkeeper in       Santiago. Perhaps it was there that she found a roof and food. Whatever       she found, it was poor enough to exasperate her pride and keep up her       anger and hate. It is certain she did not accompany him on the feat he       undertook to accomplish first of all. It was nothing less than the       destruction of a store of war material collected secretly by the Spanish       authorities in the south, in a town called Linares. Gaspar Ruiz was       entrusted with a small party only, but they proved themselves worthy of       San Martin&rsquo;s confidence. The season was not propitious. They had to swim       swollen rivers. They seemed, however, to have galloped night and day       out-riding the news of their foray, and holding straight for the town, a       hundred miles into the enemy&rsquo;s country, till at break of day they rode       into it sword in hand, surprising the little garrison. It fled without       making a stand, leaving most of its officers in Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; hands.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;A great explosion of gunpowder ended the conflagration of the magazines       the raiders had set on fire without loss of time. In less than six hours       they were riding away at the same mad speed, without the loss of a single       man. Good as they were, such an exploit is not performed without a still       better leadership.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I was dining at the headquarters when Gaspar Ruiz himself brought the       news of his success. And it was a great blow to the Royalist troops. For a       proof he displayed to us the garrison&rsquo;s flag. He took it from under his       poncho and flung it on the table. The man was transfigured; there was       something exulting and menacing in the expression of his face. He stood       behind General San Martin&rsquo;s chair and looked proudly at us all. He had a       round blue cap edged with silver braid on his head, and we all could see a       large white scar on the nape of his sunburnt neck.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Somebody asked him what he had done with the captured Spanish officers.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He shrugged his shoulders scornfully. &lsquo;What a question to ask! In a       partisan war you do not burden yourself with prisoners. I let them go&mdash;and       here are their sword-knots.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He flung a bunch of them on the table upon the flag. Then General Robles,       whom I was attending there, spoke up in his loud, thick voice: &lsquo;You did!       Then, my brave friend, you do not know yet how a war like ours ought to be       conducted. You should have done&mdash;this.&rsquo; And he passed the edge of his       hand across his own throat.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Alas, senores! It was only too true that on both sides this contest, in       its nature so heroic, was stained by ferocity. The murmurs that arose at       General Robles&rsquo; words were by no means unanimous in tone. But the generous       and brave San Martin praised the humane action, and pointed out to Ruiz a       place on his right hand. Then rising with a full glass he proposed a       toast: &lsquo;Caballeros and comrades-in-arms, let us drink the health of       Captain Gaspar Ruiz.&rsquo; And when we had emptied our glasses: &lsquo;I intend,&rsquo; the       Commander-in-Chief continued, &lsquo;to entrust him with the guardianship of our       southern frontier, while we go afar to liberate our brethren in Peru. He       whom the enemy could not stop from striking a blow at his very heart will       know how to protect the peaceful populations we leave behind us to pursue       our sacred task.&rsquo; And he embraced the silent Gaspar Ruiz by his side.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Later on, when we all rose from table, I approached the latest officer of       the army with my congratulations. &lsquo;And, Captain Ruiz,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;perhaps       you do not mind telling a man who has always believed in the uprightness       of your character what became of Dona Erminia on that night?&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;At this friendly question his aspect changed. He looked at me from under       his eyebrows with the heavy, dull glance of a guasso&mdash;of a peasant.       &lsquo;Senor teniente,&rsquo; he said, thickly, and as if very much cast down, &lsquo;do not       ask me about the senorita, for I prefer not to think about her at all when       I am amongst you.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He looked, with a frown, all about the room, full of smoking and talking       officers. Of course I did not insist.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;These, senores, were the last words I was to hear him utter for a long,       long time. The very next day we embarked for our arduous expedition to       Peru, and we only heard of Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; doings in the midst of battles of       our own. He had been appointed military guardian of our southern province.       He raised a partida. But his leniency to the conquered foe displeased the       Civil Governor, who was a formal, uneasy man, full of suspicions. He       forwarded reports against Gaspar Ruiz to the Supreme Government; one of       them being that he had married publicly, with great pomp, a woman of       Royalist tendencies. Quarrels were sure to arise between these two men of       very different character. At last the Civil Governor began to complain of       his inactivity and to hint at treachery, which, he wrote, would be not       surprising in a man of such antecedents. Gaspar Ruiz heard of it. His rage       flamed up, and the woman ever by his side knew how to feed it with       perfidious words. I do not know whether really the Supreme Government ever       did&mdash;as he complained afterwards&mdash;send orders for his arrest. It       seems certain that the Civil Governor began to tamper with his officers,       and that Gaspar Ruiz discovered the fact.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;One evening, when the Governor was giving a tertullia, Gaspar Ruiz,       followed by six men he could trust, appeared riding through the town to       the door of the Government House, and entered the sala armed, his hat on       his head. As the Governor, displeased, advanced to meet him, he seized the       wretched man round the body, carried him off from the midst of the       appalled guests, as though he were a child, and flung him down the outer       steps into the street. An angry hug from Gaspar Ruiz was enough to crush       the life out of a giant; but in addition Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; horsemen fired their       pistols at the body of the Governor as it lay motionless at the bottom of       the stairs.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       X     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;After this&mdash;as he called it&mdash;act of justice, Ruiz crossed the       Rio Blanco, followed by the greater part of his band, and entrenched       himself upon a hill. A company of regular troops sent out foolishly       against him was surrounded, and destroyed almost to a man. Other       expeditions, though better organized, were equally unsuccessful.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;It was during these sanguinary skirmishes that his wife first began to       appear on horseback at his right hand. Rendered proud and self-confident       by his successes, Ruiz no longer charged at the head of his partida, but       presumptuously, like a general directing the movements of an army, he       remained in the rear, well mounted and motionless on an eminence, sending       out his orders. She was seen repeatedly at his side, and for a long time       was mistaken for a man. There was much talk then of a mysterious       white-faced chief, to whom the defeats of our troops were ascribed. She       rode like an Indian woman, astride, wearing a broad-rimmed man&rsquo;s hat and a       dark poncho. Afterwards, in the day of their greatest prosperity, this       poncho was embroidered in gold, and she wore then, also, the sword of poor       Don Antonio de Leyva. This veteran Chilian officer, having the misfortune       to be surrounded with his small force, and running short of ammunition,       found his death at the hands of the Arauco Indians, the allies and       auxiliaries of Gaspar Ruiz. This was the fatal affair long remembered       afterwards as the &lsquo;Massacre of the Island.&rsquo; The sword of the unhappy       officer was presented to her by Peneleo, the Araucanian chief; for these       Indians, struck by her aspect, the deathly pallor of her face, which no       exposure to the weather seemed to affect, and her calm indifference under       fire, looked upon her as a supernatural being, or at least as a witch. By       this superstition the prestige and authority of Gaspar Ruiz amongst these       ignorant people were greatly augmented. She must have savoured her       vengeance to the full on that day when she buckled on the sword of Don       Antonio de Leyva. It never left her side, unless she put on her woman&rsquo;s       clothes&mdash;not that she would or could ever use it, but she loved to       feel it beating upon her thigh as a perpetual reminder and symbol of the       dishonour to the arms of the Republic. She was insatiable. Moreover, on       the path she had led Gaspar Ruiz upon, there is no stopping. Escaped       prisoners&mdash;and they were not many&mdash;used to relate how with a few       whispered words she could change the expression of his face and revive his       flagging animosity. They told how after every skirmish, after every raid,       after every successful action, he would ride up to her and look into her       face. Its haughty calm was never relaxed. Her embrace, senores, must have       been as cold as the embrace of a statue. He tried to melt her icy heart in       a stream of warm blood. Some English naval officers who visited him at       that time noticed the strange character of his infatuation.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       At the movement of surprise and curiosity in his audience General       Santierra paused for a moment.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Yes&mdash;English naval officers,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Ruiz had consented to       receive them to arrange for the liberation of some prisoners of your       nationality. In the territory upon which he ranged, from sea coast to the       Cordillera, there was a bay where the ships of that time, after rounding       Cape Horn, used to resort for wood and water. There, decoying the crew on       shore, he captured first the whaling brig Hersalia, and afterwards made       himself master by surprise of two more ships, one English and one       American.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;It was rumoured at the time that he dreamed of setting up a navy of his       own. But that, of course, was impossible. Still, manning the brig with       part of her own crew, and putting an officer and a good many men of his       own on board, he sent her off to the Spanish Governor of the island of       Chiloe with a report of his exploits, and a demand for assistance in the       war against the rebels. The Governor could not do much for him; but he       sent in return two light field-pieces, a letter of compliments, with a       colonel&rsquo;s commission in the royal forces, and a great Spanish flag. This       standard with much ceremony was hoisted over his house in the heart of the       Arauco country. Surely on that day she may have smiled on her guasso       husband with a less haughty reserve.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The senior officer of the English squadron on our coast made       representations to our Government as to these captures. But Gaspar Ruiz       refused to treat with us. Then an English frigate proceeded to the bay,       and her captain, doctor, and two lieutenants travelled inland under a       safe-conduct. They were well received, and spent three days as guests of       the partisan chief. A sort of military barbaric state was kept up at the       residence. It was furnished with the loot of frontier towns. When first       admitted to the principal sala, they saw his wife lying down (she was not       in good health then), with Gaspar Ruiz sitting at the foot of the couch.       His hat was lying on the floor, and his hands reposed on the hilt of his       sword.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;During that first conversation he never removed his big hands from the       sword-hilt, except once, to arrange the coverings about her, with gentle,       careful touches. They noticed that whenever she spoke he would fix his       eyes upon her in a kind of expectant, breathless attention, and seemingly       forget the existence of the world and his own existence, too. In the       course of the farewell banquet, at which she was present reclining on her       couch, he burst forth into complaints of the treatment he had received.       After General San Martin&rsquo;s departure he had been beset by spies, slandered       by civil officials, his services ignored, his liberty and even his life       threatened by the Chilian Government. He got up from the table, thundered       execrations pacing the room wildly, then sat down on the couch at his       wife&rsquo;s feet, his breast heaving, his eyes fixed on the floor. She reclined       on her back, her head on the cushions, her eyes nearly closed.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;And now I am an honoured Spanish officer,&rsquo; he added in a calm voice.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The captain of the English frigate then took the opportunity to inform       him gently that Lima had fallen, and that by the terms of a convention the       Spaniards were withdrawing from the whole continent.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Gaspar Ruiz raised his head, and without hesitation, speaking with       suppressed vehemence, declared that if not a single Spanish soldier were       left in the whole of South America he would persist in carrying on the       contest against Chile to the last drop of blood. When he finished that mad       tirade his wife&rsquo;s long white hand was raised, and she just caressed his       knee with the tips of her fingers for a fraction of a second.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;For the rest of the officers&rsquo; stay, which did not extend for more than       half an hour after the banquet, that ferocious chieftain of a desperate       partida overflowed with amiability and kindness. He had been hospitable       before, but now it seemed as though he could not do enough for the comfort       and safety of his visitors&rsquo; journey back to their ship.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Nothing, I have been told, could have presented a greater contrast to his       late violence or the habitual taciturn reserve of his manner. Like a man       elated beyond measure by an unexpected happiness, he overflowed with       good-will, amiability, and attentions. He embraced the officers like       brothers, almost with tears in his eyes. The released prisoners were       presented each with a piece of gold. At the last moment, suddenly, he       declared he could do no less than restore to the masters of the merchant       vessels all their private property. This unexpected generosity caused some       delay in the departure of the party, and their first march was very short.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Late in the evening Gaspar Ruiz rode up with an escort, to their camp       fires, bringing along with him a mule loaded with cases of wine. He had       come, he said, to drink a stirrup cup with his English friends, whom he       would never see again. He was mellow and joyous in his temper. He told       stories of his own exploits, laughed like a boy, borrowed a guitar from       the Englishmen&rsquo;s chief muleteer, and sitting cross-legged on his superfine       poncho spread before the glow of the embers, sang a guasso love-song in a       tender voice. Then his head dropped on his breast, his hands fell to the       ground; the guitar rolled off his knees&mdash;and a great hush fell over       the camp after the love-song of the implacable partisan who had made so       many of our people weep for destroyed homes and for loves cut short.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Before anybody could make a sound he sprang up from the ground and called       for his horse.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Adios, my friends!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Go with God. I love you. And tell them       well in Santiago that between Gaspar Ruiz, colonel of the King of Spain,       and the republican carrion-crows of Chile there is war to the last breath&mdash;war!       war! war!&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;With a great yell of &lsquo;War! war! war!&rsquo; which his escort took up, they rode       away, and the sound of hoofs and of voices died out in the distance       between the slopes of the hills.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The two young English officers were convinced that Ruiz was mad. How do       you say that?&mdash;tile loose&mdash;eh? But the doctor, an observant       Scotsman with much shrewdness and philosophy in his character, told me       that it was a very curious case of possession. I met him many years       afterwards, but he remembered the experience very well. He told me, too,       that in his opinion that woman did not lead Gaspar Ruiz into the practice       of sanguinary treachery by direct persuasion, but by the subtle way of       awakening and keeping alive in his simple mind a burning sense of an       irreparable wrong. Maybe, maybe. But I would say that she poured half of       her vengeful soul into the strong clay of that man, as you may pour       intoxication, madness, poison into an empty cup.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;If he wanted war he got it in earnest when our victorious army began to       return from Peru. Systematic operations were planned against this blot on       the honour and prosperity of our hardly won independence. General Robles       commanded, with his well-known ruthless severity. Savage reprisals were       exercised on both sides and no quarter was given in the field. Having won       my promotion in the Peru campaign, I was a captain on the staff. Gaspar       Ruiz found himself hard pressed; at the same time we heard by means of a       fugitive priest who had been carried off from his village presbytery and       galloped eighty miles into the hills to perform the christening ceremony,       that a daughter was born to them. To celebrate the event, I suppose, Ruiz       executed one or two brilliant forays clear away at the rear of our forces,       and defeated the detachments sent out to cut off his retreat. General       Robles nearly had a stroke of apoplexy from rage. He found another cause       of insomnia than the bites of mosquitoes; but against this one, senores,       tumblers of raw brandy had no more effect than so much water. He took to       railing and storming at me about my strong man. And from our impatience to       end this inglorious campaign I am afraid that all we young officers became       reckless and apt to take undue risks on service.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Nevertheless, slowly, inch by inch as it were, our columns were closing       upon Gaspar Ruiz, though he had managed to raise all the Araucanian nation       of wild Indians against us. Then a year or more later our Government       became aware through its agents and spies that he had actually entered       into alliance with Carreras, the so-called dictator of the so-called       republic of Mendoza, on the other side of the mountains. Whether Gaspar       Ruiz had a deep political intention, or whether he wished only to secure a       safe retreat for his wife and child while he pursued remorselessly against       us his war of surprises and massacres, I cannot tell. The alliance,       however, was a fact. Defeated in his attempt to check our advance from the       sea, he retreated with his usual swiftness, and preparing for another hard       and hazardous tussle, began by sending his wife with the little girl       across the Pequena range of mountains, on the frontier of Mendoza.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       XI     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Now Carreras, under the guise of politics and liberalism, was a scoundrel       of the deepest dye, and the unhappy state of Mendoza was the prey of       thieves, robbers, traitors, and murderers, who formed his party. He was       under a noble exterior a man without heart, pity, honour, or conscience.       He aspired to nothing but tyranny, and though he would have made use of       Gaspar Ruiz for his nefarious designs, yet he soon became aware that to       propitiate the Chilian Government would answer his purpose better. I blush       to say that he made proposals to our Government to deliver up on certain       conditions the wife and child of the man who had trusted to his honour,       and that this offer was accepted.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;While on her way to Mendoza over the Pequena Pass she was betrayed by her       escort of Carreras&rsquo; men, and given up to the officer in command of a       Chilian fort on the upland at the foot of the main Cordillera range. This       atrocious transaction might have cost me dear, for as a matter of fact I       was a prisoner in Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; camp when he received the news. I had been       captured during a reconnaissance, my escort of a few troopers being       speared by the Indians of his bodyguard. I was saved from the same fate       because he recognized my features just in time. No doubt my friends       thought I was dead, and I would not have given much for my life at any       time. But the strong man treated me very well, because, he said, I had       always believed in his innocence and had tried to serve him when he was a       victim of injustice.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; was his speech to me, &lsquo;you shall see that I always speak the       truth. You are safe.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I did not think I was very safe when I was called up to go to him one       night. He paced up and down like a wild beast, exclaiming, &lsquo;Betrayed!       Betrayed!&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He walked up to me clenching his fists. &lsquo;I could cut your throat.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Will that give your wife back to you?&rsquo; I said as quietly as I could.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;And the child!&rsquo; he yelled out, as if mad. He fell into a chair and       laughed in a frightful, boisterous manner. &lsquo;Oh, no, you are safe.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I assured him that his wife&rsquo;s life was safe, too; but I did not say what       I was convinced of&mdash;that he would never see her again. He wanted war       to the death, and the war could only end with his death.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He gave me a strange, inexplicable look, and sat muttering blankly, &lsquo;In       their hands. In their hands.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I kept as still as a mouse before a cat.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Suddenly he jumped up. &lsquo;What am I doing here?&rsquo; he cried; and opening the       door, he yelled out orders to saddle and mount. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he       stammered, coming up to me. &lsquo;The Pequena fort; a fort of palisades!       Nothing. I would get her back if she were hidden in the very heart of the       mountain.&rsquo; He amazed me by adding, with an effort: &lsquo;I carried her off in       my two arms while the earth trembled. And the child at least is mine. She       at least is mine!&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Those were bizarre words; but I had no time for wonder.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;You shall go with me,&rsquo; he said, violently. &lsquo;I may want to parley, and       any other messenger from Ruiz, the outlaw, would have his throat cut.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;This was true enough. Between him and the rest of incensed mankind there       could be no communication, according to the customs of honourable warfare.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;In less than half an hour we were in the saddle, flying wildly through       the night. He had only an escort of twenty men at his quarters, but would       not wait for more. He sent, however, messengers to Peneleo, the Indian       chief then ranging in the foothills, directing him to bring his warriors       to the uplands and meet him at the lake called the Eye of Water, near       whose shores the frontier fort of Pequena was built.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;We crossed the lowlands with that untired rapidity of movement which had       made Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; raids so famous. We followed the lower valleys up to       their precipitous heads. The ride was not without its dangers. A cornice       road on a perpendicular wall of basalt wound itself around a buttressing       rock, and at last we emerged from the gloom of a deep gorge upon the       upland of Pequena.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;It was a plain of green wiry grass and thin flowering bushes; but high       above our heads patches of snow hung in the folds and crevices of the       great walls of rock. The little lake was as round as a staring eye. The       garrison of the fort were just driving in their small herd of cattle when       we appeared. Then the great wooden gates swung to, and that four-square       enclosure of broad blackened stakes pointed at the top and barely hiding       the grass roofs of the huts inside seemed deserted, empty, without a       single soul.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;But when summoned to surrender, by a man who at Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; order rode       fearlessly forward those inside answered by a volley which rolled him and       his horse over. I heard Ruiz by my side grind his teeth. &lsquo;It does not       matter,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Now you go.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Torn and faded as its rags were, the vestiges of my uniform were       recognized, and I was allowed to approach within speaking distance; and       then I had to wait, because a voice clamouring through a loophole with joy       and astonishment would not allow me to place a word. It was the voice of       Major Pajol, an old friend. He, like my other comrades, had thought me       killed a long time ago.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Put spurs to your horse, man!&rsquo; he yelled, in the greatest excitement;       &lsquo;we will swing the gate open for you.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I let the reins fall out of my hand and shook my head. &lsquo;I am on my       honour,&rsquo; I cried.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;To him!&rsquo; he shouted, with infinite disgust.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;He promises you your life.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Our life is our own. And do you, Santierra, advise us to surrender to       that rastrero?&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;No!&rsquo; I shouted. &lsquo;But he wants his wife and child, and he can cut you off       from water.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Then she would be the first to suffer. You may tell him that. Look here&mdash;this       is all nonsense: we shall dash out and capture you.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;You shall not catch me alive,&rsquo; I said, firmly.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Imbecile!&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; I continued, hastily, &lsquo;do not open the gate.&rsquo; And I       pointed at the multitude of Peneleo&rsquo;s Indians who covered the shores of       the lake.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I had never seen so many of these savages together. Their lances seemed       as numerous as stalks of grass. Their hoarse voices made a vast,       inarticulate sound like the murmur of the sea.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;My friend Pajol was swearing to himself. &lsquo;Well, then&mdash;go to the       devil!&rsquo; he shouted, exasperated. But as I swung round he repented, for I       heard him say hurriedly, &lsquo;Shoot the fool&rsquo;s horse before he gets away.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He had good marksmen. Two shots rang out, and in the very act of turning       my horse staggered, fell and lay still as if struck by lightning. I had my       feet out of the stirrups and rolled clear of him; but I did not attempt to       rise. Neither dared they rush out to drag me in.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The masses of Indians had begun to move upon the fort. They rode up in       squadrons, trailing their long chusos; then dismounted out of musket-shot,       and, throwing off their fur mantles, advanced naked to the attack,       stamping their feet and shouting in cadence. A sheet of flame ran three       times along the face of the fort without checking their steady march. They       crowded right up to the very stakes, flourishing their broad knives. But       this palisade was not fastened together with hide lashings in the usual       way, but with long iron nails, which they could not cut. Dismayed at the       failure of their usual method of forcing an entrance, the heathen, who had       marched so steadily against the musketry fire, broke and fled under the       volleys of the besieged.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Directly they had passed me on their advance I got up and rejoined Gaspar       Ruiz on a low ridge which jutted out upon the plain. The musketry of his       own men had covered the attack, but now at a sign from him a trumpet       sounded the &lsquo;Cease fire.&rsquo; Together we looked in silence at the hopeless       rout of the savages.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;It must be a siege, then,&rsquo; he muttered. And I detected him wringing his       hands stealthily.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;But what sort of siege could it be? Without any need for me to repeat my       friend Pajol&rsquo;s message, he dared not cut the water off from the besieged.       They had plenty of meat. And, indeed, if they had been short he would have       been too anxious to send food into the stockade had he been able. But, as       a matter of fact, it was we on the plain who were beginning to feel the       pinch of hunger.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Peneleo, the Indian chief, sat by our fire folded in his ample mantle of       guanaco skins. He was an athletic savage, with an enormous square shock       head of hair resembling a straw beehive in shape and size, and with grave,       surly, much-lined features. In his broken Spanish he repeated, growling       like a bad-tempered wild beast, that if an opening ever so small were made       in the stockade his men would march in and get the senora&mdash;not       otherwise.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Gaspar Ruiz, sitting opposite him, kept his eyes fixed on the fort night       and day as it were, in awful silence and immobility. Meantime, by runners       from the lowlands that arrived nearly every day, we heard of the defeat of       one of his lieutenants in the Maipu valley. Scouts sent afar brought news       of a column of infantry advancing through distant passes to the relief of       the fort. They were slow, but we could trace their toilful progress up the       lower valleys. I wondered why Ruiz did not march to attack and destroy       this threatening force, in some wild gorge fit for an ambuscade, in       accordance with his genius for guerilla warfare. But his genius seemed to       have abandoned him to his despair.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;It was obvious to me that he could not tear himself away from the sight       of the fort.
