Title: The Prince of Ashes
Chapter One: The Ashen Crown

The fire had long since died in the Great Hearth of Caer Lothewyn, and with it, warmth seemed to have fled the ancient castle. Frost crept like ivy across the stone walls, and the silence was not so much the absence of sound as it was the presence of something darker. In the heart of this withering stronghold stood Prince Corwin, seventeen winters old and barely taller than the iron candelabra beside him. Yet there was a sharpness in his gaze—like the sword he kept hidden beneath his cloak, against royal decorum, against his father’s will.

King Edric, his father, had grown distant since the death of Queen Maerwen two years prior. Some whispered he conversed with shadows in the upper tower. Others claimed the queen’s passing had fractured more than his heart—it had cracked the very earth of Lothewyn. And as the realm fell into drought and plague, as rivers dried and crops blackened, people began to speak openly of the Ashen Curse.

It began in the east, they said. In the fallen land of Varoduun. A sorceress named Elthera, once spurned by the king’s court, had returned from exile with a vengeance forged in black flame. They said she called upon the Wyrms of the Hollow Sky, struck a pact with dead gods, and loosed a blight upon the land. No birds sang in the east now. No child was born without weeping.

“You’re not listening, Corwin,” said Lady Mariel, his tutor and one of the last left in court who dared address him as kin rather than title. “You drift again. These histories are not just tales. They are warnings.”

“I listen,” Corwin said, his voice low. “But there is no wisdom in memorizing doom.”

Mariel shut the tome of old legends with a sigh. “There is if you hope to avoid repeating it. Elthera was no mere sorceress. She was the first of the Hollowed. Mark that name.”

Corwin turned to the frost-glazed window. Below, the courtyard was empty but for the crows. Too many crows these days, some say. Too clever by far.

It was on the eve of the Blood Moon that Corwin first saw the sigil in his dreams.

A crown of ash. A sword wrapped in thorns. And a city of glass, shattering.

He woke choking on soot.

Three days passed before he received the letter. It was sealed in crimson wax with no crest, and the parchment smelled faintly of myrrh and something older—earth turned in a grave. The writing was not ink but rust, perhaps blood.

To Prince Corwin of the Hollow Line,

When the bells toll thrice and no hand moves them, ride east. Bring none but blade and bone. The Queen of Embers waits.

There was no signature.

Corwin burned the letter, but the words stayed etched in his mind.

The next morning, the bells rang. No wind blew, no servant moved. Still, the chimes sang.

“You will not go,” King Edric roared, slamming a goblet against the arm of his throne. “The east is death. It is madness. And you are a child!”

“I am no child,” Corwin said, voice firm. “And I will not wait here to die under stone and silence. I was born under fire. Let me meet it.”

The court fell to whispers. Mariel stepped forward, her eyes narrowed, conflicted.

“Majesty,” she said to the king, “if this is a summons... it may be our last hope. If the Queen of Embers is who I suspect—”

“You dare speak her name!” Edric snarled. “She was banished. Let her rot beyond the Veil.”

Corwin stepped forward. “If she holds power against Elthera, then we need her. If she is the enemy, then I will end her.”

“You will die,” Edric spat.

“Then I will die trying,” Corwin answered. And with that, he left the hall.

He took only his blade—Wyrmfang, named for its jagged edge and silver-steel sheen—and the mare Fenn, a black-eyed steed bred from the cold valleys of Branraen. Mariel gave him an amulet before he departed, a simple iron loop with a shard of green stone.

“To ward off what watches,” she said, pressing it into his palm.

He didn’t ask what.

The east was not as the maps claimed.

Once past the town of Hollowmere, the land cracked like glass. Forests bled sap black as ink, and the wind carried whispers like names half-remembered.

Corwin camped beneath a dead elm his second night out and was awoken by a girl in rags standing above him. Her eyes were pale as pearls and her mouth stitched shut. She pointed east and vanished in the blink of sleep.

On the third day, he found the village of Caer Brenyn.

Or what remained.

Bodies frozen mid-motion, faces twisted in silent screams. Birds pecked at empty eyes, and a lone child sat atop a well, humming a song Corwin didn’t recognize. She wore a crown of bones and smiled with too many teeth.

“Are you the prince?” she asked.

He drew Wyrmfang.

The child vanished into smoke.

It was in the Vale of Smoke that he met his first true companion.

A man clad in wolf pelts, eyes like storm glass. He called himself Ardyn.

“I was a sword once,” Ardyn said. “Then I broke. Now I’m a question.”

Corwin didn’t ask what that meant.

They traveled together, mostly in silence. But Ardyn could fight—wielding twin axes and a strange fire that danced between his fingers in moments of rage.

“There are others,” Ardyn said one night. “Others like you. Called. Marked. Some ride north, some south. All roads end in the same ash.”

Corwin stared into the fire. “Then let’s make them burn.”

They crossed into Varoduun beneath a moon the color of coal. Here, the sky never brightened, and the stars seemed absent—like they had turned their backs on the world.

They were ambushed on the Black Steps, a ruin of stairs leading to nowhere. Hollowed Ones. Creatures once men, now burned inside by Elthera’s curse. Their eyes glowed red, and they moved without breath.

Corwin slew three before he fell, blood running from his shoulder. Ardyn’s fire saved them, but the wounds festered.

A voice spoke to Corwin in his fever. A woman’s voice, and not unkind.

You are the flame that forgets. Come to me, and I will give you your name.

He awoke beneath stone spires, and a woman stood before him in robes of ember and coal.

“I am the Queen of Embers,” she said. “And you are late.”

Corwin’s hand went instinctively to the hilt of Wyrmfang, but the Queen of Embers only lifted one delicate brow, her eyes like molten amber. Her voice was not what he had expected. Neither cruel nor imperial, but tired. Ancient.

“There is no need for steel here,” she said. “If I meant you harm, you’d be nothing but dust.”

He hesitated, watching the way her feet stirred no ash where she stepped. Around them, the ruins whispered. Jagged pillars of obsidian rose from scorched earth, forming a kind of cathedral of ruin. The sky above was choked by smoke, yet here, at the summit of the world’s wound, the air shimmered strangely. The temperature shifted not by season, but by memory—warm one moment, bitter the next, as though grief shaped the very weather.

“You sent the letter,” he said finally.

The Queen inclined her head. “I did. Though I did not write it with ink.”

“What do you want from me?”

“I want nothing, Prince of Ash. But the world does.” She turned away, walking toward the largest of the spires. “Come. There are things you must see.”

Corwin followed. Ardyn trailed behind him, his gait uneven from the last battle, though he said nothing. The fire-wielder had grown more reserved the closer they came to the ruins. Like something here unsettled even him.

The Queen led them into a corridor beneath the tallest spire. There, embedded into the stone, were murals etched in silver and coal. They moved faintly, like shadows trapped in glass. Corwin paused before one—a figure in a torn crown, flames rising from his eyes. Beneath him, a field of ash. The next mural showed a dragon—no, not a dragon. A wyrm. The Wyrm of the Hollow Sky. Its body coiled around the same spire they now stood in. Its eyes were closed, but smoke still curled from its nostrils.

“These are memories,” the Queen said. “Not images. We do not preserve history here—we trap it.”

“Why bring me here?” Corwin asked. “What am I to you?”

She turned and studied him. “You are the last spark of a dying line. The Hollowed curse feeds on lineage, on broken bonds and burned oaths. Your father’s guilt runs deep, and it seeps through the kingdom like poison.”

Corwin’s jaw tensed. “This isn’t his doing. This is Elthera’s—she cast the first spell.”

The Queen’s lips curved into something like pity. “Spells are not born from nothing. They are answers to wounds too long ignored. Elthera may have struck the match, but your house left the forest dry.”

He wanted to argue. He wanted to draw Wyrmfang and demand she explain herself. But he couldn’t deny the truth in her words. His father had banished Elthera, yes—but she had once been his advisor, and more, according to rumor. Some said she had borne him a child. Others claimed she had warned of the famine, the droughts, the broken balance between magic and crown. And in response, the king had cast her out like carrion.

“And now?” Corwin asked. “What am I supposed to do?”

“You will walk the Nine Paths,” she said. “Face what your line has broken. Each path holds a fragment of the world’s undoing. If you survive, you will forge the Ashen Crown. Only then can you challenge Elthera.”

“I thought she was just a sorceress.”

“She was,” the Queen said. “Now, she is a god.”

The Nine Paths were not roads, but realms—each one a memory made solid, a trial of heart and fire. Corwin’s first would be the Vale of Echoes, where the voices of the dead never ceased. To enter, he had to leave behind something of himself.

“Sacrifice is the gatekeeper,” the Queen told him. “What will you offer?”

Corwin glanced at Ardyn, then at the Queen. Slowly, he drew Wyrmfang and held it out.

“Take it.”

Ardyn swore under his breath. “You fool.”

But the Queen only smiled, and took the blade. “Bold. Most give blood. You give strength.”

She waved her hand, and the air cracked. A seam opened in the space before them—like light being peeled back. Corwin stepped through.

He found himself in a field of white poppies, all swaying in a wind he could not feel. A gray sun hung in the sky like a dying lantern, and all around him, voices whispered. Soft. Endless. Some sobbed. Others laughed. A few called his name.

He turned in circles, unsure where to step. No paths were marked.

“Corwin.”

He froze. That voice. He hadn’t heard it in two years.

“Mother?” he whispered.

She stood among the poppies, her dress the color of morning fog, her hair as silver as moonlight.

“You should not be here,” she said.

Tears pricked his eyes. “You died.”

“I did. But death is not always a door. Sometimes, it is a mirror.”

He wanted to run to her, but his feet would not move.

“You are not ready,” she said gently. “The crown is not won by swordplay. You must become what your name means. Do you know what Corwin means?”

He shook his head.

“Heart of ash. It does not burn. It endures.”

She vanished, and the poppies turned black.

He stumbled out of the Vale three days later, gaunt and shaking. The Queen of Embers waited beside a new fire, and beside her, a sword. Wyrmfang—but changed. Its blade glowed faintly, and the hilt now bore the crest of a crowned flame.

“You’ve begun,” she said.

Corwin nodded, eyes hollow. “How many more?”

“Eight.”

Ardyn helped him to his feet. “I told you. All roads end in ash.”

Corwin looked toward the east, where the sky bled smoke.

“Then let’s walk.”

The days following his trial in the Vale of Echoes blurred into a strange rhythm—half real, half dream. Corwin spent most hours in silence, recovering by the Queen’s fire, eating the bitter roots and salted meat offered by her attendants—silent, pale-faced women who moved without speaking and vanished when not looked upon. Ardyn, ever restless, sharpened his twin axes or paced the perimeter of the Queen’s sanctuary, muttering to himself in a language Corwin didn’t know. Whatever trials the fire-wielder had endured in his past, they had left marks deeper than wounds.

It was on the fourth day, when Corwin’s fever finally broke and his strength returned, that the Queen summoned him again—not into the ruins, but out onto the rim of the eastern cliffs, where the land dropped off into a void that once was a sea.

“Look,” she said.

Corwin did. Far below, what had once been ocean was now cracked basin, its depths scorched black and filled with jagged rocks like teeth. Pools of molten glass shimmered between them, and here and there, strange figures crawled—tall and thin, with arms too long for their bodies, their heads crowned with spiraling horns of ash. They moved in slow circles, as if in search of something long forgotten.

“They are what remain of the Seabound,” the Queen murmured, her eyes distant. “Fishermen, traders, mothers, sailors. All of them caught in the tide of Elthera’s reckoning. When she cursed the Hollow Line, the sea answered. It retreated not in anger, but in mourning.”

Corwin watched them for a long time. “Can they be saved?”

“No,” she said, with a finality that chilled him. “But the cause of their suffering can be undone. And that is what matters.”

He wanted to believe her. He wanted to believe that somewhere in this fractured, flame-scoured land, salvation could still be found. But it was hard to keep faith when the world wore its scars so plainly, and when every answer brought more questions.

“What lies on the second path?” he asked quietly.

The Queen didn’t answer at first. She traced her fingers along the edge of the wind, as if reading it like parchment.

“The Path of Cinders,” she said at last. “It leads into the Ashen Wold, where time burns backward. Memories become monsters. Regret takes form.”

“And what must I give to enter it?”

Her gaze returned to him, heavy with something deeper than sorrow.

“Your certainty.”

Corwin frowned. “What does that mean?”

“You’ll know when you lose it.”

That night, he dreamed of his father—not as the man he knew now, bent by guilt and wine, but as he once was: tall and proud, his beard dark with youth, his eyes filled with fierce love. He remembered riding on his shoulders, remembered the deep rumble of Edric’s laughter, the way his hand had always been warm when it closed around Corwin’s small one. Then the dream shifted, as dreams always do. Edric turned away, and Corwin called out—but the king did not stop. He walked into a room of fire, and the door closed behind him.

Corwin awoke shivering.

They departed at dawn. The Queen gave him a small pouch of black dust and told him to scatter it when the air grew too thick with memory. “It will grant you clarity for a time,” she explained, “though not peace.”

Ardyn said nothing as they rode out, but his gaze was sharp, and his silence heavy with meaning. The further they moved from the ruins, the more twisted the world became. Trees grew with their roots above ground, their leaves shaped like hands reaching skyward. Stones hummed with old names, and once, they passed a pond that reflected not their present selves, but younger versions—Corwin as a boy, Ardyn as a man in shining armor, though he wore no such thing now.

The Path of Cinders began at a broken archway deep in the woods. There was no sign, no guide. Only a warmth on the air, and a faint whispering that tickled Corwin’s ears with words he couldn’t quite catch.

Beyond the arch, the Ashen Wold unfolded like a wound.

It was not night, but no light penetrated the canopy. Ash fell like snow, coating the ground in pale grey. The trees groaned as if in pain, and shadows moved in ways that made no sense. At times, Corwin thought he saw himself walking alongside him—a duplicate that flickered at the edge of his vision. Other times, it was his mother. Once, it was Mariel.

The deeper they went, the heavier his limbs felt. Not from fatigue, but from memory. Thoughts that should have been buried rose unbidden: his shame at failing to comfort his father after Maerwen’s death, the time he struck a servant boy in anger and never apologized, the countless nights he dreamed of running, not fighting. These recollections became voices, and then the voices became forms.

They came upon a glade where fire hung in the air like fog. Figures walked through it—ghosts made of smoke and regret. One, a man with half a face, wept without tears. Another, a woman holding a child that screamed soundlessly. They didn’t attack, only watched. Judged.

Corwin nearly dropped to his knees.

“Don’t speak to them,” Ardyn warned quietly. “They’re not yours. Not really.”

“They feel like mine.”

“They always do.”

It was not until the second night in the Wold that Corwin understood what the Queen had meant about certainty.

They found a cabin—strangely intact, tucked between two black trees. Desperate for rest, they entered, and within, Corwin found something that made his breath catch.

The cabin was his. Not some abstract image of it, but the exact shape and smell of his boyhood chambers in Caer Lothewyn. The rug with the stag embroidery. The wooden toy sword by the hearth. Even the etching he’d made on the window ledge when he was nine. Everything was as it had been.

“Do you see it too?” he asked Ardyn.

Ardyn’s eyes were narrowed. “I see ruin. Dead stone. Dust. Whatever you’re seeing—it’s not for me.”

Corwin blinked. The vision shimmered.

Then it began to speak.

“It’s safe here, Corwin,” said the room, though no mouth moved. “You don’t need to carry the burden. Let go. Let someone else fight. There is no shame in surrender.”

He stepped back. “No.”

“But you’re tired,” the voice urged. “And alone. Let us take your name. You can live here, in peace, as before.”

The ash thickened, and suddenly, it wasn’t just a room—it was Maerwen herself, standing in the hearth-light, arms open.

“Don’t you miss me, my heart?”

“I do,” he whispered, tears blurring his sight. “But I can’t stay.”

“Then you’ll die,” she said, and her voice split into many. All the ghosts spoke now, all the regrets. “You’ll die, and the world will follow.”

Corwin drew Wyrmfang and drove it through the hearth.

The vision shattered like glass, and the ash storm lifted. The world returned to its grey, unwelcoming self.

And Corwin stood, gasping, alone but for Ardyn and the sword that now bled embers from its edge.

“Now you understand,” Ardyn said.

Corwin nodded. “The path doesn’t test your strength. It tests your reason to keep walking.”

And walk he did.

By the time they emerged from the Ashen Wold, the second shard of the Ashen Crown had formed around the base of Wyrmfang’s hilt. A ring of black gold, faintly pulsing.

Two paths down. Seven remained.

The Queen of Embers waited at the border, seated beside a fire that roared with white flame.

“You carry less,” she observed as he approached. “That is the mark of the true heir.”

“I don’t feel stronger,” he admitted.

“You’re not. But you’re clearer. And that clarity will become strength.”

He sat beside her, and for a while, they watched the fire in silence.

In the distance, the land stirred. Something vast was awakening. Something ancient.

And Corwin knew the true test had not even begun.

Chapter Two: The Hollow Sky

The stars were gone.

Corwin noticed it the moment he crossed into the Third Path. Not that the sky was covered—there were no clouds, no storms, no ash swirling above. The heavens were simply… blank. As though the firmament had been scraped clean, as though some god had wiped the stars away like chalk from slate. And beneath that emptiness, the land stretched outward in slopes of black iron and shimmering dust. It looked almost beautiful from a distance—like a desert made of starlight. But as they descended into the basin, beauty gave way to something else.

It was called the Hollow Sky.

A place where gravity faltered, and memory warped. It had once been a sacred observatory, according to the Queen of Embers, built by the Old Priests before even the first kings of Lothewyn. They had studied the heavens not for knowledge, but for warning, believing the stars to be wounds in the veil between worlds. And when the Hollowed curse fell, this place had collapsed inward—not physically, but existentially. It had become less, somehow. And everything inside it remembered being something else.

Corwin rode silently beside Ardyn, neither speaking. Fenn, his mare, was nervous—her hooves left no prints, though they sank into the strange dust. Ardyn’s fire flickered constantly at his fingertips, not for light but for reassurance. The flame burned blue here, and its shape twisted unnaturally, as though resisting form.

“There’s no wind,” Corwin said at last.

Ardyn nodded. “Because the air’s not real.”

He wanted to question that, but already he could feel it. The way his breath didn’t leave condensation. The way he never felt thirsty, even after hours without water. The way their shadows no longer matched their movements.

“There’s something wrong with this place,” Corwin muttered.

“There’s something wrong with you,” a voice whispered.

He froze. It wasn’t Ardyn. The fire-wielder had gone still, eyes scanning the horizon.

The voice came again, soft, male, and oddly familiar.

“Corwin. You shouldn’t have come. There’s nothing here for you but truth.”

A figure stood ahead, right in their path. Corwin dismounted, hand on Wyrmfang’s hilt, but the blade buzzed strangely in its sheath—as though unsure of its own reality. The figure wore no armor, no crown. Just a traveler’s cloak. And as it stepped closer, Corwin felt his heart twist.

It was him.

Or rather, a version of him. Older. Sharper. The face was the same, but the eyes had seen things Corwin had not. They were lined with regret, with wisdom. With power.

“What is this?” he asked.

The double tilted its head. “What you could become.”

“Or what I must fight?” he challenged.

The echo smiled faintly. “No. I am not your enemy. I am your end.”

Corwin drew Wyrmfang slowly. “Then why appear at all?”

“To warn you. The Hollow Sky reveals what is most likely. Not what is most true. You will see many roads here. You’ll be tempted by some. Terrified by others. But only one leads to what must be done.”

“And what is that?”

“To break the world.”

Corwin hesitated. “That’s what Elthera wants.”

“Then perhaps she sees clearer than you.”

With that, the echo faded, scattering like dust in the still air.

They found the observatory ruins three hours later—a crown of broken towers atop a hill that bent space around it. From the outside, the structure looked infinite, though no more than a hundred paces across. As they climbed, the sensation of being observed grew stronger, though nothing stirred.

The entrance was a yawning arch lined with stone carvings—constellations twisted into the shapes of beasts, thrones, swords, and one that resembled a serpent swallowing its tail. Corwin reached out to touch the nearest one, and a jolt went through him. He fell back, gasping.

“What did you see?” Ardyn asked, his voice low.

Corwin took a moment before replying. “Not a vision. A question.”

He didn’t elaborate. Because the question burned still: Would you let the world die to save her?

But he didn’t even know who her was.

Inside the observatory, time buckled. The walls were mirrors that reflected not light, but moments. Each step forward pulled them sideways, and each chamber opened into five others. Echoes of the past spilled through cracks in the stone. Corwin saw flickers of his birth, the death of Maerwen, his father’s coronation. He even saw Ardyn once—standing at the gates of a burning city, face streaked with ash, holding a child in his arms before handing it to a woman made of flame.

“What happened to the child?” Corwin asked.

Ardyn’s face darkened. “I failed him.”

They moved on.

Eventually, they reached the central chamber—a vast circular room with no ceiling, only a void above. Suspended in that void was a ring of stone tablets, spinning slowly, inscribed with names. One by one, they turned to face Corwin.

The first bore his father’s name. The second, his mother’s. The third, his own.

The fourth was blank.

The stone spoke.

“To wear the Crown of Ash, you must leave behind the Sky of Fire. To light the world anew, you must become the end of all things.”

“What does that mean?” Corwin demanded. “Speak plainly.”

The stone did not answer.

Instead, a low sound filled the room—a scraping, like bone against metal. Ardyn stepped closer to the edge of the chamber and peered down into the pit that formed its center.

“There’s something coming,” he said.

They readied their weapons. From the pit rose a creature unlike any Corwin had seen before. It had no skin, only sinew and flame, and its face was a shifting mask of those Corwin had known—his mother, his father, himself, Mariel, even Elthera. It did not roar. It wept.

“The Herald of the Hollow,” Ardyn muttered. “It guards the Third Path.”

Corwin lunged, and the battle began.

The creature moved not with speed, but inevitability. Each strike it made was not an attack, but a fulfillment. Corwin felt like he was reenacting a scene already written, each parry a memory. Wyrmfang glowed fiercely, cutting through the spectral flames, but the Herald would not fall. Every time Corwin struck it down, it reformed from the air, its sorrow deepening.

“Use the dust!” Ardyn shouted.

Corwin reached for the pouch the Queen had given him and scattered the black powder into the chamber. For a moment, everything froze. The echoes vanished. The air cleared. The Herald staggered.

Corwin seized the opening and drove Wyrmfang into its heart—if it had a heart. The blade sank deep, and the creature screamed—not in pain, but in release. Its body dissolved into light, and in its place remained a single shard of dark crystal, pulsing with quiet heat.

He picked it up.

The third ring formed around his sword.

Outside, the Hollow Sky cracked.

The blank heavens split open in lines of red and gold. Not stars—wounds. Veins of something deeper.

The Queen of Embers appeared without warning, walking toward them across the fractured ground. Her expression was unreadable.

“You’ve seen the truth,” she said. “And you still stand. Few can claim as much.”

“It wasn’t truth,” Corwin said. “It was possibility.”

“Possibility is the mother of truth,” she replied.

He stared up at the open sky. “What was that creature?”

“A fragment of your fate. One you denied. That is how you win.”

Corwin turned to her. “And when do I lose?”

She didn’t answer.

Instead, she looked to the east, where the horizon shimmered with strange light. “The next path is not one you can walk with blade alone. It is the Mirrorroad. There, your enemy walks with your face. There, betrayal is the cost of progress.”

Ardyn spat into the dust. “Sounds charming.”

Corwin clenched his jaw. “And if I refuse?”

The Queen’s eyes burned brighter. “Then the stars will not return.”

The sky above gave no sign of change. It was still cracked, still bleeding.

Corwin whispered to it, though he knew it would not hear.

“I will return them.”

And the Hollow Sky trembled.

They left the Hollow Sky in silence, the world behind them unraveling as if it had only ever been borrowed from the past. The wound in the heavens remained—a smear of burning light like fire dragged across canvas—and Corwin could feel its gaze, its awareness. Something watched through that crack. It didn’t breathe, didn’t speak, didn’t move. But it was there, a presence vast and coiled like a serpent asleep beneath the world.

Fenn moved more cautiously now, her steps faltering as though the ground itself shifted beneath her hooves. Even Ardyn’s fire had grown temperamental, flickering without cause and sometimes turning cold in his palm. The Queen of Embers had returned to her keep, leaving only her parting words and the next path to guide them. No map. No token. Just direction—and the growing weight of what Corwin carried.

Three rings now circled Wyrmfang’s hilt. Each pulse a heartbeat of some great unseen force. Each a reminder of the price paid. The sword was heavier, not in mass but in consequence. It hummed when he slept and whispered in dreams he could not remember upon waking. Ardyn had begun keeping his distance at night.

They passed through a grove of trees whose leaves sang in the wind—low, murmuring tones that made Corwin dizzy if he listened too long. The road curved like a question mark, leading them through a ravine littered with the bones of beasts no man had named. Time grew fickle again, sometimes dragging like cold honey, other times flitting by like a bird startled from sleep.

“We’re being herded,” Ardyn said on the third day after leaving the Hollow Sky. “Something doesn’t want us straying. See how the landscape repeats?”

Corwin blinked, realizing he’d seen the same crooked boulder three times. “The Queen said the next path was the Mirrorroad. Could this be part of it?”

“Likely. She’s not one for direct transitions. The old roads have been twisted since Elthera’s rise. Magic leaks now. Everything remembers being something else.”

He didn’t need to be told what that meant. He already felt himself slipping at the edges—moments when he forgot who he was, or when the wind spoke in his voice. He tried not to listen. Tried not to believe the whispers that said he was only pretending to be brave. That he would kneel in the end, as his father had.

It was nearing dusk when the road truly changed.

The light flattened, as though the sun had stopped moving. Shadows stopped matching the shape of the men who cast them. The trees, once bent and broken, now stood in perfect symmetry—mirror images of each other, leaf for leaf, knot for knot. Corwin pulled Fenn to a halt.

“Do you see it?”

Ardyn nodded slowly, his face drawn. “We’ve entered the threshold. No turning back from here.”

Ahead, the forest parted into a corridor of silver mist. At its center, a single figure waited.

Corwin approached cautiously, hand on his blade.

The figure did not move. It was robed, hooded, featureless—at first.

Then it looked up, and Corwin saw himself again.

Not the same as in the Hollow Sky. This one was clean. Untouched. Regal. He wore a crown that shimmered with pale light, and his armor was not battle-worn but ceremonial, polished to a blinding gleam. When he spoke, his voice echoed like a bell struck deep underwater.

“I am what you could be,” the Mirror said.

“I’ve already heard that,” Corwin replied, unimpressed.

“But have you felt it?” the Mirror asked, stepping forward. “Have you let yourself imagine a world without war? Without fire? I offer peace. Not at the end of battle—but instead of it.”

Corwin shook his head. “Peace bought with lies is no peace at all.”

The Mirror laughed softly. “Then you have learned nothing. Truth is not a sword. It does not win wars. Truth breaks, Prince. It fractures kingdoms. Look around you. Look what truth did to your father.”

Corwin wanted to strike it, but something in the Mirror’s gaze froze him. Not fear. Recognition. There was a sadness in its eyes, one he knew intimately.

“You wear a crown,” he said. “But do you rule?”

“I guide,” the Mirror replied. “And I endure. More than you will, if you continue. There are worse things ahead. Betrayals you cannot imagine.”

“I don’t need to imagine them,” Corwin said quietly. “I’ve already lived through some.”

The Mirror said no more. It stepped aside, and the mist parted like curtains. A bridge stretched out across a chasm of light—perfectly symmetrical, suspended above nothing.

Ardyn grunted. “I hate this place.”

Corwin couldn’t argue. The Mirrorroad had begun.

The Mirrorroad was a riddle made into stone and fog. With every step they took, the world shifted to reflect something else—moments they had forgotten, or never lived, or refused to remember. They passed a battlefield filled with corpses wearing Corwin’s face. He tried not to look too long at the one that bore Mariel’s brooch.

Later, they walked through a banquet hall where hundreds feasted, and at the head of the table sat Corwin in crimson robes, a gold crown etched with screaming faces. No one spoke. Every head turned as he passed, their eyes hollow. He wanted to scream, but no sound escaped his throat.

At one point, Ardyn grabbed him, hard.

“Stop.”

Corwin blinked. The world snapped into clarity. He stood inches from the edge of the bridge, arms extended, ready to step off into the void.

“They whisper,” Ardyn said, not letting go. “Don’t let them sound like your thoughts.”

They pressed on, but the toll was clear. Corwin aged in those hours. Not visibly, but inwardly—his mind grew heavy, his heart brittle. Even Wyrmfang had changed. The blade reflected not his face, but that of others—people he had wronged, people he had failed.

At the midpoint of the bridge, they came upon a door.

It stood on nothing, surrounded by air, made of black wood and silver nails. Upon its frame was carved a single word:

BETRAYAL.

Corwin stared at it. “Do we open it?”

Ardyn shook his head. “No. You do.”

Corwin stepped forward. The moment his hand touched the handle, the world flashed.

He stood in the throne room of Caer Lothewyn. Everything was as it had been—the banners of his house, the stained glass, the cold light of morning. But something was wrong.

King Edric sat on the throne, blood seeping from his mouth, a dagger in his chest.

Corwin held the hilt.

“No,” he said aloud, dropping the vision. “That’s not real.”

But the door opened.

Inside, a single memory waited—one he had buried.

He saw Mariel’s face. Not the kind, patient look she wore in the library, but a mask of fear as she clutched a torn scroll. The one she had hidden from the king. A prophecy, maybe. Or a warning. And Corwin had taken it from her, had given it to his father.

That night, she had disappeared.

He had never asked where she went. Had told himself she fled, or that the king sent her away. But deep down, he had always known.

The road whispered: To wear the crown, you must remember every sin you denied.

When he emerged, the door was gone.

A fourth ring formed around Wyrmfang.

By the time they crossed the final span of the bridge, Corwin could barely walk. Ardyn supported him, half dragging, half shielding him from the visions that clawed at the edge of the fog. At the far end of the Mirrorroad, the mist broke into a wide plateau beneath a blood-red moon.

There, standing atop a dais of black stone, was a figure in robes of storm-colored silk. Her face was obscured, but her hands shimmered with veins of fire.

“Welcome, Prince of Ash,” she said. “You’ve come far. But not far enough.”

“Elthera,” Corwin breathed, raising his sword.

But Ardyn grabbed his arm. “No. It’s not her.”

The figure stepped down, and the veil fell from her face.

It was Mariel.

Not the one he remembered—but older, harder. Her eyes held centuries.

“You gave me away,” she said. “And I walked the Nine Paths alone. Now I guard the next.”

Corwin stepped forward. “You’re alive.”

“More than that. I’ve become what you could not.”

He raised Wyrmfang. “Then teach me.”

Mariel smiled. “Only through pain.”

The wind howled, and the fifth trial began.

Chapter Three: The Gate of Flame

The duel began without ceremony. There were no horns, no declarations, only the sudden hiss of clashing steel and the roar of wind rising from nowhere. Corwin met Mariel’s blade with Wyrmfang, sparks exploding from the impact as their swords sang in violent greeting. She moved with a grace he had never seen before—fluid as flame, precise as a needle. Each step was measured, every strike purposeful, as if she had rehearsed this battle in silence for a thousand nights.

Corwin faltered at first, still reeling from the visions of the Mirrorroad, his muscles stiff from too many trials and too little rest. But instinct kept him upright, and something deeper—rage, regret, longing—drove his hands. Mariel’s face, once a symbol of home, now flickered like a memory gone sour. It wasn’t hate that guided her blade. It was resolve.

“You’re stronger,” she said between blows. “Stronger than you were when you betrayed me.”

“I didn’t know,” Corwin gasped. “I didn’t—”

“You didn’t ask,” she snapped, forcing him back with a series of punishing slashes. “You didn’t want to know. You wanted to be innocent.”

Her blade struck his shoulder, tearing fabric and drawing a line of fire across his flesh. He grunted but didn’t fall. Instead, he stepped inside her guard and brought Wyrmfang across in a low arc, slicing toward her ribs. She twisted away just in time, the edge grazing her side. Blood splashed the stone.

“Good,” she said. “You’re finally fighting like someone who’s lost things.”

The wind surged again, lifting dust and ash into spirals around them. Ardyn stood at the edge of the plateau, unmoving. He did not interfere, though his hands flexed with nervous fire. This was Corwin’s battle. His alone.

They circled each other, breathing hard. Corwin saw now that Mariel’s body bore other scars—thin, silvery ones along her forearms, thicker ones near her throat. She had been through the paths too, maybe deeper than he had yet gone. Whatever fire had forged her, it had not done so gently.

“Why did you come back?” he asked.

“To keep you from doing what I failed to,” she said. “To keep you from becoming her.”

“Elthera?”

Mariel nodded. “She began as us. Just a voice ignored. Just a hand swatted away.”

She struck again, and he met her blade with both hands on the hilt, shoving her back. The ground beneath them cracked, lines of molten light snaking through the stone.

“I’m not her,” Corwin shouted. “I’m not my father either!”

Mariel’s eyes flared. “Then prove it!”

Their blades met again, and for a moment, time stilled. The air around them grew heavy, vibrating with the weight of prophecy. A shiver passed through Corwin’s spine—not fear, but recognition. The plateau was a fulcrum. A pivot in fate. What happened here would echo through every future.

With a cry, Corwin summoned everything the paths had given him: the sorrow of the Vale of Echoes, the clarity of the Hollow Sky, the cruel honesty of the Mirrorroad. It surged through his limbs, into Wyrmfang, and for the first time, he stopped reacting. He chose.

Mariel lunged—and he stepped past her, ducked under her blade, and brought his sword across her back in a clean, decisive arc.

She staggered, dropped to one knee, and raised no defense.

The wind died.

Corwin stepped back, heart pounding, blade trembling.

“I don’t want to kill you,” he said.

Mariel smiled through bloodied lips. “Then don’t. You’ve passed.”

The fifth ring appeared around Wyrmfang, glowing with a deeper light—one that pulsed not with power, but with grief.

Corwin fell to his knees beside her. “Why?”

“Because I needed to know you could,” she whispered. “Mercy without strength is a lie. I couldn’t teach you mercy. Only the need for it.”

He touched her arm gently, afraid it would vanish like the others. But she was real. Flesh and bone. Still alive.

She gripped his wrist. “There’s no going back now, Corwin. The next path… it doesn’t change you. It reveals you. Be ready.”

Then she fell unconscious.

They buried her at the edge of the plateau beneath a cairn of dark stone, though Ardyn insisted she was not truly dead.

“She’ll wake,” he said. “When she’s needed again. That’s the way of those who finish the paths.”

Corwin didn’t argue. He knelt beside the cairn for a long time, eyes closed, letting the cold wind pass over him. He didn’t pray. There was no god left to hear it. But he made a promise—to her, to himself—that he would finish what she had started.

That he would not become Elthera.

They set off again, eastward toward the sixth path. The land had changed once more. No more twisted woods or cursed skies. Now the world was still. Lifeless. As though it had simply given up.

They crossed plains of cracked white stone where no birds flew and no water moved. The air grew dry, and the silence thickened until even Fenn’s breathing felt loud. Once, they passed a tower made entirely of feathers—thousands of them, frozen in place, bleached and motionless.

“What’s the sixth path?” Corwin asked one evening as they camped beside a dried-out stream.

Ardyn fed the fire and stared into it before replying. “The Path of Names.”

“Sounds harmless enough.”

“It isn’t,” Ardyn said. “It’s where you remember what you were before you were born. And decide what you’ll be when you die.”

Corwin frowned. “That’s nonsense.”

“So’s the world. Doesn’t stop it being true.”

They continued.

Eventually, they reached a canyon—a vast chasm that stretched for miles in either direction, its edges carved with symbols Corwin couldn’t read. At its heart, a bridge of silver roots formed a narrow crossing. And on the far side, a single figure waited.

Not Elthera. Not a reflection. Not a monster.

A child.

She sat cross-legged on the stone, playing with a ring of tiny bones—birds, maybe, or something smaller. She looked up as they approached, her face pale and freckled, her eyes unnaturally wide.

“Are you the prince?” she asked.

Corwin nodded cautiously.

“Then come. The gate waits for you.”

He glanced at Ardyn, who only nodded grimly. “This is it.”

Corwin stepped onto the bridge.

The roots shifted beneath his feet but held. The air grew colder, not from temperature but meaning. Each step felt like a decision.

The child followed him with her eyes, still playing with the bones.

“What’s your name?” he asked.

She smiled. “You already know it.”

He paused.

“Say it,” she whispered.

Corwin’s mouth opened, but no words came. He did know. But saying it would be a kind of surrender.

The bones clattered as she spun them.

“You have to remember what was taken from you. What you gave away before you could choose.”

The silver bridge cracked.

Corwin fell to one knee, a pressure building in his chest. Images surged—flashes from a life before breath, before flesh. Fire. Chains. A name spoken in a language lost to all but stars.

He remembered.

And when he stood again, he said it aloud.

“Alarion.”

The gate opened.

Beyond it was a vast chamber, empty except for a mirror that showed no reflection and a door that opened only when closed.

This was the sixth path.

And already, Corwin could feel it changing him.

Chapter Four: The Path of Names

The mirror showed nothing.

Not darkness. Not emptiness. It simply refused to reflect. Corwin stood before it, waiting for his face to form in its surface, but all he saw was blankness—smooth and silent, like still water that did not believe in him. Behind him, Ardyn paced in tight circles, muttering under his breath, and the child—the gatekeeper, if that’s what she was—had vanished the moment they crossed the threshold.

The chamber was circular, with no visible source of light, yet the air glowed faintly, not with warmth but with awareness. The kind of light that came not from torches or sun, but from the gaze of something unseen. The mirror stood at its center, fixed to the floor by roots that pulsed like veins. Around it, names were etched into the stone in long, spiraling rings that stretched to the far wall.

They were not names Corwin recognized.

Yet he felt them.

Aches in his chest. Memories not his. Voices in other tongues. The closer he stepped to the edge of the mirror, the more the names seemed to hum beneath his feet, as if singing to him from below the stone.

“This place isn’t a trial,” Ardyn said finally, breaking the silence. “It’s a reckoning.”

Corwin looked at him. “What’s the difference?”

“In a trial, you can pass or fail. A reckoning just tells you who you are.”

He turned back to the mirror. “Then why won’t it show me?”

Ardyn didn’t answer.

Instead, the stone beneath the mirror cracked—and the chamber groaned.

Lines of molten light stretched out from the base of the mirror like a spider’s web, and a low hum filled the air. The names around them began to rise from the floor, no longer carved but floating in threads of fire. Some flickered like dying stars. Others shone brightly. Then, without warning, one of them ignited into gold and roared.

ALARION.

The name filled the space, not as sound but as force. Corwin staggered back, clutching his chest, the memory of the bridge and the girl crashing into him all over again. Alarion. His true name, the one buried beneath “Corwin,” beneath royal titles and bloodlines. The one he had forgotten in the space between birth and now.

“You gave it up,” said a voice behind him.

He turned, and there she was again—the child from the bridge, but older now. No longer a girl, but a woman cloaked in grey feathers, her face lined with age and sorrow. Her eyes were the same, wide and knowing.

“You gave it up to be born,” she continued. “It was the price. To forget what you were. Who you were.”

“I didn’t choose—”

“No,” she agreed. “But choice is a luxury of the living.”

She stepped forward, and the mirror shimmered for the first time. A ripple crossed its surface, and slowly, a figure appeared.

It was not Corwin.

It was Alarion.

Not a prince. Not a boy. Something older, taller, not quite human. Eyes like dying suns. Skin veined with light. A warrior draped in dust and memory, holding not Wyrmfang but a sword of glass that reflected every star in the sky.

“This is what you were,” the woman said. “Before Lothewyn. Before Edric. Before names were chains.”

Corwin stared at the figure. “Why show me now?”

“Because the seventh path requires not a prince, but a revenant.”

He tore his gaze away from the mirror and looked at her. “And what does that mean?”

“It means you must decide whether you are the heir of a broken line, or the return of a forgotten fire.”

The room darkened. The mirror began to crack—not shatter, but fracture like ice under strain.

“If I choose Alarion,” Corwin asked, “do I lose Corwin?”

The woman smiled faintly. “You lose the idea of him. Not the truth.”

He turned back to the mirror.

The image of Alarion reached forward—and touched the glass from the other side.

Corwin raised his hand, mirroring the motion.

The chamber fell silent.

And then, in a heartbeat that stretched longer than time, the mirror split open.

Not shattered. Opened.

It folded back like a gate made of light, and beyond it was not another room, but a storm.

A swirling tunnel of fire and wind, lined with screaming names and shattered stars. A storm of memories—his and others—whipping past at impossible speed. He stepped through without hesitation.

Ardyn followed.

Inside the storm, Corwin saw everything.

Every sin of his house, every oath broken by his forefathers. He saw Edric as a child, terrified of a mother who ruled with whispers. He saw Elthera in her youth, kneeling at the edge of a sacred well, asking the gods for guidance and receiving only silence. He saw the first king of Lothewyn steal fire from the Veil and bind it in blood.

He saw Mariel’s childhood, her betrayal by the order that trained her, her escape through frost and shadow. He saw Ardyn weep beside a corpse—a man with his face, another life, another name.

All of it passed through him. All of it burned.

But when the storm ended, Corwin did not fall.

He emerged not as ashes, but as flame.

Wyrmfang gleamed with new light—its fifth ring now pulsing gold. The blade was no longer jagged but smooth, etched with symbols that glowed faintly beneath the steel. His cloak was gone, replaced by armor that shimmered with faint green fire. The amulet Mariel had given him at the start now floated just above his chest, spinning slowly.

Ardyn stepped through behind him, eyes wide.

“You’ve changed.”

“So have you,” Corwin said.

They stood on a hill of glass, overlooking the seventh path.

It stretched before them like a river of smoke and bone.

At its far end rose a tower of fire.

“The Gate of Flame,” Ardyn said. “We’re almost there.”

Corwin took a breath.

And began to walk.

The wind over the glass hill howled like a living thing, not with anger but with memory, dragging voices across the sky like loose threads. Corwin wrapped his fingers tighter around Wyrmfang, the blade warm now, its runes glowing with a steadier pulse. The storm behind them had ended, but a storm lingered inside him—less violent, perhaps, but no less disruptive. For the first time, he felt the full shape of the journey. Not as a sequence of trials, but as a spiral. Each path led deeper, not forward.

Below them, the seventh path unfurled like a scar across the earth. It was not a road in the conventional sense, but a series of arches—stone monoliths that rose and fell across the landscape like ribs of some ancient beast. Between each arch, fire burned—not consuming fire, but standing flames, unmoving, the color of molten copper. They were too perfect, too still.

“This place isn’t natural,” Corwin said, surveying the landscape. “Not even cursed. It’s constructed.”

Ardyn nodded slowly, his eyes narrowed. “The Gate of Flame isn’t a test. It’s a forge. You either pass through it and become something else—or you break.”

Corwin glanced at him. “Have you walked it?”

“No. But I’ve seen those who tried.” Ardyn turned his gaze forward. “You can’t fight this path with steel. You fight it with decision.”

Corwin stepped forward.

The moment he passed beneath the first arch, the sky above flickered—stars blinked into existence and immediately shattered, their dust falling like snow. Time bent again, though subtly this time. Every breath felt both too long and not long enough. The fire between the arches did not burn with heat, but with questions—every flicker a challenge, every glow a demand.

By the third arch, Corwin could feel it creeping in: the doubt, the second-guessing. The storm may have passed, but its echoes lingered. Faces rose in the flames. Not monstrous ones, but familiar. His father. His mother. Mariel. Even Elthera, though younger—before bitterness had hardened her into veng
