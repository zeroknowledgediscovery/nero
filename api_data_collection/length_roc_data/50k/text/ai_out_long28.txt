Title: The Crimson Violet

Chapter One: Ashes Beneath the Orchard

There were things in the town of Marrow Glen that people did not speak of, not even under cover of dark, not even when the firelight flickered softly and the whiskey had warmed their tongues. To be born in Marrow Glen was to inherit silence as a birthright and suspicion as a second skin.

Beneath the edge of town, past the wilting orchard of plums and ash trees that hadn’t borne fruit in nearly a decade, lay the Grange estate—a creaking manor half-swallowed by ivy and secrecy. It was there that Violet Grange returned, unannounced and cloaked in the scent of rain and regret, after nearly seven years gone. Her absence had been spoken of only once, in hushed voices, following the suicide of her brother, Declan. The official story said he fell into the quarry during a storm. The unofficial one was... left untold.

Violet stepped through the rusting gate, the iron whimpering as she passed, dragging behind her a single suitcase and the heavy trail of memory. Her once-boyish hair now swept her shoulders, and the lavender birthmark beneath her collarbone—the one her mother had always insisted was a mark of some ancient blessing—peeked through the rain-dark fabric of her blouse.

The house had not changed. Shadows nested in the corners of the porch. The windows blinked slowly, unwilling to recognize her. She stood there, listening to the wind whistle through the eaves, until the door creaked open without her touch.

“Still as dramatic as ever,” came a voice. Familiar, and yet splintered by time.

“Hello, Maren,” Violet said, stepping inside.

Maren Delaney had once been her closest friend. And something else, too, though they'd never dared give it a name. Not back then. Not here, where love between two women was sin dressed as madness, or madness disguised as sin.

“You look... older,” Maren said, eyes like storm glass, her auburn hair pulled into a severe knot at the nape of her neck.

“So do you,” Violet said, setting down her suitcase with a thud that echoed through the empty house.

“I never left.”

“I know.”

Maren's mouth twisted. “Everyone thought you’d be dead by now. Or famous. Turns out you’re just late.”

Violet tilted her head, half-smiling. “Late for what?”

Maren didn’t answer. Instead, she turned and walked down the corridor, her footsteps muffled by a thick runner of moth-eaten carpet. Violet followed.

In the parlor, nothing had moved. The grandfather clock ticked its ceaseless dirge. A faint scent of burnt clove lingered, as though someone had smoked a pipe in the dark hours of morning.

“I didn’t come back for nostalgia,” Violet said, lowering herself onto the cracked leather of the settee. “I came back because something’s wrong.”

Maren remained standing. “You mean the letters.”

Violet’s eyes snapped up. “You got one too?”

Maren nodded. “Three, actually. Same handwriting. No signature. Just... fragments. Like someone is trying to rebuild a corpse from bones.”

Violet fished in her coat pocket and drew out a folded page. It was smeared at the edges with what might have been blood or ink.

    The orchard remembers. Come home. You were wrong about Declan.

Maren read it, face unreadable. “They’re trying to open something. Someone. I don’t know if they want us to help... or to stop them.”

A log cracked in the hearth, though no fire had been lit.

“We need to find the others,” Violet said.

“There are no others,” Maren whispered.

Violet leaned forward, voice low. “There were others. You know it. You know.”

And just like that, Maren’s resolve cracked. She looked toward the window, where the orchard pulsed gently in the mist, as though breathing.

The next morning dawned red, the sky bleeding at its seams. Violet wandered through the kitchen, brushing her fingers across the counters where flour had once dusted every surface and her mother’s humming had softened the corners of the room.

“Everything’s gone quiet,” Maren said, standing in the doorway. “No birds. No wind.”

“It’s listening,” Violet murmured.

“What is?”

“The thing beneath.”

They walked to the edge of the orchard, where the soil grew black and soft. In the center, where the plum trees knotted like arthritic hands, there stood an old swing, barely clinging to the gnarled limb that held it.

Violet stepped forward and laid her hand on the bark. “It started here.”

“You think it wants you?” Maren asked.

“I think it wants both of us.”

Later that day, they found the first body.

It was pinned to the chapel door with a rusted pitchfork, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes packed with violets. The reverend, old Brother Aldwych, had been dead for at least two days, though no one had noticed.

Carved into the wood beside him, in symbols that crawled like insects across the grain, were the words:

    LOVE WAS NEVER MEANT FOR THE DEAD.

Violet felt her breath catch. “This is a warning.”

Maren’s jaw clenched. “Or a welcome.”

That night, sleep did not come. Violet lay in the bedroom that once belonged to her mother, staring at the cracked ceiling where water stains formed shapes she pretended not to recognize.

At two a.m., she heard the piano. Just a single note, pressed down and held. Then another. And another.

She rose, barefoot, and crept down the hallway. At the base of the stairs, a figure stood cloaked in moonlight—long-limbed, thin, wearing Declan’s old peacoat.

She opened her mouth, but no sound emerged.

The figure turned, and there was nothing where a face should have been. Just skin stretched smooth, eyes inked directly into the flesh like tattoos.

“Violet,” it rasped, with a voice like splintered wood. “You left us.”

Then it vanished.

She stumbled back into the parlor and found Maren sitting in the dark, hands wrapped around a steaming mug.

“I saw him,” Violet whispered.

Maren did not look surprised. “They always come back, eventually.”

“Do you believe in ghosts?”

“I believe in the things we bury.”

Outside, the wind began to howl.

Inside, the walls began to weep.

The storm arrived without warning. It wasn’t the kind of rain that eased in with a whisper and gathered in polite puddles—it was a war cry of thunder and water, slamming down on the old shingles of the Grange estate like fists against a coffin lid. Violet stood at the window, her breath fogging the pane as she watched the orchard twist and flail beneath the downpour. The trees looked alive, frantic, like they were trying to speak in the language of broken branches.

Behind her, Maren stirred. She’d fallen asleep on the parlor couch, her limbs draped like she’d been dropped there. Her hair had come loose in the night, red strands curling down across her cheek like spilled ink. She blinked awake slowly, confusion blooming across her features like a bruise.

“You didn’t sleep,” she said, voice rough as stone dragged across stone.

“I watched,” Violet replied. “Something’s moving out there. Not just shadows.”

Maren stood and joined her at the window, rubbing the sleep from her face. For a moment, neither of them spoke. The world outside was chaos. But inside, there was stillness, like the breath held just before a scream.

“What did we used to say when we were kids?” Violet asked suddenly. “That rhyme?”

Maren gave her a sidelong look. “You mean the one we sang in the orchard?”

Violet nodded. “‘Red leaves fall and black roots grow…’”

“‘And lovers lost will never know…’” Maren finished. Her voice was hollow. “We thought we made it up.”

“We didn’t.”

Violet turned from the window, unease curling in her stomach like rot. “Do you think someone knew, back then? About us? About what was… starting?”

Maren didn’t answer right away. When she did, her voice was brittle. “Your mother knew.”

That struck like a slap. Violet blinked. “She never said anything.”

“She didn’t have to. I saw it in her eyes. The day we kissed in the barn, remember that? You laughed. I was terrified. But she was standing there, near the fence. Watching.”

Violet swallowed hard. She remembered. The sun had been just beginning to set, dust floating in the air like golden snow. They’d been thirteen. They’d thought they were invisible.

“She never spoke to me again after that,” Maren said, her tone distant. “Even when I came to the house with my father. She looked through me.”

Violet crossed the room and sat beside her on the couch. The leather was cold. “I’m sorry.”

“It’s not your fault. It’s this place. This town. Nothing lives here. Not really.”

They sat in silence as the storm raged. Time bent strangely, like it always did in that house. Hours folded in on themselves. The clocks ticked out of sync. Somewhere upstairs, a floorboard groaned under invisible weight.

That afternoon, they went into town.

Marrow Glen had not changed in seven years. The streets were still lined with crooked stone buildings and rust-colored shutters. The general store stood stubborn and peeling, its front windows filled with yellowing flyers and jars of candy no one bought. The people, too, had aged without grace. Faces Violet recognized twisted with confusion and quiet judgment as she passed. She heard her name in whispers, but no one greeted her.

“They never forgave you,” Maren said under her breath as they crossed the square. “They think Declan died because of you.”

“They’re wrong,” Violet said, jaw tight. “It wasn’t me. It was—”

She stopped. The old church loomed ahead, its steeple casting a long shadow like a sundial marking sorrow. The door was gone now—removed after the reverend’s body had been found. In its place was yellow tape, but even that had been shredded by wind and time.

Maren nodded toward the chapel. “It started again here.”

They went inside.

The pews were askew, some overturned, others broken. The altar had been scorched, as if someone had tried to burn something out of it. On the floor, the scorch marks spiraled out in a shape that Violet recognized but couldn’t place—an ancient pattern that prickled behind her eyes like deja vu.

“It’s like someone tried to open a gate,” she murmured.

“To what?”

“I don’t know.”

In the back of the church, they found a notebook. It was half-buried beneath a collapsed hymnal rack, its cover scorched, but the pages inside were intact. Violet flipped through them slowly.

The first entry was dated only two weeks before Declan’s death.

    “She told me about the eyes. The ones in the orchard. Said they watched us even when we weren’t looking. I think she meant the trees. But I’m not so sure. I’ve started to see them too.”

Maren leaned over her shoulder. “That’s his handwriting.”

Violet nodded, her hand trembling. She turned the page.

    “Violet would laugh if she saw this. She never believed in anything she couldn’t touch. But there are voices in the orchard. They sound like us.”

They read in silence until the last page, which had only a single line:

    If you’re reading this, it means it’s already begun again.

Violet shut the book. Her heart thundered.

Back at the Grange estate, night fell quickly. Too quickly. As if someone had pulled the sun down by force. They lit candles and locked the doors, though neither of them believed locks would help.

In the dim light of the drawing room, Maren poured whiskey into two glasses and handed one to Violet. Her fingers brushed Violet’s for a second too long.

“I used to dream about you,” Maren said. “Even after you left. Especially after.”

Violet looked down at her glass. “I never stopped thinking about you. But I couldn’t stay. You know why.”

“You thought love was enough to damn us.”

“Wasn’t it?”

They sat close, breathing the same air. Outside, something howled—not a wolf, not a wind. Something older.

“I loved you,” Violet whispered. “Even when I didn’t know what it meant.”

“I still do,” Maren said, and then leaned in slowly, giving her time to pull away.

She didn’t.

Their lips met with the hesitation of old wounds reopening, a soft collision of memory and grief. It wasn’t like it had been—careless and thrilling. It was deeper now. A promise and a warning in the same breath.

The lights flickered.

The floor shook.

And upstairs, the sound of laughter echoed—not theirs. A child’s laugh. Familiar.

They broke apart. Violet’s heart was hammering.

“That was Declan,” she said.

Maren stood, pale. “He’s calling us.”

They ran up the stairs, the house groaning beneath them. At the end of the hall, Violet’s old bedroom door stood ajar, swinging gently as if someone had just passed through it.

She pushed it open.

On the bed lay a doll she hadn’t seen in years—a hand-stitched thing with one eye missing. It was holding a small, torn slip of paper.

Violet picked it up. Written in childish scrawl were three words:

    “You’re almost there.”

Violet didn’t sleep that night, not truly. She lay beneath the thin quilt of her childhood bed, the air heavy with mothballs and memories that clawed at her throat. Every creak of the house, every shifting shadow against the walls, twisted into suggestion—into the shape of Declan’s voice, his footsteps, the whispered syllables of the orchard. Her dreams, when they did come, were not dreams at all but a suffocation, full of roots crawling across her body, threading themselves through her ribs and mouth until she could no longer scream. She awoke at dawn with her throat raw and the sensation of dirt beneath her nails.

Maren was already in the kitchen, frying eggs in a pan that sizzled like old gossip. She looked up as Violet entered but didn’t smile. The silence between them was not hostile, but reverent, as though they were both waiting for something neither of them wanted to admit might arrive.

“Did you sleep?” Violet asked, sitting at the table.

“No,” Maren said, scraping the pan. “I don’t think this house lets you anymore.”

Violet rubbed her eyes. “I had a dream. Or something like one. I was in the orchard, and the trees—God, the trees—they had faces. Not just knots or bark that looked like them. Real faces. And they were crying. Bleeding.”

Maren set the plate down in front of her, eggs trembling slightly. “That’s not a dream. That’s memory.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’ve seen it too,” she said, sitting across from her. “When I was sixteen. A week after you left. I went into the orchard alone. I thought if I walked the same path we used to take, I might feel you there somehow. And I did—but not like I wanted. The trees… they turned. Twisted toward me. I saw faces in the bark. Your mother. Declan. Even me.”

Violet stared. “Why didn’t you ever tell me?”

“You were gone. And by the time I saw you again, I didn’t know if I believed it myself anymore. I thought maybe I’d gone mad. Maybe grief does that.”

“No,” Violet whispered. “Something else does. Something older than grief.”

After breakfast, they returned to the attic. Neither of them said why—they didn’t need to. They both sensed that whatever was happening was tied to something buried, something the Grange house remembered even if its inhabitants had tried to forget. The attic door moaned open like a reluctant confession.

Dust hung thick in the air, and the smell of mildew and mouse droppings was thick enough to choke. Violet stepped carefully over boxes marked with curling labels—“Spring 1979,” “Christmas Decorations,” “Declan’s School Papers.” She paused at the last one, then knelt, lifting the lid.

Inside were notebooks, photographs, old essays with red pen scribbled across the margins. Beneath them all lay a small wooden box carved with spirals. She lifted it, and something in her chest lurched.

“I’ve seen that before,” Maren said from behind her.

Violet turned. “When?”

“The night before Declan died. He showed it to me. Said he’d found it buried beneath the swing in the orchard. Said it was humming.”

Violet pried open the lid. Inside lay a bundle of dried petals—violets, pressed until they’d turned the color of old blood. Beneath them was a tiny key, rusted but intact, and a slip of paper folded into fourths.

She opened it. The writing was hers, but childlike, unsure.

    “If you ever forget, bury it here. If you ever remember, dig it up. But do not open it alone.”

Violet stared. “This is my handwriting.”

“You wrote that,” Maren said slowly, “when we were twelve.”

“No,” Violet breathed. “I don’t remember. I don’t remember any of this.”

“Exactly.”

They took the box and the key downstairs, not sure what they would do with them but knowing they couldn’t leave them behind. As the day waned, the sky dimmed to a dull bruised hue, and the wind picked up in short, gasping fits. At dusk, the orchard began to whistle.

Not with the sound of wind, but music. A tune Violet hadn’t heard in years—one Declan used to play on the old piano. She stood at the window, hands shaking.

“We have to go out there,” she said.

Maren didn’t hesitate. “Then we go.”

The orchard was worse at night. What seemed like dead trees in the daylight became monoliths, towering and tangled, their limbs reaching down instead of up. The path was barely a path at all, more a memory of one, grown over with moss and roots. They walked in silence, holding hands without realizing it, guided only by the moonlight filtering through the leaves and the steady pulsing of that haunting melody.

At the swing, they stopped. The air was different here—thicker, colder, as though time had condensed itself into fog.

“This is where he found it,” Maren said. “He said the soil felt warm, even in winter.”

Violet knelt, brushing away the top layer of leaves and mulch. The ground gave easily, like something had been waiting to be uncovered again. She dug with her bare hands until her fingers struck wood. It was a trapdoor, narrow, barely large enough for a child.

They pried it open together.

A wooden ladder descended into blackness.

“We go together,” Violet said.

Maren nodded. “Always.”

The descent was slow, silent but for the sound of breath and heartbeat. The air grew colder with each rung, and the walls began to weep—a slow trickle of moisture that smelled like copper and roses.

At the bottom was a room.

It wasn’t large—no more than ten feet across—but the ceiling arched high, and the walls were covered in symbols etched deep into the stone. Candles lined the perimeter, unlit, yet casting a faint glow as though they remembered fire. In the center lay a circle of salt, and inside it, a mirror.

Not a mirror exactly. Its surface shimmered like water, refusing to reflect. Violet stepped forward, drawn to it against every warning instinct screaming in her bones.

Inside the mirror, a figure stood.

Declan.

But not Declan. This version was older, thinner, dressed in rags, his skin gray and papery like birch bark. He looked up at her, and his eyes were completely black.

“You shouldn’t have come back,” he said, his voice echoing without sound.

Violet trembled. “What are you?”

“Not what. When.”

Maren grabbed her arm. “We need to go.”

But Violet couldn’t look away. The mirror rippled, and another figure stepped beside Declan—her mother, eyes hollow, her face frozen in a mixture of anguish and warning.

“She tried to stop it,” Declan said. “She failed. You’re the last key.”

Then the mirror cracked.

Not loudly—quietly, like ice breaking underfoot.

The salt circle blew apart, and the air filled with the scent of burnt violets. The room shook.

“We have to leave!” Maren shouted, pulling her back toward the ladder. They scrambled up as the chamber groaned, and behind them, the mirror shattered completely, releasing something that didn’t move, didn’t speak—but watched.

Back in the orchard, the trapdoor slammed shut on its own, sealing the dark below.

They ran back to the house, not stopping, not speaking, not breathing until the door slammed behind them and they collapsed into the foyer.

“What the hell was that?” Maren gasped.

Violet was shaking. “It’s not about Declan. It never was. We’re part of something... older.”

Maren looked at her, eyes wide. “What do we do now?”

Violet stood slowly, her face pale. “We find the others. If any of them are still alive.”

The wind screamed, and the last of the orchard’s leaves began to fall, one by one, as if mourning had begun in earnest.

Chapter Two: The Roots of Memory

The town’s library had once been a place of silence and sanctuary, but when Violet and Maren pushed open its heavy oak doors the morning after the orchard’s whisperings, the quiet felt invasive. Dust blanketed every surface, motes swirling like disturbed spirits in the slivers of early sunlight that sliced through warped windows. The building smelled of mildew, ink, and forgotten things—appropriate, Violet thought, considering they were there to remember what had been buried, even in their own minds.

They didn’t speak as they walked past the front desk, now unmanned and littered with curled check-out slips. There was no one in sight. Not even the librarian, Miss Cranley, who had once made it her mission to chase them out with sharp glances and sharper reprimands about “appropriate behavior between young ladies.” The back room, once used for historical records, was locked. Maren reached up, took a key from above the doorframe, and opened it without comment.

Inside, it was as cold as a crypt.

The walls were lined with filing cabinets, thick books with cloth covers, and maps of the Glen dating back to the 1800s. Maren flipped the nearest light switch. Nothing. They worked by the light of a single window and Violet’s old flashlight, its battery weak but still serviceable.

“We need town records,” Violet said. “Property lines, ownerships. Anything that might show what was on this land before.”

Maren nodded and moved to a cabinet marked ‘1865–1900’. Violet pulled open a drawer labeled ‘Church & Cemeteries’. The silence stretched between them, punctuated only by the soft thud of old paper, the occasional rip of brittle pages. For over an hour they read—snippets of births, deaths, donations to the chapel, whispers of families long gone. Then Violet found it: an old ledger detailing the founding of the church grounds and the donation of land by a family she didn’t recognize.

“‘Beaumont,’” she read aloud. “‘Elias and Hester. Inherited the property in 1821. Formally gifted the east grove to the township for use as a burial site and sanctuary.’”

Maren looked up. “Beaumont? That’s not a local name.”

“Exactly,” Violet said. “And listen to this—‘The soil was determined to be unsuitable for crops. Trees grew in unnatural patterns. But the family insisted it was sacred, not cursed.’”

Maren’s face darkened. “So that orchard… it was once a cemetery?”

“More than that. They called it ‘consecrated to the deep roots.’ That’s not any religion I know.”

Maren reached for a second volume—thicker, more fragile. It was a genealogical book, hand-written in elegant cursive. She traced the entries until she reached the Beaumont line. “There were three children. Two died young. The third, Seraphine… she disappeared.”

Violet leaned closer. “Look at the dates. Her disappearance was the same year the original church burned down.”

A new silence fell between them—not the awkward hush of shared space, but the tightening stillness of revelation.

Maren set the book down. “Whatever started with the Beaumonts… it didn’t die with them. It was inherited. By blood. Or maybe by choice.”

They returned to the estate just before sunset, the air charged with static. Something was building. The sky above Marrow Glen had taken on a strange tint—more violet than blue, like a bruise ripening across the heavens. The trees along the road no longer stood still. They swayed, even in the absence of wind, as though they followed Violet and Maren’s steps with quiet approval.

Inside the Grange house, the electricity flickered. The refrigerator emitted a low, keening hum, then went silent. The lights blinked and then died altogether. Maren lit three candles and set them on the mantle.

“We should leave,” she said softly. “We should’ve left days ago.”

Violet shook her head. “We can’t. Not yet. I remembered something this morning.”

Maren glanced up, eyebrows raised.

“When I was a girl,” Violet began, “I used to hear singing in the orchard. I thought it was just… you know, a child’s imagination. But it wasn’t. My mother used to hum the same tune. The one Declan played on the piano. I think she heard it too. Maybe all the women in my family did.”

Maren took a slow breath. “The Beaumonts had only one surviving daughter.”

Violet met her gaze. “And my mother’s maiden name was Carrow. But her mother’s was Belmonte.”

“It’s the same name,” Maren whispered.

“Changed. Softened. Hidden.”

“So this thing—it’s passed down through the women. And the orchard, the trees, the land… they’re not haunted. They’re part of it.”

“That’s why it called me back.”

That night, they lit a fire in the hearth and sat in silence, each staring into the flickering flames with the same thought: what else had they forgotten? What memories had been locked away like the box in the attic, buried with warnings they no longer understood?

As the fire died down to embers, Violet rose and fetched the old family photo albums from the closet. She flipped through them on the floor by candlelight, Maren watching over her shoulder. Pictures of her mother, always pale, always sad-eyed. A few of Declan as a boy, his smile lopsided and tired, as if he’d been born knowing something he wasn’t meant to carry. Near the back, tucked behind a loose page, they found a photograph neither of them had seen before.

It showed a woman standing beneath the orchard swing. She wore a dark shawl, her features sharp and severe, and in her arms she held an infant wrapped in a cloth that looked exactly like the one Violet remembered from her own childhood crib. Behind her, the trees leaned in.

“That’s not your mother,” Maren said. “She looks like her, but older. Much older.”

“Then it must be my grandmother.”

Violet turned the photo over. On the back, written in faded ink, was a single line.

    She was the first to open it. Let her be the last.

Maren touched her shoulder. “But she wasn’t the last.”

“No,” Violet said. “She was only the beginning.”

That night, Violet dreamed of fire again—but this time, she was the one lighting it. She stood in the orchard, a torch in each hand, surrounded by shadows that screamed her name. Maren stood beside her, face streaked with soot, holding a knife carved from bone. Beneath their feet, the ground pulsed.

And when Violet awoke, her hands smelled like smoke.

The next morning, they drove out to the edge of town—to the Holloway property, where once, long ago, five families had lived in tightly-packed farmhouses arranged in a circle. Most had long since moved away or died out. But one name still remained in town records: Elsie Holloway.

“She was in our year,” Maren said, frowning as they pulled up the gravel drive. “She used to sit behind me in chemistry. Real quiet. Real pale. Moved away junior year.”

Violet nodded. “I saw her name in the ledger. Her great-grandmother was listed as a witness to the original consecration of the orchard land. She’s tied to it.”

The house was small, sagging, and swallowed by thistle. They knocked on the door twice before it creaked open on its own. Inside, the air was bitter with lavender and something sharper—alcohol or vinegar. The furniture was draped in sheets, and dust hung from the ceiling like cobwebs.

In the center of the living room sat a woman in a wooden rocker, her body wrapped in a thick knitted shawl. Her hair was snow white, eyes milky, but she looked at them with a clarity that struck like cold water.

“I knew you’d come,” she said.

Violet stepped forward. “Elsie?”

The woman nodded slowly. “You’re the last of the Grange line. And you,” she added, her gaze turning to Maren, “are the one who stayed. That matters.”

Maren swallowed hard. “What are we?”

“Carriers,” Elsie said, not unkindly. “Witnesses. Sometimes vessels. Sometimes keys. It depends on the season.”

Violet took a step closer. “What did we open?”

“You didn’t open anything yet,” Elsie whispered. “But it’s waiting. Beneath the orchard. It’s always waiting.”

“What is it?”

Elsie leaned forward. “Not what. When.”

The room seemed to dim, the air thinning as though something were holding its breath.

“It lives sideways,” Elsie said. “Not in your time. It feeds on moments. On love unspoken. Regret is its altar. You let it grow when you walked away from each other. When you left.”

Violet blinked. “You mean… it feeds on what we lost?”

“Exactly,” Elsie said. “But it doesn’t just feed. It remembers. And it wants you to remember too.”

Behind them, the wind rose suddenly, and in it, they heard their own voices—laughing, crying, calling each other’s names from another life.

Elsie closed her eyes. “You’ll have to go back into the orchard. One more time. Together.”

Maren didn’t look afraid. She reached for Violet’s hand and held it tightly.

“We’re ready,” she said.

Violet nodded, though her heart beat like a warning bell in her chest.

The orchard was waiting. The past was waiting.

And love—so long buried—was clawing its way back into bloom.

Chapter Three: The Orchard Remembers

It was dusk again when they returned to the orchard. Maren had asked if they should wait until morning, but Violet shook her head. “It’s not bound to time like we are,” she said, her voice thin against the growing wind. “It moves best in the in-between. Twilight. Thresholds.” They dressed in old coats from the back of Violet’s childhood closet, their pockets still holding the forgotten lint and relics of a youth neither had fully escaped. Violet tucked the rusted key from the attic box into her boot, the cold metal pressing against her ankle with each step—a reminder, an anchor.

The trees loomed like watchmen as they passed the crooked gate. Their branches, once bare, had begun to bloom with sickly violet blossoms, petals too dark to be natural. Some were open, others closed like fists, and as they brushed past them, Violet noticed a subtle quiver—not from wind, but as if the trees themselves were breathing. The path was narrower now, choked with undergrowth that hadn’t been there a week ago. It resisted their steps, pulling at their boots and hems like desperate hands.

“Do you hear that?” Maren asked.

Violet paused, tilting her head. From far away, beneath the rustle of leaves, came the faint sound of weeping. Not one voice, but many, layered over one another like overlapping dreams. It came from every direction and none at all, swelling in waves that made the trees shudder and the soil tremble beneath their feet.

“It’s calling again,” Violet said. “But it’s not just me it wants now.”

The swing at the orchard’s center was gone. In its place was a hollow pit, the trapdoor vanished, replaced by a depression in the ground where the soil sagged and steamed. A ring of blackened vines surrounded it, twitching softly. Maren stepped forward, then froze. Her gaze had locked onto something half-buried just outside the ring.

A bone.

Not animal, not child-sized. A human femur, smooth and yellowed, gnawed at the ends.

“This isn’t just a place of memory,” Maren said, voice tight. “It’s a mouth.”

Violet knelt beside the pit. The key burned against her skin now, pulsing like a second heartbeat. She drew it out, and the ground beneath them sighed. The vines recoiled, hissing like steam. A space opened in the earth—wide enough for one person at a time. This time, there was no ladder. Only stone steps descending into a glowless dark.

“You first or me?” Maren asked.

“Together,” Violet said. “One step at a time.”

The descent was different this time. The tunnel felt alive, not in metaphor but in sensation—the walls pulsed like muscle, the air wet and sweet like breath. Their footsteps echoed too long, and the further down they went, the less real the surface above became. By the time they reached the bottom, the orchard was no more than a concept—a place they used to know, like a dream remembered through fog.

The chamber they entered had changed. It was larger now, cathedral-like, and the ceiling arched overhead impossibly high, covered in tangled roots that twitched and hissed like serpents. Symbols glowed faintly on the floor, not carved this time but grown—veins of violet light running through the stone in interwoven spirals. And at the center stood the mirror again.

No cracks this time. No figures inside.

Just them. Their reflections.

Violet stepped forward, her eyes locked onto her other self. But this reflection didn’t mimic her movements. It tilted its head in the opposite direction. Its expression was not her own. It looked mournful. Determined.

“Violet,” it whispered, without moving its lips.

She froze.

“I’m not you,” the reflection said, though its voice was her voice. “I’m the part you gave up.”

“What does that mean?” Violet asked, stepping closer. Her voice was hoarse.

“It means the love you denied, the guilt you buried, the memories you scrubbed clean—all of it fed me. I grew beneath your skin. And now, I am stronger than you.”

Maren stepped forward too, her reflection mimicking her every move. But Maren’s mirror-self was weeping, her eyes flooded with black tears.

“What is this?” Maren asked. “Some kind of punishment?”

“No,” the mirror said. “It is a choice.”

Suddenly, the chamber around them shifted. Walls stretched, roots pulled away to reveal alcoves. In one, Violet saw her mother—sitting cross-legged, humming that same haunting tune, her hands pressed to her ears as if trying to block out voices from within. In another, Declan—pacing in a circle of salt, his eyes wide, lips moving without sound.

“They’re trapped,” Violet breathed.

Maren reached for her hand. “Not trapped. Anchored. They never escaped.”

“But I did,” Violet said. “I left. I survived.”

“Only because something else took your place,” said the mirror.

A soft rumble came from above them, then a loud, splintering crack. Dust rained down. The chamber groaned. The mirror pulsed.

“The orchard is waking,” Maren said. “We don’t have long.”

The voice in the mirror rose, more voices now, layered like a choir:

    “Bury your guilt. Speak your love. Or this place becomes you.”

Violet turned to Maren. Her mouth opened once, then closed again. For so many years, she had swallowed those words, thinking they were too heavy to say, too dangerous to share. But here, in this place where time had grown circular and death had no edge, she could not afford silence.

“I loved you,” she said, her voice trembling. “When we were thirteen. When I left. Every year since. I told myself I didn’t, but I did.”

Maren’s eyes filled with tears. “I know. I’ve always known.”

Violet stepped into the circle of symbols. The key, still warm in her hand, began to tremble.

“I think this is what it wants,” she said. “Not blood. Not sacrifice. Truth.”

Maren stepped in beside her. Together, they placed their palms on the mirror.

It shattered.

Not explosively, but gently—like ice thawing under spring sun. The shards fell inward, dissolving before they hit the ground. Behind the mirror was not a wall, but a corridor. At the end of it, a small garden bloomed—roses, violets, white lilies, all impossible underground. Declan stood there, his face soft, his hands outstretched.

Violet tried to step forward, but he shook his head.

“You can’t follow,” he said, smiling. “You’ve said what I couldn’t. You’ve freed us. But the orchard… it’s not done.”

The chamber dimmed. A wind swept through it—scented not with death, but soil and rain. Renewal.

When they surfaced again, the orchard was different.

Alive.

Not in the writhing, hungry way they’d known, but still. Breathing like a sleeper stirring. The blossoms glowed faintly, and the trees no longer groaned. The path was clear. The sky overhead had gone soft with dawn.

Violet turned to Maren. “Did we do it?”

Maren looked back toward the house. Smoke no longer rose from the chimney. The windows no longer wept. It looked… peaceful.

“I think we began to,” Maren said. “Maybe that’s all we were ever meant to do.”

They stood in silence for a while, then turned together toward the house.

Behind them, the orchard swayed—not ominously, but like a field of dancers, bowing toward the morning sun.

The orchard behind them breathed with a gentler rhythm now, though its stillness did not bring peace. It was the kind of stillness that follows a funeral—the moment after final words are spoken, when everyone stands awkwardly around the grave, waiting for permission to feel something again. Violet and Maren stood on the threshold of the clearing, their hands still laced together, neither daring to break the moment nor ready to move forward. There was a palpable weight in the air, not just from the remnants of what they had seen below but from the uncertainty that lingered in the soil around them.

As they returned to the house, the light shifting into full morning, Violet realized how much had changed in only a handful of days. Marrow Glen no longer felt indifferent—it was alert. Even the townspeople, distant and silent, seemed to move differently. They stood in doorways, lingering, watching, whispering to one another in ways that felt like the beginning of an old ritual repeating itself. The wind carried the scent of the orchard into town, and people turned their heads as if recognizing something not smelled in years.

They didn’t speak of what had happened in the chamber beneath the orchard until late that evening. Back inside the Grange estate, they sat by the fire, though the house no longer seemed cold. The walls had stopped their nightly moaning. The mirrors, once prone to showing things out of sync, now reflected only what was truly there.

“It didn’t destroy anything,” Violet said after a long silence. She stared into her glass, where the whiskey reflected firelight. “It just... remembered.”

Maren sat across from her, legs drawn up under her in the same way she used to sit when they were girls, whispering secrets in the barn loft. “You think remembering was all it ever wanted?”

Violet shook her head. “Not just that. It wanted truth. And it wanted it spoken, not hidden. I think the thing beneath the orchard... maybe it’s what happens when love is twisted by silence.”

Maren’s voice softened. “You mean us.”

“No,” Violet said. “Not just us. My mother. Her mother. Declan. That woman in the photo—my grandmother. They were all caught in this... in this silence. It passed down through bloodlines because no one ever broke it. They just buried it deeper.”

She paused, the fire crackling beside them.

“It doesn’t want victims. It wants vessels. It uses love that’s been mangled by fear. It thrives in what we won’t say.”

Maren nodded, her expression unreadable. “And what if we had stayed quiet?”

Violet looked up, her eyes bright. “Then we’d be part of it. Still are, maybe, in ways. But we don’t belong to it anymore.”

It was later—hours past midnight—when the knocking came. A single knock. Then another. Slow. Deliberate.

Maren froze. “No one knocks here.”

Violet stood, her body tense. She approached the door and opened it without asking who was there.

A child stood on the porch.

He looked no older than ten. Freckles dotted his cheeks, and his clothes were old-fashioned—shorts with suspenders, a gray shirt buttoned all the way to the collar. His eyes were dark and empty of expression, but not lifeless. In his hand he held a small tin toy, a wind-up bird.

“Miss Grange?” he asked, his voice flat, polite.

“Yes?” Violet’s voice barely escaped her.

“My grandmother said I should bring you this.” He extended the toy.

Violet took it slowly. It was warm to the touch.

“What’s your name?” she asked.

“Jonah,” he replied. “Jonah Holloway. My grandmother says it’s not over.”

Violet knelt to meet his gaze. “Your grandmother is Elsie?”

He nodded once.

“She says you opened one door. But there’s another. And she doesn’t know if it’s better to lock it... or step through.”

Violet glanced at Maren, then back to the boy. “Why us?”

He blinked slowly. “Because you spoke. You’re part of the story now.”

With that, he turned and walked down the steps, his little feet making no sound against the wood. Violet watched him disappear into the mist that crept low across the lawn.

When she turned back inside, the toy bird in her hand began to whir softly. Its wings lifted.

Maren moved closer. “Is it mechanical?”

“I don’t think so,” Violet whispered.

They placed it on the kitchen table, and it hopped once, then spun. A soft hum emerged from it—not a tune, not a sound a child’s toy should make, but a hum like a heartbeat echoing through stone. The bird folded its wings again, then fell silent.

They didn’t sleep that night, but it was not the orchard that kept them awake.

The next morning, Violet and Maren drove back to the outskirts of Holloway Farm. Elsie was waiting for them on the porch, already seated in her rocking chair, a thin blanket wrapped around her shoulders despite the rising warmth of the day. Her eyes seemed older, dimmer, but her posture was straighter than before.

“You saw him,” she said as they approached. “Jonah. My grandson.”

“We did,” Violet said. “He said there’s another door.”

Elsie nodded. “The first one showed you what had been buried in the soil. The second shows what you’ve carried inside. It’s the mirror that waits inside your marrow.”

Maren leaned forward. “Where is it?”

Elsie looked past them toward the hills that edged the orchard, where an old rail line had once run before it was swallowed by moss and neglect. “There’s a tunnel beneath the ridge,” she said. “Collapsed years ago, but not all the way. It runs deeper than any records ever mapped. Some say it connects to the mines. Others say it was never made by men at all.”

Violet frowned. “And what’s down there?”

Elsie’s mouth thinned. “Not what. Not who. Just why. That’s where the story goes when it’s tired of being forgotten.”

They returned to the estate, gathered what they could—flashlights, rope, blankets, matches—and by afternoon they had reached the edge of the ridge. The path was steep, choked by thistle and the dry husks of vines. Birds did not sing here. Even the wind hesitated.

They found the entrance half-covered by rockfall and overgrowth. A rusted rail poked through the dirt like a broken bone. It took an hour to clear enough space to crawl inside. The air inside the tunnel was thick and unmoving, and as they crawled forward, the darkness became physical, like wet cloth pressed against their faces.

Ten feet in, the tunnel opened into a chamber.

And there, sitting in the center, was a book.

Bound in leather that pulsed softly, stitched with thread that shimmered violet.

They approached it together, slowly.

Violet knelt and placed her hand on the cover.

It was warm.

And then it began to open, page by page, as if windless fingers turned it. The pages were not blank, nor written in ink, but filled with impressions—faces, places, memories. Some Violet recognized as her own. Others were Maren’s. Others still... belonged to no one.

“This is the second door,” Maren whispered. “It remembers everything we never said.”

The pages turned faster.

Violet saw Declan standing at the quarry’s edge, arms outstretched.

She saw her mother sobbing in the orchard with a letter clenched in her hands.

She saw herself walking away from Maren at the station, fists in her coat pockets, mouth full of words she never allowed to live.

Then the book stopped.

The final page showed a single word:

    Stay.

The chamber began to shake. Roots pressed through the stone. The air grew hot and sharp with electricity.

Violet gripped Maren’s hand.

“I’m not leaving again,” she said.

“Neither am I.”

The chamber didn’t collapse.

It breathed.

And then, it was still.

When they emerged, hours later, dusk was falling again.

But the orchard didn’t groan.

It stood tall, crowned in new blossoms.

The wind whispered softly, but there was no warning in it.

Only a welcome.

Chapter Four: The Tongue of the Forgotten

By the following morning, something had shifted in Marrow Glen. The change was imperceptible at first, more a sensation than a sight. But Violet felt it immediately upon waking—the weight of the house had lifted. The air no longer pressed down on her chest, and for the first time in days, her dreams had not turned to ash. Instead, she had dreamed of rain falling in slow motion, nourishing fields that hadn't seen bloom in generations. The dream had ended with her standing barefoot in the orchard, its blossoms open wide, as if exhaling for the first time.

She found Maren on the front porch, sitting with her legs crossed, a half-empty cup of coffee balanced on the railing beside her. The sun was climbing the sky in long golden strides, and its light fell across Maren's features with a softness Violet hadn't seen since their teenage years. It made her look younger and older at once, like someone who had returned from war and survived.

“You look different,” Violet said as she joined her.

Maren smirked without turning. “You’re not the first to say that. Elsie called earlier. Said the trees are growing too fast. Said she thinks they’re listening.”

Violet nodded slowly. “I think they always were.”

They didn’t speak for several minutes, letting the silence between them breathe without suspicion. That kind of silence—unthreatening, companionable—had once been a foreign thing in the Grange household. In her mother’s time, silence meant a storm brewing. In her own time, it had been armor. Now, it felt like a hand resting lightly on a shoulder.

“Do you think we stopped it?” Maren asked eventually.

Violet thought for a long time before answering. “No. I think we translated it.”

Maren gave her a curious glance.

“It wasn’t trying to destroy us,” Violet continued. “It was trying to be understood. That thing under the orchard, in the mirror, in the book—it was memory. Compacted, forgotten, denied. It had no mouth, so it made one out of us.”

Maren sipped her coffee. “You’re saying we were its... voice?”

“Yes. And I think that’s why it didn’t kill us.”

Maren scoffed. “Well, that’s comforting.”

That afternoon they walked through town, not because they had a destination, but because walking felt necessary. The people of Marrow Glen no longer avoided them. Some offered nods; others, brief eye contact that lingered just a moment too long. A few mothers pulled their children closer as they passed, but no one turned away.

At the edge of the square, Violet stopped in front of the old chapel. The door had been repaired with fresh wood, and a wreath of woven twigs hung on the handle, adorned with small purple flowers. The symbol carved into the wood the night of Brother Aldwych’s death had been sanded down, but if one looked closely, the faint outline remained—faint as a healed scar.

Inside, the chapel had changed too. It no longer smelled like mildew or burnt incense. The pews had been cleaned and straightened. Candles flickered at the altar. But it wasn’t religion that filled the space anymore. It was memory. Honest, open memory.

She turned to Maren. “Do you remember when we used to sneak in here after school? Just to hide?”

Maren chuckled. “You mean when we pretended to be exiled nuns?”

“Yes. And we made that ridiculous vow of silence.”

“We lasted an hour.”

“Still a record for us.”

They lingered in the chapel for some time. Violet approached the altar and placed her hand on the wood. Beneath it, she imagined the roots stretching through the soil, no longer coiled in anger but resting, dormant, waiting for spring.

That evening, they returned to the Grange house with a strange energy moving between them—a kind of hunger neither had felt in years. It was not lust. It was not even longing. It was acknowledgment, whole and unguarded.

They sat on the floor in Violet’s childhood room, surrounded by old books, letters, and the fragments of youth. They found a cassette player with a warped tape labeled in Declan’s scrawl: “Do Not Play Without Me”. Maren pressed the button anyway.

The tape hissed to life, a low whine that faded into the sound of a piano. The same song he had played in the orchard. But this version was slower, more deliberate. Every note sounded like it had been pulled from somewhere deep inside him.

Then, Declan’s voice.

“If you’re listening to this, I guess I didn’t make it. Or maybe I did and I’m just somewhere else. Either way, I need you to know something. I wasn’t crazy. Not in the way they thought. I saw things. Heard them. But the thing is, I think they came from me. From all of us. The orchard isn’t a place—it’s a reflection. And it only grows what we plant in it.”

Maren pressed pause.

The room was silent.

Violet closed her eyes. “He was trying to warn us. Or prepare us.”

“He did both,” Maren said. “And maybe this is what he wanted us to do with it.”

The days that followed passed with a strange rhythm. They spoke often with Elsie, who had taken to calling daily with odd reports: trees blooming out of season, children dreaming in languages they couldn’t speak. She didn’t sound afraid. Only observant. The town began holding evening gatherings in the park again, something that hadn’t happened since Violet was a child. People brought food and sat on blankets, and though no one mentioned the orchard or the chapel or what had happened to the reverend, there was a sense that the town was no longer waiting for something terrible to happen.

They had survived the turning.

One evening, nearly two weeks after the second descent into the tunnel, Violet stood alone beneath the plum trees, their fruit swelling slowly in the twilight. She felt the hum of the earth beneath her bare feet and the soft static of something unseen pressing gently against her skin. She wasn’t afraid. She didn’t even feel watched. She felt.
