Coins of Passage
Chapter 1: The Telling

When Eli Grantham first found the coin, he was only seven years old. It wasn’t a grand discovery — not one of those tales where a boy trips over destiny in a golden beam of light. No. It was raining that day, an ugly, angry kind of rain that blurred the world into a charcoal sketch, and Eli was knee-deep in mud, chasing after a rusted red kite that had broken free from his hands.

The coin, half-buried near the roots of an ancient elm, glinted once — just once — like an eyelid winking open. If it hadn’t caught that flash of dreary grey light, he would’ve missed it. He almost did. He almost just kept running, arms stretched out like a bird about to crash into the earth.

But he didn’t.

He stopped. Looked. Took two uncertain steps back.

It wasn’t a normal coin. Eli could tell that much immediately, even at seven. It was heavier than it looked — a thick, ridged thing about the size of a silver dollar, but darker, made of some metal that seemed to drink the light rather than reflect it. On one side was an emblem: a tree whose roots tangled around the edge like fingers. On the other, a phrase etched in a language he didn’t know but somehow understood:

    “All debts must be paid.”

He slipped it into his pocket without thinking. That was the kind of boy Eli was — he collected the strange, the broken, the forgotten. Bottle caps, lost buttons, nails bent into useless hooks. A coin like this, heavy and humming faintly against the fabric of his jeans, felt right at home among his treasures.

Of course, he didn't tell anyone. Not his mother, who would’ve scolded him for “picking up trash,” not his brother Joel, who would’ve tried to steal it just for the thrill. And certainly not his father, who barely noticed Eli most days unless something was missing or broken.

The coin stayed hidden. For a while.

But coins have their own gravity, and this one — well, it pulled things into orbit faster than Eli could’ve guessed.

The first thing that happened was the dreams.

They started a few nights after the discovery. Not the usual dreamscape of endless halls and shadow-chases that plagued Eli most nights. These were different. Vivid. Tactile. In them, he stood on a bridge made of stone so old it wept moss. Below, a river writhed — not with water, but with something black and full of eyes. Across the bridge, always, was a figure cloaked in white, holding out an identical coin between two long, narrow fingers.

"You owe," the figure whispered, though its mouth never moved.

Every night, the dream repeated. Sometimes the figure was closer. Sometimes farther. Sometimes there were two figures. Once, there were dozens, their coins gleaming like stars in the fog.

It was Joel who noticed first.

"You look like hell," Joel said one morning over their sad, dry cereal. He was ten, full of that particular cruelty that only older brothers possess.

"Shut up," Eli muttered, spooning mush into his mouth. It tasted like nothing. Like chewing on a lie.

"You better not be having nightmares again," Joel continued, unfazed. "Mom says if you wake up screaming one more time, she’s gonna take you to the doctor."

Eli said nothing. What could he say? That he was seeing rivers of eyes? Bridges that shouldn’t exist? Figures that spoke without words?

The second thing that happened was the luck.

It was small at first. Eli found a crumpled five-dollar bill on the playground. Then he won a free soda from the vending machine at the grocery store — three times in a row. Then Mrs. Donner, the meanest substitute teacher in the whole district, somehow forgot to assign homework the day Eli forgot his backpack.

Coincidence. That’s what anyone would say.

But Eli knew. Somehow, he knew. The coin was doing it.

And for a while, he leaned into it. Who wouldn’t? The world tilted his way now. Little things, but they added up. Joel started getting in trouble instead of him. The neighbor’s dog, who used to bark and snap at Eli’s heels, suddenly became docile as a sleeping cat. Even Mrs. Grantham — their mother, tired and stretched thin from double shifts at the hospital — smiled at him once, really smiled, like she used to when he was very small and the world felt safe.

It couldn’t last.

Deep down, Eli understood that too.

The third thing was the debt.

It began the afternoon Old Man Caulfield died.

Everyone knew Mr. Caulfield. He was the cranky neighbor two houses down, famous for chasing kids off his lawn with a rusted rake and a mouth full of colorful curses. No one liked him much, but he was a part of the neighborhood — like the leaning street sign at the corner or the abandoned tire swing by the woods.

Eli had been walking home from school when he found the wallet. It was lying in the gutter, soaked and heavy with rain. Without thinking, he picked it up. Inside was a wad of cash — way more than any kid had business holding — and an ID card bearing Mr. Caulfield’s scowling photo.

And the coin, tucked neatly into a small side pocket.

An identical coin.

For a moment, the world froze. Raindrops hung midair like beads of glass. Cars on the street stood still, their drivers suspended in time. Even Eli’s own breath seemed caught halfway in his chest.

Then it all snapped back.

He blinked. Shoved the wallet into his backpack.

Later that night, Mr. Caulfield’s house caught fire.

No one was quite sure how it started. Some said it was the old wiring. Others whispered about careless cigarettes. The official report said “undetermined origin.”

What Eli remembered most wasn’t the fire engines or the flashing lights. It was the smell: not smoke, but something sour and metallic, like blood left too long in the sun.

And the dreams changed.

Now the bridge was crumbling beneath his feet. The figure in white was closer than ever, its outstretched hand nearly brushing Eli’s own.

"You owe," it hissed. "One debt paid. More remain."

Eli tried to get rid of the coin after that.

He buried it in the backyard, under the cracked gnome statue no one cared about. It didn’t matter. He woke up the next morning with the coin tucked into his sock drawer, nestled between the worn wool and the forgotten marbles.

He threw it into the river. Three days later, it clattered onto his desk at school, right on top of his math homework.

He tried burning it, smashing it, even leaving it on the altar of the church where his mother sometimes dragged them on Sundays. It always came back.

Sometimes immediately. Sometimes after a day or two. But always, always.

"You owe," the voice in his dreams said, now less whisper and more growl. "All debts must be paid."

By the time Eli was nine, he understood a few things.

One: The coin would never leave him.

Two: It wasn’t done with him. Not by a long shot.

Three: The more he tried to ignore it, the heavier it became — not just physically (though it did seem heavier some days, pulling his pockets down with a dull, dragging weight), but in the air around him. Like walking through a world underwater.

Four: There were others.

He spotted them sometimes, at the edges of his vision. Strangers with strange eyes. A woman at the gas station who stared too long, a man on the bus with a coin chain wrapped around his wrist like a bracelet, a girl at the fair who wore one on a necklace and flinched when Eli’s coin clinked against hers as they passed.

They all carried the same look: a hollowed-out tiredness, a kind of resigned vigilance. The look of someone always listening for footsteps behind them.

It wasn’t until Eli turned twelve that he met the first one who spoke to him.

Her name was Mina, and she saved his life before she even introduced herself.

It happened on a Tuesday, at dusk, the sky bleeding out in bruised purples and sickly yellows. Eli was walking home — the long way, past the woods where the river chattered over broken stones — when he heard the voice.

Not the dream-voice. A real one.

"You owe," it rasped from the shadows.

He turned. Heart hammering. No one there. But the trees leaned in close, their branches clawing at the air.

"You owe," the voice insisted, closer now.

He ran.

Feet pounding, breath tearing at his lungs, Eli sprinted toward the main road. He could almost see it — the safety of it, the bright flicker of headlights — when something cold and heavy slammed into his back, sending him sprawling into the gravel.

He rolled over, ready to fight, ready to die — he didn’t know which.

And then she was there.

Mina.

She moved fast, a blur of black jacket and fury. In her hand was a coin — larger than his, gleaming with symbols he didn’t recognize — and she slammed it into the ground between him and the thing that had been chasing him.

There was a sound like a bell shattering.

The air twisted. The thing screamed — a sound like breaking glass and weeping children — and vanished.

Mina stood over him, breathing hard.

"You’re lucky," she said after a moment, her voice rough but not unkind. "Most don’t get a second chance."

Eli sat up, dizzy, blood trickling from a cut on his temple.

"Who — who are you?" he stammered.

She crouched down, her eyes level with his.

"Someone who owes too," she said simply. "And someone who’s tired of paying alone."

She offered him her hand.

Eli hesitated.

But the coin in his pocket throbbed once, as if urging him forward.

He took her hand.

And everything changed.

Mina didn’t take him home, not right away.
Instead, she led him through a maze of back alleys and side streets Eli barely recognized, even though he’d lived in Fairhaven his whole life. Somehow, in the falling darkness, everything looked different — stretched and unfamiliar, like a bad dream you couldn’t quite wake from.

They ended up in a laundromat — an ancient, flickering place squeezed between a pawn shop and an abandoned video store. The neon OPEN sign buzzed and clicked in protest, barely hanging onto life. Inside, the machines churned on their own, unattended. Eli noticed absently that none of them seemed to be washing anything — they just spun, empty, humming a low mechanical dirge.

"Sit," Mina said, pointing to a cracked plastic chair near the window.

Eli obeyed, mostly because he didn’t know what else to do. His heart still hadn’t settled. His palms were scraped raw from the fall, and his ribs ached from where he’d landed. His mind reeled, replaying the attack over and over: the shadows bending, the awful voice calling, the crushing weight on his back.

Mina paced in front of him, muttering to herself. She was older, maybe fifteen or sixteen, with a thin, wiry frame and short black hair that stuck up like a crown of thorns. Her jacket — some battered army surplus thing — was covered in patches and safety pins. A small backpack thumped against her hip as she moved.

Finally, she stopped. Faced him.

"You found a coin," she said. Not a question.

Eli nodded, then hesitated. "How do you know?"

Mina snorted, one eyebrow arching. "Because otherwise you’d be dead right now."

She pulled a coin from her pocket — different from Eli’s. Hers was brighter, almost gold, and bore the image of a coiled serpent eating its own tail. She spun it between her fingers expertly, the metal catching the dim light in quick, hypnotic flashes.

"They find you once you hold one," she explained. "The debtors. The collectors. Whatever you want to call them."

Eli swallowed hard. "Who were they?"

Mina shrugged. "Hard to say. Could be anything. Could’ve been someone you owed. Could’ve been someone the coin owed." She crouched in front of him, her voice dropping low. "The coin carries old debts. Ancient ones. Some older than memory itself. When you take the coin, you take the debt."

Eli stared at her, his brain working slow, sluggish loops. "But... I didn’t take it. I just found it."

"Doesn’t matter," Mina said grimly. "Finding it is enough. Picking it up, touching it. The coin chooses you. Not the other way around."

The laundromat lights flickered again, and Mina stood quickly, glancing toward the windows. She seemed restless, twitchy, like a cat in a room full of rocking chairs.

"We can’t stay here long," she muttered. "They’re already looking again. They don’t give up easy."

Eli stood shakily. His legs felt like wet paper. "Where are we going?"

Mina slung her backpack over her shoulder. "To someone who can help. Maybe. If he’s sober." She tossed him a look over her shoulder — a quick, evaluating glance. "You’re lucky you met me first, kid. Most people... they don’t get anyone to explain the rules. They just... disappear."

A cold knot tightened in Eli’s gut.

"Rules?" he echoed.

Mina smiled — a grim, humorless twist of her mouth.

"Yeah," she said. "The rules of the coins."

They cut through the town, keeping to the shadows. Mina moved like she had every alleyway memorized, ducking between dumpsters and scaling low fences with practiced ease. Eli struggled to keep up, wincing each time his sneakers scraped too loudly against concrete.

The rules, as Mina explained them in hushed bursts between stops, were brutal in their simplicity.

Rule One: Never lose the coin. If you lose it, you lose everything.
Rule Two: Debts must be paid. Delay too long, and the coin will pay them for you — in ways you won’t like.
Rule Three: Every favor the coin grants has a cost. A price you don’t see right away.
Rule Four: Some debts aren’t yours, but you still have to carry them.
Rule Five: There’s no getting rid of the coin. Not really. But there are ways to... manage it.

Manage it.
That was the word Mina used, like it was an unruly dog or a bad habit. Not fix it. Not cure it. Just... endure.

Eli listened, his heart a leaden thud in his chest. It didn’t seem real. How could it be real?

And yet — the coin in his pocket pulsed against his leg, warm and undeniable.

They stopped in front of a crumbling townhouse on the edge of the old downtown district. The porch sagged dangerously, the windows were boarded up, and a patchwork of graffiti crawled across the front door.

"Here," Mina said, hopping up the steps two at a time. She banged a complicated rhythm on the door — three quick knocks, a pause, then two slow ones.

For a long moment, nothing happened. Then the door creaked open a few inches. A pair of bloodshot eyes peered out.

"What," said a voice, dry and rasping, "do you want, Mina?"

"Got a new one," Mina said, jerking a thumb at Eli. "Found him getting hunted by a collector. Thought you might wanna take a look before he gets himself killed."

The door opened wider, revealing a man who looked like he’d been dragged backward through hell and decided to stay. He was tall and thin, with hair that might once have been blond but was now a patchy mix of grey and dirt. His clothes hung off him in limp folds, and he smelled faintly of old smoke and something sour.

He squinted at Eli, then grunted. "Bring him in."

The inside of the townhouse was worse than the outside. The air was thick with dust and the cloying scent of mildew. Piles of old books, yellowed maps, and broken electronics were stacked haphazardly against every wall. The floor was a minefield of crumpled paper and half-eaten meals.

The man led them into a room that might once have been a dining room. A single lightbulb swung from the ceiling, casting long, jittery shadows.

"Name’s Carrick," the man said, slumping into a battered armchair with a groan. "You got a coin, kid?"

Eli nodded, too nervous to speak. He pulled the coin from his pocket, holding it out awkwardly.

Carrick leaned forward, his bloodshot eyes gleaming. He didn’t touch it — didn’t even get too close. He just looked.

"Hmm," he said after a long moment. "Tree of Roots. Nasty one. Old blood debt, if I’m guessing right. Not something you want hanging around your neck long."

Eli opened his mouth to ask a question, but Carrick cut him off with a wave of his hand.

"First thing you gotta learn," Carrick said, his voice turning sharp, "is that the coin isn’t your friend. It’s a contract. A binding. You don’t own it. It owns you."

Mina perched on the arm of another chair, watching Eli carefully.

"But," Carrick continued, scratching at his scraggly beard, "that doesn’t mean you’re helpless. You can bargain. You can... defer."

"Defer?" Eli echoed.

"Push the debt onto others," Carrick said, grinning a broken-tooth smile. "Or pay it in smaller pieces. Tricky business, but doable. For a price."

Eli’s stomach churned. "What kind of price?"

Carrick laughed — a wet, hacking sound.

"Everything’s got a price, boy. Question is, are you willing to pay it?"

Chapter 2: Weighing the Cost

The next morning, Eli woke up in Carrick’s townhouse with a mouth full of dust and a headache sharp enough to split concrete. For a few disorienting seconds, he didn’t know where he was. He lay on a sagging, stained couch with a blanket that smelled faintly of wet dog thrown over him.

The memories came back all at once. Mina. The collector. The coin. The rules. Carrick’s gravelly voice warning him: Everything has a price.

Eli sat up, wincing. His pocket felt heavier somehow, and when he reached inside, the coin was still there — cool against his fingers, thrumming faintly, like a heart beating out of time.

The townhouse was eerily quiet. Somewhere, water dripped at irregular intervals. The front windows were boarded up so thickly that only slivers of grey light cut through.

Eli swung his feet to the floor and looked around. He wasn’t alone.

Mina sat at the battered kitchen table, picking at a piece of toast. She looked up when he moved and gave him a short nod.

"Still breathing," she said. "Good sign."

Carrick shuffled into the room a few seconds later, clutching a chipped mug of something that might’ve once been coffee. He looked even worse in the morning light — more like a scarecrow than a man.

"Right," Carrick said, clearing his throat. "Let’s get this over with."

He dropped heavily into a chair across from Eli and leaned forward, the tendons in his hands standing out like ropes under his skin.

"You’ve got two choices, boy," Carrick said. "One: You can try to ride it out alone. Keep your head down. Hope the debts don’t drown you too fast." He sipped his drink, grimacing. "Spoiler: They will."

Eli swallowed. "And the second choice?"

Carrick smiled, all teeth and bitterness.

"Join the Circle."

Mina shot Carrick a warning look, but said nothing.

"The Circle?" Eli asked cautiously.

"Those of us who carry coins — who understand them," Carrick said. "We band together. Trade debts. Share knowledge. Sometimes we even survive a little longer that way." He tapped a finger against the table. "It’s not free. Nothing’s free. But it beats dying alone in some gutter with a coin fused to your bones."

Eli glanced at Mina. She was staring at the floor, jaw clenched.

"What if I don't want either?" he said quietly.

Carrick chuckled — a low, rasping sound.

"Then you’ll be dead by the end of the month," he said bluntly. "Maybe sooner."

The room seemed to press in on Eli, heavy with the weight of too many invisible debts. He could feel the coin against his leg, burning cold now instead of warm.

"I..." Eli began, but the words stuck. What could he say? That he just wanted to go back? Go home? Pretend none of this had happened?

The world didn’t work like that anymore. Maybe it never had.

They gave him until sundown to decide.

Mina slipped out after breakfast, leaving Eli alone with his thoughts and Carrick’s warning echoing in his ears.

The day dragged by in a strange half-light. Eli wandered the townhouse, careful not to disturb the teetering stacks of books and papers. He found strange things tucked away between the clutter — a brass compass that spun wildly no matter which way he turned it, a cracked mirror that showed not his own reflection but a dark forest shrouded in mist, a deck of cards whose faces constantly shifted when he wasn’t looking directly at them.

Carrick’s world was a broken place, full of lost things and forgotten rules. Eli wondered if he was already becoming part of it — a coin-worn thing himself.

Around mid-afternoon, he found an old map tacked to the inside of a closet door. It was a map of Fairhaven, but not like any he had seen before. This one was covered in red X’s and looping lines drawn in faded ink. Some parts of the map had been scratched out entirely, as if whatever was there had been erased from reality.

A scrap of paper pinned to the bottom read:

Danger Zones - Known Haunts - Do Not Enter

Eli leaned closer, tracing one of the lines with his finger. It led straight through the woods by the river — the place where he had found the coin.

He shivered and closed the door.

When Mina returned, she looked different somehow. Sharper. More distant.

"Well?" she asked, tossing her backpack onto the table.

Eli stood by the window, staring at the thin slivers of dying sunlight.

"I’ll join," he said, voice cracking a little. "The Circle."

Mina’s shoulders relaxed, just a fraction. She nodded once.

"Good," she said. "Smart choice."

Carrick grunted from his armchair. "Don’t celebrate yet. Joining’s the easy part."

He dragged a battered notebook from under a pile of newspapers and slapped it onto the table. The cover was stained and torn, and the pages inside were filled with dense, crabbed handwriting.

"This," Carrick said, tapping it, "is the Codex. The rules we’ve written down. The ones we’ve figured out the hard way."

He shoved it toward Eli.

"Study it. Memorize it. Live by it."

Eli opened the notebook carefully. The first page read:

    THE CODEX OF THE COINBEARERS
    All debts bind. All debts bleed. Beware the bargain that costs too little.

He flipped through the pages, overwhelmed. There were lists of symbols, diagrams of coins he didn’t recognize, instructions for rituals and warnings scrawled in thick, urgent ink:

    Never accept a coin from another’s hand directly.
    Always close the circle before bargaining.
    Blood is the first currency. Memory is the second.

Carrick watched him with an expression halfway between pity and grim amusement.

"You’ll learn fast, or you’ll die faster," he said.

Mina slumped into a chair opposite him, pulling out a knife and idly flipping it between her fingers. She looked tired — not physically, but in her bones.

Eli turned another page.

    Beware the Silver Men.
    Beware the Ones Who Owe Nothing.

He pointed to that last line.

"What does that mean?" he asked.

Mina and Carrick exchanged a glance.

"You don’t want to meet them," Mina said finally. "They’re... not bound like we are. They’re free."

"But that’s good, right?" Eli said. "Being free?"

Carrick barked a harsh laugh.

"Free to do anything," he said. "Including hunting us."

The light outside faded into deep blue, and the house seemed to fold inward, its shadows stretching longer, darker.

Carrick stood with a grunt and tossed Eli a small, battered coin pouch.

"You’re one of us now," he said. "Whether you like it or not."

Eli caught the pouch awkwardly. It jingled faintly — not with coins, but with something heavier. Something alive.

Mina stood too, slipping her knife into a sheath at her belt.

"Tomorrow," she said, "we start teaching you how to survive."

Eli nodded, though fear clawed at his chest.

Survival. That was the best he could hope for now.

Chapter 3: First Debts

The training wasn’t what Eli expected.

He thought maybe Mina would teach him how to fight — like in the movies, spinning kicks and secret handshakes and maybe some flashy magic thrown in.
Instead, it was mostly running.
And hiding.
And a lot of really, really boring lectures.

“Rule of survival,” Mina said the first morning as she shoved a backpack into his arms, “is not about how tough you are. It’s about how well you can stay unseen.”

The backpack was stuffed with strange things: chalk, salt, a bundle of red thread, three iron nails, a jar of what Mina said was "river dirt" (whatever that meant), and a worn notebook full of even more rules.

Eli barely had time to ask questions before they were moving — fast — through the town’s twisted backstreets. Mina showed him how to mark safe paths with chalk symbols low on telephone poles, places only other Circle members would recognize. She showed him how to spot hiding places — old storm drains, broken fences, gaps between crumbling buildings where a quick slip could save your life.

“You move like a thunderstorm,” Mina complained after the third sprint, as Eli gasped for breath against a graffiti-covered wall. “Loud, messy, and you scare the hell out of everybody.”

“Maybe I’m not cut out for this,” Eli said, wiping sweat off his forehead.

Mina shrugged. “None of us were.”

They didn’t have time for pity. That afternoon, Carrick sent them on their first task. Not a mission — not yet — but something Mina called a proving.

A proving was simple: find a debt and settle it before sunset. If you failed, you didn’t belong to the Circle. You belonged to the collectors.

Carrick didn’t sugarcoat it. He handed Eli a battered envelope sealed with dark wax.

“Your debt,” Carrick said. “Your chance.”

Inside was a single sheet of paper with a name and an address:

MARCIA WINTERS — 14 BARNHAM LANE

And beneath it, a warning scrawled in ink:

    Debtor refused payment. Beware distortions.

Eli didn’t know what that meant yet.
He was about to learn.

Barnham Lane sat on the edge of town where Fairhaven blurred into miles of overgrown fields and forgotten farmhouses. The houses there sagged against each other like tired old men, their windows boarded, their yards choked with weeds.

Mina led the way, moving quick but cautious. Every few steps, she’d stop and scan the street, her hand resting lightly on the hilt of the knife she wore clipped to her belt.

“Distortions?” Eli asked after a while, keeping his voice low.

“Reality bends around unpaid debts,” Mina said grimly. “Things… slip. Places get wrong. People lose their faces. It gets bad fast.”

Eli’s stomach tightened.

“And what do we do when we find her?”

Mina gave him a sideways look.

“We settle it.”

Eli didn’t ask what that meant. He had a feeling he didn’t want to know until he had to.

They found the house easily enough — a squat, sagging thing swallowed by tall grass. The windows were dark, the door hanging half off its hinges.

Eli hesitated at the gate, the air thick and still around him. The world felt… wrong here. Like stepping into a photograph that had been crumpled, smoothed out, and badly taped back together.

Colors seemed off. The sky was too pale. The trees moved even though there was no wind.

Mina drew a piece of chalk from her pocket and scrawled a quick sigil on the gatepost — a small circle with an X through it. Eli recognized it from the Codex: Safe retreat.

“If anything goes sideways,” she said quietly, “you run for this mark. Got it?”

Eli nodded, swallowing hard.

Together, they stepped through the gate and onto the cracked path leading up to the house.

The air grew colder with every step. A buzzing filled Eli’s ears, faint at first, then louder, like a thousand invisible insects swarming just out of sight.

At the front door, Mina paused and pulled something from her jacket — a small mirror, no bigger than her palm. She held it up, angling it toward the house.

The reflection showed the door as a solid wall of fleshy mouths, all whispering in unison.

Mina grimaced and stuffed the mirror away.

“Bad distortion,” she muttered. “Be ready.”

She pushed the door open, and the two of them slipped inside.

The interior of the house was worse.
Way worse.

The walls breathed.
The floorboards shifted like muscles under skin.
The light came from nowhere and everywhere at once, casting long, twitching shadows that didn’t always match the shape of the objects they belonged to.

Eli fought the urge to bolt. He clenched his fists around the coin in his pocket, feeling its heavy pulse steady him.

“We need to find Marcia,” Mina whispered. “And fast.”

They moved through the house in tight formation, back to back, checking every corner, every twisted room. Most were empty except for piles of rotting furniture and strange stains that Eli didn’t want to look at too closely.

In what might once have been the living room, they found her.

Marcia Winters.

She sat in an armchair facing the wall, her back to them. Her hair was long and matted, her body skeletal beneath a thin, tattered nightgown.

Eli took a step forward.

“M-Ms. Winters?” he called, his voice cracking.

The woman stirred. Slowly, jerkily, like a puppet on broken strings.

She turned her head — and Eli bit down on a scream.

Her face was a blur.
Not scarred, not bloody — just… unfinished. Like a painting someone had wiped their hand across. No eyes. No mouth. Just a smeared suggestion of a face.

Behind him, Mina hissed a curse.

“Distortion’s too far gone,” she said grimly. “She can’t pay anymore.”

“What do we do?” Eli whispered.

Mina stepped forward, drawing a small silver knife from her belt. It wasn’t the same knife she always played with — this one was plainer, heavier, etched with runes.

“She’s trapped,” Mina said quietly. “Mercy’s the only payment left.”

Eli stared, heart pounding.

“But she’s alive—”

“She’s suffering,” Mina cut in. “Every second she stays like this is worse than death.” She looked at him, her eyes hard. “You want to survive in this world? You need to understand: sometimes paying the debt means ending it.”

Marcia shuddered in the chair, a soft, broken sound escaping her blurred not-mouth.

Eli closed his eyes.

He nodded.

Mina moved quickly, almost gently. She pressed the knife to Marcia’s chest — not stabbing, but laying it flat against her heart.

A soft blue light flared from the blade, and Marcia exhaled a long, rattling breath.

The house groaned around them. The walls shuddered.
And then, silence.

When Eli opened his eyes, Marcia was gone.
Only the empty chair remained.

The house didn't collapse when Marcia vanished.
It didn’t crumble into dust or explode into light like Eli half-expected.

It just… stopped.

The walls no longer breathed.
The colors settled back into something closer to normal — not quite right, but less wrong.
The floor beneath Eli’s sneakers felt solid again.

Mina slid the silver knife back into its sheath and straightened up. She didn’t say anything. She didn’t need to.

Eli stood frozen for a few seconds, staring at the empty chair, trying to convince himself that what had just happened wasn’t murder.
It didn’t feel like murder.
It didn’t feel like mercy, either.
It felt like paying a bill you didn’t remember racking up.

Finally, Mina touched his arm.

"Come on," she said softly. "We need to leave before something else notices."

Eli let her guide him back through the sagging house. It seemed less threatening now, just empty and ruined, another hollow place in a world full of them.

When they stepped back onto the cracked sidewalk, the air outside felt cool and clean. The sky had deepened into a violet dusk, and the first stars were pricking through.

For a moment, they just stood there.
Neither of them spoke.

Then Mina dug into her pocket and pulled out a piece of red thread. She tied it around the rusted iron gate in a quick, practiced knot.

"Claimed and closed," she murmured.

Eli watched her, still numb.

"What happens now?" he asked.

Mina glanced at him, her face unreadable.

"Now?" she said. "Now you get your first scar."

They made their way back to Carrick’s townhouse as the night thickened.

Fairhaven by night was a different beast altogether — quieter, but not safer. Shadows moved strangely in the corners of Eli’s vision. Streetlamps flickered and went dark as they passed. More than once, Mina yanked him sharply into an alley or behind a dumpster as a black car rolled slowly by, windows tinted too dark to see through.

"Collectors patrol after dark," she muttered the third time she dragged him off the road. "Especially after a debt settles. They can smell it."

"Smell it?" Eli whispered, heart hammering.

She didn’t answer.

They reached Carrick’s place just before midnight. Mina banged out the same rhythm on the door — three quick knocks, a pause, two slow — and Carrick let them in without a word.

The townhouse smelled even worse than usual — like something wet had crawled in under the floorboards and died.

Carrick eyed them both for a long moment, then jerked his chin toward the kitchen.

"Report," he said.

Mina dropped into a chair, exhausted, while Eli stood awkwardly by the doorway.

"Marcia Winters," Mina said. "Distortion stage five. No cognitive recovery possible. Debt paid by cessation."

Carrick grunted. He scribbled something down in a battered ledger.

"And him?" he said, jerking his thumb toward Eli.

Mina looked at Eli. Her face was impassive, but her eyes were different — sharper, older somehow.

"He didn’t run," she said simply.

Carrick gave a slow, grudging nod.

"Good," he said. "Means he’s got a chance."

He rummaged in a drawer and pulled out something small and heavy: a second coin. It was different from Eli’s first — this one was dull bronze, stamped with the image of an open eye.

Carrick held it out.

"Payment for services rendered," he said. "Your first bonus."

Eli hesitated, then took it.
The new coin was cold and slick in his palm. It felt wrong somehow, like holding something still alive and angry.

He glanced at Mina, who just shrugged.

"Every coin has a curse," she said. "But some curses are lighter than others."

Eli slid the coin into his pocket next to the first.
He wasn’t sure if he felt richer… or just more doomed.

That night, Eli didn’t sleep.

He lay on the battered couch, staring at the cracked ceiling, listening to the sounds of Carrick’s heavy breathing and Mina’s occasional restless shifts in the next room.

His body was exhausted, but his mind wouldn’t shut off.

The image of Marcia Winters haunted him — the way she had sat there, faceless and broken, the way the house had shuddered when she was freed.

He turned the coins over in his hand, one after another.
The Tree of Roots.
The Open Eye.

He thought about what Carrick had said:
You don’t own the coin. It owns you.

Was this what the rest of his life was going to be? Running. Settling debts that weren’t his. Hiding from things he barely understood. Collecting coins like scars.

He closed his fingers around the Tree of Roots coin, feeling its weight against his skin.

"You chose me," he whispered.

The coin pulsed once, slow and heavy, like a heartbeat.
Or a reminder.

The next few days blurred together in a haze of training and fear.

Carrick made him memorize parts of the Codex — not just the rules, but the deeper lore, the stories the older Circle members whispered about the first coinbearers, the ancient debts that had cracked kingdoms and erased cities.

Mina taught him how to draw warding circles, how to weave simple bindings with salt and string, how to spot a disguised collector from across a crowded street.

"Most of them look normal," she warned. "Bankers. Priests. Politicians. Some don't even know what they are anymore."

Every night, Eli felt the coins under his pillow, burning cold against his skin.
Every morning, he woke up a little heavier.
A little harder.

He thought maybe he was starting to understand the look in Mina’s eyes.
The hollowness.
The sharpness.

It was what happened when you lived knowing you owed a debt that could never fully be paid.

One evening, just as the sun dipped behind the broken rooftops, Carrick called them into the kitchen.

He was holding a scrap of old parchment, his hands trembling slightly.

"We've got a problem," Carrick said.

Eli and Mina exchanged a glance.

"Another debt?" Mina asked.

Carrick shook his head.

"Worse," he said. "A bondbreaking."

The word hung heavy in the air.
Even Mina paled a little.

"A what?" Eli asked, heart sinking.

Carrick slammed the parchment down on the table. It showed a crude drawing of a coin — not like Eli’s or Mina’s, but something wilder. Rougher.

"This," Carrick growled, tapping the page, "is a Shattercoin. It's what happens when a bearer tries to break their bond without paying the debt."

Mina swore under her breath.

"You can't just break the bond," Carrick said, voice rising. "You can transfer it, defer it, manage it — but you can't break it. Not without consequences."

He leaned closer, his eyes bloodshot and furious.

"When a Shattercoin forms, it doesn't just doom the bearer. It tears open a hole."

Eli swallowed. "A hole in what?"

Carrick smiled grimly.

"In the world," he said. "In the fabric of the deal itself. And everything that slithers beyond gets a peek inside."

Mina leaned over the parchment, studying the crude sigils scrawled along its edges.

"Where?" she asked.

Carrick hesitated. Then:

"Here," he said. "Fairhaven."

Eli’s stomach twisted into knots.

Someone had broken their bond.
Someone had shattered a coin.
And whatever had been keeping the worst of the collectors at bay… was breaking, right here, right now.

Carrick slammed his hand down on the table, making Eli jump.

"We need to find the Shattercoin," Carrick said. "And seal it. Before it’s too late."

Outside, the wind howled against the broken windows.
The town of Fairhaven shivered.

And somewhere in the gathering dark, something ancient and hungry opened its eyes.

They didn’t waste time.

Carrick shoved a map into Mina’s hands, and together, they started plotting possible breach points around Fairhaven. The old man mumbled to himself, tracing the paths with a grimy finger, while Eli hovered near the door, heart hammering in his chest like a trapped bird.

The wind outside picked up, rattling the boards nailed across the windows. Somewhere deep in the guts of the house, something creaked and shifted — a long, low groan that sounded almost like a voice.

"The breach won’t stay in one place long," Carrick said. "Shattercoins move. They want to be found, but not by us. They’re lures."

"Lures for what?" Eli asked, even though part of him didn’t want the answer.

Carrick gave him a long, weary look.

"For what comes after the debt collectors," he said.

Mina packed quickly — a satchel stuffed with salt, knives, a spool of black thread, a handful of iron nails, and a few glass vials filled with dark, sloshing liquid. Eli recognized some of the supplies from their earlier lessons. Others were new — new and worse, because they didn’t even have names written on the cracked labels.

Mina caught him staring and offered a tight, humorless smile.

"You don’t hunt a Shattercoin with pretty words," she said.

Carrick tossed Eli an old, battered flashlight.

"Hope you don’t mind walking through hell in the dark," he said.

They headed out just after midnight.

Fairhaven was different at that hour.
Colder. Thinner, somehow.
The streets stretched too far. The houses leaned closer. Streetlamps buzzed and spat sparks, lighting puddles that didn’t reflect anything at all.

Mina moved like a shadow, silent and precise.
Eli did his best to follow her example, every nerve stretched taut, every hair standing on end.

They started near the abandoned railyard at the edge of town — a place Carrick had marked with a red circle and a thick line through it, annotated only with the words: "Weakpoint probable."

As they approached the crumbling chain-link fence surrounding the yard, Mina paused, holding up a hand.

"You feel that?" she whispered.

Eli nodded.
The air buzzed, like a wasp nest pressed against his skin.

Mina reached into her bag and pulled out a thin rod of iron, tapping it lightly against the ground. Sparks jumped from the dirt in lazy arcs, and the buzzing grew louder.

"We’re close," she said grimly.

They crept into the railyard.

Rusting train cars squatted in the overgrown grass like sleeping giants. Graffiti twisted along their sides — not names or pictures, but symbols that hurt to look at.

The ground was wrong here.
Too soft.
Too hollow.

Every step made Eli feel like he was sinking into something deeper than earth.

At the center of the yard, where the tracks twisted into a rusted mess, they found it.

The Shattercoin.

It hovered a few feet above the ground, spinning slowly.
It didn’t gleam or flash.
It just was — a cracked, broken thing bleeding shadows into the night air.

Around it, the world bent unnaturally — fences drooped, concrete slabs rippled like water.

Eli’s mouth went dry.
The coin was bigger than any he’d seen so far — easily the size of a dinner plate, and covered in fractures that glowed a sickly green.

Mina pulled him back behind a derailed boxcar before he could stumble closer.

"Don’t look at it too long," she hissed. "It'll see you."

Eli ducked down, heart slamming against his ribs.

"What do we do?" he asked.

Mina unrolled a length of black thread and started weaving it into a complicated knot.

"We need to bind it," she said. "Seal the breach before something comes through."

"Something?"

"Yeah," she muttered. "Something worse than collectors. Something that doesn’t care about debts. Something that just wants in."

She worked fast, hands moving in sharp, practiced motions.
Eli kept his eyes low, but he could feel the Shattercoin pulsing in the air, beating like a second heart — faster and faster, growing stronger with each rotation.

From the corners of his vision, shadows began to stir.
Shapes moved between the boxcars.
Whispers drifted across the yard, just at the edge of hearing.

Eli clutched the Tree of Roots coin in his pocket, feeling it grow hot against his palm.

"Mina..." he said, voice tight.

"I know," she snapped. "Just a little longer—"

Something slammed into the boxcar behind them.
The whole metal shell shuddered with a deafening clang.

Mina cursed and shoved the thread into Eli’s hands.

"Hold this," she barked. "Don’t drop it, no matter what happens."

Before he could protest, she spun away, drawing her silver-edged knife and sprinting toward the noise.

Eli huddled there, the black thread burning cold in his fingers, listening to the chaos erupt around him.

Metal groaned.
Glass shattered.
Voices screamed — high, inhuman sounds that scraped against his brain like broken glass.

Something big moved through the yard.
Something fast.

Eli risked a glance around the corner — just a second, just to see—

And froze.

It wasn’t a collector.
It wasn’t anything he recognized from Carrick’s lectures or Mina’s warnings.

It was tall — too tall — and thin, with arms that bent wrong and a face that flickered and changed every second: an old woman, a wolf, a child, a man with no eyes.

It was hunting.

And it was looking for him.

"Eli!"

Mina’s voice cut through the yard like a whipcrack.

He bolted upright, the thread still clutched in his hands, and ran.

The thing howled behind him — a sound that rattled the tracks and shattered the cracked windows of the derelict station house.

Eli sprinted toward the Shattercoin, heart hammering so hard he could barely breathe.

Mina met him at the center of the yard, blood trickling down one temple, her jacket torn.

"Give it!" she shouted, holding out her hands.

Eli shoved the thread into her palms.

Without hesitating, she wrapped it around the Shattercoin in a complicated figure-eight, her fingers flying despite the blood dripping from her fingertips.

The ground bucked under Eli’s feet.
The shadows thickened.
The thing chasing them screamed again, closer now, impossibly close—

Mina finished the binding.
She slammed her knife into the ground at the Shattercoin’s base.

There was a flash of blinding white light—
A sound like a giant door slamming shut—

And then, silence.

When Eli blinked the spots from his eyes, the Shattercoin was gone.
Only the knife remained, embedded in the cracked dirt.

The twisted railyard was still twisted.
The graffiti still writhed.
But the wrongness had retreated — pulled back behind whatever thin wall separated their world from what lay beyond.

Mina staggered, catching herself on Eli’s shoulder.

"You good?" she rasped.

Eli nodded shakily.

The thing that had been chasing them was gone too.
Not dead — not defeated — just gone. For now.

Mina wiped the blood from her face and gave a grim, lopsided smile.

"First real hunt," she said. "Welcome to the Circle, Eli."

They stumbled back to Carrick’s townhouse as the sky turned from black to bruised purple.

Carrick was waiting on the porch, a cigarette burning between two fingers, his face carved into hard lines.

When he saw them — bruised, bloodied, but breathing — he nodded once.

"You sealed it," he said. Not a question. A statement.

Mina dropped heavily onto the porch steps, stretching out her sore legs.

"Yeah," she muttered. "Barely."

Carrick eyed Eli for a long moment, then flicked his cigarette away into the street.

"You’re marked now," he said to Eli. "You faced a breach and lived."

He pointed a crooked finger at Eli’s chest.

"They’ll smell it on you. The collectors. The ones beyond. You’re not just another debtbearer anymore. You’re a hunter now."

Eli swallowed hard.
He wasn’t sure if that was supposed to be an honor… or a death sentence.

Maybe both.

Inside, the house felt different.

Slightly less heavy.
Slightly less broken.

Carrick poured them both shots of something that tasted like burning tree bark and insisted they drink.

"A tradition," he said, raising his own glass. "You survived your first Shatter."

Eli clinked his glass against Mina’s and drank.

It didn’t make him feel braver.
But it made him feel… tethered.
Like maybe he belonged here, in this broken little corner of the world where debts and curses stitched everything together.

That night, as Eli drifted into a restless sleep on the battered couch, the Tree of Roots coin and the Open Eye coin tucked under his pillow, he dreamed.

He dreamed of the river of black eyes.
Of bridges crumbling into endless night.
And of a door.

A door cracked open just a sliver.
And something smiling in the dark beyond.

Chapter 4: The Coin Speaks

The knock came at dawn.
Three raps. Soft. Measured.
Not Mina’s urgent tap-tap-pause-tap. Not Carrick’s heavy-handed pound.

This knock was polite. Patient.
Wrong.

Eli jerked awake on the couch, the dream of the door still heavy behind his eyes. For a second he didn’t move. Neither did Carrick, who sat stiff in his battered armchair with a shotgun across his lap, eyes open and alert. Mina was already standing near the boarded window, one hand on her knife, her body tense as a drawn wire.

The knock came again.

Carrick’s voice was low, almost a growl.
"Stay back."

He moved with surprising speed for someone so battered by time and bad luck. He crossed the room in three long strides and pressed his eye to a crack in the doorframe.

What he saw made him stiffen.
Then, without a word, he slid the heavy bolt back and opened the door.

Standing on the porch was a woman in a grey coat, her face hidden by a wide-brimmed hat. She didn’t step inside — didn’t even glance around. She simply lifted one gloved hand and displayed a coin between her thumb and forefinger.

It wasn’t like any coin Eli had seen before.
It was thin — razor-thin — and shimmered like oil on water. No clear image marked its face; instead, colors and shapes shifted constantly across its surface.

Carrick bowed his head slightly. A stiff, reluctant gesture.

"Seeker," he muttered.

The woman nodded once. She spoke in a voice like polished stone.
"We need the boy."

Eli froze.
Mina stiffened visibly.

"No," Carrick said sharply. "He’s still green. He’s not ready."

The Seeker smiled faintly — not kindly.
"His readiness is irrelevant. The debt stirs. The bloodline wakens. He is summoned."

She held out a folded piece of parchment, sealed with dark red wax. A seal shaped like a tree, its roots digging into the very edge of the paper.

The Tree of Roots.
Eli’s coin.

Mina stepped protectively in front of Eli, but Carrick just sighed — the sound of a man too tired to argue with gods.

"You have until dusk," the Seeker said. "Prepare him."

And then, without another word, she turned and walked away, vanishing into the mist that clung low over the broken streets.

The door creaked shut under its own weight.
Carrick bolted it again, then turned to face Eli.

"You," he said grimly, "have bigger problems than a few collectors now."

They gathered around the battered kitchen table, the folded parchment between them like a live grenade.

Carrick poured himself a drink — not coffee this time, something stronger — and drank half of it in one go before speaking.

"She’s Circle High," Carrick said. "The Seekers don't come down here unless it's serious. Real serious."

Eli licked dry lips. "What do they want with me?"

Mina leaned back in her chair, arms crossed tightly over her chest.
"Your bloodline," she said. "The coin picked you for a reason."

Carrick nodded heavily.

"Most coins just pick people at random," he said. "Lost souls, desperate gamblers, fools who step where they shouldn't."

He pointed at the wax seal.

"But not the old coins. Not the Primal Seals. They pick bloodlines. Family lines. Debts that run deeper than memory."

Eli stared at the parchment, feeling cold all over.

"What kind of debt?" he whispered.

Carrick gave a thin, humorless smile.

"An old one," he said. "Older than Fairhaven. Older than this country. Maybe older than the world."

Mina leaned forward, fixing Eli with a hard stare.

"Your family made a bargain," she said. "A bad one. A necessary one, maybe, but still bad. And now it’s come due."

Eli shook his head.
"I don’t even know my family," he said. "I mean, it’s just me and my mom and Joel. My dad left when I was a baby—"

Carrick snorted.
"Your dad didn't leave," he said. "He ran."

The words hit Eli harder than he wanted to admit.
He tried to push it away, tried to focus on the here and now, but the knot of fear in his gut only tightened.

"W
