In the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of their       residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little       sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,       deteriora _sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts       to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a       delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The       Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy.       The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an       indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are _all       _curtains—a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The       Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are       preposterous.        How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of       blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable       thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display       of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the       heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily       understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been       brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.        To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade of       costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an       impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or       of taste as regards the proprietor:—this for the reason, first, that       wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting       a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood,       confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather       avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry       may at any time be successfully attempted.        The people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough       diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being       the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,       to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,       looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two       entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of       an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole       test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test, once       established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable       to the one primitive folly.        There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist       than the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to       say, in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual       defect is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would       of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are       amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of       art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits       of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.        A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several       pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation       to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic       arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly       continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines       occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,       the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.        Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other       decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an       extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,       irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum, as well as the       proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.        Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still       very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the       apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the       forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary       man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard       discoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows       who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their       own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have       a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of       small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As regards       texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preterpluperfect       tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies. Touching       pattern—a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a Riccaree       Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct       grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of no meaning, _are       here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or representations of       well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of       Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or       ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly       Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen       in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge, sprawling, and       radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among       which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention       of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and       worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who, to spare thought and economize       fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then established       joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.        _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household       decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion       of taste just specified. We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.       The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady       light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or       what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do       wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely       thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp       proper—the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground-glass       shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is       a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted       it, partly on account of its _flashiness_, but principally on account       of its _greater rest_, is a good commentary on the proposition with       which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of       a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly       subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of       these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is       sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its       influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half       disenchanted beneath its evil eye.        In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its       leading feature is _glitter—_and in that one word how much of       all that is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes       _pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the       embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth,       even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning       glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle       in our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of       all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.        The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before       observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has       led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our       dwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a fine       thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one       who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and       especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror       presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,—a thing       always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent       in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here       aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its       sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four       or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,       a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter       upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing       effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,       would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be       altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the       same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be       startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.        It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man       of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The       corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.       As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among _our       _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the       spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have seen apartments in       the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”]       means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-molu’d       _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even _now_, there is       present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose       decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the       weather is cool—the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of       the room during his slumber.        It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a       shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of       furniture. It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is       at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the       other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep       recesses—and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a       crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual.       They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to       the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the       recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a       deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material       of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole       fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),       issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles       the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown       open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping       it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such       devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the       tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and       determine the _character _of the room. The carpet—of Saxony       material—is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson       ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that       festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground,       _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short       irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls       are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small       Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many       paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an       imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the       lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or       four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully.       The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant       effects.” _Repose _speaks in all. Not one is of small size.       Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the       blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad       but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed.       They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,       and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to       better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of       the chamber is injured. But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is       visible. In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a       reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary       sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson       silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light       conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,       also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed       altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the       sofas. This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has       been thought sufficient. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which       bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded       angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with       highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some       light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk       cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound       books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand       lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from       He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a       tranquil but magical radiance over all.      A TALE OF JERUSALEM        Intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos      Passus erat——                     —Lucan—_De Catone_      ——a bristly _bore_.                     _Translation._         “Let us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon       the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year of the       world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one—“let us hasten to the       ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of David,       and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of       the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the       promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the       sacrifices.”         Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or       sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.        “Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity in the       heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of       the worshippers of Baal.”         “That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the       Pentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people of       Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their       own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us       lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver       shekels per head!”         “Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the       Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,       has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,       to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”         “Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who belonged       to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of       _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a       thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less       gifted perambulators)—“by the five corners of that beard which, as a       priest, I am forbidden to shave!—have we lived to see the day when a       blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of       appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated       elements? Have we lived to see the day when—”        “Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted       Abel-Phittim, “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or       by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings       should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not       extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.”         That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which       bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly       fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty       hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the       solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its       inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square       towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and       twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the       wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,       between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a       perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the       precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived       on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the       turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the       besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an       eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by       several, that of the temple of Belus.        “Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,       “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the       wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”         “And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,       not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who       seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”         “Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman       soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions       of Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has       broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your       gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought       fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a       true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the       ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the       world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every       kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and       see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”         “El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the       centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against       the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth       the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of       the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is       it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or       Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or       Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or       Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”         “Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too       rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on       the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the       holy things of the sanctuary.”         By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden       basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the       giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but       owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of       their operations could be obtained.        Half an hour had already elapsed.        “We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this       period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be       turned out of office by the Katholim.”         “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the       fat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our       loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”         “Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase       money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?”         “They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they       have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,       Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either       still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to       place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while       their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.         *       *       *       *       *        “Booshoh he!”—as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the       extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was       the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.        “Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of       Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”         “It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the       bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes are       more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is like the       honey of Hebron.”         “It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee, “the       heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our       voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the       psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut!”         It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim       that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a _hog_ of no common size.        “Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,       letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the       Philistines, “El Emanu!—God be with us—it is _the unutterable       flesh!”_     THE SPHINX         During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the       invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement       of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around       us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in       the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we       should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful       intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a       day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some       acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily       the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every       messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.       That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could       neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less       excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted       himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at       any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was       sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.        His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which       I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which       I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into       germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my       bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he       was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been       made upon my fancy.        A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief       which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to       defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he       maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I       contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute       spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of       suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and       was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the       idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.        The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred       to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so       much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for       regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded       and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind       to communicate the circumstances to my friend.        Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an       open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view       of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded       by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My       thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom       and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,       they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon       some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its       way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense       forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own       sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes       passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor       in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and       calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I       fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than       even I did myself.        Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the       large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which       had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far       larger than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line,       because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one       of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the       general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of       a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as       the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an       immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been       supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this       hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those       of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward,       parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff,       thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in       shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the       rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the       apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each       wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above       the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale       apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper       and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief       peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s       Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was       as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body,       as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded       the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast,       with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming       evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I       perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand       themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so       expressive of woe, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the       monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to       the floor.        Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of       what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of       repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.        At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we       were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I       occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near       at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an       account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end—at first laughed       heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if       my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again had a       distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute       terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly—but       maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the       course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the       hill.        I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an       omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I       threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my       face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer       apparent.        My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor,       and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the       visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed       deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk,       with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative       philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.       I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the       idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in       the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the       importance of an object, through mere misadmeasurement of its       propinquity. “To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence       to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of       Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly       be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can       you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought       this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”         He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one       of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to       exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine       print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the       book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.        “But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster,       I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.       In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus       Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class       of Insecta—or insects. The account runs thus:        “‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic       appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of       the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and       downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair;       antennæ in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed. The       Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar,       at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia       of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”         He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself       accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding       “the monster.”         “Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face       of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.       Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for       the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider       has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of       an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch       distant from the pupil of my eye.”     HOP-FROG         I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed       to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to       tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his       seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They       all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well       as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there       is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been       quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara       avis in terris.        About the refinements, or, as he called them, the “ghost” of wit, the king       troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in       a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.       Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’ “Gargantua”       to the “Zadig” of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited       his taste far better than verbal ones.        At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone       out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental “powers” still       retain their “fools,” who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were       expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,       in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.        _Our_ king, as a matter of course, retained his “fool.” The fact is, he       _required_ something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the       heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to       mention himself.        His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value       was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf       and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools;       and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days       (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to       laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your       jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and       unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our       king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a       triplicate treasure in one person.        I believe the name “Hop-Frog” was _not_ that given to the dwarf by his       sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of       the seven ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men       do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional       gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that       afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king,       for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional       swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a       capital figure.        But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only       with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious       muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way       of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform       many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,       or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more       resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.        I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog       originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no       person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.       Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself       (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been       forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,       and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.        Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close       intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became       sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was       by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many       services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although       a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much       influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit       of Hop-Frog.        On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined       to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,       occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta       were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive       in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and       arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it       seems, without his assistance.        The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been       fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could       possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of       expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed       that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up       their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month,       in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except       in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never       could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found       it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all       events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and       Hop-Frog.        When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him       sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the       monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that Hop-Frog was not       fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and       madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his practical jokes,       and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it)       “to be merry.”        “Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the       room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here       Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. We       want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of       the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the       wine will brighten your wits.”         Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances       from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor       dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his “absent friends” forced       the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he       took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.        “Ah! ha! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly       drained the beaker. “See what a glass of good wine can do! Why,       your eyes are shining already!”         Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of       wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He       placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the       company with a half-insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at       the success of the king’s ‘joke.’        “And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.        “Yes,” said the King; “Come, Hop-Frog, lend us your       assistance. Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of       characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was       seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.        Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat vacantly.        “Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”         “I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,       abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.        “Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you       mean by _that?_ Ah, I perceive. You are sulky, and want more wine.       Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and       offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.        “Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the       fiends—”         The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers       smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and,       falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.        The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her       audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most       becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a       syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the       brimming goblet in her face.        The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,       resumed her position at the foot of the table.        There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling       of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was interrupted by a       low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once       from every corner of the room.        “What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the       king, turning furiously to the dwarf.        The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his       intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,       merely ejaculated:        “I—I? How could it have been me?”         “The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers.       “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his       cage-wires.”         “True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but,       on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of       this vagabond’s teeth.”         Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object       to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very       repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as       much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another       bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and       with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.        “I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very       tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just       after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just       after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd       noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one       of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our       masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately, however,       it requires a company of eight persons and—”         “Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the       coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers. Come!       what is the diversion?”         “We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and       it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”         “We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering       his eyelids.        “The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it       occasions among the women.”         “Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.        “I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that       to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of       masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will       be as much terrified as astonished.”         “Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a man       of you.”         “The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their       jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.       Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by       eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the       company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately       and gorgeously habited men and women.
