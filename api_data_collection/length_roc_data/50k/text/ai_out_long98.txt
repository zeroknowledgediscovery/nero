Chapter One: The Shadow in the Orchard

My father used to speak of his brother only in slivers, as if the memories were too sharp to hold all at once. He would sit on the back porch when the sun dipped low and turned the apple orchard gold, the trees casting long lines of shadow like bars across the lawn. He’d light his pipe but often forget to smoke it, and then he’d say:

“You know, your uncle Eli could catch a fish with just his hands. Like some sort of river spirit.”

Then he’d stare off toward the treeline as if waiting for someone to emerge. But no one ever did.

It wasn’t until after he died that I realized I didn’t know whether Eli was alive or not.

My name is Silas Ward. I’m twenty-seven, a stonemason by trade, and I came back to the family farmhouse in Wren Hollow, Vermont, three weeks after my father passed, summoned by a voicemail from the lawyer who handled his will.

“He’s left you something unusual,” the man had said. “You’ll want to come in person.”

So I came, not knowing what to expect, not expecting much. My father had always been a man of silence, the kind who carried pain like a relic in his chest, untouched but precious. Our relationship was measured in working hours and nods, a language of few words and many pauses. I’d left at eighteen and hadn’t returned until the funeral.

Now the house stood quiet, paint peeling in soft curls from the windowsills, the orchard overgrown but still bearing sour fruit. There was something timeless about the place, like it had been waiting for something—or someone.

I met the lawyer, Elias Lark, in the parlor. A tall, skeletal man with thin silver-rimmed glasses and a cough that rattled in his throat like loose change.

“He left you this,” Elias said, handing me a wooden box. Cedar, with a latch that had nearly rusted shut. “And a letter. I advise you read it before anything else.”

Inside the box were four items: an old photograph of two boys standing in front of the orchard—one clearly my father, the other smiling like he knew a secret—a faded map of the local area with strange symbols drawn in red ink, a silver key, and a black stone, smooth and flat like a river rock but warm to the touch.

The letter was short, written in my father’s jagged hand.

Silas,

I tried to forget him. God knows I tried. But the past doesn’t lie still, not in this house.

If you’re reading this, you’re old enough to understand.

Find Eli. He’s still out there. I know it. He never really left.

Follow the map. Use the key. Don’t trust what you see.

-R.W.

The key was the size of my palm, old and heavy, the teeth oddly shaped—too angular for any door I could imagine. It left a faint metallic scent on my fingers, not iron or brass, something older, something more like blood.

I spent the night in my childhood room, the one with the sloped ceiling and the scratched desk. The wallpaper still peeled in the corners. That night I dreamed of a boy in the orchard, digging with his hands. Not digging for something—digging to something.

The next morning, I walked the land with the map. Most of the markings matched local landmarks: the well house, the split oak, the creek that curved around the back of the orchard. But one mark stood out—drawn not on land but beyond it, on a patch that was just blank space.

There was a note scrawled beside it: “Hollow Tree. ¼ mile north of split oak. Only opens after dusk.”

I waited until the sun began to sink, then followed the path through the orchard. The trees seemed to lean closer the deeper I went. The split oak had grown since I last saw it—two trunks from one base, its bark like wrinkled skin.

Past it, the ground changed. The soft hush of grass gave way to damp moss and roots that curled like fingers. I nearly missed the tree—a massive, gnarled thing with a hollow trunk wide enough for a man to slip through.

The key fit into a rusted iron fixture hidden behind a flap of bark. When I turned it, something clicked deep inside the tree.

The air changed.

I stepped into the hollow, expecting the back of the tree. Instead, I stepped out again—into a different orchard.

Same trees, same hill, but the sky was wrong—too red, like a fire just beyond the horizon. And there were no birds. No wind. Just silence.

A figure stood by the treeline, tall and lean, with a hat pulled low.

“Silas,” he said. “You took your time.”

I didn’t answer at first. My throat was dry.

“Eli?”

He smiled. It was the same smile from the photo.

“More or less.”

That was when I realized I hadn’t crossed into a hidden part of the land.

I’d crossed into somewhere else entirely.

Chapter Two: The Red Orchard

The place beyond the hollow tree was a mirror with its colors reversed. The trees bore no fruit, only dark leaves that whispered in a wind I couldn’t feel. The ground was soft and too warm, like skin. I followed Eli—if that’s who he was—through the orchard in silence.

“You’re wondering where we are,” he said eventually.

I nodded.

“It doesn’t have a name,” he said. “Not one you’d understand. It’s old. Older than towns, older than maps.”

“How did you—how did he lose you?”

Eli glanced at me, his eyes catching a flicker of red light. “He didn’t. He gave me up.”

I stopped walking.

“That’s not true.”

Eli tilted his head, birdlike. “Isn’t it? Ask yourself why he never told you. Why he never came looking.”

“He left a map.”

“Now,” Eli said. “But not when it mattered.”

I didn’t know how to argue with that.

He led me to a clearing where the trees opened in a perfect circle. At its center was a stone table, smooth and black, not unlike the one in the box.

“This is what it’s all about,” Eli said, touching the stone with reverence. “This is where they chose.”

“Chose what?”

“Who stays. Who goes. Who remembers.”

There was something written on the stone in a script that shimmered and shifted. My eyes couldn’t hold it; the words slipped away every time I tried to fix them in place.

“You were meant to come sooner,” Eli said. “But time doesn’t move here the same.”

He looked older than in the photo—much older than he should have been.

“You’ve been trapped here?”

“Not trapped. Bound. There’s a difference.”

I felt the weight of the key in my pocket.

“And you want me to free you.”

“No,” Eli said. “I want you to take my place.”

The silence in that orchard was not the kind of silence you find in the early morning, nor the hush before a storm. It was the kind of silence that pressed against your skin, that got into your ears and dulled your heartbeat. I followed Eli, if he was indeed Eli, through the strange mirror of my childhood orchard, trying not to look too long at the trees. Their bark writhed subtly, and some of the trunks appeared to have faces pressed into them, as if the trees had swallowed people long ago and the imprint of their final moments had been frozen in wood.

Eli walked with an easy grace, but his boots didn’t make a sound on the earth. That unsettled me more than anything. When I stepped, leaves crunched and twigs snapped beneath me. But when he walked, there was nothing. No echo, no weight. Just movement.

He led me past a row of trees that had been hollowed out. Inside each cavity, something shimmered faintly—images, maybe, or memories. I caught one glimpse of my father, younger than I’d ever seen him, sitting beside a river with a boy I now understood to be Eli. They laughed together, splashing water, oblivious to the watching world. But the vision faded as I passed, and when I looked back, there was only blackness.

“Why are you showing me this?” I asked, my voice sounding damp in the heavy air.

“Because this place is made of memory,” Eli said, not turning. “And memories rot, if they’re not tended to.”

At the edge of the orchard stood a house that hadn’t been there before. It resembled the farmhouse back home but in the way a dream resembles the real world—similar in structure but wrong in proportion. The shutters hung at odd angles. The door was too tall, the porch too wide. A faint light glowed in the upper window.

“You remember it like this,” Eli said. “That’s why it looks this way.”

I stopped at the porch steps. “Is this your doing?”

He shook his head. “This place listens. It builds from what’s inside you. I’ve tried to change it, but it’s stubborn. It wants truth.”

I hesitated, but Eli gestured for me to follow, and I did. The floorboards creaked under me but not under him. Inside, the house was furnished with pieces from my past—a green corduroy couch we’d thrown out when I was twelve, the cuckoo clock my father had smashed in a fit of anger one winter, the table with the burn marks from when Eli—if the stories were true—had left a lantern too close to the wood.

Everything was dusty, as though it had been waiting a long time.

Eli sat across from me in the living room, long legs folded beneath him, fingers steepled like he was about to give a sermon. I had a thousand questions, but they choked in my throat. All I could manage was, “How long have you been here?”

He tilted his head, considering. “Time is… different here. I think it’s been years for you. For me, it’s felt like a lifetime.”

“What is this place, really?”

He hesitated before answering. “It’s where things that aren’t supposed to exist… end up. Where people go when they’re forgotten but not gone. A place outside of time, outside of death.”

“You died?”

“I changed.”

That wasn’t an answer, not really. But in that moment, I believed him. His skin was pale but not sickly. His eyes held no madness. There was sadness, yes. And something sharper—regret, maybe. Or guilt.

He looked at the stone I’d placed on the table between us. “That was mine once. You brought it back.”

“I don’t know what it is.”

“It’s a seed,” he said. “From the first orchard. The one that came before this world.”

I blinked. “You’re not making any sense.”

“I know.” His voice was kind, almost apologetic. “But you will understand. There are things your father never told you. He was trying to protect you. And me. But he was too late. He made a choice. He let me stay here, because he couldn’t face what I’d become.”

I opened my mouth, but he raised a hand.

“Let me finish. You’ll want to interrupt. Everyone does, the first time.”

So I sat back. The house creaked around us. Shadows shifted on the walls even though no fire burned.

“I was thirteen the day it happened,” Eli began. “We were down by the creek. Your father and I used to pretend we were explorers, like in those old dime novels he liked. We found something—something buried in the riverbed. It looked like a stone at first, but when I touched it, I heard a voice in my head. Not words, just… a hum. Like the inside of a bell.”

He paused, eyes going distant.

“Your father told me to leave it, but I kept going back. Every night, I’d sneak out, dig deeper. Eventually I found more than the stone. I found the gate.”

“Gate?”

“There are places in the world where reality thins. Weak spots. Cracks. That was one of them. I opened it. I stepped through. And I didn’t come back the same.”

The air grew colder. I could see my breath now, curling like smoke.

“You brought something back,” I said, though I didn’t mean to say it aloud.

He nodded.

“It wasn’t evil,” he said. “Not in the way people think. It was old. Hungry. It wanted a home. I became that home.”

My mouth went dry. “What happened?”

“Your father tried to save me. But he didn’t understand the rules. He thought sealing the gate would stop it. All he did was trap me here. Half in, half out.”

“And the map?”

“He kept watch. He wanted to fix what he broke. But he didn’t believe I was still me. And maybe I wasn’t.”

I stood up, not sure what to do with my limbs. “Why bring me here?”

Eli rose too, slowly. “Because the gate’s weakening again. This place doesn’t hold as well as it used to. And you have something I need.”

I backed away, one step.

“Don’t be afraid,” he said. “I don’t want to hurt you. I just want to be free.”

“How?” I asked.

He pointed to the black stone. “Plant it.”

I frowned. “Where?”

“Here. In the orchard. It will grow. It will open the gate wide enough for me to pass.”

“What happens if I do?”

His eyes darkened. “The world changes. Maybe not all at once. But over time, this place and your world… they’ll merge. Become one.”

“And if I don’t?”

He looked genuinely sad.

“Then I stay. And something worse finds its way through.”

The ground trembled beneath our feet.

“I didn’t come here to make this choice,” I whispered.

“No one ever does,” Eli said. “But here you are.”

A groan echoed through the walls of the strange house as though the timbers themselves had heard Eli’s words and were objecting. Dust sifted down from the rafters in a fine mist. Somewhere upstairs, something heavy shifted, like a piece of furniture dragging across the floor, though neither of us moved.

I gritted my teeth and took a step back from him, my hand inching toward the pocket where the silver key sat like a hidden blade. Eli noticed, of course he did. He’d always been the quicker one, the watcher, the listener. When we were kids—if that memory had any basis in truth—he was the one who could sneak out and back in without a creak of the stairs. He saw the twitch in my hand and smiled, thin and tight.

“You think the key will protect you?” he asked.

I didn’t answer. Instead, I kept my eyes locked on his and let the silence stretch between us, trying to read his intentions the way my father used to read clouds—looking for signs of storm.

He sighed and turned away, walking to the cracked window. Outside, the orchard’s trees pulsed ever so slightly, their branches twitching in rhythm, not with the wind—there was none—but with something deeper, like a heartbeat buried in the soil. I realized that I hadn’t heard a bird, or a squirrel, or even an insect since I stepped through the hollow tree.

“I don’t want to lie to you,” Eli said after a while. “I’ve done enough of that. There is no good choice here. Only the one that hurts less.”

“You don’t even know what will come through if I plant it.”

“No,” he agreed, turning back to me. “But I know what will happen if it’s left here. It won’t stay dormant. Eventually, it’ll grow anyway. Without roots, without shape. It’ll feed off the memories here until it tears a hole too wide to mend.”

“And the real world?”

He gave a slow shake of his head. “It won’t be real for long.”

The wind picked up outside, finally, but it wasn’t the wind of home. It was thick, wheezing, carrying the scent of wet ash and something worse—something sour, like old blood on rusted iron.

“Your father knew all this?” I asked, suddenly cold down to my bones.

“He knew enough. Enough to be afraid of it. Enough to try to lock it away.”

“Then why did he leave me the map?”

“Because he believed in you.” Eli’s face softened. “Even after he’d given up on me. He hoped you’d find another way. He always thought you were stronger.”

A hollow laugh escaped me, bitter and sharp. “I’m just a mason. I fix walls. I don’t open gates. I don’t plant ancient seeds from other realities.”

Eli looked down, his voice low. “Maybe that’s exactly why it has to be you. Because you don’t want it.”

There was a crack behind us—loud and final. The back door of the house, the one I hadn’t even noticed until now, split down the center, and through the gap seeped a creeping mist. It rolled in low, slithering over the floor like fog across ice. In its wake, the wood warped and blackened.

Eli’s expression changed. For the first time, he looked afraid.

“We’re out of time.”

“What is that?” I asked, backing away as the mist inched toward my boots.

“The others,” he said. “The ones that stay in the cracks. They smell the stone. They know you brought it here.”

He snatched the black seed-stone from the table and thrust it back into my hands. It burned, not with heat, but with a kind of weight that dragged down the tendons in my wrist.

“Run,” he said.

“But—”

“GO!”

I turned and bolted through the front door, flinging it open so hard it cracked against the wall. The orchard outside was darker now, the trees closer, almost choking the path. I didn’t look back. Behind me I heard the door splinter, and something scream—a sound like metal scraping against teeth.

The ground writhed beneath me. Roots lashed at my boots. I tripped once, rolled, came up scraped and breathless, but I didn’t stop. My legs moved on their own, driven by the primal instinct that comes when all other options vanish.

The hollow tree came into view, the trunk yawning wide like a mouth waiting to swallow me whole. I could see the shimmer of my world on the other side—a haze of pale gold and fading sunlight.

I lunged through.

For a moment, I felt pulled in two directions—one foot in each world, my body stretching like taffy. The orchard behind me moaned, a chorus of rustling leaves and things that should not breathe. Then the key, still in my pocket, flared hot. I clutched it through the fabric, and suddenly I was through.

I collapsed just outside the tree in the real orchard, gasping on my hands and knees. The sky was still the blue of twilight. Birds chirped, distant and faint. The scent of apples—real, sour, overripe—hit my nose.

I was back.

I lay there for a long while, my fingers digging into the dirt just to remind myself it was solid. Real. I heard the wind move through the leaves, and it didn’t speak. It just rustled.

When I finally got to my feet, I didn’t look back at the tree. I walked toward the farmhouse on shaky legs, not bothering to brush the dirt from my clothes. My mind churned, but no clear thoughts came. Just pieces—Eli’s face, the sound of the mist slithering, the weight of the stone in my palm.

That night, I buried the black seed under the floorboards in the cellar. I wrapped it in burlap and salt and locked it in a wooden box with iron nails driven into every corner. I didn’t know if that would be enough. But it was something.

For the next week, I stayed in the house. I didn’t go back to the orchard. I didn’t answer my phone. I sat in my father’s chair on the porch and smoked a pipe I didn’t like and watched the horizon for signs of red.

Nothing came. But nothing felt the same, either.

Sometimes, at night, I heard footsteps upstairs where no one lived. And once, just before sleep took me, I thought I heard a voice whisper through the vent beside my bed.

It said, “You’ll have to choose again.”

But I didn’t respond. I rolled over, closed my eyes, and dreamed of roots reaching through the floor, looking for the box.

Chapter Two: A Silence Between Seasons

The first true snowfall came late that year. October turned over into November with bare branches and a dry wind that rattled the shutters on the house each night like the knuckles of a man too long dead to knock properly. When the snow finally did arrive, it came quietly, without storm or thunder, just a gentle layering of white that softened the world outside into something that looked almost peaceful—if not for the way the orchard refused to wear it. Every tree on the far side of the split oak remained dry, untouched, the snow melting as soon as it landed on the branches. It left a dark swath in the orchard’s heart, a strip of land that seemed to breathe against the cold.

I stayed indoors as much as I could. The farmhouse was no warmer than a refrigerator even with the wood stove burning through cords I’d stacked earlier in the month, but the cold in the house didn’t bite like the cold outside. That cold had weight, and when I stood too long on the porch, I could feel something in it watching. Something that remembered me.

My days fell into rhythmless hours. I repaired what needed repair, mostly to distract my hands—recaulked windows, oiled hinges, replaced three steps on the back porch that had turned brittle. The cellar remained locked. I didn’t go down. Not since I’d buried the seed beneath the packed earth floor and covered it with iron and salt. But sometimes, I’d feel a thrum beneath my feet when I passed over it, like a heartbeat, too faint to hear but impossible to ignore.

I started keeping a journal. It felt like something my father would have done, though I never found any journals of his, only loose notes and the map, carefully folded and now hidden inside an envelope tucked behind a kitchen cabinet. I filled the first pages with what had happened—everything I could remember from the hollow tree to the orchard-that-wasn’t. I wrote Eli’s words down, over and over, trying to see if their meaning changed depending on how I arranged them.

"He gave me up."
"It’s where things that aren’t supposed to exist… end up."
"Don’t trust what you see."

Each phrase felt like the beginning of something much older than the day I stepped through the hollow tree.

On the eleventh night after my return, I was woken by a knock—not at the door, but from beneath the floorboards. Three short raps. Deliberate. Close. I sat upright, heart hammering, eyes straining in the dark for shapes that didn’t belong. The knock didn’t come again. I didn’t go down. I waited until morning, then checked the cellar. The box hadn’t moved. The salt circle I’d drawn around it remained unbroken. But the floor above it had a fresh crack, like something had pushed up from underneath.

That morning, I went into town for the first time in weeks.

Wren Hollow hadn’t changed much in the decade I’d been gone. The gas station still only had one pump that worked. The diner still served lukewarm coffee with pie that tasted like cardboard. Most of the storefronts on Main Street were half-empty or shuttered entirely. The snow here clung properly to rooftops and sidewalks, and people nodded at me with polite suspicion.

At the edge of town, in a little trailer with a hand-painted sign that read Antiquities, Curios, & Sundries, lived a woman named Iola Pike. She’d been a fixture of the town since before I was born, older than the hills and twice as stubborn. My father used to call her “the swamp crow” when he thought I wasn’t listening, though I’d never seen her near any swamp, and she didn’t look much like a bird.

When I stepped inside, the bell above the door gave a metallic chime like a spoon striking bone. The smell of the place hadn’t changed—dried herbs, dust, and the sweet decay of time. Shelves lined every wall, filled with glass jars, taxidermy, yellowing books, and objects that looked like they’d been unearthed in places men shouldn’t dig.

Iola was perched behind the counter, wrapped in a shawl of green wool, her long grey braid draped over one shoulder. Her eyes were cloudy but sharp enough to cut glass.

“You’re Robert Ward’s boy,” she said without looking up.

“I guess I am.”

“Didn’t think I’d see you again.”

“I didn’t think I’d come back.”

She tapped ash from her cigarette into a chipped teacup. “That’s the way of it. The Hollow brings them back, sooner or later.”

I stiffened. “You know about the orchard?”

“I know about the crack in the world that runs through your family’s land. And I know your uncle Eli was the first to fall through it in fifty years.”

She lit another cigarette before the first had gone out. The smoke twisted in the air, curling like fingers.

“I need to know what I’m dealing with,” I said.

“No you don’t,” she said flatly. “You already do. You’re just hoping I’ll say something to make it easier. I won’t.”

I stepped closer to the counter, lowered my voice. “I brought something back. Or… something followed me. I locked it up. But it’s still moving.”

She didn’t flinch. “Did you bring a piece of it?”

“A seed.”

Her lips thinned. “Then it’s not following you. It is you now. That seed chose you the moment you carried it across.”

“What does it want?”

“Roots,” she said. “A place to grow. You think it’s silent, but it’s talking to the land. To everything that remembers. Trees. Shadows. Even people, if they’re hollow enough.”

I felt sick. “How do I stop it?”

“You don’t,” she said. “You bargain with it.”

“How?”

“You give it something else it wants more than you.”

I stood there for a moment, feeling the cold seep into my bones despite the warmth of the shop. Bargain. It sounded so… reasonable, which made it even more terrifying. As if what I carried was not just a force of nature, but something intelligent.

I turned to leave, but she said one more thing before I reached the door.

“It’s not the first time this has happened, you know. Your family’s been gatekeepers longer than you think. Your father just thought he could outrun it.”

I paused, then looked back. “And what about Eli?”

She didn’t answer at first. Just stared at me with those clouded eyes.

“Eli made a deal,” she said finally. “But deals don’t end. They just… shift.”

I left with more questions than answers, the same as every time I’d gone looking for truth in this town. The snow was falling again as I returned to the farmhouse, thicker now, heavy enough to obscure the trail back to the orchard.

That night, the knocking came again.

But this time, it came with a voice.

Low. Soft. Familiar.

“Silas. Let me in.”

And I did the one thing I promised myself I wouldn’t.

I listened.

The voice continued, repeating my name with patient persistence, like the dripping of water from a broken faucet. I lay in bed unmoving, heart hammering against my ribs, as though any shift of muscle or breath would draw it closer. It was Eli’s voice—at least, it wore his tone, his cadence, the lilt he always had at the end of a question, even when he wasn’t asking one. But it lacked the warmth I remembered. It felt hollow, like someone else playing Eli, like the way a ventriloquist moves his lips just slightly and pretends it's the puppet speaking.

“Silas… it’s cold down here.”

My bedroom window had frosted over. Outside, the snow fell in dense curtains, covering the orchard and barn, but again the far end beyond the split oak remained untouched. A dark corridor of earth and tree limbs still breathing in slow, subterranean pulses. I could feel the pressure of it now, like a wet cloth over my face, heavy and suffocating.

I didn’t respond. Instead, I closed my eyes and tried to will the voice away, but it stayed for hours, whispering through the floorboards, slipping between the cracks of the house like steam under a locked door. It told me things only Eli would know—how we’d broken a window with a slingshot when we were six, how we’d buried a toy soldier under the willow tree and called it a funeral. It whispered that Dad had tried to dig up the gate years ago, had failed, had made the seed angry. And now it needed new soil.

By morning, I was pale, exhausted, and sick with the taste of old ash in my mouth. I made coffee I didn’t drink and sat at the kitchen table watching the frost creep inward on the windowsill. I knew I couldn’t stay in that house much longer. Whatever tether had held the seed in place was fraying. The thing below was becoming stronger. More persuasive.

So I did what anyone does when fear gets too loud: I searched for something older than it. Something that might know what I was facing.

I found it in the attic.

Behind the boxes of yellowed tax documents and a trunk full of my mother’s dresses, I discovered a hidden panel in the wall. The latch was nearly invisible, but something—intuition, or perhaps the influence of the seed itself—drew my hand to it. Inside was a narrow compartment no larger than a drawer. A bundle of old cloth, tied in rotting twine. I unwrapped it slowly, careful not to break the brittle edges of the fabric.

Inside was a leather-bound book, handwritten in black ink, the cover etched with a single symbol I recognized immediately: the same spiral and branch etched onto the seed.

The handwriting was my grandfather’s.

His name was Thomas Ward, and I knew almost nothing about him. My father never spoke of the man. Not with bitterness, not with reverence—just silence, the kind you leave around a grave no one visits. But now here he was, a voice from before all of us, his words still inked into the pages after decades.

I was not the first, he wrote. But I will be the last.

That was the first line. What followed was a diary, a ledger, and a warning. He wrote of dreams—endless fields of white trees with red leaves, voices that came from the roots, faces in the cellar dirt. He wrote of the gate and the orchard and a “fracture line” that ran not just through the land, but through their blood. Every few generations, someone heard the call. Someone answered. Eli had been the most recent. But Thomas had heard it too, when he was a boy. He had sealed the gate with the help of a woman from town—he called her “the green-eyed witch”—and together they buried the last seed in iron and bone.

I heard it whisper once more before it died, he wrote. It said my son would open it again. That the orchard would never forget.

The pages following were filled with diagrams—wards, sigils, rituals written in a script that made my head ache to look at. There were instructions on how to bind a seed, how to trap its voice in a vessel of ash and salt. And finally, at the end, a letter.

Silas—if you find this, it means your father failed. That isn’t his fault. The seed is patient. And it waits for pain to make its move.

I don’t expect you to win. But I do expect you to choose. You’ll know when the moment comes. There is no right answer. Only sacrifice.

I’m sorry.

I sat with the book in my lap for a long time. It felt heavier than its weight. The attic was cold, but sweat slicked the back of my neck. I knew then that the thing in the cellar wasn’t just a seed. It was a memory given shape. A kind of parasite that lived not only in the soil but in the story of our family—feeding on the idea of us, generation after generation. And I had carried it further than anyone before me.

That night, I gathered the things the book said I’d need. A blade made of bone. Three strands of hair—mine, my father’s (which I found in an old shaving brush), and Eli’s (clipped from the collar of one of the coats still hanging in the closet). A jar of river water taken from the creek at dusk. And the seed, still locked in the box, still wrapped in burlap and salt. I placed it all on the kitchen table beneath the light of a dying bulb.

I waited until midnight.

Then I walked into the orchard.

The snow stopped at the line, just as before, and the trees leaned in like old men eager to gossip. I followed the path past the split oak, past the hollow tree, deeper than I had ever gone before. The air grew warm. Wet. I smelled rot and sweetness. A kind of fermentation.

At the center of the orchard, I found a stone circle I hadn’t seen before. It hadn’t been there the last time. But it had always been here. The earth had just been waiting for me to remember it.

I placed the seed in the center. Poured the river water over it. Drew the sigils from the book with my own blood on the stones. The ritual began, not with lightning or fire, but with breath. A deep inhalation from the trees, as though the entire orchard had lungs.

And then Eli stepped from the dark.

Only… it wasn’t him. Not exactly.

He had his face. His voice. But his eyes were empty—like candle stubs burnt down to the wick. The thing wearing my uncle’s skin smiled and stepped into the circle.

“You’re finally ready,” it said.

I raised the bone knife. My hands shook. My voice cracked. “I didn’t come to open the gate.”

“No,” it said. “You came to close it. But you’re too late.”

The seed cracked.

From within, something small and white began to unfurl—like a root, or a worm. It moved with purpose, reaching for the soil.

I lunged forward and drove the bone blade into the earth beside it. The trees howled. Not the wind—the trees. They screamed in every direction, a choir of grief and rage. The blade glowed briefly. Then went black.

The seed paused.

The Eli-thing stepped forward. “You can’t hold it. Not forever.”

“I don’t have to,” I said. “I just have to bury it deep enough that it forgets the way back.”

I poured the remaining river water over the root. Sprinkled the salt. Burned the strands of hair.

And then, from the trees, came another figure.

My father.

Or what was left of him.

His face was worn, transparent. A ghost dragged up by the ritual, or by my memory. He looked at me with eyes that no longer judged.

“Let go,” he said.

And I did.

I collapsed over the circle as the seed shriveled, recoiling into itself. The air tightened, then broke with a single pop, like a bubble bursting. The orchard exhaled. The wind returned.

When I woke, the snow had returned to the trees.

The circle was gone.

And so was the seed.

Chapter Three: The Memory That Waits

It snowed heavily the next three days. The orchard disappeared beneath a white blanket that looked too clean, too soft, like a freshly painted backdrop hiding the stage beneath. No more black streaks, no more heat rising off the soil. Everything was quiet again—eerily so. But the quiet now felt earned, not imposed. Like whatever had been stirring beneath the roots had finally gone still.

I didn’t dream for two nights. No voices. No whispers. Not even the usual nonsense flickers of thought that creep into the back of your eyes when you sleep too light. Just blackness. Blessed and deep. It wasn’t until the third night that a dream returned, and with it, the orchard.

But this time it was spring.

I was standing by the creek, and Eli was beside me, not as he had been in that strange version of himself, but younger—thirteen maybe—mud on his hands, a striped shirt pulled crooked across his chest. He was humming something I couldn’t place. A tune with no rhythm, no beginning. Just endless refrain. I tried to speak, but my voice didn’t work in the dream. My body wasn’t really there; I was just watching. Witnessing.

We walked together—he leading, me following—back through the trees. The orchard was blooming. White blossoms everywhere, petals falling like snow, sticking to the cuffs of Eli’s sleeves. We came to the split oak, and he knelt at its roots. Dug. Just a few inches down, he uncovered something wrapped in cloth.

He opened it.

Inside was a stone, smooth and dark, but not the one I’d brought back. This one pulsed faintly, like it breathed. Eli held it in both hands, tilted his head.

“I thought it was sleeping,” he whispered.

And then I woke.

The first thing I did after getting dressed was return to the orchard. The snow reached up to my knees, and every step took effort. I followed the same path, though I had no map to guide me this time. The trees were just trees again. No whispers. No movement. But I could feel something under the surface—a stillness that didn’t feel natural.

When I reached the split oak, I stood there a long time, listening.

Nothing.

But something drew my eyes downward. Not a sound or a shadow, just that sense you get when you walk into a room and feel you’ve forgotten something important.

I dropped to my knees and cleared the snow.

The roots of the tree curled up like twisted veins. The ground was frozen solid, but I scraped away a thin crust of ice until I saw the edge of something. Wood.

A box.

Not the one I’d buried. This one was older. I pried it out carefully with my hands, teeth chattering. It was small, cedar, with rusted hinges and no lock. When I opened it, I found a folded letter, yellowed with age and tied with a red string. Beneath it, a photograph. Two boys—my father and Eli again, younger this time, barely older than ten. They stood in front of the same split oak, both of them smiling, arms around each other’s shoulders. Behind them, just barely visible through the trees, was a third figure. Blurred. Watching.

I didn’t recognize the shape, but something about it made my skin crawl.

The letter was addressed to R.W.—my father.

I didn’t read it right away. I tucked it inside my coat and walked back home, heart hammering, unsure whether I was shivering from the cold or something deeper.

Back in the kitchen, I opened the letter.

Rob,

I know you’ll come back here. You always do when things break. If you’re reading this, it means I’ve already failed.

The orchard took something from me. From all of us. And I think part of it was never meant to be human in the first place.

I see it now—how it waited. How it shaped itself into Eli’s face. It doesn’t want the world. Not yet. It wants a home. Roots. Memory.

You’re not crazy. You were never crazy. But you have to remember: it can’t hurt what doesn’t remember. That’s why the forgetting matters.

If I don’t come back, don’t dig. Let the past stay buried. Let the memory rot. Or it will bloom again.

Forgive me. I couldn’t save him.

—T.W.

I read the letter twice. Then I sat in the silence of that old kitchen and thought about what it meant to forget someone you loved. What it would cost to un-remember your own brother. What kind of sacrifice that was, and why my father had never spoken Eli’s name without that hollow look in his eyes.

Memory. That was the key. The root. The seed.

It didn’t survive on flesh. It didn’t need blood.

It needed stories.

It fed on being remembered.

Every photograph in the house with Eli in it—there weren’t many—had been marked somehow. A smudge on his face. A corner torn. His name scratched out of a yearbook inscription. But my father hadn’t been able to forget completely. That was his failure. And now mine.

I had brought Eli back not just by crossing the threshold, but by thinking about him. By wanting to know more.

By remembering.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Instead, I gathered every photograph, every letter, every journal entry I’d written since returning. I tore the pages out. Burned them in the old stove. I took the photograph from the box beneath the tree and lit that, too. It curled black, the image of the two boys vanishing into cinders. I stood outside and watched the smoke disappear into the cold wind, and with it, something inside me frayed.

I was not afraid. Not then.

I was sad.

Because forgetting is a kind of dying.

And I wasn’t sure if I could ever truly do it.

The snow melted by the end of the week, and spring arrived early. The orchard bloomed, but this time the blossoms were pale pink, not white. There was no dark corridor. No heat in the roots. No whispers. Birds returned. Bees came in clusters. The land felt real again, grounded.

I still walk the orchard some mornings. I leave no offerings. I say no prayers. But I listen. I watch. I make sure the soil stays silent.

Sometimes I see a boy standing at the edge of the trees—just for a second. He never speaks. Never moves. He just watches.

And I tell myself he’s not real.

That he’s just a memory.

And I do not remember his name.

Spring bloomed with too much color. The grass came in fast, unnaturally green, pushing through the black soil in patches where snow had barely melted. Daffodils showed themselves like little yellow eyes, watching me from the hill above the creek. The air, for the first time in months, carried no weight—no scent of rot, no bitterness from bark. Just soil and wind and the early perfume of honeysuckle. It felt too good. Like the world was trying too hard to appear normal.

I spent more time outside then, walking the property each day just after dawn, boots wet with dew, rifle slung over one shoulder out of habit more than need. The animals had returned: rabbits darting under fenceposts, a fox near the barn, even a few deer wandering the orchard edges like ghosts wearing flesh. It all looked like it should. That was what unsettled me most. The normalcy arrived too cleanly, too completely, like someone had painted over the cracks in the world and hoped I wouldn't notice the bulge beneath the wallpaper.

I didn’t see the boy again—not at first. After the last burning, the final letter, I thought maybe it was over. Maybe I’d done enough. But then I began to notice small things, trivial things, the kind that make you pause mid-step. The willow near the creek had started blooming weeks early, which it never had before. The cellar stayed cold even on warm days, and twice I found the salt circle disturbed, not broken, but scuffed—like someone had paced around it. I began waking to the smell of pipe smoke, my father’s blend, sweet and earthy. The pipe itself hadn’t been touched. It stayed in the drawer beside his chair, clean and dry. But I smelled it anyway, always around dusk.

One morning, I found a footprint outside the hollow tree. Not mine. Too small. Barefoot. Just one print, half-melted in the grass. The weight of it made my heart seize.

I remembered the letter from my grandfather: It can’t hurt what doesn’t remember.

And yet, I couldn’t un-know what I knew. Couldn’t unsee the smile Eli wore, the way his voice bent in that not-quite-human cadence. Forgetting wasn’t just hard—it was unnatural. We are creatures of memory. Every cell in us remembers something, even when we wish it wouldn’t.

I called Iola Pike again.

She answered on the third ring, breathless and annoyed.

“You shouldn’t be calling here,” she said, no hello.

“I think something’s wrong again,” I told her.

A pause. “You didn’t burn the seed?”

“I did. Salt, blood, the whole ritual. The circle held.”

“Then it’s not the seed. It’s the soil.”

“What does that mean?”

“You live on memory, boy. And memory grows roots.”

She hung up.

That night I dreamed again. But it wasn’t the orchard. I was in the farmhouse, seated at the kitchen table, across from a child with dark hair and a face too familiar to ignore. He didn’t speak. He just smiled, swaying slightly in the chair, hands folded like he was waiting for me to finish a story. His eyes were brown. I remembered that. Eli had green eyes. My father, blue.

“Who are you?” I asked, finally able to speak in the dream.

He opened his mouth and spoke with my voice.

“I’m the part of you that never left.”

I woke with blood on my tongue. I’d bitten the inside of my cheek during sleep. The taste lingered like copper pennies and rusted nails.

The rest of the day passed in a haze. Every surface in the house looked like it might shift if I turned my back. I kept thinking I heard footsteps behind doors, felt warmth on a chair just vacated. There were no signs of intrusion. Just a growing awareness that something shared space with me again, unseen and increasingly unafraid.

By evening, I made a decision.

I returned to the hollow tree.

There was no key this time. No gate to unlock. Just the tree, wide and dark, pulsing with its own breath. I stepped close, ran a hand along its bark. Smooth now, as if time had buffed it into bone.

“I’m not here to open anything,” I said aloud. “I just need to understand.”

The wind kicked up. The leaves around me shivered. But nothing answered.

Then a sound—soft, rhythmic. A lullaby. Sung in a child’s voice. Coming from inside the hollow.

I didn’t enter. I knew better.

Instead, I reached into my coat and pulled out the last piece of the past I hadn’t burned. My father’s pipe. I placed it at the base of the tree.

“I remember you,” I said. “But I won’t let you grow here.”

The wind stopped.

I left the orchard before nightfall. Didn’t turn back. But I felt something behind me shift—like something that had been watching had finally closed its eyes.

The next few days passed in an uneasy quiet. Then the mail arrived.

Among the usual bills and catalogs was a plain white envelope, no return address, no stamp. Just my name, handwritten in ink that smelled faintly of cedar.

Inside was a single photo.

It was old, faded, curled at the corners. A picture of the orchard from decades ago. And standing in the center—so small I might’ve missed it—was the boy from my dream. He wore a striped shirt and smiled as if he’d been waiting to be found.

On the back of the photo, a single word had been written:

“Rooted.”

I burned it that night. But the fire flared high, too high, and for a moment the smoke rose not like a column but like a tree, with branches stretching toward the ceiling.

Then it was gone.

But the scent of cedar remained long after the flames had died.

Chapter Four: The House Beneath the Orchard

I began marking the days in the way prisoners do—scratches on the cellar wall. Not because I was trapped in any physical sense, but because I needed some rhythm to the silence that had taken hold. It wasn’t the same silence as before, the heavy kind that pressed in from the dark. This was subtler, more patient. Like the pause in a conversation when someone leans in, waiting to see what you’ll say next.

April slipped into May with little fanfare. The orchard ripened quickly, far ahead of schedule. Blossoms dropped and fruit began to swell where only flowers should have been. It wasn’t right. I’d lived here most of my childhood. Apples didn’t come this early, not even in good years. I started counting them. That’s how bored or anxious or unanchored I’d become. I walked row after row, tree after tree, noting which ones had fruit, which didn’t, and how many. I found a pattern by accident—every seventh tree bore two apples, exactly two, no more, no less. And the trees between those? Barren. As if something had moved through the orchard in perfect intervals, taking what it wanted and leaving silence in its wake.

The cellar grew colder. I stopped storing wood down there. The salt circle had been scuffed again, and I reinforced it with fresh chalk, double the lines. The box I’d used to bury the seed still sat in the center, wrapped and sealed, but I had the nagging suspicion it was no longer empty. That something else had moved into it.

I dreamed of footsteps beneath floorboards, of doors opening to staircases that descended forever. The house in my dreams was always mine—but wrong. Rooms too long, furniture placed just slightly off-center, like someone had rebuilt it from memory and hadn’t quite gotten it right. In one of those dreams, I found myself standing at the kitchen sink, staring out the window. The orchard beyond was black—not at night, but colorless. A void with shape. The trees were there, but drained of every hue, every sound. And in the center of that black orchard stood a house I didn’t recognize. Low-roofed. Windowless. Sunken into the earth.

I woke gasping, mouth dry, shirt damp with sweat. The image stayed with me all day. That house beneath the orchard—it didn’t belong to this world. But I had the terrible certainty that it had once been real. Maybe still was. Just beneath the surface.

Iola didn’t answer her phone anymore. I drove into town on a Thursday, thinking maybe I’d check on her. Her shop was closed, curtains drawn, dust on the windows. A faded sign on the door read, “Closed for good. We tried.”

I asked around. Nobody had seen her in over a week.

“Probably went north,” one of the waitresses at the diner said. “She always hated spring.”

I didn’t believe it. But I didn’t press. People in Wren Hollow didn’t like questions, and I’d already asked more than my share.

The next night, I went back to the hollow tree.

I didn’t bring anything. No salt, no charms, no iron. Just myself.

The tree stood as it always had, rooted like a monument to whatever gods had come before soil was called soil. I ran a hand over its bark. It felt warm again, just slightly. Like something breathing on the other side.

“Are you still there?” I asked.

No answer. Not right away.

Then, a sound.

A knock.

From inside the tree.

Three soft raps.

I staggered back, nearly falling over my own boots. The orchard swayed gently in the breeze—if there was a breeze. I couldn’t feel it on my skin. But the trees moved all the same, like an audience waiting for the curtain to rise.

And then I heard a child laughing.

Not from within the tree. From somewhere deeper in the orchard.

It was distant, echoing through the rows, bending the space between trees like a mirror stretched too far. I knew that laugh. It was mine.

Not from now. From years ago.

That’s when I understood.

It wasn’t Eli who was coming through this time.

It was me.

Not the me I knew. The me that had never come back. The boy who had once wandered too far into the orchard and seen something he wasn’t meant to. The boy who had buried a toy soldier and dug up a stone instead. That version of me—half memory, half shadow—had been waiting in the house beneath the orchard. Feeding on the recollections, on the scraps of story I’d tried so hard to burn away.

You can’t kill memory. Not entirely.

You can only choose what shape it takes.

I returned home, pulled up the floorboards in the attic, and took out the journal my father had left—the one I hadn’t yet dared finish. I’d only read pieces before, too afraid of what I’d find in the final pages. But now, I needed to see.

The last entry wasn’t a warning. It wasn’t even a goodbye.

It was a map.

Drawn in ink so faint I hadn’t noticed it before. The orchard sketched from above, each tree marked with tiny symbols. In the center: a spiral. The same spiral that had been on the stone. On the seed. On the box.

Beneath it, a word: “Door.”

Not gate. Not threshold. Not even portal.

Door.

Doors go both ways.

The house beneath the orchard wasn’t just a metaphor or dream. It was real. Or real enough.

And if it had a door, it could be opened.

Or sealed.

I packed for the journey as one might pack for a pilgrimage. Rope. Lantern. The bone knife. A compass that had never worked right but still made me feel safer. I took nothing that tied me to the present. No phone. No clock. Just tools, the kind you take when you expect not to return.

The next morning, I marked the spiral on the orchard floor with lime powder. It didn’t take long. The pattern was already there beneath the soil. My father hadn’t drawn it. He’d traced it.

At the spiral’s center, I began to dig.

The earth came up easy at first, then turned dense, rich with a scent like rotting fruit. After three feet, the color changed—from brown to black
