Title: The Prince and the Ashen Star
Chapter One: The Letter in the Flame

The morning air of Eldareth was perfumed with the scent of cinnamon and dying leaves. Autumn had cloaked the palace grounds in crimson and gold, the colors of change, though the court still pretended it was summer. Prince Kaelen, second son of the High Throne, found little comfort in the pageantry of the season. His boots crunched over frost-tipped grass as he crossed the Eastern courtyard alone, arms crossed and eyes distant.

He hadn’t slept. Again.

“Your Highness.” A soft voice echoed behind him.

Kaelen turned, recognizing Sir Rorin—his shadow more than his guard, the only man in the palace who dared call him by name when protocol demanded title.

“You’ll catch fever,” Rorin said, offering a fur-lined cloak.

Kaelen accepted it, more out of respect than chill. “Did the ravens come?”

“No word from Caer Vardis. Nor from the Northward Pass. But…” Rorin hesitated. “Something else arrived.”

The knight reached into the folds of his surcoat and produced a folded parchment, its edges blackened as if licked by flame. The seal bore no crest, just an indigo smear shaped like a dying star.

Kaelen frowned. “What is this?”

“It appeared in your chambers. No one saw who delivered it.”

The prince opened the letter. The parchment was warm—absurdly so—and bore no ink, only a single line burnt into the paper as though by invisible fire:

“The world is ending. You must come. Midnight’s Hollow. The door opens for no other.”

He blinked. “A jest?”

“I don’t think so,” said Rorin. “It reeks of old magic.”

Kaelen looked up, eyes stormed. “Get the horses.”

Chapter Two: Midnight’s Hollow

They rode hard through the Rivenwood, avoiding the high roads where questions gathered like flies. Only Rorin and Kaelen knew the journey’s purpose, though the prince himself wasn’t sure he understood it. A message without a name, a warning with no reason, and a place that did not exist on any map he knew. Midnight’s Hollow. A fable, whispered by old women to children to keep them from wandering into the hills.

They reached the place after five nights. The Hollow was not marked by any sign or landmark, but they knew it when they saw it—a clearing where the trees leaned away rather than toward, and the sky above was unnaturally dark, as if time forgot this piece of land.

In the center, a door stood upright, embedded in nothing, its frame made of bone and bramble.

“Gods,” Rorin murmured.

Kaelen approached it slowly. There was no handle. No seam.

He reached out. The surface shimmered under his hand and, without sound, opened.

Beyond was not another part of the forest—but a chamber of lightless stone, carved in impossible angles, walls humming with ancient energy. And standing at its heart, a woman draped in silver threads, her eyes black as coals and burning just the same.

“Welcome, Prince of the Cracked Crown,” she said.

Kaelen stiffened. “You know me.”

She nodded. “I called you.”

“Why?”

“The world dies, and you must stop it.”

Chapter Three: The Fractured World

Her name was Virell, Keeper of the Eclipsed Flame. She spoke in broken riddles at first, her tongue old as forgotten suns. But she told him the truth, or at least her truth: that the world—Aravell—was not whole. Not anymore. It had fractured long ago during the War of the Splintering Sky, and only now, centuries later, were the wounds beginning to bleed again.

“There are seven shards,” she explained, gesturing to a constellation map etched into the stone. “Each a fragment of the Prime Source. And each guarded, hidden, cursed.”

“And you want me to collect them?” Kaelen asked, his brow furrowed.

“No,” she replied, voice quiet. “You must earn them.”

One was kept in the Hollow Monastery, guarded by monks who spoke only in dreams. Another in the Ruins of Sylveth, beneath the bones of the first dragon. A third lay sealed in the chest of a sleeping god.

Kaelen felt laughter rising in his throat. “You’re mad.”

“No more than the world,” she said. “But you’ve already begun. The moment you opened the door, your path was inked.”

“I have no army. No magic.”

“You have choice. That is the rarest power.”

Chapter Four: A Blade Named Mourning

The Hollow spat them out onto a different path, far south of Eldareth. The skies here were bruised purple, the sun a sickle barely scraping the edge of the horizon. The land was barren but not empty.

They came upon a village hollowed by silence—no people, no livestock, just houses whose doors bled rust. On the altar of a broken chapel lay a sword, black as obsidian, hilt wrapped in silver thread. It vibrated faintly, humming like a whispered name.

Kaelen touched it—and saw fire.

A battlefield. Screams. Himself, older, broken, kneeling before a burning city.

Then, nothing.

When he awoke, Rorin stood over him.

“The sword,” Kaelen gasped. “Did you touch it?”

“No,” Rorin said. “But it sings to you.”

Virell’s voice echoed in his skull. “That is Mourning, the blade that remembers. It will show you the cost before the choice.”

Chapter Five: The Monk’s Dream

They reached the Hollow Monastery after ten more days, guided by visions Kaelen could not explain. Dreams and symbols, voices in the wind. The monks greeted him not with words but by pressing their foreheads to his and filling his mind with images: a child with no face, drowning in black water; a tower of screaming mirrors; a field of clocks all ticking backward.

The trial was simple. Kaelen was given a vial of blood and told to drink it.

“What is it?” he asked.

Rorin frowned. “Poison?”

“A memory,” one monk said aloud, breaking their vow. “Of someone you’ve never been. You must become him, and find your way back.”

Kaelen drank.

He was suddenly elsewhere—a thief in a city of smoke, hunted by guards for a crime he didn’t commit. He had no sword, no name. He had only instinct.

It took him seven days in the dream to remember he was a prince. When he awoke, the shard lay on his chest, a sliver of gold encased in a stone heart.

Chapter Six: Betrayal in Sylveth

Sylveth was a ruin of bones and shattered marble. Once a city of dragons, now a graveyard.

They weren’t alone.

A group of mercenaries had arrived days before, led by a woman Kaelen once called friend—Captain Serah Valen, now exiled from Eldareth for reasons too tangled to speak of.

“Kaelen,” she said, drawing her blade. “Or do you call yourself something else now?”

“I need the shard,” he said.

She smiled. “Then you’ll have to bleed for it.”

What followed was chaos—steel on stone, shouts, fire. Rorin took a spear to the side. Kaelen dueled Serah beneath a crumbling arch, their swords ringing like bells.

She was better. Always had been.

But Kaelen was different now.

He let Mourning guide him, saw the futures behind her eyes. Saw her die. Saw her live.

He chose mercy. Knocked the sword from her hand. Offered his instead.

She stared at it. “You’re a fool.”

“Maybe.”

She took his hand.

And together, they entered the dragon’s tomb.

Chapter Seven: When the Sky Split

With three shards in hand, the sky began to change. Colors bled wrong. Birds flew backward. Children spoke in dead tongues.

Virell returned in flame.

“Time frays,” she warned. “You must hurry. The next shard is buried in the Wastes of Harn, where time forgot itself.”

“And the others?” Kaelen asked.

“They will come to you. But beware—the Starborn have seen you.”

“Who?”

She faded.

The Starborn came that night. Creatures of glass and breath, with no faces but thousands of mouths. They whispered Kaelen’s name in every voice he’d ever heard, even those long dead.

He did not sleep.

He did not dare.

Kaelen stood still for a long time after the woman’s form vanished into smoke. The torchlight in the strange chamber flickered against the wet, dark stone, casting shadows that danced with a rhythm that seemed off, like a heartbeat too slow or too fast. He tried to tell himself this was a dream, some elaborate jest played by sorcerers or madmen—but deep in his bones, he already knew that was not true. The air in this place was too heavy with meaning, too dense with the kind of silence that only ancient truths could summon.

He looked to Rorin, who hadn’t stepped inside the door but had come close enough to lean against its invisible threshold. The knight’s brow was creased, his mouth pressed into a thin line, but his hand did not reach for his sword. That alone spoke volumes.

“What did she say?” Rorin asked, eyes scanning the room as if trying to understand how it fit into the world they knew.

Kaelen didn’t answer immediately. He turned, walking back through the door, half-expecting it to shut behind him and leave him lost forever in that unnatural chamber. But the door remained open until he crossed the threshold—and then, without fanfare, it simply closed. A blink, and it was gone. The frame had vanished, no scorch mark left on the grass, no shimmer in the air. Just trees again, leaning in as if the moment had never happened.

“She said the world is ending,” Kaelen said finally, his voice hollow.

“Well,” Rorin muttered, adjusting the hilt of his blade, “at least it’s not another arranged betrothal.”

Kaelen didn’t laugh. Instead, he turned back toward the horses. “We’ll need supplies. Provisions. And no questions asked.”

“You’re not thinking of returning to the palace?” Rorin asked, tone bordering on alarm.

“No,” Kaelen replied. “We go east. There’s an old sage near the Glass Hills. He used to talk of things like this. Runes, stars, cracks in the veil. My brother always called him a madman.”

“Your brother calls squirrels mad when they don’t run,” Rorin said. He paused. “Does this have something to do with the plague in Vesseran? Or those stories out of the marshlands—the black rain and blood-colored fog?”

Kaelen shook his head. “I don’t know. But if I wait to understand, we’ll already be too late.”

They rode again before dawn, their horses restless and snorting in the chill. The path they took was old—so old the trees seemed to lean aside for it, and no birds dared call from the branches above. The road was cracked, overtaken by roots and moss, but it still remembered its purpose, and so did the air.

After two days, they passed a ruin that neither of them could name. The stones looked like teeth chewed by time. Rorin spotted a shape watching them from the tallest broken arch, but it vanished when they approached. Kaelen did not ask what he saw. They both knew some things watched only the marked.

At night, the prince stared into the fire and remembered her words. You must come. The world is ending. And that strange place beyond the door, the way it felt like it was not built but grown, not lit but remembered.

He also remembered her eyes. Not cold, not cruel—just full of knowing, like someone who had watched the sun die and kept the story to herself.

“You should sleep,” Rorin said, tossing him a rough-woven blanket.

“I can’t,” Kaelen replied, watching sparks lift into the sky. “Every time I close my eyes, I see a tower with no top and no bottom. It’s burning, but the flames are blue, and they burn up not down.”

“Sounds like prophecy.”

“Sounds like a trap.”

They reached the edge of the Glass Hills on the fifth day, the land shimmering as though a mirror had cracked across it. The sage they sought—Arreth—lived in a hut made of discarded memories. That’s what Kaelen had called it once, after seeing the walls made from broken windowpanes, scrolls too faded to read, and bones that hummed when touched.

Arreth emerged before they could call out, as though he’d been waiting for years. His beard reached past his knees, and his eyes were shut with old scars.

“I told you not to come back, princeling,” he said without smiling.

“I was summoned.”

The blind man tilted his head. “You heard the Ashen Star, then.”

Kaelen’s breath caught. “You know of it?”

“I know it,” Arreth said, his voice rasping like dry parchment. “But no one’s heard it for an age and a half. Not since the last Sundering.”

Kaelen stepped forward. “What is it? Why now? Why me?”

“Because,” the old sage whispered, “the world is fraying at its seams, and you are one of the few still holding a thread.”

Arreth invited them in without waiting for a reply. The inside of the hut was darker than it should have been, as though light feared to stay too long. The shelves were crowded with books that smelled of smoke and seawater, and jars that pulsed faintly when Kaelen passed.

The sage sat with difficulty, motioning for the prince to do the same. “You were touched by the Hollow. That much I can sense. You’ve crossed a door that most believe is metaphor. You’ve entered the space-between. That makes you dangerous.”

“To who?” Kaelen asked.

Arreth didn’t answer right away. He reached into a jar and pulled out a lump of dark glass, polished and warm. He passed it to Kaelen.

In it, the prince saw a reflection—but not his. The face was his, but older, hollow-eyed, scarred by fire and grief. Behind that face, the stars were falling.

“Yourself,” Arreth said. “You are your own danger now.”

Rorin stood near the entrance, arms crossed, watching with growing discomfort. “He’s no sorcerer. No priest. He’s not chosen.”

“No,” Arreth said. “But he is seen. That matters more than being chosen.”

Kaelen tightened his grip on the glass, feeling it burn into his palm.

“Then tell me what to do,” he said. “Give me something. A name, a place, anything.”

The old man sighed and gestured toward a map pinned to the wall by thorns. “The shards. Seven in all. One to the north, buried in a monastery of silent monks. Another in the ruined city of Sylveth, under the bones of the last sky-dragon. One guarded by a river that flows backward through time. You’ll need them if you want to mend what’s breaking.”

“And what’s breaking?” Kaelen asked.

Arreth leaned forward, breath sour with age. “The veil. The line between what is and what should not be. Once it tears, nothing will keep the unmade things from crawling through.”

Kaelen looked at the map, tracing lines from one shard to another.

“When do I start?” he asked.

“You already have,” said the sage.

That night, as they made camp at the base of the hills, the moon turned red—not the red of blood, but the red of heat and iron. The horses grew restless, and even Rorin looked unnerved. Something was stirring in the bones of the world.

Kaelen sat beside the fire, Mourning across his knees, and for the first time, he spoke aloud to no one.

“I will follow this path,” he said, “but I don’t believe in fate. If this world ends, it won’t be because I didn’t fight for it.”

The flames flared higher as if in response, and far in the distance, something screamed—long and low, like the sky itself cracking open.

Chapter Two: Whispers in the Hollow

The eastern winds carried a strange bitterness as Kaelen and Rorin pressed on into the lowlands. The trees had begun to change, not just in hue but in form—trunks curling as though they twisted away from the earth, their leaves paper-thin and colorless, fluttering like torn veils. Kaelen tried not to think about the way the path behind them seemed different whenever he looked back. One moment the trail was dirt; the next, moss-covered stone. At times there were no footprints at all.

“We’re being watched,” Rorin said quietly, pulling his cloak tighter. His hand never strayed far from the hilt of his sword, a blade far more ordinary than Mourning, but no less trusted.

Kaelen nodded. He had felt it too. A presence, not close but constant, like a name someone kept trying to say in a crowded room. His sleep had become fragmented, haunted by glimpses of a tower in the middle of a black ocean, its top wreathed in lightning that danced in reverse. He would awaken with Mourning already drawn, breath ragged, fingers clenched white around the hilt.

They passed through three villages in the next five days. Each more silent than the last. Doors were left open, fires still smoldered in hearths, meals half-eaten upon stone tables. The people had vanished. No signs of struggle, no blood—only absence. At the last of them, Kaelen found a single word scrawled across the wall of a meeting house, etched into the wood with something sharp and scorched at the edges.

UNSEEN.

“What does it mean?” Kaelen asked, his voice low.

Rorin didn’t answer right away. He bent down and ran his fingers over the soot-lined mark. “It means they didn’t vanish,” he said finally. “They were taken. Or… turned away.”

“Turned?”

Rorin stood, brushing off his gloves. “There are old stories, from before even the Writings of Elennor. Of things that lived in the gaps between what we know. Things that couldn’t be seen—not because they were invisible, but because we never knew how to look at them. They were... wrong. And when they came near, the world refused them. The wind would stop. The animals would bolt. Flames would die.”

“And they’re back?”

“If they ever left,” the knight said grimly.

They did not linger.

Their next destination was the Hollow Monastery, a place Kaelen had only heard of in whispered tales told by initiates too green to know better. It was said the monks there had long since given up the need for speech, choosing instead to commune through dreams and symbols, their minds no longer bound by the spoken word. Virell’s instructions had been maddeningly simple: Find the dreaming monks. They guard the first shard, though they do not know it.

As they approached the monastery’s vale, the land dipped into a shallow basin surrounded by cliffs so smooth they appeared melted. The monastery itself was carved directly into the cliff face, a spiral of arches and bridges that defied logic, appearing taller from within than it seemed from without. There were no gates, no guards, just a long stone path flanked by bowls of fire that did not burn but glowed with a deep blue radiance.

Kaelen paused before stepping onto the path. “No turning back, is there?”

“You turned the moment you read the letter,” Rorin said. “The rest is just walking forward.”

The silence inside the monastery was not the absence of sound, but its inverse. Every footstep felt muffled, as if the space itself rejected noise. The monks appeared without warning—hooded figures in robes of bone-white cloth, their faces concealed behind veils made of thin silver chains. They moved as one, never speaking, never gesturing. And yet, somehow, Kaelen understood where to go.

He was led through a long corridor that seemed to curve endlessly inward, past murals carved directly into the walls—scenes of starfalls, oceans burning, and figures faceless but crowned. At the end of the corridor, a domed chamber awaited, the ceiling painted with a map of a sky that did not exist.

The monks formed a circle around him. One stepped forward and held out a small cup filled with dark crimson liquid. Without a word, Kaelen took it. The taste was sharp, metallic, and the world immediately pitched sideways.

He fell.

But not to the ground.

He awoke in a different skin.

The clothes on his back were tattered, his hands smaller, rough with dirt and cuts. Around him rose a city of glass towers and smoke-choked alleys, humming with strange, half-familiar energy. He realized with a slow, dawning horror that this was not a vision but a memory—one that did not belong to him. The sounds, the scents, the heaviness of his limbs—they were all real.

He tried to speak, but his voice came out with an accent he didn’t know. He was someone else. Somewhere else. And he had no sword, no title, no past.

His name, he learned, was Daran. A thief. A liar. A survivor of the lowest ward in the city of Varenth—a place that existed only in the apocryphal texts Kaelen had once mocked as fantasies. He spent his first night in this false life bleeding from a cut across the ribs, hiding beneath a rusted stairwell as soldiers passed by, searching for a stolen artifact he had no memory of stealing.

He lived as Daran for seven days. And each day, the weight of this borrowed life grew heavier. There was no sign of the monks. No clues. Just fear and smoke and the growing suspicion that he was losing himself to this identity.

But on the seventh night, he stood before a mirror that had not worked since he arrived. For the first time, it reflected something other than the city behind him. It showed his true face. Kaelen. Crownless, sleepless, and now—aware. In that moment, he remembered why he was here.

And the world around him cracked like glass.

He awoke gasping in the monk’s chamber, sweat-soaked and trembling. Rorin was by his side, hand on his shoulder. The monks were gone.

In his lap lay the first shard.

It was no larger than a child’s tooth, shaped like a twisted spiral and glowing with a light too deep to be color. Kaelen picked it up, and the stone around them trembled as if recognizing the shard’s presence.

“Did you find it?” Rorin asked.

Kaelen stared at the fragment. “I didn’t find it. I became it.”

They left the monastery without words, the monks watching silently as they passed. Outside, the wind had changed. The sky was darker than it had been, though the sun still hung above the horizon. Birds flew in spirals instead of lines. And far to the north, a shimmer of light rippled across the horizon, like a curtain tearing.

“What now?” Rorin asked.

Kaelen didn’t answer right away. He held the shard in his palm, felt the pull of it—toward the east, toward a place he could not yet name but already feared.

“We find the next,” he said finally. “And we pray that when we do, we’re still ourselves.”

They mounted their horses and rode on, and behind them, the Hollow Monastery vanished—folding itself back into the cliff as though it had never been.

The road that led away from the Hollow Monastery stretched like a thread unraveling from the hem of the world. What had once been familiar countryside gave way to uncanny terrain, where trees bore leaves shaped like hands and streams ran uphill for brief, disorienting moments. Time moved irregularly here—sometimes the sun would seem to hover in one spot for hours, other times it would jerk across the sky like a marionette pulled by unseen strings. Even Rorin, whose iron calm had never faltered through battlefield or blizzard, began to shift uneasily in his saddle.

“We need to get out of this region before our minds start melting out our ears,” he muttered one evening, as he attempted to light a fire for the fourth time with flint that refused to spark.

Kaelen sat nearby, staring into the darkness between the trees. “The shard pulled us here. The next may be doing the same.”

“Then we follow it and hope it doesn’t lead us off a cliff.”

Kaelen didn’t respond. In truth, he felt something gnawing at the corners of his perception—an itch he couldn’t reach, like a word on the tip of the tongue that refused to manifest. The shard they had recovered no longer glowed, but it pulsed with a warmth that increased when they headed east. He had taken to wearing it beneath his shirt, tied in a leather pouch around his neck. Though small, it felt heavier than it should, as though each step toward the next shard added weight not only to his body but to his soul.

Three nights later, they encountered their first living soul in nearly a week.

She stood in the middle of the road as if she had grown from the stone itself—tall, cloaked in brown robes stained with ash and dust, her head bare and her eyes rimmed in black kohl. She did not flinch when the horses drew near, nor did she speak. But when Kaelen dismounted and approached, she held out her hand and made a strange sign in the air—three fingers up, one curled, the thumb angled toward the sky.

Kaelen returned the gesture instinctively, though he did not know why.

“Child of the Ashen Star,” the woman said, her voice hollow and echoing as if from a deep cavern. “You walk the Path of Unmaking.”

“I walk a path I was shown,” Kaelen replied. “I did not choose it.”

“All choices lead to the same end,” she said, lowering her hand. “Only the footprints differ.”

Kaelen glanced to Rorin, who looked about ready to draw steel.

“Do you guard the next shard?” the prince asked.

“I am a witness,” the woman said. “Not a guardian. What comes next is neither test nor gift. It is a reckoning.”

Before he could speak again, she turned and walked into the woods without another word.

Kaelen followed without question.

They came to a clearing that was not a clearing at all. The trees parted only to reveal a crater in the earth, vast and filled with mist that shimmered silver and gold. In the center stood a structure—no, a skeleton of a structure. It looked like the ruins of a cathedral, its spires snapped like bones, its windows shattered into constellations of glass that reflected nothing.

“What is this place?” Kaelen asked softly.

The woman did not answer, but the answer came nonetheless.

He heard it in his mind—no voice, just intent.

Here lies the second wound.

He stepped forward, and the mists parted as if in deference.

Inside the ruin, time stuttered. One moment Kaelen was stepping over fallen stone; the next, he was a child again, running through the palace gardens with his brother, laughing. Then he was old—too old—sitting in a broken throne room with dust in his mouth and fire in his eyes. Then he was himself again, gasping, sweating, and kneeling at the base of a shattered altar.

A figure waited at the altar. Tall, pale, draped in robes of deep indigo stitched with symbols that hurt to look at.

“Prince of Eldareth,” it said. “Bearer of one. Seeker of many. Do you know what lies beneath your feet?”

“No,” Kaelen replied.

“Your grave,” the being said. “And theirs.”

It raised its hand, and the ground quaked.

From the dust rose forms—ghosts, maybe, or memories. They looked like people Kaelen had failed. Soldiers who had died while protecting him. Servants poisoned in a plot meant for his father. Even his mother, her face drawn with the sorrow she’d carried until the day she disappeared.

“What is this?” he asked.

“This is the price,” the figure said. “All power is drawn from loss. All balance paid in kind. You cannot take from the world and expect it to remain still.”

Kaelen stood slowly. “Then I’ll pay it. Whatever it is. But I won’t run.”

The figure tilted its head. “Brave words. Let us see if they endure.”

The forms rushed him—not to attack, but to envelop. Kaelen was submerged in them, a tide of regrets, of missed chances and whispered blame. He felt his lungs closing, his knees buckling. But then, through it all, he remembered the firelight from the monastery. The feeling of the shard in his palm. The knowing that he had already begun to change.

He screamed—not in fear, but in defiance—and the ghosts shattered like glass underfoot.

When the world settled, he stood alone. The altar had crumbled to dust, and in its place lay the second shard. This one was shaped like a fang, serrated along one edge and cold to the touch.

The cloaked woman waited outside the ruin.

“You have passed the Reckoning,” she said. “But you are no closer to truth.”

“I don’t want truth,” Kaelen muttered. “I want to stop what’s coming.”

“Then you must understand what it is you fight,” she said. “Follow the storm. There you will find the Sleeper.”

She walked into the mist and was gone.

Kaelen turned to Rorin, who had remained behind, sword drawn and face pale.

“Did you see them?” the prince asked.

Rorin nodded once. “I saw enough.”

They did not speak further that night. They camped by the edge of the crater, the sky above blanketed by rolling clouds lit from within by green lightning. Kaelen dreamed of oceans made of glass and a voice calling to him from beneath the waves.

When morning came, they found the forest gone.

In its place was a plain of ash, stretching to the horizon, and far beyond it—rising like a monolith carved from shadow—was the edge of the storm.

ChatGPT said:

The plains of ash were not silent—they breathed.

With every gust of wind that swept across the grey and lifeless soil, a low hiss followed, as if the land itself exhaled through a thousand unseen mouths. Each step Kaelen and Rorin took stirred ancient dust, exposing remnants buried beneath—twisted fragments of armor, half-melted medallions, bones scorched black by fire older than memory. There were no birds overhead, no insects in the air, only the storm looming in the east, pulsing like a great wound in the sky.

Kaelen kept the second shard close, tucked beside the first in the same leather pouch. When he placed both near each other, they emitted a faint hum—not a song, exactly, but something like a warning passed between siblings who remembered what their parents refused to speak of.

They walked for two days without seeing another soul. The sky never shifted. The storm loomed larger, but the sun neither rose nor fell. They passed monoliths made of what appeared to be fused glass and bone—towers with no doors or windows, slanting toward the storm as if pulled by its breath. On the third day, the land began to tilt upward, forming a ridge of cracked obsidian that overlooked a vast chasm below.

And in that chasm, nestled at the storm’s heart, they saw it.

A temple—if it could be called that—built not of stone or wood but of metal and fire. Its towers twisted skyward in spirals, bristling with thorns that shimmered and disappeared depending on how the light touched them. Around its perimeter marched figures—humanoid, but faceless, their forms rippling like water disturbed by wind. They moved in a circle, never stopping, never speaking.

Rorin peered through his spyglass, lips tight. “What in the name of the Nine Flames is that?”

Kaelen lowered his hood, staring down at the impossible structure. “The Sleeper,” he said. “It must be.”

“You think the next shard’s in that place?”

“No,” Kaelen said after a pause. “I think he is.”

They descended the ridge cautiously, using ancient trails carved by long-dead rivers. The further they moved into the chasm, the more the world warped. Time itself seemed to bend—Kaelen would blink, and Rorin would suddenly be standing three paces ahead. A moment of silence would stretch into an hour of stillness, their skin pricked by invisible thorns of magic gone rancid.

Halfway down the slope, they encountered a corpse impaled upright on a spike of glass. It wore no armor, only robes made of woven twilight. Its face had been split open like fruit, and yet there was no blood—just darkness oozing from the wound.

At its feet lay a broken pendant, etched with the symbol of the Ashen Star.

Rorin knelt beside it, examining the corpse without touching it. “Another one of yours?”

Kaelen picked up the pendant, fingers tightening. “Not one of mine. One of hers.”

They pressed on.

At the base of the chasm, the ground gave way to a field of obsidian petals, sharp enough to cut through boots, but strangely pliant underfoot. The air grew thicker, tinged with copper and electricity. The storm above had stopped moving—it now pulsed directly overhead, the clouds spinning in a slow, immense spiral, centered upon the temple below.

They crossed the threshold together.

Inside, the temple did not obey the rules of space. The entrance led into a corridor that extended endlessly in both directions. Doorways opened into rooms without walls. Some contained statues that seemed to watch Kaelen as he passed; others held mirrors that refused to reflect him. In one chamber, Rorin nearly stepped into a pit that looked shallow but reached infinitely down. Only the shard’s pull—warm and constant—kept them moving forward.

Eventually, they reached a central chamber. A dome of pure night curved overhead, lit not by flame or torch, but by the illusion of stars—each blinking in patterns too precise to be natural. At the chamber’s heart stood a man.

Or rather, something that had once been a man.

He was suspended above the floor, bound by chains made of runes, his eyes closed, his chest rising and falling as if caught in the rhythm of a distant tide. His hair was white, not with age but with fire that had long since gone cold. Around his neck hung a shard—the third—this one long and flat, shaped like the blade of a ceremonial dagger.

Kaelen stepped forward, drawn not by desire, but inevitability.

As he did, the Sleeper opened his eyes.

They were black. Not the black of pupils or the void, but the black of grief—a color so deep it pulled at Kaelen’s soul like a tide.

“You carry their echoes,” the Sleeper said, his voice too many at once.

“I’ve come for the shard,” Kaelen replied, forcing the words through a throat tight with ancient fear.

“No,” the Sleeper said. “You’ve come for yourself.”

“I don’t know what that means.”

“You will,” the Sleeper whispered. “But not yet.”

The chains binding him glowed with blue fire. Each rune on them pulsed once, then dimmed. Kaelen felt something twist behind his eyes.

“You are not ready to bear what I carry. But you will be. Take it.”

The shard snapped from the Sleeper’s neck and flew toward Kaelen, embedding itself between the two he already bore. For a moment, Kaelen’s vision swam. The ground beneath him cracked. The sky inside the dome tore open.

He saw a city burning.

A woman with silver eyes kneeling in chains.

His brother, crownless and dead.

A blade not yet forged.

Then nothing.

He awoke outside the temple.

Rorin crouched beside him, bruised but alive. “You collapsed. Everything inside that place just—fell in on itself.”

Kaelen reached into his pouch. Three shards now. Each humming. Each warm. Each heavier than before.

“Did you see the Sleeper?” he asked.

Rorin shook his head. “There was no one there. Just… darkness.”

Kaelen stared up at the storm. It was gone. The clouds were breaking apart, light filtering down in ragged shafts.

“We have three,” he said. “Four remain.”

Rorin helped him to his feet. “And what happens when you have all seven?”

Kaelen looked toward the east, where the sky was beginning to glow red—not with dawn, but with fire.

“Then I find out what they want me to become.”

They left the chasm behind, unaware that behind them, buried beneath a mountain of falling obsidian, the Sleeper still dreamed.

Chapter Three: The Crownless Road

The land they emerged into from the ash chasm bore little resemblance to the Aravell Kaelen once knew. Where once there had been forests and rivers, now stretched a wide, barren valley pocked with scars in the earth like claw marks. Whole swaths of ground appeared scorched from within, cracked open to reveal glowing magma beneath brittle soil. The air hung heavy with ozone, and strange lights flickered just above the horizon—blues and greens like the auroras spoken of only in the ancient epics. It felt like a place unmoored from the world, a land still arguing with its own right to exist.

Rorin scanned the horizon with weary eyes, chewing absently on a strip of dried meat that had long since lost all flavor. “There’s nothing out here. No villages, no roads. No people.”

“There used to be,” Kaelen murmured. “This was the Lowvale Basin. The breadbasket of half the eastern provinces.”

Rorin gave a snort. “Looks more like the gods dropped a forge on it.”

They traveled in silence for some time. Kaelen could feel the shards pressing against one another in his pouch, like living things beginning to wake from a long sleep. Their song had changed—not louder, but more layered, more complex. Sometimes it seemed as if they whispered not to him, but to each other, in a language just outside the edge of understanding. He found himself glancing over his shoulder more often than before, not out of fear, but from a strange certainty that the past was following them, each step leaving not just a mark on the world but an echo.

By the third day of crossing the Crownless Road—so called, Kaelen had learned, because no royal caravan had dared travel it since the Sundering of Halden’s Pact—they came upon a structure standing alone on the plain. It was a simple tower, round and squat, covered in ivy that had long since died but clung to the stone as though trying to remember life. Its door hung crookedly on one hinge, and a dull crimson light pulsed faintly from within, like a heartbeat slowed almost to stillness.

Kaelen dismounted and approached cautiously, Mourning drawn but held low. Rorin followed, crossbow at the ready. The door opened without resistance, groaning under its own age.

Inside was a spiral stair that led downward. The light grew brighter with each step. And when they reached the bottom, they found not a crypt or cellar—but a vast underground chamber filled with mirrors.

Thousands of them.

Some stood tall, etched with sigils Kaelen did not recognize. Others were cracked or dust-covered. Still others floated, suspended in the air as though unaware of gravity’s rules. The red light came not from torches or fire, but from the mirrors themselves—each reflecting a different sky, a different time.

Kaelen stepped closer to one and gasped.

It showed him, but not him. In this reflection, he wore a crown of thorns and flame, and his eyes glowed white. Behind him, legions of armored warriors marched across a blackened plain, banners raised, their faces veiled.

Another mirror showed him dead—pinned to a tree by spears of light, his hands charred, his eyes hollow.

Rorin moved among them warily. “I don’t like this. This reeks of arc-sorcery.”

A voice echoed through the chamber, quiet yet omnipresent. “They are possibilities.”

The mirrors shimmered, and a figure stepped from one of them—a woman cloaked in midnight, her face obscured by a mask made of woven stars.

Kaelen’s grip tightened on Mourning. “Are you another guardian?”

“I am a curator,” she said, her voice like wind through a cavern. “These are the fates not chosen. Paths not taken. Each shard you gather limits the futures available to you. You become more certain. More defined. Less possible.”

“I didn’t come to weigh futures,” Kaelen said. “Only to stop the end of this one.”

The woman stepped closer. “Then choose carefully.”

She raised a hand, and a new mirror rose from the floor. This one was darker than the others, almost black, and it shimmered as though submerged in water. Within it, Kaelen saw no reflection—only a void that pulsed, slow and patient.

“This is the Gate of the Null Path,” she said. “Where all things are unmade. There is a shard on the other side. But it is not guarded. It is forgotten. To retrieve it, you must step through. But beware—what passes through the gate does not always return the same.”

Kaelen approached, every hair on his body rising. The gate pulled at him, not physically, but emotionally—like it knew his grief, his questions, and offered an end to them all.

“What do I become if I take it?” he asked.

“Less,” she replied. “But also more. A paradox. You will forget some of yourself. In return, you may gain understanding no mortal mind should carry.”

Rorin grabbed his arm. “Kael, this is madness. We’ve already seen too much. You step through that thing, you may come out a stranger—or not at all.”

Kaelen looked from Rorin to the gate. He thought of the monks. Of the Sleeper. Of the ghosts that still haunted his dreams.

Then he stepped through.

For a moment, he became everything.

He saw himself as a child, crying in a nursery his mother had abandoned. He saw himself laughing with his brother, unaware of the blade poised above both their heads. He saw thousands of versions of himself—beggar, tyrant, knight, assassin, king, martyr. He became a constellation, a broken sword, a whisper on the lips of a dying god. Time ceased. Space inverted.

Then—he was nothing.

And then—

He was again.

Kaelen staggered out of the mirror, gasping, falling to his knees. Rorin caught him, barely. The chamber had gone dark, the mirrors silent. Only one remained lit—the one he had passed through—and within it, his reflection slowly faded to black.

He opened his hand. A new shard lay in his palm.

It was unlike the others. Not jagged or crystalline, but smooth. Round. Like an eye.

Rorin helped him to his feet. “You were gone for hours.”

“It felt like centuries,” Kaelen whispered.

The curator was gone. Only her voice remained, drifting like smoke.

“The fourth is yours. But the fifth waits where the dead speak. Tread lightly. Memory is a weapon, and your enemies carry blades made of yours.”

They left the mirror tower at dusk. The sky above had turned gold, and flocks of birds—real birds, not illusions—passed overhead for the first time in days.

Kaelen did not sleep that night. The dreams that came were not his own.

They belonged to another Kaelen.

And that Kaelen had done terrible, irreversible things.

They crossed the outer edge of the Glassreach the next day, entering a swathe of land known on no official chart, though the locals of bygone eras had called it the Whispershade. Kaelen had read of it once, in the margins of a book too damaged for the royal scribes to catalog—a passage scrawled in ink the color of dried blood: Here speak the dead not in cries, but in memory, drawn from those who dare to listen.

The fifth shard, he now believed, waited here.

Unlike the scorched plains or the mirror chamber, the Whispershade was not overtly hostile. It bore a quiet sorrow, like a room long abandoned, still carrying the scent of its last occupant. The forest, if it could be called such, was dense with trees that had no bark—only smooth grey skin, warm to the touch and eerily pliable. Their leaves were translucent and shaped like tongues. At first, Kaelen thought it imagination, but then he realized the trees were whispering—not in wind, but in voices.

He heard his name first. Then his brother’s. Then his mother’s lullaby, sung in the old tongue. Each time he paused, the voices multiplied, swelling into layered murmurs that pressed against his skull like too-tight bandages. Rorin held out better, jaw clenched and eyes forward, but even he flinched when the trees began speaking in his own voice, repeating words he’d spoken years ago in the quiet aftermath of battle: It should’ve been me. Gods, it should’ve been me.

They camped in a hollow where the voices thinned, though never ceased. That night, Kaelen stood watch, sleep having become a luxury he could no longer afford. The fourth shard, ever since leaving the mirror tower, had become... active. It spun faintly in its pouch, vibrating against the others, creating a tone he could almost hear, like a tuning fork held to his soul.

He pulled the pouch free and laid the shards out before him in a circle.

Each glowed a different hue—red, silver, violet, black. The colors pulsed in rhythm, and as he stared, an image took shape between them—not projected, but formed in his mind. A mountain wreathed in stormlight. A black gate carved into its face. A figure kneeling before it, offering something unseen.

He saw the fifth shard there.

Not buried. Not guarded.

But weeping.

Kaelen shook the image from his mind as dawn broke, the trees exhaling long moans as if protesting the sun’s return. They moved quickly, cutting through thickets that bled sap when touched. The terrain worsened. Pools of brackish water appeared without warning, their surfaces reflecting not the sky, but faces—some Kaelen recognized, others he could not. One showed Serah Valen, the exiled captain from Sylveth, her mouth moving in frantic speech though no sound came through. Another showed Arreth, the blind sage, his eyes open and bleeding fire.

Finally, they came upon a mound—no, a barrow. A burial place.

It stood at the center of a clearing where no trees dared grow. Moss covered its sides, and a single stone marked its entrance, etched with symbols Kaelen could not decipher. As he approached, the air thickened, not with heat, but with memory. Not his own.

Suddenly, he saw through another’s eyes—a woman, kneeling at this very barrow, tears cutting lines through soot on her cheeks. Her hands were red with blood. She whispered a name into the earth, and Kaelen felt it echo in his chest, though he could not understand it.

“She buried it,” Kaelen murmured, coming back to himself. “The shard. It was her sacrifice.”

Rorin studied the barrow warily. “What kind of place is this? I feel like we’re trespassing in a dream.”

“We are,” Kaelen said. “But dreams remember.”

They entered the barrow, ducking beneath the low stone lintel. Inside was pitch black, but the shards lit the space softly, casting shadows that trembled like candleflame. The walls were lined with bones—not arranged, but scattered, as though thrown in haste. There was a dais at the center, unadorned, save for a single crown resting atop it. The crown was broken—split down the center, its sides dented and scorched. Beneath it, nestled in a hollow, was the fifth shard.

Kaelen reached for it, but as his fingers touched the crown, the chamber sighed.

A figure rose from the far corner—a ghost not made of light, but of silence. Its features were Kaelen’s own, though older, thinner, haunted. Its eyes glowed pale blue, and when it spoke, its voice was identical to Kaelen’s.

“You forget too easily.”

“I don’t understand,” Kaelen said.

“I am the you who gave up. Who fled. Who abandoned the world because the weight of it was too much.”

Kaelen stepped back. “I never—”

“Not yet,” the echo interrupted. “But you could. And that’s why this shard weeps.”

The specter reached for the crown, lifting it with a tenderness that made Kaelen’s throat tighten. “This is the symbol of what you were born into. And what you must choose to leave behind. You cannot save the world as a prince. Only as something more. Or something less.”

Kaelen stared at the ghost, at the shard, at the broken crown.

And then, slowly, he reached down, lifted the crown from its resting place, and placed it on the ground beside him.

“I’ll carry the weight,” he said, voice steady. “But not the crown.”

The ghost nodded.

The fifth shard leapt into his hand.

And the barrow collapsed.

Rorin dragged him from the rubble just before the entrance caved in completely. They lay in the clearing, coughing, staring up at a sky now streaked with gold and crimson, as though dawn and dusk had arrived at once.

Kaelen held the fifth shard against his chest. It no longer wept.

But he did.

Only for a moment.

That night, as they set camp on the ridge beyond the Whispershade, Kaelen placed all five shards before him, arranging them in a circle. They hummed in harmony now, each color melting into the next, forming a pattern he couldn’t name but somehow understood. He saw a door in his mind—a real door, not the illusion of one. It waited atop a distant cliff, carved from stormglass and framed by ancient silver trees.

“The sixth is waiting,” Kaelen said.

Rorin looked up from sharpening his blade. “Where?”

Kaelen stared at the fire. “At the edge of the world.”

Chapter Four: The Silver Trees

The edge of the world was not a place one arrived at. It was a place one remembered—a half-formed idea left behind in the stories of madmen and poets, hinted at in the spaces between maps, or in the old songs where lines trailed off into silence. Yet as Kaelen and Rorin journeyed westward from the Whispershade, guided now by a force neither of them could name, the landscape itself began to betray the rules it once obeyed. Rivers flowed upward, skipping across the sky in arching bands before falling into the mouths of canyons below. Mountains rearranged themselves subtly each morning, so that familiar silhouettes became strangers overnight. The stars above burned with too many colors, and the constellations spun out of their orbits like dancers breaking formation.

They were crossing into myth.

The air grew thinner with each day, not with altitude, but with something else—some quiet unweaving of the world’s fabric. The ground beneath them still held weight, but Kaelen could feel it resisting, as though their presence strained the patience of the land. The fifth shard had changed as well; it no longer hummed like the others. It pulsed once every few minutes, sending faint shocks into Kaelen’s chest, as though marking the seconds until some final threshold would be crossed.

They came upon the first silver tree on the ninth morning, just as the wind had begun to whisper in voices again—not as it had in the Whispershade, but clearer, sharper, like bells tolling names. The tree stood alone at the top of a rocky hill, its bark gleaming like polished moonlight, its leaves shaped like narrow blades, each one catching the light and splitting it. There was no sound in its presence, only stillness.

Rorin touched the bark with a gloved hand and hissed, pulling back. “Cold,” he muttered. “Not just cold—wrong. Like something too old to remember warmth.”

Kaelen stepped closer, placing his hand on the trunk. The tree didn’t resist. It welcomed him.

And suddenly, he was somewhere else.

He stood in a circle of identical trees, each bending toward the center, forming a dome of silver limbs. In the middle sat a man. Or a god. Or something in between. His skin was pale as the bark, and his eyes burned with layered light.

"You carry the fifth,” the figure said. “The Weeping Shard. The memory of surrender.”

Kaelen nodded. “And I’m looking for the sixth.”

“It has already found you,” the man said, lifting one hand. “But to wield it, you must pass the Trial of Truth. You must know yourself. Not the version you present. Not the prince. Not the seeker. You.”

Kaelen braced for pain, for fire, for the crushing weight of sorrow as before. But instead, the dome of trees filled with silence so complete it became pressure—pushing into his ears, his lungs, his eyes.

And then he saw himself.

Truly.

Not in fragments or dreams. But as a boy who never understood why his mother left
