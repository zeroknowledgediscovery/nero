Was there aught that I did not share       In vigil or toil or ease,    One joy or woe that I did not know,       Dear hearts across the seas?     I have written the tale of our life       For a sheltered people's mirth,    In jesting guise--but ye are wise,    And ye know what the jest is worth.     GENERAL SUMMARY     We are very slightly changed    From the semi-apes who ranged       India's prehistoric clay;    Whoso drew the longest bow,    Ran his brother down, you know,       As we run men down today.     “Dowb,” the first of all his race,    Met the Mammoth face to face       On the lake or in the cave,    Stole the steadiest canoe,    Ate the quarry others slew,       Died--and took the finest grave.     When they scratched the reindeer-bone    Someone made the sketch his own,       Filched it from the artist--then,    Even in those early days,    Won a simple Viceroy's praise       Through the toil of other men.     Ere they hewed the Sphinx's visage    Favoritism governed kissage,    Even as it does in this age.     Who shall doubt the secret hid    Under Cheops' pyramid    Was that the contractor did       Cheops out of several millions?    Or that Joseph's sudden rise    To Comptroller of Supplies    Was a fraud of monstrous size       On King Pharoah's swart Civilians?     Thus, the artless songs I sing    Do not deal with anything       New or never said before.     As it was in the beginning,    Is today official sinning,       And shall be forevermore.     ARMY HEADQUARTERS     Old is the song that I sing--       Old as my unpaid bills--    Old as the chicken that kitmutgars bring    Men at dak-bungalows--old as the Hills.     Ahasuerus Jenkins of the “Operatic Own”     Was dowered with a tenor voice of super-Santley tone.     His views on equitation were, perhaps, a trifle queer;    He had no seat worth mentioning, but oh! he had an ear.     He clubbed his wretched company a dozen times a day,    He used to quit his charger in a parabolic way,    His method of saluting was the joy of all beholders,    But Ahasuerus Jenkins had a head upon his shoulders.     He took two months to Simla when the year was at the spring,    And underneath the deodars eternally did sing.     He warbled like a bulbul, but particularly at    Cornelia Agrippina who was musical and fat.     She controlled a humble husband, who, in turn, controlled a Dept.,    Where Cornelia Agrippina's human singing-birds were kept    From April to October on a plump retaining fee,    Supplied, of course, per mensem, by the Indian Treasury.     Cornelia used to sing with him, and Jenkins used to play;    He praised unblushingly her notes, for he was false as they:    So when the winds of April turned the budding roses brown,    Cornelia told her husband: “Tom, you mustn't send him down.”     They haled him from his regiment which didn't much regret him;    They found for him an office-stool, and on that stool they set him,    To play with maps and catalogues three idle hours a day,    And draw his plump retaining fee--which means his double pay.     Now, ever after dinner, when the coffeecups are brought,    Ahasuerus waileth o'er the grand pianoforte;    And, thanks to fair Cornelia, his fame hath waxen great,    And Ahasuerus Jenkins is a power in the State.     STUDY OF AN ELEVATION, IN INDIAN INK     This ditty is a string of lies.    But--how the deuce did Gubbins rise?     POTIPHAR GUBBINS, C. E.,    Stands at the top of the tree;    And I muse in my bed on the reasons that led    To the hoisting of Potiphar G.     Potiphar Gubbins, C. E.,    Is seven years junior to Me;    Each bridge that he makes he either buckles or breaks,    And his work is as rough as he.     Potiphar Gubbins, C. E.,    Is coarse as a chimpanzee;    And I can't understand why you gave him your hand,    Lovely Mehitabel Lee.     Potiphar Gubbins, C. E.,    Is dear to the Powers that Be;    For They bow and They smile in an affable style    Which is seldom accorded to Me.     Potiphar Gubbins, C. E.,    Is certain as certain can be    Of a highly-paid post which is claimed by a host    Of seniors--including Me.     Careless and lazy is he,    Greatly inferior to Me.     What is the spell that you manage so well,    Commonplace Potiphar G.?     Lovely Mehitabel Lee,    Let me inquire of thee,    Should I have riz to what Potiphar is,    Hadst thou been mated to me?     A LEGEND     This is the reason why Rustum Beg,    Rajah of Kolazai,    Drinketh the “simpkin” and brandy peg,    Maketh the money to fly,    Vexeth a Government, tender and kind,    Also--but this is a detail--blind.     RUSTUM BEG of Kolazai--slightly backward native state    Lusted for a C. S. I.,--so began to sanitate.    Built a Jail and Hospital--nearly built a City drain--    Till his faithful subjects all thought their Ruler was insane.     Strange departures made he then--yea, Departments stranger still,    Half a dozen Englishmen helped the Rajah with a will,    Talked of noble aims and high, hinted of a future fine    For the state of Kolazai, on a strictly Western line.     Rajah Rustum held his peace; lowered octroi dues a half;    Organized a State Police; purified the Civil Staff;    Settled cess and tax afresh in a very liberal way;    Cut temptations of the flesh--also cut the Bukhshi's pay;     Roused his Secretariat to a fine Mahratta fury,    By a Hookum hinting at supervision of dasturi;    Turned the State of Kolazai very nearly upside-down;    When the end of May was nigh, waited his achievement crown.     When the Birthday Honors came,    Sad to state and sad to see,    Stood against the Rajah's name nothing more than C. I. E.!    *   *   *   *   *     Things were lively for a week in the State of Kolazai.    Even now the people speak of that time regretfully.     How he disendowed the Jail--stopped at once the City drain;    Turned to beauty fair and frail--got his senses back again;    Doubled taxes, cesses, all; cleared away each new-built thana;    Turned the two-lakh Hospital into a superb Zenana;     Heaped upon the Bukhshi Sahib wealth and honors manifold;    Clad himself in Eastern garb--squeezed his people as of old.     Happy, happy Kolazai!  Never more  will Rustum Beg    Play to catch the Viceroy's eye. He prefers the “simpkin” peg.     THE STORY OF URIAH     “Now there were two men in one city;    the one rich and the other poor.”     Jack Barrett went to Quetta       Because they told him to.    He left his wife at Simla       On three-fourths his monthly screw:    Jack Barrett died at Quetta       Ere the next month's pay he drew.     Jack Barrett went to Quetta.       He didn't understand    The reason of his transfer       From the pleasant mountain-land:    The season was September,       And it killed him out of hand.     Jack Barrett went to Quetta,       And there gave up the ghost,    Attempting two men's duty       In that very healthy post;    And Mrs. Barrett mourned for him       Five lively months at most.     Jack Barrett's bones at Quetta       Enjoy profound repose;    But I shouldn't be astonished       If now his spirit knows    The reason of his transfer       From the Himalayan snows.     And, when the Last Great Bugle Call       Adown the Hurnal throbs,    When the last grim joke is entered       In the big black Book of Jobs,    And Quetta graveyards give again       Their victims to the air,    I shouldn't like to be the man       Who sent Jack Barrett there.     THE POST THAT FITTED         Though tangled and twisted the course of true love                This ditty explains,        No tangle's so tangled it cannot improve                If the Lover has brains.     Ere the steamer bore him Eastward, Sleary was engaged to marry    An attractive girl at Tunbridge, whom he called “my little Carrie.”     Sleary's pay was very modest; Sleary was the other way.    Who can cook a two-plate dinner on eight poor rupees a day?     Long he pondered o'er the question in his scantly furnished quarters--    Then proposed to Minnie Boffkin, eldest of Judge Boffkin's daughters.     Certainly an impecunious Subaltern was not a catch,    But the Boffkins knew that Minnie mightn't make another match.     So they recognised the business and, to feed and clothe the bride,    Got him made a Something Something somewhere on the Bombay side.     Anyhow, the billet carried pay enough for him to marry--    As the artless Sleary put it:--“Just the thing for me and Carrie.”     Did he, therefore, jilt Miss Boffkin--impulse of a baser mind?    No! He started epileptic fits of an appalling kind.     [Of his modus operandi only this much I could gather:--    “Pears's shaving sticks will give you little taste and lots of lather.”]     Frequently in public places his affliction used to smite    Sleary with distressing vigour--always in the Boffkins' sight.     Ere a week was over Minnie weepingly returned his ring,    Told him his “unhappy weakness” stopped all thought of marrying.     Sleary bore the information with a chastened holy joy,--    Epileptic fits don't matter in Political employ,--    Wired three short words to Carrie--took his ticket, packed his kit--    Bade farewell to Minnie Boffkin in one last, long, lingering fit.     Four weeks later, Carrie Sleary read--and laughed until she wept--    Mrs. Boffkin's warning letter on the “wretched epilept.”...     Year by year, in pious patience, vengeful Mrs. Boffkin sits    Waiting for the Sleary babies to develop Sleary's fits.     PUBLIC WASTE       Walpole talks of “a man and his price.”             List to a ditty queer--      The sale of a Deputy-Acting-Vice-            Resident-Engineer,      Bought like a bullock, hoof and hide,      By the Little Tin Gods on the Mountain Side.     By the Laws of the Family Circle 'tis written in letters of brass    That only a Colonel from Chatham can manage the Railways of State,    Because of the gold on his breeks, and the subjects wherein he must pass;    Because in all matters that deal not with Railways his knowledge is great.     Now Exeter Battleby Tring had laboured from boyhood to eld    On the Lines of the East and the West, and eke of the North and South;    Many Lines had he built and surveyed--important the posts which he held;    And the Lords of the Iron Horse were dumb when he opened his mouth.     Black as the raven his garb, and his heresies jettier still--    Hinting that Railways required lifetimes of study and knowledge--    Never clanked sword by his side--Vauban he knew not nor drill--    Nor was his name on the list of the men who had passed through the “College.”     Wherefore the Little Tin Gods harried their little tin souls,    Seeing he came not from Chatham, jingled no spurs at his heels,    Knowing that, nevertheless, was he first on the Government rolls    For the billet of “Railway Instructor to Little Tin Gods on Wheels.”     Letters not seldom they wrote him, “having the honour to state,”     It would be better for all men if he were laid on the shelf.    Much would accrue to his bank-book, an he consented to wait    Until the Little Tin Gods built him a berth for himself,     “Special, well paid, and exempt from the Law of the Fifty and Five,    Even to Ninety and Nine”--these were the terms of the pact:    Thus did the Little Tin Gods (long may Their Highnesses thrive!)    Silence his mouth with rupees, keeping their Circle intact;     Appointing a Colonel from Chatham who managed the Bhamo State Line    (The which was one mile and one furlong--a guaranteed twenty-inch gauge),    So Exeter Battleby Tring consented his claims to resign,    And died, on four thousand a month, in the ninetieth year of his age!     DELILAH     We have another viceroy now,--those days are dead and done    Of Delilah Aberyswith and depraved Ulysses Gunne.     Delilah Aberyswith was a lady--not too young--    With a perfect taste in dresses and a badly-bitted tongue,    With a thirst for information, and a greater thirst for praise,    And a little house in Simla in the Prehistoric Days.     By reason of her marriage to a gentleman in power,    Delilah was acquainted with the gossip of the hour;    And many little secrets, of the half-official kind,    Were whispered to Delilah, and she bore them all in mind.     She patronized extensively a man, Ulysses Gunne,    Whose mode of earning money was a low and shameful one.    He wrote for certain papers, which, as everybody knows,    Is worse than serving in a shop or scaring off the crows.     He praised her “queenly beauty” first; and, later on, he hinted    At the “vastness of her intellect” with compliment unstinted.    He went with her a-riding, and his love for her was such    That he lent her all his horses and--she galled them very much.     One day, THEY brewed a secret of a fine financial sort;    It related to Appointments, to a Man and a Report.    'Twas almost worth the keeping,--only seven people knew it--    And Gunne rose up to seek the truth and patiently pursue it.     It was a Viceroy's Secret, but--perhaps the wine was red--    Perhaps an Aged Councillor had lost his aged head--    Perhaps Delilah's eyes were bright--Delilah's whispers sweet--    The Aged Member told her what 'twere treason to repeat.     Ulysses went a-riding, and they talked of love and flowers;    Ulysses went a-calling, and he called for several hours;    Ulysses went a-waltzing, and Delilah helped him dance--    Ulysses let the waltzes go, and waited for his chance.     The summer sun was setting, and the summer air was still,    The couple went a-walking in the shade of Summer Hill.    The wasteful sunset faded out in Turkish-green and gold,    Ulysses pleaded softly, and-- that bad Delilah told!     Next morn, a startled Empire learnt the all-important news;    Next week, the Aged Councillor was shaking in his shoes.    Next month, I met Delilah and she did not show the least    Hesitation in affirming that Ulysses was a “beast.”                 *   *   *   *   *     We have another Viceroy now, those days are dead and done--    Of Delilah Aberyswith and most mean Ulysses Gunne!     WHAT HAPPENED     Hurree Chunder Mookerjee, pride of Bow Bazaar,    Owner of a native press, “Barrishter-at-Lar,”     Waited on the Government with a claim to wear    Sabres by the bucketful, rifles by the pair.     Then the Indian Government winked a wicked wink,    Said to Chunder Mookerjee: “Stick to pen and ink.    They are safer implements, but, if you insist,    We will let you carry arms wheresoe'er you list.”     Hurree Chunder Mookerjee sought the gunsmith and    Bought the tubes of Lancaster, Ballard, Dean, and Bland,    Bought a shiny bowie-knife, bought a town-made sword,    Jingled like a carriage-horse when he went abroad.     But the Indian Government, always keen to please,    Also gave permission to horrid men like these--    Yar Mahommed Yusufzai, down to kill or steal,    Chimbu Singh from Bikaneer, Tantia the Bhil;     Killar Khan the Marri chief, Jowar Singh the Sikh,    Nubbee Baksh Punjabi Jat, Abdul Huq Rafiq--    He was a Wahabi; last, little Boh Hla-oo    Took advantage of the Act--took a Snider too.     They were unenlightened men, Ballard knew them not.    They procured their swords and guns chiefly on the spot;    And the lore of centuries, plus a hundred fights,    Made them slow to disregard one another's rights.     With a unanimity dear to patriot hearts    All those hairy gentlemen out of foreign parts    Said: “The good old days are back--let us go to war!”     Swaggered down the Grand Trunk Road into Bow Bazaar,     Nubbee Baksh Punjabi Jat found a hide-bound flail;    Chimbu Singh from Bikaneer oiled his Tonk jezail;    Yar Mahommed Yusufzai spat and grinned with glee    As he ground the butcher-knife of the Khyberee.     Jowar Singh the Sikh procured sabre, quoit, and mace,    Abdul Huq, Wahabi, jerked his dagger from its place,    While amid the jungle-grass danced and grinned and jabbered    Little Boh Hla-oo and cleared his dah-blade from the scabbard.     What became of Mookerjee? Soothly, who can say?    Yar Mahommed only grins in a nasty way,    Jowar Singh is reticent, Chimbu Singh is mute.    But the belts of all of them simply bulge with loot.     What became of Ballard's guns? Afghans black and grubby    Sell them for their silver weight to the men of Pubbi;    And the shiny bowie-knife and the town-made sword are    Hanging in a Marri camp just across the Border.     What became of Mookerjee? Ask Mahommed Yar    Prodding Siva's sacred bull down the Bow Bazaar.    Speak to placid Nubbee Baksh--question land and sea--    Ask the Indian Congressmen--only don't ask me!     PINK DOMINOES     They are fools who kiss and tell”--      Wisely has the poet sung.    Man may hold all sorts of posts      If he'll only hold his tongue.     Jenny and Me were engaged, you see,      On the eve of the Fancy Ball;    So a kiss or two was nothing to you      Or any one else at all.     Jenny would go in a domino--      Pretty and pink but warm;    While I attended, clad in a splendid      Austrian uniform.     Now we had arranged, through notes exchanged      Early that afternoon,    At Number Four to waltz no more,      But to sit in the dusk and spoon.     I wish you to see that Jenny and Me      Had barely exchanged our troth;    So a kiss or two was strictly due      By, from, and between us both.     When Three was over, an eager lover,      I fled to the gloom outside;    And a Domino came out also      Whom I took for my future bride.     That is to say, in a casual way,      I slipped my arm around her;    With a kiss or two (which is nothing to you),      And ready to kiss I found her.     She turned her head and the name she said      Was certainly not my own;    But ere I could speak, with a smothered shriek      She fled and left me alone.     Then Jenny came, and I saw with shame      She'd doffed her domino;    And I had embraced an alien waist--      But I did not tell her so.     Next morn I knew that there were two      Dominoes pink, and one    Had cloaked the spouse of Sir Julian House,      Our big Political gun.     Sir J. was old, and her hair was gold,      And her eye was a blue cerulean;    And the name she said when she turned her head      Was not in the least like “Julian.”     THE MAN WHO COULD WRITE     Shun--shun the Bowl! That fatal, facile drink      Has ruined many geese who dipped their quills in 't;    Bribe, murder, marry, but steer clear of Ink      Save when you write receipts for paid-up bills in 't.     There may be silver in the “blue-black”--all    I know of is the iron and the gall.     Boanerges Blitzen, servant of the Queen,    Is a dismal failure--is a Might-have-been.    In a luckless moment he discovered men    Rise to high position through a ready pen.    Boanerges Blitzen argued therefore--“I,    With the selfsame weapon, can attain as high.”     Only he did not possess when he made the trial,    Wicked wit of C-lv-n, irony of L--l.     [Men who spar with Government need, to back their blows,    Something more than ordinary journalistic prose.]     Never young Civilian's prospects were so bright,    Till an Indian paper found that he could write:    Never young Civilian's prospects were so dark,    When the wretched Blitzen wrote to make his mark.    Certainly he scored it, bold, and black, and firm,    In that Indian paper--made his seniors squirm,    Quoted office scandals, wrote the tactless truth--    Was there ever known a more misguided youth?    When the Rag he wrote for praised his plucky game,    Boanerges Blitzen felt that this was Fame;    When the men he wrote of shook their heads and swore,    Boanerges Blitzen only wrote the more:     Posed as Young Ithuriel, resolute and grim,    Till he found promotion didn't come to him;    Till he found that reprimands weekly were his lot,    And his many Districts curiously hot.     Till he found his furlough strangely hard to win,    Boanerges Blitzen didn't care to pin:    Then it seemed to dawn on him something wasn't right--    Boanerges Blitzen put it down to “spite”;     Languished in a District desolate and dry;    Watched the Local Government yearly pass him by;    Wondered where the hitch was; called it most unfair.    *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     That was seven years ago--and he still is there!     MUNICIPAL             “Why is my District death-rate low?”               Said Binks of Hezabad.            “Well, drains, and sewage-outfalls are              “My own peculiar fad.             “I learnt a lesson once, It ran            “Thus,” quoth that most veracious man:--     It was an August evening and, in snowy garments clad,    I paid a round of visits in the lines of Hezabad;    When, presently, my Waler saw, and did not like at all,    A Commissariat elephant careering down the Mall.     I couldn't see the driver, and across my mind it rushed    That that Commissariat elephant had suddenly gone musth.     I didn't care to meet him, and I couldn't well get down,    So I let the Waler have it, and we headed for the town.     The buggy was a new one and, praise Dykes, it stood the strain,    Till the Waler jumped a bullock just above the City Drain;    And the next that I remember was a hurricane of squeals,    And the creature making toothpicks of my five-foot patent wheels.     He seemed to want the owner, so I fled, distraught with fear,    To the Main Drain sewage-outfall while he snorted in my ear--    Reached the four-foot drain-head safely and, in darkness and despair,    Felt the brute's proboscis fingering my terror-stiffened hair.     Heard it trumpet on my shoulder--tried to crawl a little higher--    Found the Main Drain sewage outfall blocked, some eight feet up, with mire;    And, for twenty reeking minutes, Sir, my very marrow froze,    While the trunk was feeling blindly for a purchase on my toes!     It missed me by a fraction, but my hair was turning grey    Before they called the drivers up and dragged the brute away.     Then I sought the City Elders, and my words were very plain.    They flushed that four-foot drain-head and--it never choked again!     You may hold with surface-drainage, and the sun-for-garbage cure,    Till you've been a periwinkle shrinking coyly up a sewer.     I believe in well-flushed culverts....                                       This is why the death-rate's small;    And, if you don't believe me, get shikarred yourself. That's all.     A CODE OF MORALS              Lest you should think this story true             I merely mention I             Evolved it lately. 'Tis a most             Unmitigated misstatement.     Now Jones had left his new-wed bride to keep his house in order,    And hied away to the Hurrum Hills above the Afghan border,    To sit on a rock with a heliograph; but ere he left he taught    His wife the working of the Code that sets the miles at naught.     And Love had made him very sage, as Nature made her fair;    So Cupid and Apollo linked, per heliograph, the pair.    At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise--    At e'en, the dying sunset bore her husband's homilies.     He warned her 'gainst seductive youths in scarlet clad and gold,    As much as 'gainst the blandishments paternal of the old;    But kept his gravest warnings for (hereby the ditty hangs)    That snowy-haired Lothario, Lieutenant-General Bangs.     'Twas General Bangs, with Aide and Staff, who tittupped on the way,    When they beheld a heliograph tempestuously at play.    They thought of Border risings, and of stations sacked and burnt--    So stopped to take the message down--and this is what they learnt--     “Dash dot dot, dot, dot dash, dot dash dot” twice. The General swore.     “Was ever General Officer addressed as 'dear' before?    “'My Love,' i' faith! 'My Duck,' Gadzooks! 'My darling popsy-wop!'    “Spirit of great Lord Wolseley, who is on that mountaintop?”     The artless Aide-de-camp was mute; the gilded Staff were still,    As, dumb with pent-up mirth, they booked that message from the hill;    For clear as summer lightning-flare, the husband's warning ran:--    “Don't dance or ride with General Bangs--a most immoral man.”     [At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise--    But, howsoever Love be blind, the world at large hath eyes.]    With damnatory dot and dash he heliographed his wife    Some interesting details of the General's private life.     The artless Aide-de-camp was mute, the shining Staff were still,    And red and ever redder grew the General's shaven gill.     And this is what he said at last (his feelings matter not):--    “I think we've tapped a private line. Hi! Threes about there! Trot!”     All honour unto Bangs, for ne'er did Jones thereafter know    By word or act official who read off that helio.     But the tale is on the Frontier, and from Michni to Mooltan    They know the worthy General as “that most immoral man.”     THE LAST DEPARTMENT     Twelve hundred million men are spread     About this Earth, and I and You    Wonder, when You and I are dead,     “What will those luckless millions do?”     None whole or clean, we cry, “or free from stain    Of favour.” Wait awhile, till we attain      The Last Department where nor fraud nor fools,    Nor grade nor greed, shall trouble us again.     Fear, Favour, or Affection--what are these    To the grim Head who claims our services?      I never knew a wife or interest yet    Delay that pukka step, miscalled “decease”;     When leave, long overdue, none can deny;    When idleness of all Eternity      Becomes our furlough, and the marigold    Our thriftless, bullion-minting Treasury     Transferred to the Eternal Settlement,    Each in his strait, wood-scantled office pent,      No longer Brown reverses Smith's appeals,    Or Jones records his Minute of Dissent.     And One, long since a pillar of the Court,    As mud between the beams thereof is wrought;      And One who wrote on phosphates for the crops    Is subject-matter of his own Report.     These be the glorious ends whereto we pass--    Let Him who Is, go call on Him who Was;      And He shall see the mallie steals the slab    For currie-grinder, and for goats the grass.     A breath of wind, a Border bullet's flight,    A draught of water, or a horse's fright--      The droning of the fat Sheristadar    Ceases, the punkah stops, and falls the night     For you or Me. Do those who live decline    The step that offers, or their work resign?      Trust me, Today's Most Indispensables,    Five hundred men can take your place or mine.     OTHER VERSES     RECESSIONAL    (A Victorian Ode)     God of our fathers, known of old--      Lord of our far-flung battle line--    Beneath whose awful hand we hold      Dominion over palm and pine--     Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,    Lest we forget--lest we forget!     The tumult and the shouting dies--      The Captains and the Kings depart--    Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,      An humble and a contrite heart.     Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,    Lest we forget--lest we forget!     Far-called our navies melt away--      On dune and headland sinks the fire--    Lo, all our pomp of yesterday      Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!     Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,    Lest we forget--lest we forget!     If, drunk with sight of power, we loose      Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe--    Such boastings as the Gentiles use,      Or lesser breeds without the Law--     Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,    Lest we forget--lest we forget!     For heathen heart that puts her trust      In reeking tube and iron shard--    All valiant dust that builds on dust,      And guarding calls not Thee to guard.     For frantic boast and foolish word,    Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord!                                  Amen.     THE VAMPIRE     The verses--as suggested by the painting by Philip Burne Jones, first    exhibited at the new gallery in London in 1897.     A fool there was and he made his prayer      (Even as you and I!)    To a rag and a bone and a hank of hair    (We called her the woman who did not care),    But the fool he called her his lady fair      (Even as you and I!)     Oh the years we waste and the tears we waste      And the work of our head and hand,    Belong to the woman who did not know    (And now we know that she never could know)      And did not understand.     A fool there was and his goods he spent      (Even as you and I!)    Honor and faith and a sure intent    But a fool must follow his natural bent    (And it wasn't the least what the lady meant),      (Even as you and I!)     Oh the toil we lost and the spoil we lost      And the excellent things we planned,    Belong to the woman who didn't know why    (And now we know she never knew why)      And did not understand.     The fool we stripped to his foolish hide      (Even as you and I!)    Which she might have seen when she threw him aside--    (But it isn't on record the lady tried)    So some of him lived but the most of him died--      (Even as you and I!)     And it isn't the shame and it isn't the blame      That stings like a white hot brand.     It's coming to know that she never knew why    (Seeing at last she could never know why)      And never could understand.     TO THE UNKNOWN GODDESS     Will you conquer my heart with your beauty; my soul going out from afar?    Shall I fall to your hand as a victim of crafty and cautious shikar?     Have I met you and passed you already, unknowing, unthinking and blind?    Shall I meet you next session at Simla, O sweetest and best of your kind?     Does the P. and O. bear you to meward, or, clad in short frocks in the West,    Are you growing the charms that shall capture and torture the heart in my    breast?     Will you stay in the Plains till September--my passion as warm as the day?    Will you bring me to book on the Mountains, or where the thermantidotes play?     When the light of your eyes shall make pallid the mean lesser lights I pursue,    And the charm of your presence shall lure me from love of the gay “thirteen-    two”;     When the peg and the pig-skin shall please not; when I buy me Calcutta-build    clothes;    When I quit the Delight of Wild Asses; forswearing the swearing of oaths;    As a deer to the hand of the hunter when I turn 'mid the gibes of my friends;    When the days of my freedom are numbered, and the life of the bachelor ends.     Ah, Goddess! child, spinster, or widow--as of old on Mars Hill whey they    raised    To the God that they knew not an altar--so I, a young Pagan, have praised    The Goddess I know not nor worship; yet, if half that men tell me be true,    You will come in the future, and therefore these verses are written to you.     THE RUPAIYAT OF OMAR KAL'VIN     [Allowing for the difference 'twixt prose and rhymed exaggeration, this ought    to reproduce the sense of what Sir A-- told the nation sometime ago, when the    Government struck from our incomes two per cent.]     Now the New Year, reviving last Year's Debt,    The Thoughtful Fisher casteth wide his Net;      So I with begging Dish and ready Tongue    Assail all Men for all that I can get.     Imports indeed are gone with all their Dues--    Lo! Salt a Lever that I dare not use,      Nor may I ask the Tillers in Bengal--    Surely my Kith and Kin will not refuse!     Pay--and I promise by the Dust of Spring,    Retrenchment.  If my promises can bring      Comfort, Ye have Them now a thousandfold--    By Allah! I will promise Anything!     Indeed, indeed, Retrenchment oft before    I swore--but did I mean it when I swore?      And then, and then, We wandered to the Hills,    And so the Little Less became Much More.     Whether a Boileaugunge or Babylon,    I know not how the wretched Thing is done,      The Items of Receipt grow surely small;    The Items of Expense mount one by one.     I cannot help it. What have I to do    With One and Five, or Four, or Three, or Two?      Let Scribes spit Blood and Sulphur as they please,    Or Statesmen call me foolish--Heed not you.     Behold, I promise--Anything You will.    Behold, I greet you with an empty Till--      Ah! Fellow-Sinners, of your Charity    Seek not the Reason of the Dearth, but fill.     For if I sinned and fell, where lies the Gain    Of Knowledge? Would it ease you of your Pain      To know the tangled Threads of Revenue,    I ravel deeper in a hopeless Skein?     “Who hath not Prudence”--what was it I said,    Of Her who paints her Eyes and tires Her Head,      And gibes and mocks the People in the Street,    And fawns upon them for Her thriftless Bread?     Accursed is She of Eve's daughters--She    Hath cast off Prudence, and Her End shall be      Destruction... Brethren, of your Bounty    Some portion of your daily Bread to Me.     LA NUIT BLANCHE       A much-discerning Public hold        The Singer generally sings      And prints and sells his past for gold.       Whatever I may here disclaim,        The very clever folk I sing to        Will most indubitably cling to      Their pet delusion, just the same.     I had seen, as the dawn was breaking      And I staggered to my rest,    Tari Devi softly shaking      From the Cart Road to the crest.     I had seen the spurs of Jakko      Heave and quiver, swell and sink.    Was it Earthquake or tobacco,      Day of Doom, or Night of Drink?     In the full, fresh fragrant morning      I observed a camel crawl,    Laws of gravitation scorning,      On the ceiling and the wall;    Then I watched a fender walking,      And I heard grey leeches sing,    And a red-hot monkey talking      Did not seem the proper thing.     Then a Creature, skinned and crimson,      Ran about the floor and cried,    And they said that I had the “jims” on,      And they dosed me with bromide,    And they locked me in my bedroom--      Me and one wee Blood Red Mouse--    Though I said: “To give my head room      You had best unroof the house.”     But my words were all unheeded,      Though I told the grave M.D.    That the treatment really needed      Was a dip in open sea    That was lapping just below me,      Smooth as silver, white as snow,    And it took three men to throw me      When I found I could not go.     Half the night I watched the Heavens      Fizz like '81 champagne--    Fly to sixes and to sevens,      Wheel and thunder back again;    And when all was peace and order      Save one planet nailed askew,    Much I wept because my warder      Would not let me set it true.     After frenzied hours of waiting,      When the Earth and Skies were dumb,    Pealed an awful voice dictating      An interminable sum,    Changing to a tangle story--      “What she said you said I said”--    Till the Moon arose in glory,      And I found her... in my head;     Then a Face came, blind and weeping,      And It couldn't wipe its eyes,    And It muttered I was keeping      Back the moonlight from the skies;    So I patted it for pity,      But it whistled shrill with wrath,    And a huge black Devil City      Poured its peoples on my path.     So I fled with steps uncertain      On a thousand-year long race,    But the bellying of the curtain      Kept me always in one place;    While the tumult rose and maddened      To the roar of Earth on fire,    Ere it ebbed and sank and saddened      To a whisper tense as wire.     In tolerable stillness      Rose one little, little star,    And it chuckled at my illness,      And it mocked me from afar;    And its brethren came and eyed me,      Called the Universe to aid,    Till I lay, with naught to hide me,      'Neath the Scorn of All Things Made.     Dun and saffron, robed and splendid,      Broke the solemn, pitying Day,    And I knew my pains were ended,      And I turned and tried to pray;    But my speech was shattered wholly,      And I wept as children weep.     Till the dawn-wind, softly, slowly,      Brought to burning eyelids sleep.     MY RIVAL     I go to concert, party, ball--      What profit is in these?    I sit alone against the wall      And strive to look at ease.     The incense that is mine by right      They burn before her shrine;    And that's because I'm seventeen      And She is forty-nine.     I cannot check my girlish blush,      My color comes and goes;    I redden to my finger-tips,      And sometimes to my nose.     But She is white where white should be,      And red where red should shine.    The blush that flies at seventeen      Is fixed at forty-nine.     I wish I had Her constant cheek;      I wish that I could sing    All sorts of funny little songs,      Not quite the proper thing.     I'm very gauche and very shy,      Her jokes aren't in my line;    And, worst of all, I'm seventeen      While She is forty-nine.     The young men come, the young men go      Each pink and white and neat,    She's older than their mothers, but      They grovel at Her feet.     They walk beside Her 'rickshaw wheels--      None ever walk by mine;    And that's because I'm seventeen      And She is forty-nine.     She rides with half a dozen men,      (She calls them “boys” and “mashers”)    I trot along the Mall alone;      My prettiest frocks and sashes    Don't help to fill my programme-card,      And vainly I repine    From ten to two A.M. Ah me!      Would I were forty-nine!     She calls me “darling,” “pet,” and “dear,”       And “sweet retiring maid.”     I'm always at the back, I know,      She puts me in the shade.     She introduces me to men,      “Cast” lovers, I opine,    For sixty takes to seventeen,      Nineteen to forty-nine.     But even She must older grow      And end Her dancing days,    She can't go on forever so      At concerts, balls and plays.     One ray of priceless hope I see      Before my footsteps shine;    Just think, that She'll be eighty-one      When I am forty-nine.     THE LOVERS' LITANY     Eyes of grey--a sodden quay,    Driving rain and falling tears,    As the steamer wears to sea    In a parting storm of cheers.       Sing, for Faith and Hope are high--      None so true as you and I--      Sing the Lovers' Litany:      “Love like ours can never die!”     Eyes of black--a throbbing keel,    Milky foam to left and right;    Whispered converse near the wheel    In the brilliant tropic night.       Cross that rules the Southern Sky!      Stars that sweep and wheel and fly,      Hear the Lovers' Litany:      Love like ours can never die!”     Eyes of brown--a dusty plain    Split and parched with heat of June,    Flying hoof and tightened rein,    Hearts that beat the old, old tune.       Side by side the horses fly,      Frame we now the old reply      Of the Lovers' Litany:      “Love like ours can never die!”     Eyes of blue--the Simla Hills    Silvered with the moonlight hoar;    Pleading of the waltz that thrills,    Dies and echoes round Benmore.       “Mabel,” “Officers,” “Goodbye,”       Glamour, wine, and witchery--      On my soul's sincerity,      “Love like ours can never die!”     Maidens of your charity,    Pity my most luckless state.    Four times Cupid's debtor I--    Bankrupt in quadruplicate.       Yet, despite this evil case,      And a maiden showed me grace,      Four-and-forty times would I      Sing the Lovers' Litany:      “Love like ours can never die!”     A BALLAD OF BURIAL     (“Saint @Proxed's ever was the Church for peace”)     If down here I chance to die,      Solemnly I beg you take    All that is left of “I”       To the Hills for old sake's sake,    Pack me very thoroughly      In the ice that used to slake    Pegs I drank when I was dry--      This observe for old sake's sake.     To the railway station hie,      There a single ticket take    For Umballa--goods-train--I      Shall not mind delay or shake.     I shall rest contentedly      Spite of clamor coolies make;    Thus in state and dignity      Send me up for old sake's sake.     Next the sleepy Babu wake,      Book a Kalka van “for four.”     Few, I think, will care to make      Journeys with me any more    As they used to do of yore.       I shall need a “special” break--    Thing I never took before--      Get me one for old sake's sake.     After that--arrangements make.       No hotel will take me in,    And a bullock's back would break      'Neath the teak and leaden skin    Tonga ropes are frail and thin,      Or, did I a back-seat take,    In a tonga I might spin,--      Do your best for old sake's sake.     After that--your work is done.       Recollect a Padre must    Mourn the dear departed one--      Throw the ashes and the dust.     Don't go down at once. I trust      You will find excuse to “snake    Three days' casual on the bust.”       Get your fun for old sake's sake.     I could never stand the Plains.      Think of blazing June and May    Think of those September rains      Yearly till the Judgment Day!    I should never rest in peace,      I should sweat and lie awake.     Rail me then, on my decease,      To the Hills for old sake's sake.     DIVIDED DESTINIES     It was an artless Bandar, and he danced upon a pine,    And much I wondered how he lived, and where the beast might dine,    And many, many other things, till, o'er my morning smoke,    I slept the sleep of idleness and dreamt that Bandar spoke.     He said: “O man of many clothes! Sad crawler on the Hills!    Observe, I know not Ranken's shop, nor Ranken's monthly bills;    I take no heed to trousers or the coats that you call dress;    Nor am I plagued with little cards for little drinks at Mess.     “I steal the bunnia's grain at morn, at noon and eventide,    (For he is fat and I am spare), I roam the mountain side,    I follow no man's carriage, and no, never in my life    Have I flirted at Peliti's with another Bandar's wife.     “O man of futile fopperies--unnecessary wraps;    I own no ponies in the hills, I drive no tall-wheeled traps;    I buy me not twelve-button gloves, 'short-sixes' eke, or rings,    Nor do I waste at Hamilton's my wealth on 'pretty things.'     “I quarrel with my wife at home, we never fight abroad;    But Mrs. B. has grasped the fact I am her only lord.     I never heard of fever--dumps nor debts depress my soul;    And I pity and despise you!” Here he poached my breakfast-roll.     His hide was very mangy, and his face was very red,    And ever and anon he scratched with energy his head.    His manners were not always nice, but how my spirit cried    To be an artless Bandar loose upon the mountain side!     So I answered: “Gentle Bandar, an inscrutable Decree    Makes thee a gleesome fleasome Thou, and me a wretched Me.    Go! Depart in peace, my brother, to thy home amid the pine;    Yet forget not once a mortal wished to change his lot for thine.”     THE MASQUE OF PLENTY     Argument.--The Indian Government being minded to discover the economic    condition of their lands, sent a Committee to inquire into it; and saw that it    was good.     Scene.--The wooded heights of Simla. The Incarnation of    the Government of India in the raiment of the Angel of Plenty    sings, to pianoforte accompaniment:--     “How sweet is the shepherd's sweet life!      From the dawn to the even he strays--    And his tongue shall be filled with praise.       (adagio dim.) Filled with praise!”     (largendo con sp.) Now this is the position,                      Go make an inquisition                      Into their real condition                        As swiftly as ye may.                   (p) Ay, paint our swarthy billions                      The richest of vermillions                      Ere two well-led cotillions                        Have danced themselves away.     Turkish Patrol, as able and intelligent Investigators wind                    down the Himalayas:--     What is the state of the Nation? What is its occupation?    Hi! get along, get along, get along--lend us the information!    (dim.) Census the byle and the yabu--capture a first-class Babu,      Set him to file Gazetteers--Gazetteers...                     (ff) What is the state of the Nation, etc., etc.     Interlude, from Nowhere in Particular, to stringed and Oriental    instruments.     Our cattle reel beneath the yoke they bear--      The earth is iron and the skies are brass--    And faint with fervour of the flaming air      The languid hours pass.     The well is dry beneath the village tree--      The young wheat withers ere it reach a span,    And belts of blinding sand show cruelly      Where once the river ran.     Pray, brothers, pray, but to no earthly King--      Lift up your hands above the blighted grain,    Look westward--if they please, the Gods shall bring      Their mercy with the rain.     Look westward--bears the blue no brown cloud-bank?      Nay, it is written--wherefore should we fly?    On our own field and by our cattle's flank      Lie down, lie down to die!                             Semi-Chorus             By the plumed heads of Kings                            Waving high,            Where the tall corn springs                            O'er the dead.             If they rust or rot we die,            If they ripen we are fed.             Very mighty is the power of our Kings!
