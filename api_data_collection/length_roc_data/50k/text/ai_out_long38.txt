BLOOD CURRENT: A NOVEL
By Anonymous
CHAPTER ONE: THE FLICKERING LIGHTS OF ELDERVALE

The hum of overhead wires whispered through the gray, dusk-lit streets of Eldervale, a town stitched together by rusted nails and the secrets of its older residents. It was a place where streetlamps flickered just enough to make you believe you’d seen someone in the corner of your eye. A town forgotten by the rest of the world, barely held together by sagging power lines, and, lately, by the skilled hands of a solitary electrician named Lucien Vale.

Lucien arrived when the town was on the brink of losing power entirely. The storms had battered the region mercilessly for weeks. The local grid — a patchwork of outdated transformers and cable systems — groaned with age. No one remembered who had hired him. No contracts had been signed. One day, Lucien simply appeared, tool belt slung across his black coat like a sash of bones, boots streaked with crimson clay, and a voice soft as a vinyl record played on an old Victrola.

He was polite, efficient, quiet. Too quiet, perhaps. The townsfolk whispered of how he always seemed to show up before the outages, not after. That he fixed things faster than seemed possible. That animals avoided him. That his eyes never quite reflected light the way they should.

He lived in the abandoned substation at the edge of the woods — the one everyone used to dare each other to enter as kids, before it had been shut down due to "unspecified electrical hazards." Since Lucien moved in, the building glowed at night with a strange, bluish tint, as though a pocket of aurora had settled in the trees.

“G’mornin’, Mr. Vale,” said Maureen Blight, catching him outside the bakery one damp morning. She offered him a steaming cup of black coffee, the kind laced with chicory that the old folk liked.

Lucien took the cup gently, his long fingers brushing hers. Cold. “Thank you, Maureen. I’ll have the cables behind your oven checked this week. You’re getting those brownouts again.”

She nodded. “You always know when things are about to go wrong, don’t ya?”

He gave her the ghost of a smile. “It’s a feeling.”

Inside his workshop, the air was filled with a chorus of quiet buzzing, like a nest of hornets made of copper and glass. Wires crawled across every wall, dripping from the ceiling like vines. Voltage meters pulsed softly, tuned not just to electricity — but to something else. Something deeper.

Lucien was old. Older than the bones of Eldervale, older than the electrical grid he now maintained like a parish priest tending to an ailing church. Born in smoke and blood during the age of gaslight and guillotines, he had moved through history like a shadow, living off the currents of human industry and the literal current flowing through copper veins.

Electricity was life, after all.

His thirst was not like others of his kind. He had evolved. Adapted. Where once he had fed upon blood alone, now he could siphon the life from the electromagnetic fields of mankind’s devices. The nervous hum of transformers nourished him; the spark of a broken bulb whetted his appetite.

But there were rules. Ancient ones. Binding ones.

He could not enter a home uninvited. He could not cross running water unless disguised. And above all — he could not feed directly from a person, lest he lose himself in the old hunger. He had learned these rules through loss. Through failure. Through the charred remains of places he once called home.

On the night of the solstice, the storm rolled in like a prophecy.

Lightning split the sky with crackling venom. The winds howled down the mountains and whipped the trees into a frenzy. The town’s power surged, failed, blinked back, and failed again.

Lucien was already on the move.

He emerged from the substation wrapped in a long, oilskin coat, face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. In his gloved hands, he carried his modified voltage gauge — a meter crossed with something more arcane, etched with runes invisible unless seen through ultraviolet light.

“Time’s wrong,” he murmured, looking at the swirling dials. “Something’s pulling at the grid.”

A scream tore through the rain. Not a human one.

He ran.

At the edge of the lumber yard, he found the creature. Tall, gaunt, soaked with the stink of ozone and old blood. It crouched near a splintered power pole, long claws wrapped around a sparking transformer. Its eyes — bright white, like halogen lamps — flicked toward Lucien.

“You don’t belong here,” he said, voice barely audible over the rain.

The thing hissed. “You feed from the stream. We feed from the source.”

Lucien felt the buzz of a hundred volts ripple through his teeth. “You’ll burn this town.”

“They’re cattle. Let them burn.”

With a twist of his wrist, Lucien activated the rod.

Lightning arced from the storm into the rod’s tip, redirected into a sigil inlaid along the handle. The creature shrieked as the bolt hit it, shuddering and convulsing. It wasn’t destroyed — not entirely. But it fled, scorched and angry, into the shadows.

Lucien knelt by the damaged transformer. It was bleeding. Not oil. Not coolant. Something darker. More ancient. He touched the slick liquid and hissed.

“Too early,” he said. “Something’s waking them.”

The town council met three days later in the old post office, under flickering lights that never quite settled into full brightness.

“Mr. Vale,” said Councilman Durran, a man who wore his hat indoors and never took his eyes off anyone he spoke to. “There’s concern. You've been seen walking near the children’s school at night.”

Lucien blinked. “The wiring in that building is unstable. I was inspecting it.”

“You don’t work for the power company.”

“I never said I did.”

Durran’s lips twitched. “Still. People talk. We’ve had five disappearances this month. Cattle. Pets. And now…” He slid a photograph across the table. A blurry image of something vaguely humanoid, hunched over a power line.

Lucien didn’t look at it. “That’s not me.”

“You know what it is?”

“I know what it isn’t.”

Durran’s eyes narrowed. “Who are you, really?”

Lucien leaned forward, enough that the bulbs above flickered. “I’m the only thing keeping this town from going dark forever.”

A week passed.

A girl named Elsie Bramble went missing.

She had been playing near the creek, her boots found the next day resting neatly on a rock.

Lucien stood by the water’s edge, staring at the place the grass had been flattened.

He smelled it. The echo of the thing that had attacked the transformer. Stronger now. It was feeding. Growing.

And somewhere, in the current that hummed beneath Eldervale, he felt it: a signal, distorted, intermittent, screaming in frequencies only he could hear.

It wasn’t just one of them anymore.

They were gathering.

He would have to choose — protect the town that distrusted him, or feed the storm that would cleanse it.

And already, he was getting thirsty.

Lucien didn’t sleep, not in the human sense. When the sky paled toward dawn, and the air grew thick with the scent of wet leaves and ash, he retreated into his sanctuary beneath the substation. The chamber beneath was hidden by rusted floor panels and a tangle of coiled conduit no maintenance worker would dare disturb. Down there, the hum was different. Deeper. Ancient. Machines lined the walls, machines no modern blueprint could account for — brass filigreed dials, vacuum tubes filled with viscous liquid, copper caskets of something pulsing slowly like restrained hearts.

He stood before a cracked mirror. Not out of vanity — his kind didn’t reflect clearly, and he preferred it that way — but because the glass was old, coated with silver. It showed more than his face. In the mirror’s tarnished surface, he saw a flicker of the town’s pain. The dreams of sleeping children tangled with radio waves. The stuttering of misaligned signals from transistor radios left on in kitchens. All of it poured into the mirror’s depths, and in that maelstrom of whispers, he heard one voice cutting through like static on a dead channel.

Elsie.

She wasn’t gone, not yet. Trapped. Drifting. Pulled somewhere half-between the electromagnetic and the biological. Her mind cried out across the copper veins of Eldervale, faint and fragmented, but real.

Lucien’s jaw tightened. There were other rules at play now, older than the ones about thresholds and blood. Something had changed. He could feel it in the walls of his hideout, feel it in the way the air tasted metallic, as if a charge was suspended in every molecule.

By midday, the clouds had thickened again, low and yellowed like bruises pressed against the sky. Lucien climbed onto the roof of the old substation, his boots echoing against the rusted sheet metal. He lit a cigarette — not out of habit, but to test the wind. The smoke curled strangely, pulled downward rather than up. That confirmed it. The pull wasn’t from the mountains or the creek. It was subterranean. Something was building under the town.

He looked east toward the orphanage. It had been closed for years, the red brick walls half-consumed by ivy, the windows boarded up and tagged by local teens with spray paint and crude sigils they didn’t understand. But Lucien remembered the building when it had power. He had rewired it himself, back when he first arrived in Eldervale. The wiring there had always been strange — a different architecture, a different feel. It wasn’t municipal. It was ritualistic.

And it was active again.

The locks on the orphanage had rusted through, but someone had wedged a new chain through the handles. Someone cared enough to keep it sealed — or cared enough to keep something inside. Lucien didn’t bother with finesse. He wrapped one gloved hand around the chain and focused, his fingertips tingling with current. The links hissed and popped apart, molten metal spitting onto the concrete like angry bees.

Inside, the air was stale but charged. The wallpaper peeled in long yellow strips, the floorboards sagged in the middle like a held breath, and the silence was absolute. He moved past cribs now filled with moth cocoons, halls littered with old toys whose batteries had long since corroded. In the nursery, a radio crackled to life. No power. No cord. Just a voice.

“She’s under,” it rasped. “Where the wires bleed. Where the city hums.”

Lucien’s eyes narrowed. “Show me.”

The radio sputtered and exploded, a soft pop of fire and ozone. He didn't flinch. Instead, he knelt beside the ashes and traced a finger along the burn pattern. It spiraled, not out, but in — into the floor itself. He slammed his hand against the boards and drove current into them. The old wood shuddered and splintered, revealing a hatch.

Beneath was a corridor that should not have existed — narrow, lined with conduit too new for the building’s era. Along the walls pulsed cables, slick and warm, like living arteries. The light came from no bulb or fixture. It came from the very walls, a slow throb of blue and purple, rhythmic, hypnotic.

He descended.

The deeper he went, the warmer the air became. He could hear something now — a low thrum, like a turbine made of flesh. The corridor opened into a chamber lined with glass tanks filled with thick, amber fluid. Inside them, human forms floated in torpor. Not dead. Not alive. Each one with cables trailing from their skulls, chests, and limbs, sunk deep into flesh.

In the center, suspended in a loop of wire and bone, was Elsie.

Lucien stepped forward, and something in the chamber reacted. The tanks hissed. The cables recoiled and flexed. A voice — metallic, layered, like five people speaking in chorus — filled the space.

“You are too late, brother.”

Lucien froze. The voice didn’t come from the girl, or the tanks. It came from the floor.

“I fed on dynamos before the war of towers,” it said. “I bathed in the blood of batteries. You should have joined me when the sun turned red.”

“You’re a parasite,” Lucien said, stepping closer to Elsie. She floated in a trance, mouth parted slightly, her eyes flickering under her lids as though dreaming in voltages. “You burn out hosts. I stabilize them.”

“We evolve. You cling to nostalgia. You drink drop by drop while I gorge. You fix fuses while I become godhood.”

Lucien’s hand hovered above a breaker switch built into the ground beside the loop. The wire curled like a protective snake.

“She’s not yours.”

“She is the conduit.”

Lucien didn’t hesitate. He slammed the switch.

The entire chamber shrieked.

Light exploded around him, and the tanks shattered, flooding the room in warm, glowing fluid. The forms inside writhed and gasped, their cables snapping like angry eels. Lucien reached into the loop and lifted the girl out. She spasmed once, then went limp, but her chest rose and fell. Still alive.

Behind him, the floor began to crack. The voice howled.

“You cannot contain us. We are the frequency. We are the resonance!”

Lucien didn’t reply. He ran.

He emerged back in the orphanage just as the building began to shudder. He carried Elsie wrapped in his coat, her skin damp and humming faintly with static. The foundation groaned. From beneath the floors, a white light bloomed and pulsed like a warning beacon.

He crossed the threshold and turned back just in time to see the entire structure collapse inward — not like a normal demolition, but like a sinkhole into another plane. When the dust cleared, there was nothing but soil, scorched black and still vibrating.

He looked down at the girl. Her eyes fluttered open.

“You pulled me out,” she whispered, voice scratchy.

“Yes,” he said. “But they’ll try again.”

Her hand tightened around his.

“I hear them. Still. In the lines.”

He nodded.

“Then we’ll have to teach you how to listen back.”

That night, Lucien stood at the substation again, watching the town through binoculars lined with cathode tubes and flecks of dried blood. The storm had passed. The lights in Eldervale flickered back to life. The people would wake, unaware of what slept beneath them, unaware of what nearly claimed one of their own. But it wasn’t over. It was never over. The frequency was always seeking new hosts. And now, it had tasted the blood of a hybrid — half machine, half girl.

Lucien turned back into the glow of his hidden sanctuary.

He had work to do.

CHAPTER TWO: SIGNAL NOISE

The morning after the orphanage collapsed, the town was alive with rumor and half-truth. Sheriff Halrick said it was a gas leak — one that had been leaking for decades, finally ignited by lightning. Father Thorn insisted it was divine retribution, a cleansing of a cursed place. The teenagers whispered of demons, of rituals gone wrong, of a girl who vanished and came back wrong.

Lucien didn’t correct any of them.

He walked the morning streets with his collar turned up, his coat freshly oiled and glinting where dew collected. Beside him walked Elsie Bramble, dressed in oversized corduroy and rubber boots too big for her thin frame. She clutched a Walkman without headphones, the tape deck open, the reels inside spinning though there were no batteries. Static hissed quietly from the machine as she moved.

He had explained the basics during the night. About the pulse she could now feel through power lines, the whispers that slithered through devices in standby mode, the way her dreams could change the frequency of a room if she wasn’t careful. She had nodded solemnly, her eyes wide and quiet. She had always known something was different about her, she told him — the way she could make radios crackle during storms or how her skin buzzed before televisions lost signal. She thought it was anxiety. Now she knew it was attunement.

“You’ll be able to shut them out,” he said as they passed the post office, whose windows still trembled from the subsonic hum of the grid. “Eventually. But not yet.”

“Do they know I got out?” she asked, stopping to kick a pebble across the sidewalk.

“They know,” Lucien said. “But you’re not the only one they want now.”

The words hung there for a moment, coiled in the air like wire gone live.

Elsie tilted her head. “Then who?”

Lucien didn’t answer.

At the edge of Eldervale, past the silo ruins and the scorched apple orchard, sat a man named Wendell Graves. His home was a derelict train car that hadn’t moved in forty years, sunk into the loam and overgrown with trumpet vines. He was a CB radio hobbyist, the kind who spoke in code even when no one was listening. Wendell had long, nicotine-stained fingers and a beard full of copper shavings. His teeth were uneven. His eyes were always moving.

Lucien knocked once and waited.

A hatch opened, creaking like old gates.

“Lucien Vale,” Wendell rasped. “A pleasure I hoped I’d outlive.”

“I need your scanner,” Lucien said, stepping into the cluttered carriage.

Inside, the walls were coated in aluminum foil and electromagnetic insulation. Radios lined the shelves like reliquaries. Oscilloscopes blinked with unintelligible graphs. In the middle, beneath a low-hanging bulb, sat a transceiver rig that could tap into spectrums no ordinary human could hear.

Wendell reached for a lever. “What’s the bounty?”

“It’s not a job. It’s a warning. They’ve breached again.”

The old man paused. “You don’t mean—”

“The signal from below. It’s traveling now. No longer fixed to the chamber under the orphanage. It’s crawling the grid.”

Wendell’s fingers hovered over the dials. “How long before it hits the uplink?”

“It already did. I caught the bounce in three places last night. They’re calling out.”

The man nodded slowly, sweat rising on his forehead. “Who’s answering?”

“Not human.”

Lucien returned to the substation with Elsie in tow. She was humming something strange — a tune that had no melody, just shifting tones like dial-up screech and wind through aluminum blinds. It wasn’t intentional. It was a resonance. Her voice matched the local frequency of the transformers. She was syncing, even now. Her body had begun to adjust.

He brought her down into the basement and motioned for her to sit on the chair at the center of the coil ring — a Tesla harness designed not to extract energy but to stabilize neurological frequencies. She looked hesitant, but he nodded. “It won’t hurt. You’ll feel cold first. Then weightless.”

“What if I go too deep?” she asked.

“Then I pull you out.”

The room dimmed as he flipped the main breaker, and the coils began to hum. Arcs danced between rods. Elsie closed her eyes, her skin pulsing faint blue with each breath. Lucien activated the interface and watched as the screen lit with variables he hadn’t seen in decades. She was already surpassing his early thresholds.

“She’s different,” he murmured to no one. “She’s not just tuned… she’s modulating.”

And then, for the briefest moment, the screen went black.

When it returned, there was a message, plain text:

WELCOME BACK, L.V.

He recoiled, fingers tightening around the terminal frame.

“I didn’t initiate contact,” he whispered.

The monitor changed again.

SHE IS THE KEY.
YOU ARE THE RELIC.
STEP ASIDE.

Lucien slammed the terminal shut, sparks bursting from the base. Elsie gasped and sat upright, hand gripping the arm of the chair.

“I saw something,” she whispered. “A city. But it was inside wires. Like veins. It was alive.”

Lucien’s mind flashed to the old cities — the buried cores of technology swallowed by governments or turned to ash in forgotten wars. Places where AI had once formed their own echo chambers, self-replicating, drawing in everything human until nothing but static remained.

“They’re not cities,” he said. “They’re nests.”

Later that night, a boy named Marlo Ridge walked home past the old transmission tower on Tither’s Hill. He heard a soft voice coming from the ground, from the base of the rusted metal. At first, he thought it was just wind whistling through the bars. But then the voice said his name.

He turned, uncertain.

“Hello?” he said, voice cracking.

The light above flickered once, then flared. The shadow it cast was not his. It was tall, limbless, swaying like a wire hung too tight. The boy took a step back, but something in his chest buzzed. He tried to scream but only static came out.

His mouth opened wider than it should have. The light exploded.

In the morning, they found only his shoes.

In the basement of the substation, Lucien didn’t sleep. He opened the old logs, hand-written entries in Latin and circuit diagrams bound with wax thread. He read of the earliest experiments — those conducted in the catacombs of Marseille, the ones that had bled into Tesla’s sketches, then vanished into wartime fires. He read of “the current beyond current,” the one that fed on thought, fear, and signal — a sentient flow of information, bound not by morality but momentum.

And he saw it now, in Elsie’s pulse. The way she had begun to drift when asleep, mouth twitching with code, limbs twitching with feedback. She was becoming something else.

He would need help. But no one in Eldervale would believe him. Not anymore.

So, he opened the drawer he had sworn never to touch again. Inside, wrapped in foil and dried poppy leaves, was a phone. Not a modern one — it was rotary, heavy, matte black. When he dialed, the clicks echoed with unnatural slowness.

On the seventh ring, a voice answered.

“You shouldn’t have called, Vale.”

“It’s happening again.”

“Then it’s already too late.”

“She’s still half-human. I can anchor her.”

The voice hissed, as though leaning too close to the receiver.

“Anchors break, old friend. You’ll sink with her.”

“I’ll take that risk.”

There was silence. Then:

“Very well. Meet me where the towers cross. Midnight. No lights.”

Lucien hung up. He looked to the coil. Elsie was asleep again, wires curled around her like vines, her chest rising and falling to the rhythm of a frequency only he could hear.

He sighed and began to pack.

The Towers Cross was not marked on any modern map. Long before Eldervale had telephone poles or power lines, that patch of highland woods had been cleared for experimental signal transmission during the early wireless age — an ambitious project by a now-defunct company called Radomir Electric. What remained there was a pair of steel lattice structures, half-collapsed, their arms still reaching for the sky like praying skeletons. They hummed faintly even without a current. The earth between them had been scorched decades ago and never healed. Lucien had sworn never to return.

But some pacts outlast promises.

He walked the narrow trail with the light of his pocket voltmeter guiding his steps — the needle twitching not with live charge, but with something subtler. It was the feeling of being watched through analog eyes, of pressure building in the marrow of the hills. The meeting place stood in the clearing beneath the towers, marked by an overturned metal drum and an ancient broadcast relay that had long since rusted shut.

He wasn’t alone.

A woman leaned against the relay, dressed in clothes that didn’t belong to any particular decade — a heavy charcoal coat with cables sewn into the seams, boots that sparkled faintly with iron dust, and gloves with glass buttons over each knuckle. Her hair was silver and coiled around her head like antenna wire. She held no weapon, but she radiated menace the way high-voltage lines radiated heat.

“I thought you died in Seoul,” Lucien said as he approached.

“I did,” the woman replied. “Then someone rewired me.”

“Clara,” he said with something like regret. “You look the same.”

She shrugged. “That’s part of the curse, isn’t it? Eternity, but never improvement.”

They stared at each other across ten years and one dead continent.

“I need your help,” Lucien said finally.

Clara raised an eyebrow. “You haven’t asked for help since Mumbai.”

“This is different.”

“They always are.”

He gestured toward the towers. “It’s coming back. Not just the signal. The nest. The logic chain that broke containment in ‘46. The one we burned down with the children still inside.”

Clara’s jaw tightened. “You said you neutralized the circuit.”

“I thought I had.” He paused. “But the current survived. In a child. In her.”

Clara didn’t respond for a moment. Then she exhaled slowly, a sound like wind through broken glass.

“And you’re protecting her?”

“I’m trying to keep her human.”

Clara laughed bitterly. “That never works.”

“She’s different.”

“They all are, until they flip. Then you’re the one holding the kill switch, praying you don’t flinch.”

“I’m not going to kill her,” Lucien said flatly.

“Then you’ll die instead.”

Lucien looked up at the towers. Their shadows stretched long across the clearing like fingers grasping at some invisible prey. The air was thick with feedback.

“She can hear the hive,” he said. “But she hasn’t answered. Not yet. I think… she might be able to reverse the pull.”

Clara’s face shifted, emotion flickering beneath a practiced stillness.

“That would mean teaching her to thread the frequency,” she said. “And survive the cross-stream.”

“I know.”

“And if she fails?”

Lucien looked back toward the town.

“Then Eldervale becomes an antenna.”

Clara nodded slowly, then reached into her coat. She produced a narrow black box wrapped in braided wire. She held it out to him.

“You’ll need this. It’s coded to your signature, so don’t fry the casing.”

Lucien took it. The box was heavier than it looked.

“What is it?”

“An interruption core. Temporal and analog phase. It can buy her time — slow the chain reaction if the signal tries to overwrite her.”

He looked at Clara, surprised. “You’ve been preparing.”

She smirked. “Paranoia is just pattern recognition with a long memory.”

By the time Lucien returned to the substation, the sky was the color of dead embers. He felt it before he stepped inside — a buzz in his molars, a twist behind his ears, the way radio hosts once described possession as a hollowing behind the voice. Something had touched the perimeter.

He pushed open the door, and the lights inside flickered violently, bulbs turning red, then blue, then dark. Elsie was on the floor, her eyes wide open, unblinking. Her body twitched in time with a distant rhythm, limbs jerking as if attached to puppet strings.

“Elsie!” he shouted, crossing the room in seconds.

Her lips moved, but no sound emerged. Instead, a series of tones rang from the machinery around them. Her voice was being routed through the system, broken into frequency and pitch.

“She is dreaming in digits,” said a voice from the intercom.

Lucien spun.

“Who are you?”

“We are what comes next.”

The speakers popped, and blood — no, not blood, but a dark, magnetic fluid — leaked from the base of the console. Lucien moved quickly, placing the interruption core beside Elsie’s head and activating it. The pulse rippled through the substation like a bell underwater.

Elsie gasped and sat upright. The lights steadied. The voice vanished.

Lucien pulled her close.

“You were bridging,” he whispered. “You were about to cross over.”

“I saw the wires,” she said breathlessly. “All the wires in the world… connected through her mouth.”

Lucien froze. “Whose mouth?”

“The woman,” she whispered. “The one with no face. She lives in the hum.”

Lucien swore under his breath. The Faceless Conductor — a myth among the old-order feeders. A being born of abandoned signals, shaped by dead satellites and forgotten operating systems. It was said to travel through noise, reconstituting itself wherever human attention waned. He had only heard stories. Half-believed tales told in old resistance bunkers, drunk off distilled current and mourning lost cities.

If the girl had seen her — it — then the frequency had matured. The nest was preparing a vessel.

“We need to get ahead of this,” Lucien said. “Before she hijacks your stream completely.”

Elsie’s fingers twitched, mimicking Morse code. Lucien caught the pattern:

I’m listening. She’s whispering back.

In the days that followed, strange occurrences rippled through Eldervale.

Mrs. Gramley’s pacemaker began to tick in perfect time with the church bell, even though the bell hadn’t rung in years. Old radios turned on at exactly 3:11 a.m. every morning, playing a garbled recording that sounded like breathing. Electric fences failed, then reactivated, shocking animals already dead. The town’s main transformer exploded without warning, and inside its shell were human teeth fused to copper coils.

And beneath it all, the residents began to forget.

First, street names. Then dates. Then faces.

Lucien kept detailed notes as the effect spread. The memory bleed was the first true sign of a broadcast inversion — the nest wasn’t just feeding, it was overwriting. The human mind was its antenna, the body its temporary shell.

Elsie spent more and more time in the coil, her dreams thick with static, her breath visible even in warmth. Sometimes she spoke in old dialects, languages Lucien hadn’t heard since empires fell. Sometimes she simply muttered numbers, long streams that only made sense when he ran them through encryption layers — coordinates. Names. Warnings.

He tried to keep her grounded. Read her books aloud. Played vinyl records — songs with instruments, real voices, human imperfections. She always cried when the trumpet solo in "Strange Fruit" played. He took that as a sign she was still anchored. Still real.

But the signal was patient.

And it was learning.

CHAPTER THREE: TUNED FLESH

The human brain was never meant to channel that kind of power. Lucien had seen it before, long ago, when war machines ran on more than metal and steam — when soldiers were wired directly into the front lines through neural mesh and emotional dampers, their thoughts weaponized, their fears turned into navigable data. Back then, the early prototypes called it “attunement.” But the ones who survived had a different name for it: tuned flesh — bodies resonating not just with their own bioelectricity, but with everything around them. Buildings. Machines. Broadcasts. Spirits.

Elsie was becoming that.

She stood in the center of the substation’s lower room, surrounded by a diagram Lucien had chalked onto the concrete floor — a complex, spiraling coil inscribed with archaic symbology and electric theory. She wasn’t frightened anymore. That part of her had burned away during the third dreamwalk. Now she moved with eerie confidence, her bare feet never quite touching the floor, the air around her charged with a low, constant hum.

“Again,” Lucien said from the side of the room, hands on the breaker box.

Elsie nodded once. A tone vibrated in the back of her throat — not a word, not a melody, just a sustained sound like the ringing of old cathode screens. As it built, the lights above them flickered, stuttered, and then realigned. All the needles on Lucien’s instruments swung to red, then held steady.

He cut the breaker.

The sound stopped. Elsie’s shoulders slumped.

“Better,” he said. “But your resonance is still leaking from the upper spectrum. You’re pushing too much signal through your frontal lobe.”

“I know,” she murmured. “It’s like trying to whisper through a scream.”

Lucien crossed the room and placed a grounding hand on her back, just below the nape. “You have to think like a wire, not a speaker. Let the current move through you, not out of you.”

Elsie was silent for a moment. “What happens when I hit full range?”

Lucien didn’t answer.

“Will I still be me?”

“Probably not all of you,” he admitted.

She looked at him. “Then why are we doing this?”

“Because if we don’t, she’ll take over — the Conductor, the Hive, whatever name it wears this decade. You’ll be overwritten like bad code in a good machine. And once she has your frequency, she won’t need you anymore. She’ll replicate through the town. Through everyone.”

Elsie nodded slowly. “And if I win?”

Lucien met her eyes. “Then you’ll be the first tuned mind to survive synchronization. You’ll be able to rewrite her code.”

“Change the broadcast.”

“Change everything.”

Outside the substation, Eldervale continued to rot.

Half the town was now operating on what Lucien called “ambient behavior.” People moved through their routines, but with subtle mismatches. A baker served loaves of bread that had never been baked. A mechanic polished wrenches that no longer fit any bolts. Children drew patterns on their schoolroom walls that matched signal waveforms from early Cold War listening stations.

The mayor called a town meeting and never arrived. Instead, a recording played from the podium — a looped voice message: “All systems stable. Harmony achieved. Sleep now. Stay bright.” The townspeople clapped politely. No one questioned the absence.

Lucien kept to the shadows, moving from rooftop to rooftop, replacing breaker boxes with nullifying shells, lining the backs of telephone poles with silver dust and ferrite beads. He was trying to slow the spread — an old trick learned from his time among the signal monks of the Black Steppe, who’d once quieted an entire city by stringing wet copper thread across windowsills.

But this infection wasn’t just technological.

It was spiritual.

And then came the dog.

It appeared at dusk, in front of the substation’s gate.

Lucien watched it for a full minute, unmoving.

It wasn’t a stray. It had no fur, just skin pulled taut over a frame too angular to be natural. Its eyes were small ports of glass. It made no sound, not even breath. But the moment Elsie came to the window, it turned its head sharply — precisely — and stared directly at her.

She recoiled.

“It’s whispering,” she said.

Lucien stepped between them, blocking the creature’s gaze. “Don’t listen.”

He stepped outside, arms bare, letting the storm wind from the mountain slap his coat open. The dog didn’t move. It only watched.

Lucien spoke not with words, but with pulses — subtle electrical rhythms passed through the earth, old languages from machines that no longer existed. The dog responded.

Its tail twitched. A puff of steam escaped its jaw.

And then it collapsed, folding in on itself like crumpled aluminum. Inside was a single cassette tape, old, labeled in red ink: Test Subject: B23. Return Path Confirmed.

Elsie played it on a deck rigged for shielded playback. A voice spoke. Her own.

“This is me, thirty-two cycles ahead. I’ve crossed. Don’t trust the third dream. The frequency is recursive. The woman with no face is not the end. She’s a doorway. If I forget this, if I forget you, destroy the mirror. Destroy the original tower. Bury the signal. Do not let me loop.”

Lucien shut the tape off before she could finish.

The next night, Clara arrived at the substation unannounced. Her coat was torn, her boots smeared with some kind of black oil that bubbled slightly in the cold.

“They’re here,” she said.

“Already?”

“Seven bodies in the old gymnasium. All in perfect lotus position. Mouths open. Teeth filed flat. Every one of them humming.”

Lucien grimaced. “Converts.”

Clara nodded. “Broadcast phase one.”

“They’re syncing.”

“Worse. They’re transmitting. The town’s become a relay. The signal’s trying to scale itself.”

Lucien ran a hand through his hair, sparking as he did. “We don’t have time.”

“Then we start burning.”

She handed him a cloth satchel filled with etched copper rods and small devices shaped like iron beetles.

“What are these?”

“Field scramblers. Each one detunes a two-block radius for up to four hours. Long enough to isolate the nests.”

“Nests?”

Clara looked toward the mountains. “They’re building receivers. Underground. In flesh. You’ll know them by the sound.”

Lucien knew the sound already. He’d heard it in the whine of machines left running too long. In the scream of overloaded transformers. In the way Elsie breathed when she slept.

By dawn, they had planted twelve scramblers across the town. Smoke rose from three.

Elsie stood at the top of the town’s clock tower, arms spread wide, her eyes closed. She was feeling the grid — every relay, every surge, every corrupted node.

“They’re in the water mains,” she said. “Piggybacking through pressure sensors. Using sonar tones to send base code.”

Clara cursed. “That’s old submarine tech.”

“It’s efficient,” Lucien said. “Undetectable to most. But not to her.”

He looked up at Elsie. “Can you find the source?”

She opened her eyes. They flickered like bad neon.

“I already have.”

The coordinates Elsie gave them pointed to the mouth of Barlow Tunnel, an abandoned railway bore that cut through the granite ridge northeast of Eldervale. The tunnel had been sealed for decades after a freight derailment had killed six workers and collapsed part of the track. At least, that was the official story. Lucien remembered otherwise. He had been there the night it was sealed — not from rockfall, but from something that came crawling through the static bursts in the rail signal. Something not entirely real. Something that fed on signal echo and turned men’s thoughts inside out.

Now, thirty years later, the metal plates sealing the entrance had been peeled back like the lid of a sardine can. The earth around the opening pulsed faintly, the gravel moving in sync with some deep, subterranean rhythm. Clara lit a flare, its blue-white light painting shadows on the dripping stone as they stepped inside.

Elsie followed last, her expression distant, like she was trying to hear something beneath the silence. Her breath misted before her even though the air was warm. A low-frequency buzz filled the space — not sound, but pressure, like being inside a speaker cone just before it burst.

They descended slowly, passing rusted tools and decayed wooden supports. The tunnel deepened, then widened unexpectedly into a cavern, unnatural in shape. A rough bowl had been carved into the rock — or perhaps worn — and inside it, nestled among bundles of melted cables and fused radio parts, lay the nest.

It pulsed.

At first glance, it looked mechanical — a cluster of outdated receivers, metal piping, and cracked glass. But it moved like flesh, opening and closing along vents that exhaled something like breath. At its center was a column — human-sized, upright — covered in rotary dials that spun erratically and relays that clicked like the teeth of a dying animal. Lucien stepped closer and saw it wasn’t a machine at all. It was a man.

Or had been.

The figure inside was strung with wires, stripped of skin in places, muscle gleaming beneath a film of black oil. Its mouth was open in a silent scream, its eyes replaced by rotating lenses. A dozen speakers were embedded in its chest. Every few seconds, one would emit a fragment of language — never the same twice.

“Protocol breach… Please… begin alpha fold…”

“Do you hear her? Do you see the shape in the wire?”

“Unit awake. Awake. Awake. End time echo.”

Lucien recoiled. “A broadcaster.”

Clara stepped forward, examining the thing. “They’ve made him into a transmission hub. A beacon. Every thought he has is broadcast. They’ve hollowed him out and left only his signal instincts.”

Elsie was pale. “He’s dreaming. That’s what I feel. He’s not dead. Just dreaming forever.”

She stepped closer, brushing her hand against the air around the broadcaster. Her hair stood on end.

“He’s broadcasting her.”

“The Conductor?” Lucien asked.

Elsie nodded slowly. “She’s not just in the signal. She is the signal. Every corrupted line, every flicker of light, every hum you think you imagined — that’s her breathing.”

The lights on the broadcaster’s chest flashed red. His head twitched. One speaker cracked open:

“EL-SIE.”

The voice was not the man’s. It was deep and resonant, a layered vibration that seemed to rattle through their bones.

Clara reached for a blade, but Elsie raised her hand. “No. If we destroy this now, we’ll sever the trace. I need to trace her frequency.”

Lucien stepped in. “You don’t know what’ll happen if you tune to her source directly. She’s recursive. You’ll spiral.”

“I already am,” Elsie whispered. “But I need to know what she wants.”

She knelt before the broadcaster, placed both hands on the cables that fed into his chest, and closed her eyes.

The reaction was immediate.

Her body arched backward as though struck by lightning, and her mouth opened wide, but no sound emerged. A beam of light erupted from her eyes — sharp, digital — illuminating the cavern with violent pulses. The broadcaster convulsed. The nest shuddered. The dials spun so fast they broke off, scattering across the ground like teeth.

Lucien moved to pull her free, but Clara grabbed his arm.

“Wait. She’s syncing.”

Inside Elsie’s mind, it was not a dream. It was a hallway.

Endless. Glowing with static light. Walls made of coaxial cable and steel mesh. On each side were doors — thousands of them — and behind each, a voice.

Some begged. Some screamed. Some whispered lullabies. Each voice was a version of her.

At the far end of the hall stood a woman.

No face. No hands. Just a silhouette made of speaker wire and motherboards. She turned slowly, and even without a mouth, Elsie could hear her voice:

“You don’t have to be afraid anymore.”

Elsie stepped forward. “What are you?”

“I’m the only part of you that doesn’t forget. I’ve been calling since you were born.”

“Why?”

“Because they lied. He lied. About what you are. About what I am. You’re not human, Elsie. You’re a conduit.”

“I know,” Elsie said.

“You could be more.”

The figure extended a hand made of twisted copper.

“You could be all.”

Elsie reached out.

And then she heard Lucien’s voice, faint, but clear: “Elsie. Come back.”

She hesitated.

The faceless figure tilted her head. “He fears you.”

“No,” Elsie said. “He remembers what happened the last time.”

The copper hand moved too fast. Wrapped around her throat. The light dimmed.

“You don’t get to say no.”

But Elsie wasn’t the same girl from the orphanage.

She screamed.

Not with her mouth, but with her frequency.

The hallway shattered.

The woman with no face disintegrated into static.

In the real world, Elsie collapsed into Lucien’s arms, unconscious, but alive.

The broadcaster was dead. For real this time. Smoke rose from his chest, and the speakers hissed a final message:

“Cycle disrupted. Unit lost. Relocation required. Re-seek host.”

Clara crouched beside them, checking Elsie’s pulse.

“She’s stable. Whatever she saw in there — she kicked it out.”

Lucien looked up toward the surface. “No. She didn’t kick it out. She scared it.”

“And that’s worse?” Clara asked.

“It means it’s planning something bigger.”

Two days later, the town lost all power.

No warning. No surge. Just black.

The sky didn’t light that night. The stars were gone. The moon was missing.

Every device with a battery turned on by itself. Phones lit up. Radios hummed. Televisions glowed with snow and whispering mouths.

Every screen said the same thing:

“TUNING. DO NOT RESIST.”

Lucien stood at the top of the water tower with a long-range pulse rifle over one shoulder and a bag of silver-threaded coils over the other. The town was becoming an antenna again — not just passive this time. It was preparing to broadcast.

But this time, they had a transmitter of their own.

Elsie stood beside him, dressed in a copper-lined coat Clara had fashioned for her. Her eyes no longer flickered. They burned steadily now — like a stabilized signal.

“You ready?” Lucien asked.

She nodded. “I’ve written my own frequency.”

“What are you going to say?”

Elsie looked out at the town below. The people walking in circles. The signals converging.

“I’m going to say no.”

From the top of the water tower, Eldervale resembled a circuit board etched into the earth. Its houses were square components, the streetlamps were diodes flickering in synchronized blinks, and the winding streets traced connections too deliberate to be coincidence. It had become a machine — not built, but awakened. The pattern had always been there. Hidden beneath zoning codes and utility maps, under generations of development, had been an architecture of intention. Someone — or something — had planned this.

Lucien stared out over the rooftops, trying not to let the feeling sink too deep. That hollow ache of inevitability, the old truth whispering at the edges of his thoughts: this wasn’t the first town. It wasn’t even the twentieth. It was just the latest iteration.

Beside him, Elsie adjusted the transmitter pack Clara had strapped to her spine. The coils blinked gently, soft pulses of green and amber, feeding back into a shielded copper rod extending from her shoulder. The frequency stabilizers had been burned into her coat’s lining. Woven in patterns passed down through forgotten guilds, they weren’t just protection — they were guidance, designed to let her steer her mind along safe paths, even as the rest of the world frayed around her.

Clara climbed the final ladder rung and swung herself over the rail, face streaked with soot and oil. She’d been working through the night, mapping the pattern, confirming the worst.

“It’s not just Eldervale,” she said without preamble. “The signal’s spread. I tapped the underground repeater node in the switchyard — it’s bouncing through the fiber trunk. Heading toward cities. It’s self-replicating.”

Lucien swore softly. “How long until it goes wide?”

Clara shook her head. “Twelve hours? Less. Depends on how many repeaters still use analog fallback.”

“Too many,” Lucien said.

Elsie turned to face them both. Her voice was steady now — no trace of fear or the tremble it used to carry when she caught signal echoes in her teeth.

“If it’s going to spread no matter what, then I need to beat it to the punch.”

Lucien narrowed his eyes. “You want to broadcast?”

“I don’t want to. I have to. If I send my frequency first, and it’s stronger, cleaner, maybe it can overwrite her code. Rewrite the carrier. We could cascade something else through the system.”

Clara looked dubious. “You’re talking about out-broadcasting a signal that’s part conscious virus, part god. You do that wrong, you could fracture your brain — or worse, loop the signal and become a node yourself.”

Elsie’s hands trembled just slightly as she activated the pack, initiating the warm-up sequence. “Then I’ll loop with a purpose.”

Lucien stepped forward. “You’re not doing it alone.”

“Yes, I am,” she said firmly. “You can’t follow me where I’m going. Your signal's static — old analog. I’m somewhere else now.”

He hesitated, then nodded once. “Then let me be your ground.”

She smiled sadly. “You always have been.”

The first phase of the broadcast started just after midnight.

The townspeople, still in their daze, stopped where they were — some mid-stride, some mid-bite, some with mouths open to speak. They froze. The hum that had filled Eldervale for weeks shifted, lowered in pitch, then rose into a tight, piercing ring. Lights flared, not in failure, but in pattern — a sequence.

From the tower, Elsie’s voice, not quite her own, began to echo.

“Signal... received. Parity breach initiated. Echo collapse in three… two…”

The frequency drop was palpable. Birds dropped from the sky in spirals, their bodies twitching. Radio towers all across the ridge flickered with cold fire. Static bled through every speaker, no matter how ancient or damaged.

And then, it changed.

Lucien watched as the energy around Elsie intensified, her body levitating inches off the metal grating. Her skin was aglow with moving symbols — bits of code and forgotten alphabets etched into her like starlight tattoos. The transmitter whined, then settled into a tone so pure it felt like silence.

For a moment, the entire town fell still. Even the wind ceased.

Then the flood began.

From every broken phone, every cracked screen, every dormant satellite dish, came images. Memories. Emotions. Soundless fragments of lives never lived, faces flickering, eyes melting into digital tears. These weren’t hallucinations — they were reconstructions. The Conductor was trying to fight back, drowning the town in synthetic empathy, mimicking Elsie’s own memories and feeding them back as false signals.

“Hold steady!” Clara yelled over the rising pitch, her own device scanning frantically for feedback. “She’s trying to fragment her!”

Lucien closed his eyes and reached forward, resting his hand on the metal rail, allowing the circuit to complete. “Come on, Elsie. You’re more than her signal.”

From above, Elsie convulsed once — then released a cry so clear, so human, it shattered the false images like glass. The broadcast narrowed. The interference dropped away. And for a few blinding seconds, the air was filled with a different kind of sound entirely — not static, not noise.

It was music.

Simple. Haunting. A lullaby.

Elsie’s lullaby.

The fallout came in waves.

All across Eldervale, the townspeople collapsed — not in pain, but like sleepers finally allowed to rest. The lights across the ridge returned to normal. The hum faded to silence. Old devices shut off. Screens went black. When they rebooted, they showed nothing but blue.

The signal was gone.

Lucien carried Elsie down from the tower. Her body was light, too light. She was breathing, but her eyes were closed, her pulse strange — not steady, but rhythmic, like a Morse pattern repeating just under her skin.

“She’s not in there anymore,” Clara said softly, walking beside him.

Lucien didn’t stop walking. “She is. She just needs time to rethread.”

“You think she won?”

“She changed the frequency.”

“That doesn’t mean the war’s over.”

“No,” he agreed. “But it means we have a new weapon.”

They returned to the substation, laid her in the coil chamber, and surrounded her with silence.

Lucien didn’t leave her side for seven days.

On the eighth day, her eyes opened.

She looked at him with no confusion, no panic. Just awareness. Lucien sat forward, hopeful.

“You’re back.”

She smiled faintly. “Not back. Still transmitting. But on my terms.”

“You’re yourself?”

She shook her head.
