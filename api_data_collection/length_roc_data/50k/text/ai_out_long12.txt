Title: Grease and Smoke

Chapter One: The Last Bolt

The wrench slipped with a metallic clang, scraping Jonah’s knuckle raw. He swore, low and bitter, then wiped the blood on his oil-stained jeans. The Chevy Caprice in front of him—black, sun-faded, and dented—was a lost cause, but he couldn’t give up. Not yet.

Jonah Grady had been a mechanic in the town of Ashwick for seventeen years. Long enough to watch the buildings peel and the people leave. Long enough to lose track of which rusted cars he’d fixed and which he’d buried under scrap. He ran "Grady’s Garage" alone since Pop passed. No customers today—just the wind rattling the tin roof and the ever-dripping coffee machine hissing in the background.

He sighed, looked at the cracked clock above the parts shelf—3:42 PM—and pushed the wrench back into the engine.

“Goddamn carb’s choked up,” he muttered. “Just like this town.”

From the corner of the garage came a sudden clatter.

He turned fast. “Hello?”

Silence.

Then: a slow crunch of gravel outside.

He stepped out, wiping his hands with a rag, squinting into the afternoon haze. A woman stood there, lean and taut like a tensioned wire. Leather jacket, dusty boots. A cigarette dangled from her fingers, unlit.

“You Grady?” she asked.

“Yeah. What’s it to you?”

She didn’t smile. “I need an engine rebuilt. Not fixed. Rebuilt. And I need it fast.”

Jonah studied her face. There was something sharp in her eyes, like she wasn’t used to asking for help.

“Depends what’s wrong with it,” he said.

She tossed him a set of keys. “You’ll see.”

The truck was parked two blocks down, she said. Left it idling, which was crazy, but he didn’t argue. As he walked, he turned the keys in his hand. The fob had no markings. Just plain black plastic. The kind of thing you got when you didn’t want anything traceable.

He found the truck—a battered, matte-gray Ford F-150. The engine was knocking like a death rattle. He shut it off and popped the hood.

Inside was a mess. But not just mechanical. There was something off—parts replaced with aftermarket pieces that didn’t belong. Wires that had been cut and rerouted. Jonah frowned. This wasn’t just a rebuild. It was a cover-up.

When he walked back to the garage, the woman was leaning against the wall, arms folded. Her eyes flicked toward him.

“Well?”

“This ain’t a job,” Jonah said. “It’s a goddamn jigsaw.”

“I’ll pay.”

“How much?”

She named a number. Jonah blinked.

“Cash?” he asked.

She nodded.

“What’s in it for you?”

She took a long time before answering. “Closure.”

Her name was Maeve. No last name, or if she had one, she wasn’t sharing. Said she was passing through. Said the truck belonged to her brother.

“Used to,” she added.

Jonah didn’t press.

That night, he stayed late in the garage, cigarette burning in the ashtray, fingers black with grease. He opened the truck’s engine wide, deeper than most mechanics would dare. He needed to understand what he was fixing—and why.

He found a small black box wired into the ignition system. Not standard. Not even close. Jonah had seen something like it years ago, when a Homeland Security van came in busted and they asked no questions. This was military-grade. Tracking, maybe. Remote kill switch.

He put it on the bench and stared at it.

Next morning, Maeve was there before he opened.

“You found it,” she said.

“You knew it was there?”

“I hoped.”

“You wanna explain?”

She leaned against the wall. Her face was paler than yesterday. Less guarded.

“My brother ran with people he shouldn’t have. Government folks. Off-the-books kinds. The truck... it’s a loose end.”

“Loose end they wanna tie up?”

“Something like that.”

Jonah felt his skin prickle. He wasn’t built for cloak-and-dagger. He built engines, fixed clutches, cussed at brakes. But the way Maeve looked at him—like he was the last thing standing between her and whatever hell was coming—he couldn’t say no.

He nodded toward the bench. “You want me to take it out?”

Maeve hesitated. Then nodded.

He started pulling the wires.

The men came on the third day.

Black Suburban. No plates. Three men in suits who didn’t introduce themselves.

Jonah met them outside, arms crossed.

“You Grady?”

“Who’s asking?”

“Where’s the truck?”

Jonah spat. “Sold it.”

The man in front smiled without humor. “That’s unfortunate.”

They didn’t search the garage. Just handed him a card with no name, no number. Just a red circle printed on the front.

“Call if you remember anything.”

After they left, Jonah found Maeve in the back, crouched behind an oil drum. Her hands were trembling.

“We need to finish this,” she said.

“We?” he said, but it came out weaker than he wanted.

By the fifth day, the truck’s engine was stripped and clean. Jonah had replaced everything suspect. The box was in a lead-lined crate under the floorboards. Maeve made calls in hushed tones, sometimes stepping outside, sometimes disappearing for hours.

She told him about her brother, Liam—brilliant, reckless, doomed. Recruited out of MIT. Worked on things he wasn’t allowed to talk about. When he tried to leave, they made sure he didn’t.

“They said it was a car crash,” she said.

“But it wasn’t?”

She shook her head. “I got this truck two days after the funeral. No note. Just keys in the mail. I know he left something in it. Something they want.”

Jonah looked at the half-assembled engine. “You think it’s in there?”

“Not anymore,” she said, and smiled. It was the first time she had.

On the seventh day, they ran.

The truck roared to life, smoother than it ever had. Jonah packed a duffel with tools, instinct more than thought. Maeve drove. The town faded behind them in the rearview mirror.

“You sure about this?” he asked.

“No,” she said.

But they didn’t turn back.

Somewhere in Arizona, they stopped at a rest stop. The desert stretched wide and mute. Jonah sat on the hood, watching the sun bleed into the mountains.

“You ever think about just... letting it go?” he asked.

Maeve didn’t answer. Just lit a cigarette.

He didn’t push.

Behind them, the truck clicked softly as it cooled. Inside the glovebox, beneath a false bottom, was a hard drive.

Jonah hadn’t asked what was on it. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.

But whatever it was, it had been worth killing for.

And now it was theirs.

Maeve didn’t sleep that night. Jonah could hear her pacing the garage floor above his small cot in the office, bootsteps soft and irregular. He lay in the darkness, staring at the ceiling fan wobbling slightly as it spun. The engine had been rebuilt, the black box removed, and the wires rerouted so clean it looked like factory work—but there was a weight in the air that hadn’t left with the suits.

At dawn, Jonah walked out into the soft gray light, mug of coffee clutched in one hand, and found her outside, sitting on the truck’s tailgate. Her cigarette had burned to the filter without being smoked. She stared at the road like it might carry an answer.

“You know,” Jonah said, sitting down next to her, “you keep looking at that road like it’s gonna tell you something.”

Maeve didn’t smile. She rarely did. “It might. Eventually.”

He took a sip, let the heat roll through him. “I don’t think they’re done. The suits. That box—whatever it is—it’s part of something bigger. You don’t put a government tracker in a truck unless you’re scared of what’s in it.”

“I’m not scared of them,” Maeve said quietly. “I’m scared of what they think I have. That’s the difference.”

Jonah looked at her sidelong. She wasn’t built like someone who spooked easy. There was an edge in her—like rebar wrapped in leather. But everyone had limits. Even metal bent if you hit it just right.

“You ever think about just leaving it? Throw the damn box into a lake and vanish.”

Her jaw tightened. “And let them keep whatever it is they buried? No.”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he reached into his coat and pulled out the small black box. It felt heavier than it should have, dense with something unspoken.

“You’re not telling me everything,” he said.

Maeve exhaled slowly. “Would you believe me if I said I didn’t know everything either?”

“Try me.”

She stared down the road again, and for a while, he thought she wouldn’t answer. Then:

“My brother used to talk about leverage. He said the only thing more powerful than a gun was proof. Not evidence—proof. The kind that makes the bastards sweat before they start to deny it.”

Jonah rolled the box between his palms. “So what’s in here? Proof?”

“Maybe. I think it’s just a key.”

“To what?”

She shook her head. “That’s what I need to find out.”

The silence stretched between them. Jonah glanced at the sky. The clouds hung low, bloated with the promise of rain.

“If you’re dragging me into something deep, Maeve,” he said, “I’d like to know how far the bottom is.”

Her eyes flicked toward him. “That’s the thing about the bottom, Grady. You don’t see it till you hit it.”

Later that morning, Jonah drove the truck out to an old service road that led nowhere. It was where he tested rebuilt engines—a forgotten loop of pavement surrounded by pine and silence. Maeve sat beside him, map unfolded on her lap, but her eyes weren’t on it.

He pushed the truck harder than usual, listening for every whine, every shudder. But it held together. The rebuild had worked. He hadn’t lost his touch.

After two laps, he pulled over and killed the engine. The silence came roaring in.

“I need to go to Denver,” Maeve said suddenly.

Jonah raised an eyebrow. “That’s six hours from here.”

“Five if you drive like a lunatic.”

He looked at her, then at the truck. “You think whatever’s in that box connects to Denver?”

She nodded. “My brother’s last call came from there. Burner phone. Thirty seconds of static, then a name.”

“What name?”

She hesitated. “Halvorsen.”

The name meant nothing to Jonah, but it obviously meant something to her. Her voice had dropped half an octave when she said it.

“You think this Halvorsen has answers?”

“I think he has secrets. And if Liam trusted me enough to send me the truck, it’s because he knew they’d come for me eventually.”

Jonah didn’t answer right away. He looked at the cracked windshield, the old pine trees swaying just a little, and thought about the kind of life he’d had. Predictable. Quiet. And empty.

“All right,” he said finally. “But if we’re doing this, we do it smart. No more blind guesses.”

Maeve offered him a crooked grin. “I knew you weren’t just some grease monkey.”

“I am,” he replied. “Just a really cautious one.”

Back at the garage, Jonah packed a few essential tools—a torque wrench, a diagnostic scanner, his lucky flashlight with the duct-taped handle. Maeve worked on her end: burner phones, cash, a separate plate for the truck. She moved like someone who’d done this before.

As they loaded up the truck, Jonah stopped her with a hand on her shoulder.

“Maeve,” he said, “you don’t have to do this alone.”

Her eyes met his. For a second, the hardness in her expression cracked. “Neither do you.”

They pulled out of Ashwick as dusk settled, the sun melting into the horizon like rust bleeding through paint. The truck rumbled steady beneath them, rebuilt heart pounding like it knew it had a second chance.

Jonah looked once in the rearview mirror. The garage sat silent, the town already half-forgotten.

“You ever think we’re just replacing one set of ghosts with another?” he asked.

Maeve adjusted the mirror. “Depends if the new ones scream louder.”

They drove in silence after that, the road stretching long and dark ahead.

By the time they reached the Colorado border, it was after midnight. They stopped at a roadside diner called The Laughing Jackal—half the neon sign broken, the parking lot cracked with weeds. Inside, it was all formica tables and low yellow light. A woman with a smoker’s voice took their order without making eye contact.

Jonah poked at his burger. Maeve studied the room like it was a puzzle.

“Why’d you leave?” she asked suddenly.

He looked up. “Ashwick?”

“No. Your life. The world. You’re good. Sharp. You don’t belong in some ghost town under a pile of oil rags.”

He shrugged. “Pop got sick. Someone had to keep the garage open.”

“And after?”

Jonah gave a bitter smile. “After, I just kept fixing things that weren’t mine.”

Maeve didn’t push. She just nodded.

“You?”

She took a slow sip of coffee, her expression unreadable.

“Ran away from something,” she said. “Then started running toward something else. Haven’t figured out which direction was worse.”

The woman behind the counter lit another cigarette and turned up the radio. Old blues crackled through the speakers.

“You think we’ll make it to Denver without them catching up?” Jonah asked.

“No,” Maeve said. “But we’ll be ready.”

In a motel that smelled like mildew and old rain, Jonah lay awake staring at the ceiling. Maeve slept in the other bed, one arm under her pillow, the other curled tight to her chest like she was holding onto something only she could see.

He couldn’t sleep. The weight of the black box pressed on him, even though it sat in the glove compartment of the truck outside. Somewhere down the road was a man named Halvorsen. Somewhere down the road were answers.

But he wasn’t sure anymore if answers were what they really needed.

Maybe, he thought, they just needed to make it far enough that the past couldn’t follow.

Maybe.

The motel room held the staleness of long-dead conversations and a thousand dreams dried on linoleum floors. Jonah woke before sunrise, blinking against the amber streetlight filtering through the blinds. He sat up slowly, careful not to wake Maeve, and stared at the red LED of the alarm clock blinking 5:14. His back ached from the sagging mattress. He'd never been much of a traveler, but he was starting to understand why people stayed moving—because the second you stopped, your body reminded you just how broken it was.

In the bathroom, the water sputtered before running brown for a moment. He let it clear, then washed his face and stared at the mirror. The man looking back at him had crow’s feet and grease under his nails that wouldn’t come out no matter how hard he scrubbed. His eyes were tired, not from the drive, but from the weight of something he'd willingly carried once Maeve walked into his life.

She stirred when he came out, sitting up with a sharpness that said she didn’t sleep much either. Her hand went instinctively to her side, where she'd stashed a revolver between the mattress and the wall.

"You always wake up ready for a fight?" Jonah asked as he tossed her a plastic-wrapped danish from the vending machine downstairs.

She blinked the sleep away. "Only when I’m not sure what side I’m on."

He sat down on the edge of the bed. "You sure this Halvorsen guy’s even still in Denver?"

"No. But I know who to ask." She peeled back the wrapper and took a bite, chewing mechanically. "There’s a guy named Dobbs. Ran security with Liam years ago. Used to be a field op, then got bumped up to logistics. Liam always said Dobbs kept one foot in the system and one out."

"Sounds trustworthy."

Maeve smirked faintly. "Depends on what you're trading him."

Jonah leaned back, hands behind his head. "So what are we trading him?"

She looked at him, her expression turning flat. "Whatever he wants."

There was something bitter in her voice—not fear exactly, but something older. He didn’t press. Not yet.

They rolled out of the parking lot by 6:30, the sun cresting over the hills in a wash of gold that made the road look like it was burning. The truck hummed, steady beneath them, its rebuilt engine smoothing out the rattle it had carried when it limped into Ashwick. Jonah felt the vibration in his bones, familiar and grounding. He’d built this. With his hands, his knowledge, his sweat. There weren’t many things he was proud of anymore, but this engine was one of them.

Maeve navigated through the outskirts of Denver like she knew the layout by heart. They kept off main roads, winding through industrial zones and service lanes, until they reached an old meatpacking district that had been mostly abandoned, then partially reclaimed by artists and people who couldn’t afford better.

They stopped outside a two-story warehouse with painted-over windows and a rusting metal awning that read “WEISS FEED SUPPLY” in flaking white letters. Maeve killed the engine and turned to him.

"If anything goes sideways, you get back to the truck and wait five minutes. If I don’t come back, you leave."

Jonah frowned. "You expect it to go sideways?"

"I always expect it to. That way I’m never surprised."

He reached behind the seat and pulled out a crowbar. "Five minutes. Then I come in."

Maeve gave him a look that bordered on gratitude, then slipped out of the truck and walked to the side door like she owned the place.

Jonah waited. Every second scraped at his nerves.

Four minutes in, the door cracked open and Maeve emerged, motioning him inside.

The air in the warehouse was thick with dust and a strange smell—metallic, like blood or old copper pipes. A man stood near the back, balding, shoulders hunched, fingers twitching near the hem of a heavy coat. He looked like he’d been up all night and lost an argument with sleep.

“This is Dobbs,” Maeve said. “Dobbs, this is Jonah.”

Dobbs nodded slightly but didn’t offer a hand. His eyes kept darting toward the windows.

“Your brother was a smart guy,” Dobbs said, voice raw like gravel dragged across concrete. “Too smart. That was the problem.”

“What do you know about Halvorsen?” Maeve asked, stepping forward.

Dobbs shook his head. “I know he disappeared. Officially retired, moved to New Mexico. Unofficially, he’s deep in something. Private contracts, asset repurposing, black-bag stuff. And he’s been talking to someone from Citadel.”

Jonah furrowed his brow. “Citadel?”

Maeve answered for him. “A shell company. Government front for projects they don’t want traced. My brother mentioned it in his notes.”

Dobbs pulled a small envelope from inside his coat and handed it to her. “Last address I had on him. Storage unit off Alameda. You didn’t get it from me.”

Maeve opened the envelope and looked inside. Jonah saw a faded photograph and a folded slip of paper.

“Why are you helping us?” Jonah asked.

Dobbs looked at him and, for the first time, seemed to see him. “Because Liam helped me once. Pulled me out when a mission went sour in Caracas. I owed him.”

He turned to Maeve. “And because if you’re really going to poke this beehive, you should know—there’s no way to do it quiet.”

The storage facility was guarded by a keypad gate and a flickering streetlight. Jonah pulled the truck around back, where the fence had been peeled open like someone had done it before. Maeve keyed in the number from Dobbs’ paper, and the door to unit 117 rolled up with a grinding complaint.

Inside was darkness and cold. The place smelled like dust, old wood, and mildew.

They stepped inside together. Maeve clicked on her flashlight, and the beam caught rows of boxes, metal cases, and a single battered desk with a green banker’s lamp tipped on its side.

Jonah opened one of the cases. It was filled with photographs—overhead drone shots, documents with most of the text redacted. One photo was circled in red: a complex deep in the desert, barbed wire and motion sensors lining the perimeter.

Maeve flipped through a binder on the desk. “This is bigger than I thought.”

“Yeah?” Jonah said. “Because I’m starting to think we’re already in over our heads.”

She turned a page. “This facility—whatever it is—it’s where Halvorsen went after Liam died. Look.”

She held up a printed email, faded but legible. It was from an internal Citadel address, referencing an asset recovery operation linked to "Subject 213B" and the relocation of data from an unauthorized source.

“What the hell is Subject 213B?” Jonah asked.

Maeve didn’t answer. Her face had gone pale.

“This was about Liam,” she whispered. “He didn’t just die. They used him.”

Jonah felt something cold settle in his gut. “Used him for what?”

Maeve looked at the open case again, then at the folder of emails. “For whatever that box in the truck connects to. They implanted something. Tracked him. Maybe even controlled him. Jesus…”

Jonah stepped back, heart thudding. “You’re saying your brother was a test subject?”

She nodded slowly. “And we’re holding the evidence.”

At that moment, outside, they heard tires crunch gravel. Headlights cut through the slats in the unit’s door.

“Time’s up,” Jonah said.

Maeve stuffed the folder into her jacket. “We’ve got what we need. Let’s go.”

They bolted for the truck just as a dark van rolled into view, side doors already sliding open.

Jonah floored the engine, tires screaming as the truck tore out of the lot. Bullets cracked the rear windshield. Glass exploded into the cab. Maeve ducked, cursing.

“Guess we’re not quiet anymore,” Jonah said.

Maeve pulled her revolver and twisted in her seat, eyes wild.

“We were never supposed to be.”

The truck roared into the night, carrying them both away from the truth—and deeper into it.

Chapter Two: Burn Line

The sun was already high by the time they stopped driving. Jonah pulled the truck onto an overgrown service road shielded by juniper and mesquite, the engine ticking as it cooled under the midday heat. Maeve stepped out without a word and disappeared into the trees. She didn’t go far—he could hear the dry grass crunching beneath her boots as she paced, her breath uneven.

Jonah leaned against the hood, staring at the cracked sky through a windshield spiderwebbed from the night before. They’d been lucky. The bullets had torn the rear glass but missed the fuel line. The truck had made it, but it wouldn’t again—not without more work. He had maybe two hours before the radiator gave out completely.

He reached for his tool bag, hands moving by instinct more than thought. He didn’t need to be told what came next. They were in it now—knee-deep—and the only thing keeping them ahead of whoever was chasing them was four cylinders, a box of fuses, and whatever wiring miracle he could pull from rusted metal.

“Do you think they followed?” Maeve asked as she returned, her hair tied back, face still pale from the adrenaline dump.

“I’d say we bought a few hours. Maybe less. These guys don’t use roadblocks and sirens—they’re not lawmen. They’ll come quiet. They’ll wait for us to slow down.”

She crouched beside him. “Can you keep it running?”

Jonah glanced at the radiator. “I can do better. I can change the damn thing. If we find a salvage yard.”

Maeve unfolded the map she’d stolen from the glove compartment of a gas station two towns back. Her finger tapped a town ten miles east. “Siler Junction. I’ve been through before. One garage, maybe two. Worth a shot.”

He nodded, started packing his tools. “We go. But after that, you tell me the whole story.”

She didn’t respond, but she didn’t argue either.

Siler Junction was a gasping relic of a town where the bones of the Old West had long since been picked clean by tourists and neglect. Two stoplights, three churches, and a single mechanic shop named Tommy’s Fix-It. The sign was crooked, half the letters sun-faded to pink. A man sat outside under a faded awning, drinking what looked like sweet tea from a mason jar.

Jonah killed the engine and stepped out slowly, letting the man get a good look at them. Maeve stayed in the truck, her eyes scanning every storefront, every passing car, every window.

“You Tommy?” Jonah asked.

The man squinted. “Depends who’s asking.”

“I need a radiator. Something small. Ford F-150, '09.”

Tommy wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Got one in the back. Ain’t new.”

“I’m not picky. You got a jack, I’ll swap it myself.”

Tommy gave him a long look. “You look like someone who knows what he’s doing. You military?”

Jonah shook his head. “Just a mechanic. Been one my whole life.”

The old man stood, stretching. “Well then, come on. I’ll show you what we’ve got. But if you’re bringing trouble, I got no use for that.”

Jonah followed him, ignoring the sweat already pooling beneath his collar. In the back of the garage, amidst piles of rusted hoods and half-buried axles, they found what he needed. It would hold. Long enough, anyway.

He worked fast, keeping one eye on the road, the other on the job. Maeve stood a few yards away, arms crossed, her stance wide like someone ready to bolt or fight. He’d seen that posture before—marines returning home, waiting for the world to snap at them again.

“You wanna talk now?” he asked as he tightened the last bolt.

Maeve knelt down beside him. “I didn’t lie, Jonah. But I didn’t tell you everything.”

“Start with the name. Halvorsen. What was he to Liam?”

She nodded, staring at the gravel. “He was Liam’s handler. CIA offshoot, but private—hired through Citadel. He wasn’t just a boss. He ran the program.”

“What kind of program?”

Maeve hesitated. “They were working on neuromodulation. Targeted cognition mapping. Imagine being able to rewrite a person’s reflexes, implant behavior patterns without them even knowing. We’re not talking hypnosis or MK-Ultra stuff. This was chemical, surgical, digital.”

Jonah set the wrench down. “You’re saying your brother was... programmed?”

“Modified. It started as memory retention training, accelerated learning. Then came the implant. Data-collection, tracking. He volunteered. They told him it was experimental, but safe. And for a while, it worked. He could recite code strings after a single glance. He broke encryption that took teams months.”

“And then?”

“They stopped asking. They started telling. And he couldn’t say no.”

Jonah rubbed his hands on a rag, slow. “So the truck—what he sent you—it was evidence.”

“Not just that.” She reached into her jacket and pulled out the hard drive they’d found under the glovebox. “It’s everything. Project logs. Names. Procedures. Data from the implant. All copied before he went dark. And Halvorsen? He’s the only one left who can prove it was real.”

Jonah stood, stretched his sore back. “So we find Halvorsen. And then what? You think he’ll just confess? Turn himself in?”

“No. But he’ll want to live. He’ll deal. I just need to make sure what Liam died for doesn’t disappear.”

They left Siler Junction an hour later. The truck ran smoother, quieter. The engine purred like it remembered what it was meant to be. Jonah didn’t speak for a long time. The desert rolled by, slow and endless. He watched the road, and Maeve watched the horizon, her thumb brushing the edge of the drive like a prayer stone.

They were twenty miles from Denver’s outskirts when the air changed.

The sound came first—a low thrum, like distant thunder but steady. Then the glint of sunlight on metal in the rearview. Maeve turned her head sharply.

“Drone,” she said. “Military-grade. They’re tracking us.”

Jonah’s hands tightened on the wheel. “Can you jam it?”

“I can try.” She opened the glovebox, pulled out a wrapped bundle of wires and a small circuit board. “Give me ten seconds.”

The drone buzzed closer. Jonah saw it now—sleek, black, predatory. It veered, slowed above them.

Maeve connected the circuit board to a cigarette lighter converter, then switched a toggle. A low click echoed through the truck.

The drone flickered—literally. Its lights blinked, then it swerved erratically before shooting upward and vanishing behind a ridge.

Maeve leaned back, breathing hard. “EMP pulse. Short range. We only get one.”

Jonah didn’t take his eyes off the road. “Then we better make it count.”

The truck shot forward, engine roaring as he pushed it harder than ever. The line between pursuit and escape blurred, and every mile ahead felt thinner than the last. Somewhere out there was Halvorsen. Somewhere out there was the truth.

And behind them, the silence was not peace. It was the sound of something coming.

They didn’t stop again until dusk, pulling into the shell of an abandoned gas station just off Highway 285. The structure sagged like it had been waiting to collapse for a decade, half the roof caved in, the sign overhead barely clinging to its rusted frame. Maeve jumped out first, checking the perimeter with the practiced efficiency of someone who didn’t trust silence. Jonah followed slowly, stretching out his back with a wince as he scanned the empty road behind them. The drone hadn’t returned, and no vehicles had tailed them—not that he could tell—but the tension hadn’t eased. If anything, it had worsened, thickening with the knowledge that they were still being hunted, even if they couldn’t see the predators.

Inside, the gas station smelled of mildew and scorched rubber. Broken shelves were littered with ancient candy wrappers, cigarette butts, and shattered glass. Maeve found a relatively intact office behind the counter and pulled a chair into the corner, placing her backpack within reach. She sat down heavily, exhaling a long breath as if she'd been holding it since Siler Junction.

Jonah stood by the window, peering through a crack in the boarded-up pane.

"We can’t run forever," he said after a while.

"I know," Maeve replied, rubbing the bridge of her nose. "That’s why we stop running tomorrow."

"You have a plan?"

She nodded, though her eyes didn’t leave the floor. "Halvorsen isn’t in Denver anymore. He left weeks ago. But I know where he went."

"Let me guess—deep in the woods, off-grid, armed to the teeth?"

"Worse," she said. "He’s in the mountains. Private retreat. Used to be a communications station, long since gutted and converted. No internet, no phone lines, just shortwave and hardlines patched through encrypted relays."

Jonah sat down on the floor, arms draped over his knees. "So what’s our move? Knock on the door and ask him nicely to give us what we want?"

Maeve’s voice was steady. "We don’t ask. We make him talk. And we take whatever he has before they do."

There was a flicker of something in her eyes when she said it—not anger exactly, but something colder. It reminded Jonah of the engine he’d pulled apart in Ashwick, the pieces slick with oil and years of neglect. Whatever was driving Maeve wasn’t revenge. It was unfinished business buried so deep it bled rust.

"You said he ran the program," Jonah said. "What makes you think he’ll still have anything left?"

She looked up at him now. "Because he’s the only one arrogant enough to keep copies. He’s not scared of them. He is them."

Jonah leaned his head back against the wall. "And if he’s already handed it off? If we’re too late?"

"Then we burn it all down anyway."

They slept in shifts, if sleep could even be called that. Jonah dozed on and off, haunted by dreams of metal arms twisting from the dirt, gears grinding in place of human voices. Maeve stood watch until the early morning, staring into the blue-black dark like she could will the sunrise into coming faster.

By 5:30, they were back on the road, climbing steadily toward the Rockies. The landscape changed with every mile—flat plains giving way to winding inclines, pine and aspen creeping in where desert brush had ruled the day before. Jonah drove in silence, eyes fixed on the road, the hum of the tires the only constant. He felt the altitude in his lungs, the way the engine strained ever so slightly against the incline. The rebuilt radiator was holding, but barely.

Maeve unfolded a printed map across her lap, her finger tracing the route. "He’s near an old fire watch trail, east of Twin Lakes. We’ll have to hike the last two miles. There’s no way the truck makes it through."

"You sure he’s there?"

"Unless he’s dead. And if he is, the place will still have what we need."

Jonah grunted. "Sounds like a good place to bury the truth."

"Or people."

They stopped in Leadville for supplies. Jonah filled the truck’s tank and bought two packs of jerky, a jug of water, and a flashlight. Maeve picked up a thermal blanket and a roll of black tape. She paid in cash, careful not to speak more than a few words.

The mountains closed in around them as they drove higher. The temperature dropped. By the time they pulled off the main road and onto the gravel path Maeve had marked, it was late afternoon and clouds had begun to gather overhead, thick with threat.

The truck bucked and jostled over stones and washed-out ruts, the suspension groaning with each lurch. They finally reached a clearing wide enough to leave the truck hidden beneath the trees. Jonah shut off the engine and let the quiet settle in.

"We walk from here?" he asked.

Maeve nodded. "Two miles, give or take."

Jonah grabbed his pack and slung it over his shoulder. He caught her glancing back at the truck, eyes narrowed.

"You thinking we’re not coming back?" he asked.

"I’m thinking if we do, it’ll be a miracle."

They hiked in silence for the first mile, boots crunching snow-dusted gravel, breath fogging in the cold air. The trail narrowed into a rocky incline framed by tall pines that creaked under the weight of the wind. Jonah felt the ache in his legs quickly, but he didn’t complain. Maeve moved ahead with purpose, scanning every bend in the path like it might jump out and strike.

When they finally saw the edge of the compound, it looked more like a bunker than a retreat—low concrete walls embedded into the hillside, narrow slit windows, a steel door half-hidden behind brambles and frost. The place gave off a stillness that made Jonah’s stomach twist.

Maeve crouched behind a fallen tree, pulling binoculars from her bag.

"One camera," she murmured. "Old model. No movement."

"You think it’s empty?"

"No. Just quiet."

They waited until the sun slipped behind the ridge. Then they moved.

Maeve led the way, slipping between brush and snow patches, circling to the rear where an exhaust vent protruded from the hillside. It was old, rusted through, barely wide enough for Jonah’s shoulders, but she pointed at it like it was salvation.

"That’s how we get in."

"You sure about this?"

"No."

But she went first.

The vent led them into a narrow corridor lit only by the blinking red light of a maintenance alarm. The air inside was cold and dry, thick with dust. Jonah’s fingers closed around the crowbar in his pack, just in case. Maeve moved like she’d been in places like this before—silent, methodical.

They found Halvorsen in a side room. He was older than Maeve had described—gray at the temples, eyes sunken deep into a face that had once been sharp but was now drawn and hollow. He didn’t move when they entered. He was seated in front of an old CRT monitor, typing something slowly with one finger.

"You’re late," he said without turning.

Maeve leveled the revolver at his chest. "You know why we’re here."

"Of course I do," Halvorsen said, finally turning. His voice was calm, almost clinical. "You’re here for your brother’s files. For what’s left of them."

"You know they’re coming, don’t you?" Maeve said. "You know we’re not the only ones who found this place."

"They’ve always been coming," Halvorsen said. "But this time, they’ll burn it all. Including me. Including you."

Jonah stepped forward. "Then give us what we need before they do."

Halvorsen smiled, slow and bitter. "It won’t change anything. The truth only matters when people care. And people don’t care about shadows."

Maeve’s voice dropped, shaking. "He died for this. You killed him with your silence."

"No," Halvorsen said. "I killed him with obedience. The same thing that kills us all."

He reached under the desk slowly, pulled out a hard drive, and held it up.

"This is everything I have. The rest is already in the wind."

Maeve took it, her hands trembling.

"They’ll trace you," Halvorsen said. "As soon as you power that up. You’ll have hours, maybe less."

"Then we better get moving," Jonah said.

As they turned to leave, Halvorsen called after them.

"You think exposing the truth will fix anything? It won’t. But it might destroy more than you’re ready to lose."

Maeve didn’t answer. She didn’t look back.

They were already running when the first tremor hit.

From deep within the compound, a low, humming vibration surged through the floor. Jonah grabbed Maeve’s arm and pulled her down the corridor as lights exploded behind them, the old concrete walls beginning to crack and groan.

They barely made it through the vent before the mountain began to swallow its secrets.

Behind them, Halvorsen and everything he had built collapsed into silence.

And ahead, the night waited.

Chapter Three: Static Veins

They didn’t speak as they ran. The mountain groaned behind them like some dying god, and every step on the rocky path felt like borrowed time. Maeve led, her face slick with sweat despite the cold, her breath ragged. Jonah’s legs screamed with every downhill stride, but he kept pace. There was no choice. The hard drive Maeve clutched against her chest like a holy relic had already become more than data. It was leverage. It was Liam’s legacy. It was bait.

By the time they reached the truck, the night had swallowed the sky. Clouds loomed heavy and low, smothering the stars. Maeve climbed into the passenger seat without a word, the drive still in her hands. Jonah turned the key, and for a heartbeat nothing happened. Then the engine roared to life—hoarse, but ready.

They didn’t look back as they drove, didn’t wait for whoever might crawl out of the smoke behind them. Maeve wiped her face with the sleeve of her jacket and finally spoke.

"They burned it. Halvorsen must’ve had a trigger—self-destruct, failsafe, something built into the system."

Jonah nodded, eyes on the narrow, twisting road. "He didn’t want it falling into the wrong hands."

"Too late for that. We’ve got it."

"Yeah," Jonah said. "Which makes us the wrong hands now."

They drove in silence for nearly an hour, passing through ghost-towns and half-lit truck stops. Jonah’s knuckles were white against the steering wheel. Every taillight in the distance looked like a target. Every engine behind them sounded like it was following.

Finally, they pulled into a desolate campground just south of Fairplay, tucked against the treeline. Jonah killed the engine and killed the headlights. The only illumination came from the dull silver sheen of the moon through thinning clouds. They both sat in the cab for a few minutes, breathing, still too wired to call it rest.

"You think they’re still chasing?" he asked.

Maeve shook her head slowly. "Not chasing. Predicting. They’ll know where we’re headed, not where we’ve been."

"Which means we don’t go where they expect."

She turned to him. "Then where?"

He leaned back, staring through the cracked windshield at the sky. "Somewhere no one wants to go. Somewhere off-grid. You ever hear of Donnor’s Hollow?"

Maeve frowned. "Sounds like a place you’d name a horror movie after."

Jonah gave a weak smile. "Exactly. Old mining town, wiped off maps in the ‘80s. Used to be a gold rush site, then a uranium claim. When the feds pulled out, the locals stayed behind until even they gave up. Now it’s just mountains and dust. My dad took me there once when I was a kid. It’s the last place anyone would look, because there's nothing left to take."

Maeve considered. "You think we can power the drive out there?"

"Depends. If I can jury-rig a converter, maybe. But we won’t have time to analyze everything."

She hesitated, then reached into her coat and pulled out a small notebook, pages worn and corners frayed. She handed it to him.

"Liam’s notes," she said. "Everything he couldn’t put on a drive, he wrote here. Passwords, server keys, safe points. If there’s a way to decrypt the files without tripping any alerts, it’s in there."

Jonah opened the book carefully. The handwriting was tight and precise, each word etched with care. There were sketches of chip diagrams, code fragments, and an odd line of poetry at the bottom of one page:

    A spark inside the vessel hums,
    The static veins will always run.

He frowned. "Was he always this poetic?"

"Only when he was afraid. He used metaphor to hide the truth. That line—‘static veins’—he used it to describe the neural threads they implanted. The interface that connected the subject’s mind to the hardware. His veins were the circuit."

Jonah shut the notebook. "So whatever’s on this drive—it isn’t just files. It’s a blueprint for how they built him."

Maeve’s voice turned quiet. "And how they broke him."

The road to Donnor’s Hollow wasn’t marked. Jonah drove by memory, squinting through fog that seemed to grow thicker with each mile. The truck struggled against the incline, tires slipping on gravel. At last, they crested a ridge and saw it below: a cluster of leaning wooden buildings, many collapsed, all silent. A rusted water tower stood watch over the wreckage, its legs bowed inward like a dying animal.

Jonah parked near what used to be the general store. The roof had caved in, but the side room remained intact. They cleared it quickly, then set up inside.

Maeve unpacked the hard drive and laid it on a folding table Jonah had rigged from old boards and a toolbox lid. He connected it to a backup laptop he’d brought from the garage—ten years out of date but tough as hell. The laptop hummed, screen flickering to life.

Maeve sat beside him, tension vibrating off her. "Try the first password in the notebook."

Jonah typed it in.

Nothing.

He tried the second.

The screen blinked. A prompt appeared: USER AUTH RECOGNIZED. ACCESS PROTECTED. RETINA VERIFICATION REQUIRED.

Maeve cursed. "I didn’t think... Liam must’ve locked it to his biometrics."

Jonah stared at the screen. "Is there a bypass?"

"Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on whether he used a hardware token or just encoded a retinal image."

Jonah leaned back, exhaling through his teeth. "So we’ve got the key, but no door to put it in."

Maeve stood abruptly, pacing. "Unless…"

He watched her carefully. "Unless what?"

She turned. "Unless we fake it."

Jonah stood. "You’re talking about cloning a retinal pattern? That's not something you do with duct tape and a soldering iron."

"No. But I know someone who can do it. Problem is, she’s in New Mexico. Santa Fe. And if I contact her, there’s a 70% chance she’s compromised."

Jonah raised an eyebrow. "Only seventy?"

Maeve didn’t smile. "We don't have other options. She used to work with Liam. Before everything fell apart."

"Then call her."

Maeve pulled a battered burner phone from her pack, stared at it a moment, then stepped outside. Jonah heard the buzz of signal trying to connect, the nervous staccato of her pacing just beyond the wall.

He sat in the quiet, staring at the flickering prompt on the laptop. The mountain wind moaned through the hollow buildings like a warning.

Fifteen minutes later, she came back in.

"She’ll meet us," Maeve said. "But we only get one shot. She’s spooked."

Jonah shut the laptop gently. "Then let’s not waste it."

They drove again at dawn, leaving behind the ruins of Donnor’s Hollow. The hard drive was hidden in the truck’s floor pan beneath a false cover Jonah had installed during the night. The route to Santa Fe was long and dangerous. They stayed off major roads, looping through valleys and ghost highways, sleeping in the cab when they couldn’t keep their eyes open any longer.

On the second night, they stopped at a ranger’s outpost turned museum, now closed for the season. Maeve barely touched her food. She sat at the edge of the overlook, feet dangling over rock and shadow.

"You still sure about all this?" Jonah asked, handing her a bottle of water.

She nodded without looking. "I didn’t come this far to quit now."

He sat beside her. "You came this far because you loved your brother. But what if this ends up being bigger than that?"

Maeve turned to him. "Then we make it matter."

Behind them, the wind whispered through the trees. Somewhere in the distance, the static veins were still running.

They rolled into Santa Fe under cover of night, the desert city alive with quiet motion—neon signs humming above closed cantinas, empty buses rumbling past shuttered galleries, wind chimes clinking softly from adobe porches like metallic whispers. The sky had that purple-black depth only found in places where the horizon stretched for miles. Jonah stayed hunched over the wheel, careful to obey every traffic signal, every stop sign. Paranoia wasn’t paranoia anymore—it was strategy.

Maeve directed him to an old laundromat on the outskirts of town, nestled between a pawn shop and a boarded-up florist. The sign above the door read Spin Cycle in chipped blue letters, though none of the lights were on inside. Jonah pulled the truck around back, where a battered Toyota sedan sat parked under a flickering security lamp. Maeve was already out of the cab before the engine was off.

“She’s inside,” she said. “Give me two minutes. If I don’t come out, drive away.”

“Not happening,” Jonah said flatly.

She looked at him, the kind of look that usually ended arguments. But this time, she just gave a short nod and disappeared through a side entrance marked EMPLOYEES ONLY.

Jonah waited, eyes scanning the street, fingers drumming on the steering wheel. Two minutes. That was the deal. Just two.

At two and a half, the door creaked open and Maeve emerged with a woman in tow—tall, mid-forties, hair clipped close to the scalp, wearing a baggy denim jacket and mirrored aviators despite the hour. She carried herself with a confidence that wasn’t showy, but dangerous. The kind that came from knowing too much and surviving anyway.

Maeve climbed into the passenger seat without a word. The woman climbed into the back and looked directly at Jonah.

“You’re the mechanic,” she said, voice smooth but tired.

“That’s what they tell me.”

She handed him a small black pouch. “Inside’s a portable biometric emulator. Custom firmware, multi-spectral lens. Give me Liam’s notes and ten minutes, and I can build a close-enough retinal sequence.”

Jonah started the engine and pulled away from the laundromat. “And what do you want in return?”

The woman smiled faintly. “To be left alone. After this, I disappear. You do your thing, I do mine.”

Maeve glanced back. “Her name’s Carmen Reyes. She used to run field ops for Halvorsen before she walked.”

Jonah glanced at her in the rearview mirror. “Walked?”

Reyes chuckled dryly. “I was supposed to clean up one of their test subjects. A girl—sixteen. Implant degraded, brain hemorrhaged, seizures every hour. She’d written Liam’s name over and over in a journal. I left the door unlocked instead.”

Maeve reached into her coat and handed over Liam’s notebook. “Page thirty-nine. He left some kind of retina hash. Embedded in a sketch.”

Reyes flipped through the book, nodding. “Yeah. This’ll do.”

They drove to a small motel on the city’s edge, the kind of place where no one asked for ID and the rooms still had analog TVs chained to the nightstands. Jonah paid cash and parked the truck at the far end, under a broken security light. Inside, Reyes laid her equipment out across the room’s scarred desk—lens modules, a soldering pen, a flask-sized processor that looked like it had been patched together with spare parts and black market tech.

Jonah watched her work, impressed despite himself. She moved with purpose, hands steady, muttering under her breath as she calibrated the lens. Maeve sat by the window, gun in her lap, eyes fixed on the parking lot.

“This’ll only get you one pass,” Reyes said, never looking up. “Once you connect this emulator to the drive, it’ll ping the internal verification system. If it accepts the hash, it’ll start decrypting. If it doesn’t... well, the drive might fry itself. Or call home.”

“And calling home means?” Jonah asked.

“Citadel gets a little red flag that says someone poked the bear. They don’t like being poked.”

Maeve turned from the window. “How long until we’re ready?”

“Five minutes,” Reyes replied. “Maybe ten. Depends on whether Liam’s drawing is as smart as he thought it was.”

She pulled a fiber-optic cable from her kit and connected it to the drive, then activated the emulator. A thin blue light scanned across the lens. The laptop screen lit up with cascading lines of code—no prompt this time, just raw system diagnostics.

“Looks like your brother was smarter than most,” Reyes said. “It’s accepting the signal.”

Jonah leaned closer. “How long until the files open?”

“That’s the good news,” she said. “Bad news is, they’re encrypted across six partitions, and half of them are rigged to wipe if accessed incorrectly.”

“Then don’t access them incorrectly.”

She gave him a look. “You think I haven’t done this before?”

Maeve tensed. “Someone’s outside.”

Jonah moved to the window, peering through the edge of the curtain. A black sedan had pulled in, lights off, engine idling.

“Company?”

“Looks like it,” Maeve said, rising to her feet.

Reyes didn’t flinch. “You’ve got maybe four minutes before they come knocking.”

Jonah reached for the drive. “Can we move it?”

“Not now,” Reyes hissed. “If we unplug it mid-sequence, we’ll lose everything.”

Maeve checked her weapon. “Then we hold the line.”

Jonah positioned himself by the door, gripping a crowbar he’d tucked in his coat earlier. It wasn’t elegant, but it made a point.

Reyes muttered curses under her breath as code scrolled faster. The laptop beeped once—sharp, metallic.

“That’s one partition down,” she said. “Come on, Liam, you beautiful bastard…”

A knock at the door. Not hard, but not friendly.

Jonah didn’t move. Maeve flattened herself against the wall beside the window, her revolver cocked.

A voice came through, muffled. Male, smooth. “We just want to talk. No one has to get hurt.”

Reyes kept working. “That’s always how it starts.”

Jonah glanced at Maeve. “Options?”

“Go out the bathroom window. Climb the fence behind the laundry room. That’s our out.”

“You gonna shoot your way through?”

“Only if they make me.”

The kn
