Chapter One: The Window Rolls Down

The Ferrari’s window slid down with a purr that barely whispered over the ocean breeze. Scarlet metal, polished to the sheen of sin, gleamed under the lowering sun. The driver, a woman with a scar like lightning down her jawline, let the engine idle as she stared out at the beach. Her fingers, long and knuckled with tension, drummed lightly against the steering wheel.

“Luca,” she said.

From the passenger seat, the man flinched. He was young—maybe twenty-four—his jeans too clean, his face too eager, too sharp. He looked over. “Yeah?”

“You sure you want to do this?”

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he looked ahead at the figure standing alone at the shoreline. The man wore white, barefoot in the sand, hands tucked behind his back like he was attending a funeral. His name was Dimas Vale. And Luca had waited three years to see him again.

“I’m sure,” Luca said.

The woman turned her head slowly. Her eyes were pale blue, like beach glass. “Then go. Say what you need to say.”

The Ferrari hissed as he opened the door. Gravel crunched beneath his boots. He walked—tense, shoulders bunched like he expected to get shot before he reached the water. But Dimas didn’t move.

“Hey,” Luca said when he was within earshot.

Dimas turned. His face had aged. Grey curled in his temples. But the eyes were still the same: deep, unreadable, half-asleep. “You shouldn’t be here.”

“That’s a hell of a thing to say.”

“You came all this way to get insulted?” Dimas’s voice was smooth, but not cruel. Not yet. “Go home, kid.”

“I want to talk,” Luca said. “About my sister.”

The ocean spat up a foamy wave, licking at Dimas’s feet. He sighed. “Not here. Not with them watching.”

Luca frowned. “Them?”

Dimas nodded subtly—towards the rocks. For a moment, Luca saw nothing. Then, movement. A lens catching light. A sliver of polished steel.

“They’ve been on me since Paris,” Dimas muttered. “You brought trouble, didn’t you?”

“No,” Luca said. “Trouble brought me.”

Dimas gave a long, slow blink, then nodded once. “Get in the car.”

—

They drove inland, through winding roads that looked half-abandoned, past citrus trees and rotted signs. The woman never asked questions. She didn’t look at either of them. Just drove, fast and smooth, like the wheel was part of her body.

They stopped at a motel that might’ve once had charm, if someone hadn’t killed the charm and buried it under rust and mildew. Room 14 smelled like lemon cleaner and regret. But it had a table. A light. Chairs.

“You have ten minutes,” the woman said. She stood in the doorway, one hand resting on something beneath her coat.

Luca sat across from Dimas. The table was chipped. His hands left prints in the dust.

“You were supposed to protect her,” Luca said.

“I tried.”

“No,” he snapped. “You promised. That’s different.”

Dimas’s mouth twisted. “We were compromised. You think I meant for her to die?”

Luca stared. “She didn’t die.”

Silence.

“She’s alive?” Dimas whispered.

“You tell me,” Luca said. “She went missing three years ago. You were the last person to see her.”

Dimas sat back slowly. He looked haunted, but not surprised. “That night... she said she had a plan.”

“What plan?”

“She didn’t tell me. Only said if things went bad, to run.”

“You ran.”

“I thought she was behind me.” Dimas’s jaw tensed. “She wasn’t.”

They sat there. Clock ticking. The woman in the doorway didn’t move, but Luca could feel her growing impatient like a thunderstorm on the edge of the sky.

Then Dimas said: “If she’s alive, she’ll be in Caligari.”

“Where the hell is that?”

“It’s not on a map.”

—

Two days later, they reached a compound in the south of Italy, where the roads turned to gravel and the gravel turned to dirt. The compound sat behind broken walls, like something half-remembered from a war story. It was a place you didn’t go unless you were already dead in some way.

Luca got out first. His stomach clenched. The woman—her name was Myra—stayed with the car.

“Tell me you’re armed,” she muttered.

Luca nodded. “Kind of.”

“Kind of doesn’t cut it.”

He showed her the knife. Not a gun—he didn’t trust himself with those yet. But the knife was old, steel tempered in silence. It had belonged to his father.

Dimas led the way, quiet as a ghost. They entered through a gate half-hinged. Inside were people with faces like puzzles missing pieces—hard eyes, broken teeth, tattoos like maps of pain. Nobody smiled.

A man approached. Big. Bald. Arms thick with ink and history. He spoke in low Italian. Dimas replied. Luca caught only fragments—“ragazza,” “scomparsa,” “famiglia.” The man looked at Luca, then back at Dimas. After a beat, he stepped aside.

Inside the compound was a door that led to a room that led to another room. And finally, a hall with a woman standing at the end of it.

She had jet-black hair. Her face was shadowed. She was tall. Still. And when Luca saw her, he nearly dropped the knife.

“Sera?” he whispered.

The woman stepped into the light. And she smiled.

But it wasn’t his sister.

—

“She calls herself ‘Sera,’” Dimas said later. “She’s not your sister. But she’s part of the same game.”

“What game?”

“Something old,” he said. “Older than you think. Your sister... she found something. A list. A code. She cracked it. Now everyone wants her dead.”

“She told me about the code before she vanished,” Luca said. “It didn’t make sense. She was scared.”

“She had reason.”

Outside, a hawk circled.

“Then what do we do?” Luca asked.

Dimas lit a cigarette. “We find the others. The ones she trusted. And we pray.”

Luca looked out the window. He thought about the day his sister vanished—the blood on her bed, the note in cipher, the clock frozen at 3:17. He had chased ghosts for three years. But now, at last, the trail was warming. He could feel it in his blood.

He turned to Dimas. “Let’s burn the world down if we have to.”

Dimas nodded once. “That’s the spirit.”

—

Dimas stubbed out the cigarette on the windowsill, leaving a faint smear of ash on the sun-bleached wood. The wind moaned through the half-broken shutters, and somewhere outside, a metal door creaked like it had something to say. Myra was downstairs, sitting with her back to the wall, drinking something from a chipped enamel mug that steamed in the cold. She hadn’t spoken since they arrived, and Luca was beginning to understand that silence, for her, wasn’t an absence. It was a weapon.

He sat on the edge of the cot. “You think she’s really here? In Caligari?”

Dimas ran a hand over his face. His palms were weathered, scarred across the knuckles. “If she’s not here now, she was. Her name’s been carved into too many whispers for it to be coincidence.”

“Whispers don’t get you far. I need something solid.”

Dimas glanced toward the doorway. “This place isn’t made for solid things. Everything here floats just above real. You’ll get stories. Codes. Maybe a photo. But you won’t get truth. Not clean.”

Luca reached into his jacket and pulled out the folded piece of paper that had started it all: the coded letter his sister had left him. It had been folded so many times it looked more like fabric than paper now, smoothed and crinkled like an old road map. The symbols on it meant nothing to him, even now. Rows of slashed lines, broken circles, dots with tails. The only thing he ever recognized was the signature. A crude shape like a trident, drawn in red ink.

He unfolded it again, laid it on the floor between them. “This trident. She drew that on our bedroom wall when we were kids. Said it was ‘hers.’”

Dimas crouched, examined the mark. “I’ve seen this,” he said quietly. “In Marrakesh. And again in a vault under a gallery in Prague.”

Luca blinked. “You think she was there?”

“I think she’s been everywhere.” He sat back on his heels. “What your sister found... it wasn’t just data. It was a sequence.”

“A sequence of what?”

Dimas gave a ghost of a smile. “Of people. Locations. Decisions. It’s like someone set up dominoes fifty years ago and she’s the first one to knock them down.”

“I still don’t get why.”

“She must’ve seen something,” he said. “Or knew someone who did.”

Myra stepped into the room then, silent as snowfall. She was chewing on something—mint leaves, maybe—and her eyes were scanning the floor like a predator.

“We need to move,” she said flatly.

Luca stood. “Now?”

“There’s a convoy heading up from Palermo. Someone sold us out. We’ve got maybe fifteen minutes before this place becomes a memory.”

Dimas didn’t ask questions. He grabbed his coat, swept the paper off the floor, and tucked it into his shirt.

“What about ‘Sera’?” Luca asked.

“She’s not coming.”

“Why not?”

“She was the one who made the call.”

The words landed like broken teeth in his mouth. He wanted to argue. Wanted to grab Dimas and shake him and scream that he was wrong. But somewhere, deep in the hollow of his ribs, he knew it was true.

“She smiled like she knew me,” he muttered.

“She smiled like a spider,” Myra said. “Come on. We’re burning daylight.”

They left the way they came—through the warren of rooms, past the bald guard who was suddenly nowhere to be seen. The compound’s gates hung open. A rusted motorcycle leaned half-collapsed near the guardhouse, the engine still warm.

Myra got behind the wheel. Dimas climbed in beside her. Luca hesitated.

The sky had shifted. The color of a storm not yet born. In the distance, the hills seemed to move—not like shadows, but like shapes with intention. He got in and slammed the door.

“What’s in Palermo?” he asked.

“Answers,” Myra said. “And maybe a bullet.”

They drove west, away from Caligari, toward the coast. As the compound disappeared behind them, the first drops of rain struck the windshield like warning taps from something just out of view. Myra didn’t slow. She leaned into the wheel like she could outrun what was behind them.

For the next hour, nobody spoke. The road twisted and bucked through hills of olive trees and crumbling ruins. Occasionally, they passed a shepherd, or an old woman walking with a basket on her head. Time didn’t feel real in places like this. It folded, it echoed. It refused to follow the rules.

Eventually, the car pulled into a town square so small it didn’t have a name. The café looked abandoned, but lights flickered inside. Myra parked beneath an overhang and killed the engine.

“Wait here,” she said. “I’m going in first.”

“No,” Dimas said. “We go together.”

She looked at him, and for a second, something passed between them. Then she nodded.

Luca followed them into the café, expecting silence. But it was loud. Too loud. A TV in the corner played a football match in grainy black-and-white. Two men at the bar argued in a dialect Luca didn’t recognize. A waitress, maybe thirteen years old, carried a tray with olives and small glasses of clear liquid.

Behind the counter, a man with silver hair and eyes like burnt wood saw them and froze. Then he smiled. “Back from the dead,” he said in Italian.

Dimas smiled without joy. “Barely.”

The man wiped his hands and came around the counter. “You brought ghosts with you,” he said, nodding at Luca.

“His sister was one of ours.”

“Then she was never safe.”

The man’s name was Aldo. He led them to a back room that smelled of cardamom and dust. Shelves lined the walls, filled with boxes and maps and what looked like radio parts from a forgotten war. He closed the door, lit a lamp, and sat.

“She was here,” he said before they could ask. “Two years ago. Stayed four days. Never said her real name. But I remember her eyes. Like she was dreaming of something that scared her.”

“Did she leave anything?” Luca asked.

Aldo nodded. From a metal box beneath the table, he pulled out a thin envelope, sealed with wax. The trident symbol was stamped cleanly into the red.

“She said only her brother could open it,” Aldo said.

Luca took the envelope. His hands were trembling. He broke the seal. Inside was a photo—grainy, black and white, like a satellite still. It showed a building. No address. Just a shape.

On the back, his sister’s handwriting: If you’re reading this, it means they know. Do not go to the building. Burn this. Forget me.

Luca stared at the photo.

Then he said, “We’re going to the building.”

Dimas didn’t argue.

Neither did Myra.

Outside, the wind began to rise again.

They left the café under cloud-thick skies, the kind that pressed down on you like a warning. Aldo gave no goodbye, just a nod and a murmured prayer in a dialect that sounded older than the stones beneath their feet. Back in the Ferrari, the silence was tight, drawn between them like tripwire. Luca turned the photo over in his hand again and again, as if it would change under pressure, as if the ink would yield new meanings if only he stared long enough.

Dimas leaned back, eyes half-closed, one leg bouncing with the subtle rhythm of someone who didn’t want to sit still. “The building looks Eastern Bloc,” he said finally. “Probably Cold War era. Reinforced. That antenna array on the roof—that’s not commercial. Could be military. Could be a listening post.”

Luca squinted at the photo. The angle suggested it was taken from above, maybe by drone or satellite. It didn’t look Italian. It didn’t look like anything he’d seen before. “What would she be doing near a place like this?”

“Running,” said Myra, flicking the car into gear. “Or hiding.”

The engine growled as they tore away from the town, heading east now. The road grew narrow and wild, bordered by overgrowth and olive groves that hadn’t been pruned in years. At times it felt like the trees were leaning in, trying to whisper secrets to the car as it passed. They hit a stretch of cracked asphalt that jolted the chassis hard enough to knock Luca’s head against the window.

He hissed, rubbed the side of his temple, then muttered, “Do we even know what country this is in?”

“No,” Dimas said. “But I’ve seen that kind of window frame before. Russia. Maybe Ukraine. Or one of the ghost states nobody talks about.”

“Great,” Luca muttered. “Because borders make this easier.”

“They don’t matter,” Myra said, eyes on the road. “Not with these people. They operate in silence. No visas. No checkpoints. Just shadows.”

They stopped for gas at a station so remote it didn’t have signs—just a pump, leaning sideways, covered in stickers from bands no one had heard of in twenty years. The attendant was asleep in a plastic chair with a cigarette hanging from his lip. Dimas filled the tank. Myra kept her hand inside her coat the entire time. Luca went around back and threw up in the weeds, chest heaving, palms on his knees.

He didn’t say anything when he got back in the car. No one asked.

They drove until the sun died completely, and the world became outlines. At some point the road disappeared, replaced by gravel, then mud. Myra didn’t slow. She drove like the car was just another limb, trusting its instincts to find the path.

At a fork in the trail, Dimas suddenly sat up straighter. “Stop.”

Myra did. The headlights showed two paths, both choked by underbrush. To the left, the remains of a rusted-out gate. To the right, a wooden sign with no writing left on it, just splinters and moss.

“She came through here,” Dimas said, pointing left.

“You’re sure?” Luca asked.

“I remember that gate. We passed it once when we were tracking someone in ’18. She must’ve known it too. If she wanted to disappear... this is where she’d start.”

Myra turned the wheel.

The car growled forward. Leaves slapped at the windows. Branches scraped along the sides like fingernails. After ten minutes, the forest opened just enough to show a field, empty except for a chain-link fence and a structure beyond it.

Luca felt his breath catch.

It was the building.

Even in the dark, he could make out the outline—blocky, brutalist architecture, heavy concrete, no windows on the top floor. A perimeter fence sagged with rust. The air smelled like metal and mildew. A dead generator squatted near the fence, its paint flaking.

They killed the lights. Myra opened the glovebox and handed Luca a small flashlight. “You ever done recon?”

“No,” he admitted.

“Good,” she said. “You’re not gonna overthink it. Stay low, stay fast. Look for signs of recent entry—scuff marks, broken locks, footprints. Anything.”

Dimas handed him a knife. A different one than before. Shorter. Balanced. “If you hear breathing and it isn’t yours, don’t wait.”

They moved as one—three shadows slipping from the car into deeper dark. The fence wasn’t even locked. Someone had cut through the links with bolt cutters and wrapped the gap with plastic to keep it from catching on clothes. They slipped through and crossed the open field, feet soft on the wet grass.

At the entrance, Myra paused. “There’s light,” she whispered.

Indeed, faint orange glowed from within. Not electric. Fire.

They entered.

The inside smelled of smoke and old paper. The air was warm—too warm. Someone had lit a fire recently, maybe in a barrel or hearth, and the smoke hadn’t fully cleared. The first room was empty except for filing cabinets, most of them overturned or smashed. Something about the destruction felt methodical.

“This place was cleared,” Dimas said. “Not looted. Someone was looking for something.”

In the next room, they found a radio. Ancient. Still humming faintly. The kind used by field agents decades ago, with oversized dials and thick cables.

Myra moved forward and adjusted the tuner. Static. Then: a voice.

“...delta-seven... expires by dawn... extraction confirmed...”

Then silence.

Luca looked at Dimas. “What the hell was that?”

“A call sign,” he said. “Delta-seven is a person. Expires by dawn? That means a kill order. Extraction confirmed means they’re being pulled out. Fast.”

Luca’s hands went clammy. “They’re talking about my sister.”

“She’s still in play,” Dimas said. “Which means we’re running out of time.”

They pushed deeper into the building. Stairwells with railings long since rusted. Doors with bullet holes. A wall scrawled with writing in Cyrillic and blood.

In the lowest level, behind a steel hatch that took all three of them to pry open, they found a map room. A huge board covered in pins and string. Black-and-white photos, half-burned. And there, pinned dead center, was a newer photograph. Not satellite. Surveillance.

It was Luca’s sister. Hair longer. Face thinner. Eyes different.

She was smiling.

Behind her stood a man in a suit with a tattoo of the trident on his neck.

“My god,” Luca whispered. “She’s working with them.”

“No,” Myra said coldly. “She’s inside.”

The realization hit all three of them at once. This wasn’t a rescue mission.

This was an infiltration.

A door slammed above them.

Footsteps.

Myra drew her weapon without a word. Dimas pulled Luca into the shadows. They waited. The footsteps echoed down the stairwell. Slow. Measured. Whoever it was, they knew they weren’t alone.

A flashlight beam cut through the dark. Then a voice.

“Luca.”

It was her.

Sera.

He stepped forward before anyone could stop him.

And the light found him.

She was different. Gaunt, like a statue carved from shadows. Her eyes were haunted, but clear. And behind her, four men stepped into view, armed and faceless.

“I told you not to come,” she said softly.

“I didn’t listen,” Luca replied.

“I know.” She looked at Dimas. Then at Myra. “You brought them?”

“I needed help.”

Her face twisted, almost in grief. “You don’t understand what you’ve done.”

Then the first shot rang out.

—

Chapter Two: Crossroads and Shrapnel

The first bullet tore through the air with the kind of finality that breaks everything in a room. It wasn’t just sound—it was prophecy. A warning. Myra tackled Luca before he could fully register what happened. His head hit the concrete with a jolt of pain, and all he could see for a moment was static and dust. Another shot followed, ricocheting off the metal cabinet inches from where Dimas had thrown himself. The gunfire was controlled, precise, but brief—two shots, maybe three. Then silence again. But the silence now was different. Charged. Waiting.

Dimas crouched behind a steel desk, gun drawn, eyes sharp. Myra was already scanning the angles, pressed low, her own weapon up and steady. Luca lay there, pulse rattling in his throat, ears ringing.

“She’s not trying to kill us,” he gasped.

“She’s keeping us here,” Dimas said. “Pinning us down.”

“Why?”

“Because someone else is coming,” Myra replied, voice hard and low. “And she wants us alive for them.”

The overhead fluorescents flickered. Somewhere above, a metallic clang sounded—something falling or being thrown. The sound echoed strangely in the building’s guts, disorienting, impossible to trace.

Luca pushed himself up, head spinning. “We have to go after her.”

“No,” Myra said. “We move blind, we die.”

Dimas peeked around the corner. “There’s a stairwell—north end of the hallway. If we move now, we can flank whoever’s waiting.”

Myra didn’t hesitate. She moved first, silent as breath, weapon pointed ahead. Dimas motioned for Luca to stay low and follow close. They sprinted in short bursts, slipping between shadows, navigating broken walls and fractured silence.

The stairwell smelled like rust and mold. Half the steps were missing or twisted. Myra took them two at a time, eyes always ahead, gun up. At the top, she paused, cracked the door open with the edge of her boot.

Moonlight spilled in.

The upper floor was partially exposed to the elements—roof collapsed, windows gone, parts of the wall eaten by time. Luca stepped out behind them, the cold air like ice on his sweat-drenched skin.

A voice called out from the far end.

“Luca.”

She was standing in what had once been a control room. Now it was just a concrete shell, empty save for cables dangling like vines. Her arms were raised. She was alone.

He moved before the others could stop him, walking across the open floor toward her.

“Sera,” he called, breath catching. “Why?”

“You don’t understand,” she said, voice trembling. “They weren’t lying. None of them. This goes deeper than I ever thought. What I found—it’s not just a code. It’s a key.”

“To what?”

She looked past him, to Myra and Dimas emerging behind him. Her face hardened. “They’ll never let it exist. Not in one piece.”

“Sera,” Luca said again, “come with us. We can figure this out together.”

“I can’t,” she whispered. “If I leave now, it all falls apart. I’m not who I was, Luca. And you’re not safe anymore.”

Dimas stepped forward. “You don’t have a choice.”

“I always have a choice,” she said, and then she threw the device.

It was small, black, shaped like a pebble—but the second it hit the floor, it pulsed blue and exploded in a blossom of light. A concussive wave tore through the room, flinging everyone back. The world turned to chaos. Ears rang. Concrete cracked. Luca hit the wall, stars bursting behind his eyes.

When he came to, the room was full of smoke. Myra was dragging him by the collar, Dimas covering them with wild eyes, firing blindly into the haze.

“She’s gone!” Dimas shouted. “She dropped through the floor—there was a chute or something—”

Luca tried to speak but coughed instead. His lungs burned. The edges of his vision trembled.

Outside, an engine roared.

They reached the edge of the structure in time to see a black SUV speeding away, its tires kicking up gravel. Sera was in the passenger seat, eyes locked on the rearview mirror.

Luca’s chest felt like it was caving in.

“What the hell just happened?” he whispered.

“She made her move,” Myra said, brushing ash from her jacket. “And we’re officially behind.”

They regrouped hours later, holed up in a barn outside the village of Sestu. The place smelled of hay and motor oil, but it was empty, remote, and dry. Dimas set up a makeshift workstation using an old toolbox and the few electronics they salvaged from the building. Myra cleaned her weapon in the corner, hands steady, eyes unreadable.

Luca sat in the hay, knees drawn to his chest.

“She was trying to protect me,” he muttered.

“She was trying to stall you,” Dimas said without looking up. “There’s a difference.”

“No,” Luca said. “She could’ve had us killed. She didn’t.”

Myra looked up. “That bomb she threw could’ve killed you, if you’d been closer.”

“She knew I’d back off,” he said. “She was counting on it.”

Dimas tapped the side of a decrypted hard drive. “Well, good news. She left us something.”

“What?”

“Data. Compressed. Hidden inside the radio signal we picked up. It’s not clean, but I’m getting fragments.”

Luca stood and came over. The screen showed lines of raw code, interspersed with brief flashes of imagery—a blurred map, a building layout, what looked like a sequence of chemical notations.

“She knew we’d follow her,” Dimas said. “This... this was a trail of breadcrumbs. Which means she’s not lost. She’s leading us.”

Myra frowned. “Or she’s leading us into a trap.”

“Both things can be true,” Dimas said.

Luca pointed at one of the images. “That symbol. The double-ring. I’ve seen it before. It was in her journal. Something about ‘mirror sites.’”

Dimas nodded slowly. “Twin locations. Identical structures built miles apart, in case one gets compromised. Military used to do it in the ’70s. Intelligence communities picked it up later.”

“She’s going to the second site,” Luca said.

“Where?” Myra asked.

Dimas zoomed in on the map. “Hungary. Northern edge. Near a village called Torma.”

“That’s four countries away,” she said. “We’ll never make it before her.”

“We don’t have to,” Luca said suddenly. “We just need to get there before them.”

Myra studied him for a long moment. “You're starting to sound like her.”

He didn’t respond.

They crossed the border into Slovenia two days later under fake names and borrowed documents. Myra had contacts, and Dimas had favors owed. The car was a battered Opel that smelled like old cigarettes and something worse, but it ran clean and didn’t draw attention.

Luca spent most of the drive staring out the window, watching the countryside unravel into strange terrain—hills like sleeping giants, rivers that moved too fast, too quiet. They stopped only when necessary, sleeping in shifts, avoiding main roads. The air changed as they moved east, grew colder, thinner. Even the sky looked different.

They arrived in Torma just after dusk. The town was barely more than a cluster of buildings pressed into a hillside, where the roads gave up and turned to gravel again. The second site wasn’t hard to find. It stood out—wrong somehow, too angular and modern in a place that still ran on firewood.

“This is it,” Dimas said, peering through binoculars. “There’s already a team inside. Not hers. The other one.”

“The people who want her dead,” Luca said.

Myra checked her sidearm. “Then we better get in before it ends.”

Dimas looked at Luca. “You ready for this?”

Luca exhaled. “No.”

“Good,” Dimas said. “That means you’re thinking.”

They moved out, silent, into the teeth of whatever came next.

—

The ground was uneven, scattered with loose gravel and patches of ice clinging stubbornly to the earth even in late spring. They moved under the cover of trees—scraggly, windblown things, their silhouettes stark against the dim, purple horizon. The facility stood like a bunker dug into the belly of the hill, its entrance surrounded by floodlights and silence. There were no guards posted visibly, but the lack of activity didn’t comfort them. It only made Dimas more certain the danger was inside.

“We go in through the east side,” he said, crouching behind a low wall where the trees thinned. “There’s a drainage hatch, probably welded, maybe rigged, but it's the only way that doesn’t put us in a spotlight.”

Myra knelt beside him, eyes narrowed. “I count two sentries in the inner corridor—infrared tells me they’re posted stationary. That usually means automated surveillance is doing most of the watching.”

“Internal cameras?”

“Likely.”

“Loops?”

“I’ll need thirty seconds once we’re inside to fry the feed.”

Dimas looked at Luca, who had been watching the compound with a mixture of awe and dread. “You stay close to Myra. You watch how she moves. You don’t try to be a hero.”

Luca nodded, jaw tight.

They waited until the last glimmer of sunlight faded, until the compound’s exterior lights cycled down into night-mode dimness. Then they moved—quick, calculated, bodies low and breaths shallow. The wind picked up as they crossed open ground, carrying the scent of ozone and earth. The kind of air that warned of storms.

The drainage hatch was embedded in the far wall, hidden beneath a concrete lip and half-swallowed by frost and vines. Myra knelt and drew a tool from her vest, a slim, needle-like thing that clicked quietly as she inserted it into the seal.

“Old Soviet design,” she murmured. “Steel’s cracked in two places. I can open it, but we’ll make noise.”

“Do it,” Dimas said.

The hatch gave way with a soft metallic pop, and the rush of stagnant air that followed was thick with damp and rot. They slipped through in silence, boots echoing faintly in the narrow service tunnel that descended beneath the facility. The light here was minimal—just emergency strips along the floor, pulsing faint red every few feet. Somewhere far above, machinery hummed like a sleeping beast.

At the first intersection, Myra paused. She tapped something into her forearm console, and a blue shimmer passed over the walls.

“Cameras looped,” she said. “We have ninety seconds before they start repeating.”

Dimas took point now, guiding them through a maze of corridors that hadn’t seen maintenance in decades. Paint peeled from the walls in long, curling strips. Old posters in Cyrillic languages hung askew, their messages faded and ominous. The deeper they went, the warmer the air became. It smelled of metal and something else—something sour.

They reached a control room at the edge of the inner ring, sealed by a sliding door smeared with rust and what might have once been blood. Myra hacked the keypad in silence, fingers a blur, then motioned for them to enter.

Inside, the room was dark, except for a few flickering monitors that showed interior views of the compound. Most were static. One wasn’t.

It showed Sera.

She stood in a chamber lined with leaded walls, speaking to a man whose back was to the camera. His suit was clean, expensive. The trident tattoo on the back of his neck marked him instantly. Dimas leaned in.

“That’s Lazar.”

Luca’s brow furrowed. “Who?”

“One of the architects. He’s supposed to be dead. Prague, ’09—car bomb. I guess the rumors were wrong.”

“He’s the one pulling her strings?”

“He’s the one she thinks is offering her a way out.”

Luca clenched his fists. “Then let’s go get her.”

But Dimas didn’t move. He was staring at the console, where a second feed had just gone live. This one showed the hallway outside their room.

“I don’t think she brought us here to be rescued,” he said.

Because standing in that hallway, looking straight into the lens, was Sera.

And she was smiling again.

The door blew inward with a blast that sent them sprawling. Dimas was up first, pulling Myra out of the line of fire as automated turrets hissed to life in the ceiling. Luca grabbed a table leg and flipped it over for cover just as the corridor filled with smoke and the unmistakable crack of gunfire.

“I told you,” Dimas shouted over the noise, “this wasn’t a rescue!”

“Then what the hell is it?” Luca yelled.

“A test,” Myra growled, sliding a fresh clip into her weapon. “She wanted to see if we’d follow her all the way down.”

The gunfire died abruptly.

The smoke lingered.

And then Sera stepped through it.

She was unarmed. Her clothes were different now—simple black fatigues, no insignia, no rank. She looked at them like she’d known every step they’d take.

“You should have stayed away,” she said.

“Sera—what are you doing?” Luca asked, rising slowly. “Why are you helping them?”

“I’m not helping anyone,” she said softly. “I’m dismantling something from the inside.”

“That man—Lazar—”

“He’s not in control. Not really. He’s a cipher. A mouthpiece. There are older hands at work here. You remember that code I gave you?”

“The symbols? The map?”

She nodded. “That was Phase One. A tracking algorithm buried inside Cold War defense schematics. It could predict military movements weeks in advance. I thought it was about war.”

“It wasn’t?” Myra asked.

“It’s about memory,” she replied. “There’s a program running through this facility—tied into every server, every hidden satellite left from the old networks. It doesn’t just track people.”

Luca stepped forward. “Then what does it do?”

Sera looked at him with eyes full of sadness. “It rewrites them.”

The silence that followed was total.

“They’re erasing identities,” she said. “Replacing people at the edges. Ones who don’t have social ties. Ones who won’t be missed. They call it a rebalancing operation. Maintain control by altering the past just enough that the present tilts toward their design.”

Dimas swore under his breath. “That’s why they wanted you.”

“They thought I could finish the work,” she said. “They didn’t realize I was using them to destroy it from within.”

Luca stepped closer. “Then let us help you.”

“You don’t understand. If I fail, the entire system collapses. But if I’m removed too early... the system activates a purge protocol. Every backup goes live. Every rewritten identity becomes real. It’ll overwrite everything.”

“Then we stop it together,” Luca said.

Sera hesitated. “There’s one way. But it’s not clean. It’s not even guaranteed.”

“Tell me.”

“There’s a failsafe. A hard-coded anomaly that shuts down the rewrite node permanently. But to activate it, someone has to trigger a brainwave signature stored in a neural profile. Mine.”

“You mean—”

“If I die in the right place, at the right time, the whole program crashes.”

Luca went pale. “No. No, we’ll find another way.”

“There isn’t one,” she said.

Dimas stepped forward. “Where is it?”

She looked at him, then slowly handed over a small black device. “Here. Inside this. It’s a quantum signature key. It’s paired to my neural net.”

Myra stared at the device. “That’s it? She dies, this thing gets triggered, and it all ends?”

“It ends for now,” Sera said. “But they’ll try again. Somewhere else. With someone new.”

Luca reached for her hand. “Don’t do this.”

“I’m already gone,” she said. “This version of me was never going to make it out.”

Alarms sounded overhead.

“They’re coming,” Dimas said.

Sera pressed the key into Luca’s palm. “Go north. There’s a maintenance tunnel behind the chamber. It leads to the woods.”

“What about you?”

“I’ll make sure they follow me.”

Luca tried to speak, but the words caught in his throat. Then Sera did something unexpected—she kissed his forehead. Just like when they were kids.

“I love you,” she said. “Don’t look back.”

Then she turned, and ran into the dark.

Chapter Three: The Broken Corridor

The forest welcomed them like a grave. Wet earth squelched beneath their boots, trees crowding in with branches like fingers. The cold gnawed at Luca’s face as he stumbled through tangled roots and low fog, clutching the device Sera had placed in his palm. His legs felt hollow. His heart, worse—like a pendulum swinging out of rhythm, cracking ribs as it went.

They didn’t speak. There was no space for words. Only movement. Behind them, the explosion of gunfire still echoed through the hills, dull thumps of war against the silence of nature. Sera’s diversion had worked—at least enough to buy them time. But time was no longer a friend. It was a fuse, burning too fast, toward something far worse than detonation.

Dimas led the way, moving with that animal grace born from years of tight escapes. Myra followed behind, her face unreadable but alert, watching the treeline for movement, the horizon for betrayal. Luca kept his head down and followed, the black device warm in his hand.

Eventually they reached a ravine, its mouth gaping like a wound. A metal pipe jutted from the rocks above it, leaking a steady trickle of sulfurous water. Dimas paused, scanned the terrain, then pointed toward a narrow path that sloped upward into thicker forest.

“There’s a village twenty kilometers northeast,” he said. “Hidden. Not on any map made after 1987. I’ve got a contact there. If we can make it, we’ll get answers.”

“We don’t need answers,” Myra snapped. “We need extraction.”

“We don’t have that luxury.”

She crossed her arms, her face shadowed. “We’re carrying the kill-switch for a system built to erase people from history. We don’t even know if it works. And the only person who did—”

“She’s not dead yet,” Luca interrupted. His voice cracked with more than just exhaustion. “She’s still buying us this chance. Don’t talk like she’s gone.”

Myra didn’t respond, but the silence that followed was not disagreement.

They pressed forward. The forest thickened, then broke into a low valley. Fog clung to the ground in wet, clutching waves, and strange insects hummed through the underbrush like living wires. At one point, they came upon an old bus, half-swallowed by vines, leaning on its side as if trying to sleep. Dimas paused to check it for supplies. Found nothing. They moved on.

Hours passed in increments too small to track—moments defined by breath, step, heartbeat. The cold turned cruel, and the silence around them began to feel watched. But eventually, the trees opened to reveal a narrow trail carved through thick pine, and beyond it, the ghost of a village appeared. Rooftops sagging under moss. Doors missing. Windows staring, empty-eyed.

Dimas led them to what had once been a church. The bell tower had collapsed, but the nave was mostly intact. Inside, the pews were gone, replaced by crates and tools, the smell of diesel and mold thick in the air. A fire had been recently lit—embers still smoldered.

“He’s close,” Dimas said. “Or was.”

“Who is he?” Luca asked.

“Name’s Jurek. Used to run data laundering operations for rogue states. He’s gone underground for the last decade, hiding from both sides.”

“What makes you think he’ll help us?”

Dimas looked around, then pointed to a carved symbol on the wall: a scratched triangle, broken through its center.

“He owes me.”

Myra checked the perimeter, then nodded. “Fifteen minutes, no more. If he doesn’t show, we move.”

But they didn’t have to wait that long.

The floor creaked near the back of the nave, and a hatch opened. From beneath, a man emerged—tall, skeletal, wrapped in layers of wool and fatigue. His beard was streaked with grey, but his eyes were sharp, alive with an energy that defied his appearance.

“Dimas,” he said, voice gravel-thick. “You brought ghosts into my house.”

“They brought the future with them,” Dimas said.

Jurek stepped into the firelight, eyeing Luca and Myra with suspicion, then focused on the device in Luca’s hands.

“You have no idea what that thing is, do you?”

“We know enough,” Myra said.

“You know what it does. But not what it costs.”

Luca stepped forward. “Can you help us activate it?”

Jurek didn’t answer right away. He walked to the fire, stirred the coals, added wood from a hidden stash beneath the floor. When he finally spoke, his voice was soft.

“This isn’t just a kill-switch,” he said. “It’s a memory vector.”

“Meaning?”

“It doesn’t just destroy the network. It rewinds it. All the rewritten identities, all the false histories—they collapse. Time itself will try to realign around what it once was.”

Luca stared. “You mean people... come back?”

“No,” Jurek said. “They never left. But they’ve been altered—displaced, buried under new layers. When the system fails, those layers shatter. Some people will remember everything. Some will remember nothing. And some... will fracture.”

“Fracture how?” Myra asked.

“Split. Identity loss. Temporal confusion. It’s not clean. You push a thousand memories into one mind, you don’t always get sanity on the other side.”

Silence fell again.

Luca looked down at the device. “So if we use this... it might destroy more than just their system.”

“It might,” Jurek confirmed. “But it’s the only thing left that scares them.”

Myra leaned against the stone wall, arms folded. “Where’s the closest node?”

“Prague,” Jurek said. “Underground. Used to be a Cold War relay bunker. Now it’s something else. They call it the Vault. If the signal from that device reaches the core server inside it, the chain reaction starts.”

Dimas nodded slowly. “Then we go to Prague.”

But Luca didn’t move. He was still looking at the device. His voice, when it came, was barely a whisper.

“If Sera is still alive... if she knew what this thing really does... she wouldn’t have handed it to me unless she knew I’d hesitate.”

Myra looked at him, eyes narrowed. “What are you saying?”

“I’m saying maybe she didn’t just want the system destroyed. Maybe she wanted to remember.”

They all stared at the fire for a long moment.

Then Dimas stood. “We move at first light.”

By the time they reached the Czech border, they were traveling under different names, with new passports, and a different car—this one a grey van with tinted windows and a false floor beneath the rear seats. Dimas drove. Myra navigated. Luca held the device in his lap, cradled like a weapon he didn’t know how to use.

They passed through checkpoints unnoticed, thanks to Jurek’s forged credentials and Myra’s uncanny ability to manipulate suspicion with silence. Every town they passed felt like a dream someone else had abandoned—a haze of gray rooftops and shuttered buildings, bent telephone poles, and alleyways too narrow for light.

In Prague, they parked beneath a parking structure near an old theater. Dimas led them on foot through back alleys slick with rain and oil. The entrance to the Vault was beneath the Vltava river, accessed through a forgotten utility tunnel once disguised as a sewage route. They reached it just after midnight.

Inside, the tunnel walls dripped condensation. Pipes groaned. Rusted valves hissed at intervals like angry spirits. But further in, the space changed—became cleaner, more deliberate. Reinforced steel walls. Keypad locks. Scanners.

Myra took the lead. One by one, she bypassed the systems, cracked open access points, and brought them deeper into the facility. The final door required two keys and a biometric confirmation.

“This is it,” she said.

Dimas nodded.

Luca stepped forward.

The room beyond was massive, circular, and silent—lit from below by pale blue LEDs that cast their glow across server stacks and cables that snaked like veins. At the center was a platform. Atop it, a receiver. The same shape as the device in Luca’s hands.

He looked at the others.

“I’ll do it,” he said.

“You sure?” Dimas asked.

“No.”

But he stepped forward anyway.

As he approached, the device began to hum.

Then the lights dimmed.

And a voice echoed from above.

“You don’t know what you’re doing,” it said.

They looked up.

And standing on the catwalk, flanked by guards, was Sera.

Alive.

Bleeding.

Smiling.

Chapter Four: The Echo Protocol

Sera stood like a statue against the steel framework, a thin line of blood crawling from her temple down her cheek, vanishing into the collar of her black jacket. The guards flanking her were still, rifles across their chests, but they didn’t seem ready to shoot. Not yet. Not unless ordered. It was the kind of poised silence that could break into chaos with a single wrong word.

Below, Luca froze mid-step on the platform, the humming device in his hand now vibrating faintly, like it recognized the gravity in the air. Myra’s grip on her sidearm tightened. Dimas turned slightly, angling his body to shield both of them without being obvious. They all knew the room was now more than a server core. It had become a crucible.

“I watched you die,” Luca said, his voice unsteady, a half-whisper that echoed more loudly than he’d intended.

“I let you see what they needed you to see,” Sera replied. Her voice was calm, but it lacked its usual weight. It sounded borrowed, like she’d been talking for too long in someone else’s throat. “They knew you wouldn’t stop if you thought I was alive.”

Luca shook his head. “But you are alive. You’re here. So why stop us now?”

She looked down at him, those same haunted eyes now a strange hybrid of exhaustion and clarity. “Because I was wrong.”

Dimas stepped forward slightly, not threatening, but not yielding either. “What exactly were you wrong about?”

Sera tilted her head. “The system. The protocol. I believed we could control it from within, rewrite the sequence ourselves. But it isn’t a system. It’s an echo. A reflex born from the decisions of people who no longer exist but left scars in the data. It’s rewriting everything because it thinks it’s healing the wound.”

“And this,” Myra said, nodding to the device in Luca’s hand, “this stops the echo?”

Sera nodded. “It does. But at a cost. One we weren’t prepared for.”

“You mean memory collapse,” Luca said. “Jurek explained.”

She smiled faintly, as though hearing that name had softened something. “Jurek knew pieces. He always did. But the truth is uglier than fragments.”

She stepped closer to the edge of the catwalk, eyes fixed on her brother. “If you activate that device here, every identity constructed by the Echo Protocol will crash. Not just altered people. Not just the dead who were rewritten. But those of us who were tethered to its memory field. The ones used as anchors. Me. Dimas. Myra. You.”

Luca’s mouth went dry. “What do you mean?”

“I mean,” she said, her voice quieter now, “you are not entirely you anymore. Not the version that existed before this all began. You’ve been touched by the echo—shaped by its feedback. Your thoughts, your choices, even your grief... some of it’s yours. Some of it isn’t.”

Silence followed. Dense. Suffocating.

Myra, always pragmatic, broke it. “So what’s your solution? Let the system keep running until it rewrites the entire species?”

Sera shook her head. “I’ve found another key. It’s not destructive. It dampens the signal, slows the rewriting—buys us time to isolate the source. There’s a core buried under Siberian rock, older than the Vault, older than this entire operation. It’s not software. It’s something else. Biological, partially. Designed during the early MK systems testing. No one knows what’s inside it—only that the echo didn’t start from code. It started from something human.”

Luca tried to grasp her meaning, but the words felt disjointed, incomplete. “You want to go there? Shut it down manually?”

“I’m going there,” she said. “Alone.”

“No,” he said immediately. “You won’t make it. You’ll be intercepted before you cross the border.”

“That’s not your call anymore.”

He stepped back from the platform and stared at the small humming device in his hands. “Then give me a reason not to use this right now.”

Sera took a breath. “Because if you do, I won’t just die—I’ll be erased. Everything I’ve done, every trail I left, every resistance I seeded in the system... all of it gone. The network will devour the anomaly. It’ll be like I never existed. And the system won’t end—it’ll adapt.”

The words landed harder than she intended. For a moment, she looked like she regretted saying them.

Luca clenched the device tighter. “Then tell me what to do.”

For the first time, she didn’t have an answer.

Instead, she turned to the guards. “Leave us.”

They hesitated.

“Now.”

The guards looked at each other, then exited without question, their boots echoing down the hall until silence reclaimed the chamber.

Sera stepped down from the catwalk slowly, painfully, her hand gripping the railing like she didn’t trust her legs. When she reached the base, she faced them without defense, shoulders sagged, hair plastered to her face with sweat and blood.

“Luca,” she said gently, “you always saw the world as a puzzle with pieces missing. I used to envy that—your need to fix things, to make them whole. But sometimes we’re not supposed to fix. We’re supposed to choose which cracks to keep.”

He swallowed hard. “I just wanted to find you.”

“You did.”

Dimas lowered his weapon. Myra looked away, jaw clenched. None of them knew what came next, because for the first time, the objective wasn’t obvious. It wasn’t a bomb to defuse, a gun to fire, a villain to kill. It was a question no one could answer correctly.

Luca stepped to the platform again and looked at the device.

“It has to end,” he said finally. “But I’ll give you time.”

He placed the device carefully into the receiver, but didn’t activate it. Then he stepped down.

“You have seven days,” he said. “After that, I finish what you started.”

Sera’s eyes glistened. “That’s more than I deserve.”

They left the Vault in silence, the future suddenly heavier than it had been hours ago. Outside, the rain had stopped. The city was quiet. They walked into it like strangers to their own lives.

None of them knew if they would ever return.

And above them, in the darkened sky, a satellite blinked—once, twice—before vanishing entirely.

—

The satellite blinked out as if swallowed by the night itself, and for a long moment, no one moved. The four of them stood beneath the archway of the old access corridor, their shadows stretched thin by the blue-tinted emergency lighting inside the Vault. Rain had begun again, soft and cold, the kind that numbs the hands and tightens the skin on your face. It tapped against the concrete with delicate persistence, as if nature itself were unsure whether to grieve or wait.

They walked back through the tunnel the way they’d come, every step echoing with things left unsaid. At the surface, Dimas made a quick sweep, checking for signs of surveillance or tailing agents, but the alley behind the theater was deserted. The only witnesses were puddles and old posters peeling from brick.
