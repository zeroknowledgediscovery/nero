Chapter One: Double-Booked

It started with the sound of a spoon clinking against ceramic. Evan Mulroney, thirty-two, single by circumstance and occasional design, stirred honey into his coffee with the same distracted air he brought to most tasks. It was late afternoon in Chicago, the sun already sinking behind the apartment blocks, casting long, slanted shadows across the cluttered surface of his kitchen table—newspapers, unopened mail, a dying pothos plant he kept meaning to revive. His phone buzzed once. Then again. He picked it up, thumb hovering over the screen, brow furrowed.

Two texts.

Rachel: “Looking forward to tonight! 😊 Hope you like Vietnamese!”

Marissa: “Can’t wait for 7! Dress sharp, mister. 🍷”

Evan blinked. Re-read. Then said, quietly, “Shit.”

He had, in the blur of last week’s networking drinks, a conversation in a bookstore, and three too many late-night app scrolls, apparently scheduled two first dates—one with Rachel, the sharp-witted editor with dark eyes and an unhealthy obsession with true crime podcasts, and the other with Marissa, the free-spirited photographer who made everything sound like an adventure waiting to happen.

Same day. Same time. Different places.

He sat very still, processing. On the television, muted but still visually noisy, a commercial showed a smiling couple kissing over pasta. The irony was palpable.

Evan checked the time: 5:12 PM. Two hours until disaster. He could cancel one of them. That would be the rational thing to do. But he wasn’t rational; he was curious. Possibly bored. And, beneath that, maybe a little desperate not to miss out on either.

His best friend, Joel, picked up on the second ring.

“You absolute idiot,” Joel said after hearing the story.

“I’m not asking for judgment. I’m asking for strategy.”

“You want strategy for how to date two women at once, in the same city, on the same night?”

“I didn’t mean to.”

“That’s worse.”

“I didn’t not mean to,” Evan offered weakly.

Joel sighed. “Okay. Lay it out.”

Rachel had chosen Saigon Sisters, a cozy place in the West Loop known for its banh mi and low lighting. Marissa had picked The Violet Hour in Wicker Park, with its mixologist-chic cocktails and dramatic velvet curtains.

“Reservations at seven, both places,” Evan said. “I can push Rachel to 7:15. Maybe 7:30. She’s chill. I tell Marissa I’ll be ten minutes late. Hit her spot first, grab a drink, make an excuse, then Uber to Rachel. Dinner. Then circle back to Marissa for a ‘surprise dessert’ or something.”

“You’re asking for an aneurysm. What if one of them runs late?”

“I’ll adapt.”

“Evan, you once got confused by the two-exit bathroom at Ramen-San.”

“I’ve grown.”

“You’re going to end up alone and covered in chili oil.”

“Thanks for the vote of confidence.”

But Evan did it. Or at least, he tried.

7:04 PM – He walked into The Violet Hour in a gray blazer and dark jeans, running a hand through his hair like he hadn’t already done that thirty-seven times in the cab.

Marissa waved from a shadowy booth. She was luminous. Dressed in a retro polka-dot dress and wearing earrings shaped like tiny cameras. She handed him a drink without asking.

“I picked for you,” she said. “Figured you for a bourbon kind of guy.”

Evan smiled. “You figured right.”

They talked travel. She had stories of Moroccan train mishaps and Icelandic hitchhiking, and he managed to contribute anecdotes of his one brave trip to Montreal and a disastrous Airbnb experience involving a live ferret.

At 7:36 PM, he excused himself.

“I’ve got to—friend emergency,” he said, wincing. “Ten minutes, tops.”

Marissa raised an eyebrow. “Should I be worried?”

He kissed her cheek. “You’ll miss me.”

She laughed and took a sip of her drink. “I already do.”

Outside, he sprinted for an Uber and begged the driver for speed.

7:48 PM – He slid into the booth across from Rachel, breathless, apologetic.

“I’m so sorry. My boss called and—long story.”

Rachel, clad in a black turtleneck and gold earrings, looked amused more than annoyed.

“You’re lucky I like Vietnamese food too much to leave.”

Dinner was good. Really good. Rachel was smart, almost intimidatingly so, but never unkind. She spoke about her father’s political campaigns, about her love of autumn and ghost tours, about a novel she was secretly writing.

Evan’s mind was a spinning plate.

At 9:03 PM, with dessert menus approaching, he muttered something about having to walk his friend’s dog and dashed out again.

9:26 PM – Back at The Violet Hour.

Marissa was outside, waiting.

“You look like you wrestled a bear,” she said. “Was your friend on fire?”

He smiled sheepishly. “Chihuahua emergency. Don’t ask.”

She eyed him for a moment, then held out a paper bag. Inside was a still-warm cookie from a bakery down the street.

“I figured if you were lying, you might as well enjoy dessert anyway.”

Evan blinked.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “This night got away from me.”

Marissa shrugged. “It happens. Just don’t make it a habit.”

They sat on the curb, eating cookies, watching the last of the bars spill out onto the sidewalk.

He didn’t go home until midnight. Alone, full of sugar and guilt.

Chapter Two: Fractures and Echoes

Evan woke up the next morning with a gnawing pit in his stomach and a dozen unread messages. Two were from Rachel.

Rachel: “I had a great time. Would love to see you again.”

Rachel (later): “Actually, were you okay last night? You seemed… distracted. Hope all’s good.”

One from Marissa.

Marissa: “So. Want to tell me the real story now, or do we keep pretending you’re a part-time firefighter with a dog?”

He groaned, dragging a pillow over his head.

Later, after three cups of black coffee and an internal lecture that bordered on the Biblical, he decided honesty might not kill him. Not all at once, anyway.

He replied to both.

To Rachel: “You’re right. I was distracted. I messed up. Scheduled two dates, tried to be clever. Not proud. You deserve better.”

To Marissa: “Yeah… there wasn’t a dog. There was another date. And you were both too great for me to want to cancel. Also not proud. Sorry.”

He expected radio silence. Maybe a meme of a dumpster fire. What he didn’t expect were their responses.

Rachel: “That’s... unexpectedly honest. I’m not thrilled, but I’ve had worse. Still, not sure what to do with this.”

Marissa: “Damn. That’s gutsy. Stupid, but gutsy. Call me tomorrow.”

The next few days were strange. Evan floated through work, meetings blurring into emails, emails dissolving into Slack messages. He saw Joel for a drink.

“So what’s the fallout?”

“Minimal. For now.”

“Do you actually like them? Either of them?”

He hesitated. “I liked them both.”

“That’s not what I asked.”

Evan didn’t answer.

By the following week, things had changed.

Rachel invited him to an author panel at her publishing house. It was awkward at first, but she seemed willing to give him a second chance—under probation, as she called it.

Marissa, on the other hand, took him to a roller-skating party where he fell twice and earned a massive bruise but also a long, lingering kiss behind the DJ booth.

He was falling, and he was falling in two directions.

By character count, the story was just beginning.

Evan sat on the edge of his bed, shoes still on, tie loose around his neck like a remnant of a former self who had ambitions of control over the evening. His apartment, dimly lit by the streetlamps filtering through the blinds, felt both suffocating and oddly quiet after the chaos of the night. He could still taste the ginger-laced pork belly from Saigon Sisters and the smoke-kissed bourbon Marissa had handed him. And yet, despite the sensory trail lingering on his tongue and clothes, there was a hollowness that crept in—a dull awareness that something about the evening had shifted in him.

He had pulled it off. Technically. Neither woman had stormed off. No drinks were thrown, no dramatic reveals, no accidental meetings in the restroom. But the whole thing had cost him. He’d lied—indirectly, maybe, but lied nonetheless. Evan was a man of mild habits and lukewarm impulses, not some player juggling hearts. So why had he done it? Why had he let curiosity outpace decency?

He pulled out his phone and opened the Notes app, a strange ritual he’d started during the pandemic—a private therapy of sorts, where he jotted down thoughts too vague or embarrassing to text anyone. He typed:

“Double-booked dates. Both amazing. Felt like two parts of me fit into two different worlds. Is that normal or just cowardice?”

He stared at it. Deleted it. Then typed something else.

“They’re not interchangeable. I know that.”

The next morning, Evan woke to a sky smeared with clouds and the muffled sounds of the building’s old pipes coughing awake. His phone buzzed at 8:23 a.m.—far too early for social calls. He checked it, half-expecting a follow-up scolding or a curt “thanks, but no thanks.” Instead, it was a message from Joel.

Joel: “Brunch? You owe me a disaster debrief.”

Evan smiled faintly and replied: “Only if you buy the coffee.”

When he arrived at the corner diner, Joel was already halfway through a plate of eggs and toast, reading something on his tablet.

“You look like someone who broke both arms trying to hug a cactus,” Joel said as Evan slid into the booth.

“Thanks,” Evan muttered. “Appreciate the imagery.”

“So? What’s the damage report?”

Evan filled him in—every awkward pivot, every near miss, the full story of the night including Rachel’s late-night text and Marissa’s clever cookie gesture. Joel listened in silence, occasionally raising an eyebrow but mostly just nodding.

“You really like both of them,” Joel said once Evan had finished.

“Yeah,” Evan admitted. “But not the same way.”

“Explain.”

“It’s like…” Evan paused, collecting his thoughts. “Rachel’s like a sharp wind—you feel her before you see her. There’s this energy around her, this intelligence that makes me want to be sharper, funnier, more… real. But Marissa—she’s a slow burn. She makes me want to say yes to everything. Even the scary stuff.”

Joel stirred his coffee slowly. “So what’s your move?”

“I don’t know. I thought I could figure it out by spending time with both. But that’s not fair to them.”

Joel set his mug down. “Look, it’s not a sin to be unsure. Just don’t drag them through it.”

Evan nodded. He already knew that. But knowing and doing were rarely aligned.

That afternoon, in a bout of guilt-motivated productivity, Evan cleaned his apartment from top to bottom. It was the kind of aggressive cleansing only remorse could fuel—sheets stripped and washed, dishes actually dried and put away, even the junk drawer subjected to triage. He found a dried-out pen, three expired coupons, and a fortune cookie slip that read: “A new chapter requires closing an old one.”

He stared at it longer than he should have.

By evening, Evan sat down with his laptop to catch up on work but instead found himself scrolling through both Rachel’s and Marissa’s Instagram pages. Rachel had posted a photo of her cat, curled next to a hardback book, captioned: “Weekend goals.” Marissa had shared a reel of a woman fire-dancing on a beach in Tulum, captioned: “New client, wild shoot.”

Two lives. Two different worlds.

He couldn’t shake the feeling that, whichever direction he chose, something meaningful would be left behind.

Later that night, Evan went for a walk through his neighborhood. The streets were quiet, the occasional whirr of a passing bike or the shuffle of someone walking their dog breaking the stillness. He passed a window where a couple sat across from each other, laughing over what looked like Chinese takeout. Their silhouettes, framed by warm light and familiarity, gave him a pang in his chest. Not jealousy—something more like longing, but less defined.

He sat on a bench near the park and called his sister, Lily.

“Wow,” she said after he’d unloaded everything. “Classic Evan.”

“Thanks.”

“I mean that affectionately. You’ve always wanted things to feel balanced. But people aren’t spreadsheets.”

“I know.”

“Do you want me to tell you what to do?”

“Yes. No. Maybe.”

She sighed in that older-sibling way that was half love, half exasperation. “You need to be honest. With both of them. And with yourself. Figure out what you’re really looking for—not just who fits best, but who challenges you to grow.”

“Can’t you just tell me who to choose and save me the pain?”

“Nope. That’s your mess.”

Back in his apartment, Evan opened a blank email window. Then closed it. Then opened a new one and began to write—to Rachel first. A real message, not a panicked text. He explained the situation again, more thoughtfully this time. He admitted the mistake, owned the immaturity of his decision, and told her he understood if she wanted nothing more to do with him.

He hit send before he could overthink it.

Then he did the same with Marissa.

The next day, he woke up to silence. Not a chirp. Not a buzz. Not a single notification.

He went through the motions—coffee, half-hearted attempts at work, a short call with a client, and lunch he barely remembered eating.

It wasn’t until 3:42 p.m. that his phone buzzed.

Rachel: “I appreciate the honesty. Really. It sucks, because I liked you. But I also think you’ve got some stuff to figure out. Maybe do that, and if we cross paths again… who knows.”

He stared at the message, heart heavy but grateful. It was closure, at least. And it didn’t feel like a door slamming, just a gentle one clicking shut.

Then, at 6:18 p.m., another buzz.

Marissa: “I’m not gonna pretend I wasn’t pissed. But I’m also not great at black-and-white decisions. If you’re willing to be real from now on, I’m willing to see where this goes. One condition: no more double-booking. I’m not a subplot.”

Evan smiled. It was crooked and small, but it was there.

He typed back: “Deal.”

And for the first time in a long time, Evan felt like maybe he wasn’t just juggling parts of himself—but beginning to integrate them.

Chapter One: Conclusion

By the end of the week, the chaos of Evan’s double-booked evening had quieted into something more reflective. He hadn't chosen between Rachel and Marissa in the way he'd expected—instead, the choice had been made for him through honesty and consequence. He still thought about Rachel, about her voice and her incisive questions, but there was also something comforting in the way Marissa had offered him a second chance—not as a do-over, but as an opportunity to grow.

And maybe, he thought as he sat with her on a park bench days later, sharing a bag of popcorn and laughing over a stranger’s yappy poodle, that was all anyone really wanted. A chance not to be perfect, but to be understood.

And to try again, with fewer lies.

Chapter Two: The Week After

The following week settled like silt after a storm—slow, fine, deceptive in its stillness. Evan returned to the rhythm of his day job at the branding agency, but everything felt slightly off-kilter, like a table with one leg just a little too short. The office was the same: fluorescent lights humming, coworkers slouched in ergonomic chairs trying to look productive, glass meeting rooms always half-occupied and echoing with words like “synergy” and “touchpoint.” But Evan noticed a subtle dislocation in himself. Conversations didn’t fully land. Music didn’t stir. Even his daily cappuccino tasted too milky. It wasn’t heartbreak. It was... consequence.

He didn’t text Rachel again. Not because he didn’t want to, but because her parting message had left little ambiguity. She hadn’t blocked him or called him names—she’d done something harder. She’d calmly withdrawn, and the dignity of that made reaching out feel invasive. There were no dramatic fights or long, winding goodbyes to dramatize later. Just the echo of someone who had decided her worth wasn’t worth being negotiated.

With Marissa, things were tentative but strangely charged. They had agreed—unspoken at first—that whatever lay between them had to reset. That meant new ground rules, more openness, fewer assumptions. When she texted him on Thursday asking if he wanted to join her at a gallery opening in Pilsen, he hesitated for only a moment before replying, “Absolutely. Tell me where and when.”

The gallery was a whitewashed former warehouse with exposed beams and terrible acoustics. A jazz trio was playing near the corner while guests in all shades of faux-boho milled around holding wine in small, cheap cups. The exhibit was a series of black-and-white photographs of abandoned places—schools, theaters, rural houses overtaken by vines. The artist had called it Vacant Memory. Evan wasn’t sure if the name was genius or pretentious, but he found himself pulled in anyway.

Marissa appeared beside him with two plastic glasses of red wine.

“They say the guy used to sneak into these places with nothing but a flashlight and a thirty-five-millimeter Nikon,” she said, handing him one of the glasses. “He got chased by a dog in Michigan. Lost a shoe.”

Evan smirked. “That sounds like the beginning of a horror movie.”

“That’s what makes it art,” she said, nudging his shoulder.

They wandered for a while. Evan found a photo of a piano in a room with collapsed rafters. The instrument looked like it had once been majestic, carved from cherry wood, now missing half its keys. For some reason, it made him think of Rachel—not in a longing way, but in recognition. Some things still haunt even when they’re no longer present.

Later, after the wine and the polite gallery talk, they ended up in Marissa’s car, an old Subaru with film canisters rolling around on the passenger side floor and a Polaroid of her dog clipped to the rearview mirror. She drove them to a taco truck she swore made better pastor than anywhere in the city. Evan didn’t argue.

They sat on the hood of her car under the weak glow of a nearby streetlamp, biting into tacos wrapped in greasy foil and talking about nothing for the first time since their chaotic beginning.

“You ever think about how most people don’t get second chances?” she asked, licking hot sauce off her thumb.

“Yeah,” Evan said. “I’ve thought about that a lot lately.”

She glanced at him sideways. “You’re not going to turn this into a self-help podcast moment, are you?”

“Only if you promise to rate and subscribe.”

She smiled, but it didn’t reach all the way. The silence stretched, comfortable but precarious.

“I’ve had guys lie to me before,” she said. “But at least they didn’t apologize. That sounds weird, I know. But your honesty... it threw me.”

“I didn’t want to keep pretending,” Evan said. “It felt like a trap I made for myself.”

She nodded slowly. “I think I can work with that. But if you lie again, I’m going to slash your tires and blame gentrification.”

He laughed. “Noted.”

For the first time in days, he felt like he could breathe normally.

Back at his apartment that night, Evan stood in front of his mirror brushing his teeth and caught sight of himself—shirt half untucked, hair tousled, a faint pink smudge of salsa near his collar. He didn’t look like a man in control. But he didn’t look lost either. Something in his expression had changed. Less polished. More present.

The next morning, Evan’s inbox was a minefield of tasks. The agency had landed a new tech startup and needed mockups for their entire brand identity—logos, color palettes, social media templates, the works. Evan dove into the project with a kind of relieved focus. It was easier to think in color schemes than moral gray areas. He designed a typeface that looked sleek but not sterile, layered in subtle shadows, and kept the branding clean but playful. He didn’t think about Rachel, or Marissa, or how fragile the last few days had felt. He just worked.

But life, like Marissa’s car, never stayed in one lane for long.

It was a text from Rachel on Saturday afternoon that derailed him.

Rachel: “Hey. Random, but did you leave your copy of The Master and Margarita in my bag that night? Found it today while looking for my headphones.”

His breath caught. He had, in fact, loaned it to her in passing when she said she’d never read it and he’d raved about it being “Kafka on vodka.”

He considered ignoring it. But he couldn’t.

Evan: “Yeah. That’s the one with all the scribbles in the margins. Keep it if you want. It suits you more than me.”

She replied two hours later.

Rachel: “I started reading it. You’re right—it’s weird and wonderful and very Russian. Anyway, thanks.”

No invitation. No bitterness. Just an update, like a final postcard from a journey that had already ended.

That night, Evan lay in bed thinking about the strange way life looped. Sometimes people exited softly, leaving their shape in your life like steam on glass. Others stayed and rearranged the furniture. Marissa was still there, curious and cautious. Rachel had stepped back, her silhouette fading behind the pages of a borrowed book. And Evan? He was somewhere in between—no longer the man who thought he could split his attention without consequence, but not yet someone with a fully clear map ahead.

On Sunday morning, Marissa invited him to a photo walk through the Garfield Park Conservatory.

It was a quiet, green wonderland—glass ceilings, humid air, and a riot of tropical plants in controlled chaos. She lent him an old camera and taught him how to load the film, how to gauge the light, how to frame something with intention. He wasn’t good at it. His photos came out crooked or overexposed. But she never laughed, only adjusted his fingers gently, showed him with patience how to see instead of look.

They sat on a bench near the fern room, both slightly sweaty, her head resting lightly against his shoulder.

“I like this version of you,” she murmured. “The one that’s not trying so hard to be impressive.”

He let out a breath. “I like this version of me, too.”

And in that moment, amid the wet hush of tropical leaves and the muted click of cameras in the distance, Evan felt something real take root—not perfect, not certain, but honest. And maybe, just maybe, that was the beginning of everything else.

The next week unfolded in small, careful increments. Evan and Marissa saw each other three times—each encounter stitched into the fabric of their slowly evolving relationship with deliberate care. They didn’t talk about exclusivity. They didn’t talk about the night Evan had double-booked himself. Instead, they made room for presence, for ordinary things: a late dinner after she wrapped a shoot, an impromptu trip to a flea market in Logan Square where Marissa bartered for a vintage lens, a quiet hour spent reorganizing the bookshelves in Evan’s apartment.

Marissa brought color into his world—not just metaphorically, but literally. She left behind a red scarf on his couch, a teal enamel mug in his sink, a sunflower-patterned notepad with film development notes stuck to his fridge. Evan noticed it in moments: her scent lingering faintly in the hallway, a song she hummed reappearing in his head hours later. These were not grand declarations, but subtle marks of belonging.

Still, beneath the surface, there was a tremor in Evan. Not fear exactly, but the residue of an unresolved equation. Rachel remained a ghost in his inbox, her name buried under promotional emails and project updates, but never truly gone. The copy of The Master and Margarita—now returned and placed back on his shelf—felt almost radioactive. He hadn't opened it since. It sat there like a reminder, not of guilt, but of a path untaken.

One evening, while Marissa was editing photos in his living room and Evan was in the kitchen making tea, she called out without looking up from her laptop, “Did you love her?”

Evan turned slowly, the kettle halfway to the stove. “What?”

She looked up. “Rachel. Did you love her?”

He set the kettle down.

“I didn’t know her long enough to call it that,” he said. “But I could’ve. Maybe.”

Marissa nodded and returned to her screen. “Okay.”

There was no accusation in her voice, but the air changed slightly, as if someone had opened a window in winter. Evan crossed the kitchen and sat beside her, watching the flicker of edited images on her screen—street scenes, portraits, still lifes.

“Does that scare you?” he asked.

“A little,” she admitted. “But not in a bad way. I’d rather deal with someone who’s capable of love than someone who’s still pretending not to need it.”

They sat in silence for a few minutes, the kind that felt like the settling of dust rather than absence. Outside, the city pulsed gently, neon signs glowing across the street, distant traffic moving in softened rhythm. Evan leaned back into the couch and closed his eyes. He was tired, but not the kind of tired that sleep solved. More like the exhaustion that came with change.

The next day brought a complication he didn’t see coming. At the agency, his manager pulled him aside with an offer—an eight-week opportunity to work in the firm’s Berlin satellite office. One of their clients there had a new product launch, and they needed someone who could bring Evan’s particular “creative fluency” to the table. It wasn’t a promotion exactly, but it was the kind of assignment that often led to one.

“You’ve got till Friday to decide,” his manager said. “Flights, housing, stipend—already lined up. You’d be back in time for Q4.”

Evan sat at his desk, staring at the open project window on his screen but not seeing any of it. Berlin. Eight weeks. A reset of sorts. The idea thrilled and unnerved him. He’d always envied people who moved abroad, even temporarily. People who packed light and lived out of sublets, who tried new languages without shame, who walked into unknown cities as if their very presence could stitch them into the local rhythm.

But there was Marissa now. And, weirdly, the ghost of Rachel. And maybe more than either—there was Evan himself, no longer quite sure if running was a form of exploration or evasion.

That night, he told Marissa about the offer.

They were walking along the lake, the breeze off the water strong enough to lift her hair into her face. She didn’t stop walking when he told her—didn’t even look surprised.

“Are you going to go?” she asked.

“I don’t know.”

She wrapped her scarf tighter. “Would you be going to get away, or to move toward something?”

He didn’t answer right away. The question was more complicated than it sounded.

Marissa stopped and turned to face him. “You don’t owe me a decision. But if you’re staying because of me, that’s not enough. Not yet. And if you’re going because of me, that’s not fair either.”

He looked at her then. She wasn’t accusing him. She wasn’t pleading. She was just asking him to be honest with himself.

“I’ve never been that far from here,” he admitted. “Not really. It’s stupid, but Berlin sounds like someone else’s life.”

“Maybe it is,” she said. “But it doesn’t have to be.”

They walked in silence after that, their steps soft on the gravel path. It didn’t feel like a fight. It felt like the prelude to one of those forks in the road that quietly change everything.

Later that night, Evan opened a blank document on his laptop and started writing—not for work, not for anyone else, just for himself. He didn’t know what he was writing yet. A list? A letter? A confession? But he kept going. The words came in fragments:

“What I think I want: to feel new again. To learn to be alone without feeling empty. To not mistake motion for growth. To choose something for myself that isn’t about approval or fear.”

He wrote until the words stopped, and then he sat with them, quietly.

On Friday, he accepted the Berlin assignment.

He didn’t tell Marissa immediately. Not because he was hiding it, but because he wanted to make sure he wasn’t telling her in hopes she’d stop him. She deserved more than to be someone’s tether or escape hatch.

He told her on Saturday, over brunch, in the sun-drenched patio of a small café that served cardamom pancakes and bottomless espresso.

Her reaction was calm, but not unreadable.

“So, eight weeks,” she said, sipping her coffee. “That’s not forever.”

“It’s not,” Evan said. “But it’s something.”

She nodded, staring into her cup. “Do you want to try long distance? Or leave it open-ended?”

He reached across the table, took her hand. “I want to try. But I also want to be honest that it’s going to be messy.”

“I’m a photographer,” she said with a small smile. “I like messy.”

And just like that, something fragile but strong passed between them.

That night, back at his apartment, Evan started making lists: what to pack, what to leave, who to notify. But as he folded clothes and counted plug adapters, he didn’t feel like he was leaving a mess behind. He felt, for the first time in a while, like he was walking toward something—with eyes open, with fewer illusions.

And that, more than anything, felt like growth.

Chapter Three: Departures and Detours

The morning of Evan’s flight arrived cloaked in a surreal calm. The city had decided to be generous with its weather—clear skies, a crisp edge to the breeze, the kind of early autumn morning that whispered the end of one chapter and the subtle promise of another. Evan stood by the window of his apartment, a half-packed suitcase open on the bed behind him, watching the street below. A man in a neon vest was unlocking his bike from a lamp post. A woman walked briskly with a dachshund in tow, the little dog’s ears flapping with each step. Life moved forward.

Evan’s bags were lighter than he expected. He’d spent years accumulating things that no longer felt necessary—old tech gear, college hoodies, kitchen gadgets he never used. When it came time to prepare for Berlin, he only wanted to bring what served him. Two pairs of good shoes, a few layered outfits, his favorite books, his laptop, a well-worn notebook. Everything else stayed.

Marissa arrived at ten, carrying two paper cups of coffee and a small brown box tied with string.

“I didn’t wrap it,” she said, handing it over. “But I promise it’s not a farewell bomb.”

Evan smiled and undid the string. Inside was a compact film camera—vintage, black leather trim, with a fresh roll of Kodak Gold already loaded.

“It still works,” she said. “Mostly. You have to finesse the shutter a little. It’s kind of like dating me.”

He turned the camera in his hands, surprised by how warm it felt. Not just physically—emotionally, almost. A strange comfort, as though he’d been handed a pocket-sized version of her.

“You sure?” he asked.

Marissa shrugged. “I’ve got like four others. Besides, you’ll see things over there I’ll never get to shoot. You can be my proxy.”

They drank their coffee in his small kitchen, elbows brushing, knees touching, the silence between them intimate but tempered. Neither tried to fill the void with empty reassurances. Neither promised what they couldn’t. That was the thing about Marissa—she didn’t try to make the hard things easy. She just stayed present while you felt them.

At the airport, Evan checked his bag and moved through security with a low-level hum of nerves running under his skin. It wasn’t just about the flight. It was the bigness of the shift. The uncertainty. The knowledge that he wasn’t entirely sure who he would be when he came back—or even if he would want to come back the same.

Before he boarded, Marissa stood on the other side of the glass, waving. She mouthed something. At first he didn’t catch it, then she repeated it with exaggerated clarity.

“Don’t forget to live.”

He smiled. Nodded. And turned away before the ache had time to bloom into something harder to carry.

The flight was long and strange, a pocket of suspended time. He didn’t sleep, despite his intentions. Instead, he read a few chapters of a travel memoir he'd bought on impulse, nibbled at tasteless airline food, stared out the window at the stars scattered across the sky like punctuation marks in a silent sentence.

Berlin greeted him with gray skies and the smell of rain on pavement. The taxi ride from the airport took him through winding streets of graffiti-tagged brick, pastel buildings, cyclists weaving between cars, and pedestrians in scarves moving with enviable certainty. The air felt different—cooler, crisper, laden with a kind of history that hummed under every surface.

The agency’s temporary apartment was tucked in the Prenzlauer Berg district—fourth floor, narrow stairwell, the building’s bones echoing each step. Inside, it was sparse but clean: a bed, a desk, a tiny kitchenette, and a window overlooking a courtyard where ivy curled up the brick walls like something out of a forgotten novel.

Evan unpacked slowly, methodically. He placed Marissa’s camera on the desk, next to his laptop. He pinned a small photo of Chicago’s skyline to the bulletin board above the bed, more out of habit than sentiment. And then he sat on the floor, cross-legged, trying to understand what it meant to be untethered.

Work began the next morning. The Berlin office was smaller than Chicago’s—sleeker, more minimalist. There were glass walls and standing desks and more tattoos than suits. Everyone spoke flawless English, though Evan tried to greet them with his beginner’s German out of courtesy.

The project—branding a new sustainable app aimed at streamlining home energy use—was interesting enough. It gave him something to focus on. Yet what surprised him more was how quickly he settled into the rhythm of the city. Mornings with espresso from the café below his building. Long walks after work through neighborhoods that smelled of bread and damp stone. Occasional beers with coworkers who, despite their aloof exteriors, warmed quickly once they knew you could laugh at yourself.

He sent Marissa postcards—old-school, handwritten, stamped.

“There’s a mural on my block of a giant bear wearing a crown. You’d love it.”

“Found a bookstore where the cat sleeps on the register. Bought a novel I can’t read. Feels romantic somehow.”

“Took the tram the wrong way and ended up at a cemetery. Took three photos. Hope one turns out.”

She replied through email and voice messages, her tone always light but never dismissive. They weren’t keeping up constant contact, but their connection didn’t feel diminished. If anything, distance seemed to crystallize something—what was essential, what was real.

One night, after a particularly long meeting, Evan wandered to a bar called Das Gift, a Scottish pub run by a former artist and full of Berliners and ex-pats who nursed their drinks like they were holding conversations with them. He found a seat by the window, ordered a dark beer, and scribbled in his notebook.

He didn’t realize someone had sat down next to him until he heard a voice.

“Are you Evan Mulroney?”

He turned, startled. A woman with sharp features and blunt-cut bangs looked at him with bemused curiosity.

“Uh—yes?”

“I’m a friend of Rachel’s. She mentioned you were working here. I thought I recognized you from her photos.”

Evan blinked, heart suddenly doing a small, frantic shuffle in his chest. “Sorry—Rachel who?”

The woman laughed. “Rachel Locke. From Chicago. We went to undergrad together. She was here last month for a publishing summit. Talked about you a lot more than she meant to.”

Evan swallowed. “I didn’t know she was in Berlin.”

“Yeah, she didn’t tell many people. She was pretty... closed-off that week. Nice, but distracted. She mentioned you, though. Said things ended complicatedly.”

“That’s one word for it.”

The woman smiled, eyes softening. “She left a copy of that Russian novel you liked at my place. Said she couldn’t read it without thinking of you.”

Evan stared at his half-finished beer. The room felt heavier suddenly, as though gravity had thickened in the corners.

“Thanks for telling me,” he said.

She nodded and slipped him a card with her name and number. “If you want to get coffee sometime, no pressure. It’s just... strange how small the world can feel.”

After she left, Evan stepped outside. The air was sharp and electric. His breath came out in little clouds, and for a moment he leaned against the side of the bar, phone buzzing in his pocket, unread messages waiting.

He pulled out Marissa’s camera instead. Lifted it. Framed the neon reflection in a puddle on the cobblestone. Clicked.

The shutter stuck a little. He adjusted. Clicked again.

Then he walked back to his apartment through the quiet dark, Berlin’s silence wrapped around him like a language he was just beginning to understand.

Evan didn’t mention the chance encounter at the bar to Marissa. It wasn’t that he was hiding it—at least not in the way he had hidden things before—but rather, he didn’t know what it meant. Rachel hadn’t reached out directly, hadn’t sent a message or followed up. Her absence was intact, whole, almost sacred. And still, the idea of her—talking about him to someone else, walking the same streets he now wandered—unsettled something.

The next few days passed in a quiet haze. His work picked up momentum, the Berlin team increasingly leaning on him for creative direction. There was a pitch scheduled with the client, a sleek Norwegian tech company with a minimalist vision and unforgiving expectations. Evan found that the pressure suited him here, in this city where anonymity wrapped around him like a blanket. In Chicago, he had often second-guessed himself. Here, he felt free to decide without overthinking.

Still, the city could be lonely in its brilliance. He would spend hours walking through markets filled with brash voices and bright vegetables, only to return to a silence that pressed in around the edges. One evening, he stood on the Oberbaum Bridge, watching the Spree River reflect orange streetlight and the slow movement of boats beneath. A couple nearby leaned against the railing, arms wrapped around each other. They spoke in a language he didn’t understand, but their closeness translated easily.

Back in his apartment, he sat on the windowsill, knees drawn up, the film camera in his lap. He’d taken rolls’ worth of pictures already—cracked tiles, street art, people on bikes, a dog sleeping under a bench. He hadn’t developed any yet. He liked the mystery of not knowing how they’d turned out.

His phone buzzed with a message from Marissa. A voice note.

He hesitated, then played it.

“Hey you. I was walking through the art supply store today and saw a little sticker that said ‘Don’t just exist, rebel’ and I thought, yep, that’s very Berlin. And also very you now. Hope you’re not letting your hair grow into some tortured European mop. I miss you. Not in the needy way, in the annoying way—like I miss teasing you in person. Anyway. No pressure to call back. Just wanted to send a sound into your night.”

Evan replayed it once, then set the phone down. There was a pang in his chest he didn’t know how to label—longing, maybe. Gratitude. A kind of tether, subtle but firm.

The next morning, a brown envelope arrived at his apartment. No return address. Inside was a black-and-white photograph. It was grainy, printed on matte paper. The image: a street corner he recognized in Kreuzberg, an older man reading a newspaper on a milk crate, a pigeon mid-flight in the foreground. On the back, a single sentence:

“Found this moment. Thought you’d appreciate it. –R”

He sat down, slowly. Held the photo for a long time.

Rachel.

She had been here. Maybe still was. Or maybe this was her way of closing the loop. It didn’t ask for a response. Didn’t require anything of him. Just a gesture—a still frame from a city they never got to share.

He didn’t tell Marissa.

Instead, he carried the photograph in his coat pocket for a week, pulling it out sometimes when waiting for the train or sitting in a café. Not to study it, but to remember that he wasn’t alone in his capacity to remember. People could carry pieces of each other without asking permission. Sometimes that’s all they could do.

A week later, he finally went to the film lab. It was a small place near Schönhauser Allee, run by a retired journalist who wore suspenders and spoke English with a Danish accent. Evan handed over four rolls, uncertain what he expected.

When he came back two days later to pick up the prints, the old man handed him the envelope with a small, approving nod.

“You see the world like someone who’s learning to forget himself,” he said cryptically. “That’s rare.”

Evan chuckled awkwardly. “Thanks... I think?”

Back in his apartment, he spread the photos across the floor. Some were blurry, some overexposed. But others held something arresting: a little girl chasing a balloon near the Brandenburg Gate, a busker framed perfectly between columns, Marissa’s camera on the desk catching golden afternoon light through the window. He stared at that one longer than the rest.

Later that evening, Evan finally called Marissa.

She picked up on the second ring. “I was starting to think you forgot how phones work.”

“I was waiting for the right photo to send,” he said. “Turns out, I found it.”

“Yeah?” she asked. “What’s in it?”

“Light,” he said. “The kind I didn’t know I missed.”

There was a pause on the line, then a soft laugh. “Okay, poet. Send it over. I’ll pretend I’m not swooning.”

After they hung up, Evan sat by the window again, listening to the city breathe beneath him. He was starting to think of Berlin not just as a backdrop, but as part of his interior landscape. Its contradictions suited him—the quiet chaos, the order beneath mess, the solemn beauty in decay. He still didn’t know what would happen when the eight weeks were over. But for once, that uncertainty didn’t scare him.

He had another drink with the woman who knew Rachel—her name was Lina. They met again at Das Gift, and this time they talked longer. She was a graphic designer, divorced, with a dry sense of humor and a fondness for dystopian novels. She asked him, casually, if he was seeing anyone. He hesitated.

“Sort of,” he said. “It’s not simple.”

“It never is,” she replied, raising her glass.

He didn’t flirt. Didn’t stay too long. But walking home, he realized something had shifted in him. Not guilt, not temptation—just a growing awareness of choice. Of the lives we build through what we accept, and what we let pass.

On Sunday, Evan wrote another letter—this time to himself.

“You thought love had to be dramatic, high-stakes, an either-or. But it doesn’t. Sometimes it’s quiet. Sometimes it’s choosing to show up every day, even when you're afraid of being ordinary.”

He folded the page, tucked it into his notebook, and took the camera with him to the canal. The sky was overcast, and people were bundled in scarves, couples walking dogs, kids on scooters. He took pictures of hands, of reflections in puddles, of a pair of gloves forgotten on a bench. He wasn’t documenting a trip anymore—he was capturing a life, however brief, in motion.

By the time he returned to his apartment, there was a voice message from Marissa.

“Guess what?” she said, breathless. “I got the grant. The one for the New Mexico desert shoot. It’s four weeks. I leave in November. How wild is that? You go to Berlin. I go to the desert. We’re so bad at normal timelines. But maybe that’s our thing.”

He listened to the message twice. Then smiled.

Maybe it was their thing.

And maybe it wasn’t about waiting for life to settle, or for someone else to make it clear. Maybe it was about finding rhythm in the in-between, choosing each other even across time zones, and trusting that connection didn’t always mean proximity.

Evan looked around the apartment, now filled with little signs of habitation: a scarf on the chair, books on the windowsill, a bowl of plums ripening in the kitchen. The borrowed camera sat on the desk, ready for another roll.

He had six weeks left in Berlin.

And for the first time in his life, he wasn’t counting down.

Chapter Four: Strange Equilibrium

The fourth week brought rain. Not the dramatic, theatrical kind, but a persistent drizzle that soaked the city in quiet melancholy. Sidewalks shimmered with damp reflections of bicycle lights and streetcars. The trees lining the avenues wept gently onto parked cars and folding umbrellas. Berlin didn’t stop for the weather—it merely adjusted its gait. Evan found he liked that. People moved on, wet sleeves and all.

By now, his days had settled into a rhythm so precise it startled him. He rose early—before the city’s pulse quickened—made coffee in the tiny press he’d picked up at a flea market, and watched the courtyard wake up. There was an elderly man who swept the walkway each morning, whistling tunelessly. A woman in a red coat walked her dog—a solemn Schnauzer that looked like it’d been a bureaucrat in another life. The details repeated like lyrics. Familiar. Steady.

Evan had begun to speak German in hesitant, practical fragments. Enough to order bread at the corner bakery. Enough to say “no bag, thank you” or “just one espresso, please.” It humbled him, fumbling through even the simplest things, but there was an honesty in that, too. When he misunderstood someone, there was laughter but no malice. In his brokenness, he was still received.

The project at the agency neared completion. There were late nights now, deadline-induced pizza, back-to-back Zooms with Chicago, and moments of genuine creative flow. His coworkers had warmed to him—he’d even been invited out twice for drinks, which, in Berlin terms, meant he was no longer a stranger. He noticed that he no longer introduced himself with a disclaimer: “I’m just here temporarily.” He simply was.

But it was the spaces between the work—the hours without screens, the conversations with no agenda—that grounded him most.

One of those came on a Saturday when Lina, the graphic designer who had once recognized him as “the guy Rachel talked about,” invited him to a photography exhibition near Neukölln. It was underground—literally—a converted U-Bahn station with vaulted ceilings and exposed brick. The theme was Memory Through Obstruction. Abstract, yes. But compelling. The photographs were printed large and framed with brutal simplicity. Faces obscured by glass. Landscapes folded through mirrors. Letters burned but not destroyed.

As they walked the dim corridors of the gallery, Lina turned to him with a half-smile.

“She used to love this stuff,” she said softly.

“Rachel?”

“Yeah. The more cryptic, the better.”

Evan nodded. “She always saw the layers. Sometimes before they existed.”

There was a long pause before Lina added, “I think she cared about you more than she let on.”

Evan didn’t respond right away. He didn’t know how to. He was learning that some truths didn’t require a counterpoint. They simply hung in the air, like unclaimed jackets on a hook.

They parted ways after the exhibit. Lina kissed him on the cheek in the European way and waved as she disappeared into the crowd, leaving Evan with a strange mix of gratitude and something more difficult to name.

That evening, Evan sat at his desk and wrote a letter to Rachel.

He didn’t plan to send it. That wasn’t the point. It was a ritual, like lighting a candle or folding a flag. He wrote about the photograph she’d sent. About how Berlin had changed him—not into someone new, but into someone more aware. He told her about the bakery down the street and the film lab with the Danish man and how he’d stopped counting his days here. Then he thanked her. For leaving when she did. For not chasing resolution. For letting him grow without asking to witness it.

He folded the letter and slid it between the pages of The Master and Margarita, which now sat on his nightstand again. Not radioactive anymore. Just a book. One with history, yes, but also peace.

Meanwhile, Marissa remained a soft and steady voice in his life. They weren’t in constant contact, but that was by design. Every few days, they exchanged messages—voice notes, photos, occasionally short video calls when time zones aligned. There was something delicious about the slowness, the way distance gave shape to their conversations.

One night, she sent him a three-minute recording of wind rushing through cholla cacti in New Mexico, paired with a grainy image of the desert under a fat moon. Her voice followed: “This place is quiet in a way that makes your bones ache. I love it. I miss you.”

He played it four times.

He responded with a picture of his courtyard under rain and said, “Come see it someday. I think you’d like the silence here, too.”

It was an unspoken agreement—they weren’t labeling anything. But they weren’t drifting either. What held them wasn’t proximity. It was curiosity. Patience. The belief that they were both in a becoming phase, and there was time to meet again fully formed.

One afternoon, Evan took a tram to Grunewald, a quiet forest on the outskirts of the city. He packed a notebook, a bottle of water, a sandwich. He spent hours wandering through pine trees, photographing bark and shadows and birds that refused to pose. At some point, he found a small clearing and sat on a fallen log, watching the light scatter through the branches.

He wrote in his journal:

“I think I used to mistake movement for growth. Now I know growth sometimes looks like stillness. Like sitting long enough to hear your own noise fade into the background.”

As the sun dipped low and the temperature dropped, he stood and walked slowly back to the tram, his mind quiet.

That night, he cooked dinner for the first time in weeks. Something simple—pasta, olives, garlic, soft cheese. He played jazz through the tiny speaker on the windowsill, let the steam fog the panes, drank wine from a chipped glass he’d found in the cabinet.

He thought, for a moment, about inviting someone over. But he didn’t. Not because he was lonely—because he wasn’t. But because the evening felt whole as it was. A kind of contentment he hadn’t expected to find in solitude.

As he sat at the table, twirlin
