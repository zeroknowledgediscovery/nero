Title: Gridiron & Grimoires
Chapter One: The Field and the Flame

Jaxson Wilder wasn’t used to sitting still. On the turf, he moved like smoke—slipping tackles, reading gaps, juking defenders like they were made of mist. Quarterback for the Chicago Cyclones, three-time MVP, cover of every sports magazine in North America. But on this chilly Tuesday morning, Jaxson sat alone in his high-rise penthouse, staring at a worn leather-bound book that didn’t belong in any locker room.

The title etched in crumbling gold letters read: The Veil Unseen: An Initiate’s Guide to Arcane Foundations. It had no author, no publisher, and he sure as hell hadn’t bought it. It had just… appeared. Dropped in his gym bag between a protein shaker and a pair of cleats, like some weird joke.

He’d tossed it aside at first. Then he’d tried to throw it out, but it kept showing back up. On his kitchen counter. His car seat. Even once on the field, during pregame warm-ups, tucked beneath a pylon.

Now, ten days later, he was flipping it open for the first time, though he didn’t know why.

“Chapter One: Energy is Memory,” he read aloud. The letters shimmered faintly, dancing like candlelight on the page. Jaxson blinked. “Okay. Nope.”

He snapped the book shut. It thudded with more weight than seemed natural. Heavy like a helmet filled with lead. He set it down.

Then it flipped open again.

“Nope,” Jaxson muttered again, backing away.

The pages turned on their own, stopping at a passage written in a jagged, ink-dark script: “Every world has a game. Magic is the game between the threads of reality. Learn its rules, and you may bend the score in your favor.”

Jaxson closed his eyes. Maybe it was all a symptom of his latest concussion. Or the stress of the Cyclones' playoff loss to the Raiders. Maybe he was cracking.

Then his phone buzzed.

Coach Braddock. He let it ring.

Then another buzz. Unknown Number. And a text: "You opened the book. Meet me at 18th and Wabash. Midnight. Bring nothing."

He stared.

And against every ounce of reason in his brain and body, Jaxson showed up.

The intersection at 18th and Wabash was dead at midnight, except for a single flickering gas lamp that hadn’t been part of Chicago’s infrastructure in at least a century. Jaxson parked his car a block away and walked in a hoodie, basketball shorts, and Nike slides. He looked ridiculous. He felt ridiculous.

Then a voice came from behind him.

“Wilder. You’re late.”

He turned fast. A woman stood in the middle of the intersection wearing what looked like a blacksmith’s apron over a leather trench coat. Her eyes glowed faintly violet in the gaslight. Jaxson instinctively took a step back.

“Uh—who are you?”

“Name’s Lira. I’m your sponsor.”

“My what?”

“You opened the book. That makes you a candidate. You were marked when you first touched it.” She nodded toward the star-shaped tattoo that had appeared on his left palm last week—he’d thought it was some new ink he drunkenly got in Miami. “That symbol binds you to the Veil. Which means now, you either learn how to wield it, or die from it.”

Jaxson looked around. “Is this a prank? Is this one of those TikTok cult things?”

Lira smiled grimly. “Sure. Let’s call it that. Come with me.”

She turned and walked straight into a brick wall—and vanished.

Jaxson stood dumbfounded. Then curiosity, the same trait that got him to watch game film for 11 hours straight and practice no-look shovel passes until his arms went numb, took over. He stepped toward the wall.

And fell through it.

The other side looked nothing like Chicago. More like an alleyway made of shifting glass and smoke. The air was warm and smelled like burnt cinnamon. Torches floated in midair.

Lira was already twenty feet ahead.

“Keep up,” she said. “This place doesn’t like hesitation.”

Jaxson jogged to catch up, the sound of his slides echoing awkwardly in the shimmering alley. “Okay, so… magic’s real?”

“As real as gravity. Just harder to measure.”

“And the book?”

“It chooses people who’ve already touched the edge. Sometimes athletes, sometimes artists, sometimes lunatics. You—you’re borderline.”

“Gee, thanks.”

They stopped in front of a wooden door carved with hundreds of runes. Lira tapped it twice. It melted into fog, revealing a spiraling staircase lit by floating blue orbs.

“Training begins now,” she said.

Jaxson hesitated. “I have practice tomorrow. Interviews. Press junkets—”

Lira raised an eyebrow. “You can go back. Try to pretend the Veil isn’t real. You’ll start seeing things. Shadows in your peripheral vision. Voices in hotel mirrors. By then, it’ll be too late. You either step forward now, or you’re out.”

He looked down at his marked palm. The star pulsed faintly.

“…Screw it.”

He walked through.

The first week was the worst.

Jaxson had thought two-a-days in August heat were brutal, but learning to control the threads of the Veil made that look like recess. Spells weren’t cast with wands—they were woven, with intention, memory, and emotion. He had to relive his most intense moments—wins, losses, betrayals—and twist those memories into sigils.

He failed. Repeatedly.

During a weaving trial, he accidentally summoned a storm of flaming footballs that smashed half the training room. During focus training, he slipped into a trance and started reciting Cyclones plays from 2022 until he passed out. The instructors—beings cloaked in shifting ink and static—barely tolerated him.

But Lira didn’t give up on him.

She trained him late into the night, using methods that blurred the line between coaching and torment. She made him recall the exact moment he fumbled the championship ball in 2023. Then channel that shame into a binding rune.

“You’re trying to brute force it,” she said once, shoving his shoulder as he failed another thread pull. “This isn’t the field. You can’t overpower it.”

“What if that’s all I know how to do?” he snapped.

“Then learn something else.”

He hated her. Then he respected her. Eventually, he trusted her.

By month two, he could split fire into fractals and shape them into moving images—he made one of the final touchdown he scored against the Falcons and cried watching it flicker.

By month three, he could bend light around himself and walk unseen through the training hall.

By month four, he returned to the NFL.

It was meant to be a cover. He needed the money, the status, the media presence. The Veil’s enemies were watching for people who stepped out of its order. Hiding in plain sight as a football god? Perfect.

Except the powers didn’t stay hidden.

During a game against Dallas, he felt the opposing quarterback shift—just slightly—the threads of reality. Not enough for fans to notice. But Jaxson did.

He wasn’t the only Veilborn in the league.

Back in the locker room, Jaxson confronted him.

Tyrell Moore. Giants’ golden boy. Rookie of the Year two seasons ago.

“I saw you twist the snap,” Jaxson whispered. “Right before halftime. That wasn’t just instinct.”

Tyrell didn’t deny it.

“You’re a threadweaver,” he said. “Didn’t think you’d wake up so fast.”

“How many of us are there?”

Tyrell just smirked. “Enough.”

Then he walked away.

And in that moment, Jaxson knew that the field was just another arena in a much older, stranger war.

And he wasn’t even close to ready.

Jaxson didn’t sleep that night.

After the confrontation with Tyrell Moore, the locker room had felt colder, more distant. Everything was too quiet. The hum of the fluorescent lights buzzed like interference in his ears, and every face around him blurred into an indistinct smear of smiles, chatter, and cleats clacking on the tiles. When he finally made it back to his condo, he tossed his duffel bag aside and paced until dawn, eyes tracing the skyline like it might hold answers.

Who else knew? How many more players—teammates, rivals—were like him? Magic in the league? What did that even mean? Had this been going on for years? Decades?

And what was Tyrell’s angle?

The next morning, he returned to the Hall of Threads—Lira’s term for the strange spiraling space hidden beneath Chicago, where the Veil flowed most openly. The entrance was tucked between a shuttered jazz club and a Lithuanian bakery, behind a metal door that never rusted and could only be opened by drawing a circle in the air with your breath.

Lira was already waiting inside, brewing something that smelled like tree sap and motor oil over a fireless stove. Her apron was smeared with crimson chalk and scorched thread remnants. When she saw him, she didn’t even greet him, just said, “You saw one.”

He nodded slowly, still shaken. “Tyrell Moore. Quarterback. He twisted the snap, made it jump the line. Clean as silk.”

“I warned you,” she said, pouring the thick black liquid into two cracked mugs. “The Veil’s been bleeding into sports for longer than you'd think. It’s a natural fit. Precision, emotion, instinct. The playing field’s practically a ritual circle.”

“Why doesn’t anyone stop it? Expose it?”

“You think anyone would believe a story like this? And even if they did, it’s not illegal. Not technically. The Veil isn’t governed by your laws—it’s older. And besides, most of the ones who use it don’t abuse it. They just… bend the odds.”

Jaxson took a sip. The drink burned like whiskey but left his tongue tasting of iron and pine. “But someone is abusing it. I can feel it. Something’s off.”

Lira didn’t speak for a long time. Then she leaned against the counter and folded her arms. “There’s a faction,” she said finally. “They call themselves the Second Signal. They believe the Veil should rule—not hide. They’ve infiltrated media, politics… even sports. Tyrell’s likely one of theirs.”

“So what happens now?”

“You train harder. You stop thinking like an athlete and start thinking like a mage. If you want to survive, Jaxson, you’ll have to do more than throw fireballs and weave light.”

He exhaled sharply and set the mug down.

“Fine. Let’s go again.”

That afternoon, Lira took him deeper into the Hall. Through mirrored corridors that reflected memories instead of faces. Across bridges spun from threads of music—each step reverberating with the echoes of some long-lost lullaby. They stopped before a vault door shaped like a giant spiral shell.

“This is where we test resilience,” she said. “Inside is the Echo Chamber. It will show you every failure, every fear. The ones that live in your bones. You can’t fight it. You have to walk through.”

“Like some kind of vision quest?”

“No. More like surgery without anesthetic.”

Jaxson hesitated. Then stepped inside.

The chamber closed behind him, and silence swallowed everything.

At first, he saw himself on the turf again—2019, the Wildcard Game. Fumble on the 1-yard line. The crowd’s roar turned to a groan, and he felt the weight of a city’s disappointment crush his ribs like glass. Then the scene twisted. The locker room after. His father’s voicemail: “You’re losing your edge, son. Might be time to think about other things.”

Then more.

The night his college teammate overdosed and Jaxson didn’t return the last call.

The face of the girl he loved and left in Baton Rouge without goodbye.

The moment he realized his fame had grown too big for real friendships.

All of it bled together—waves of guilt and dread until he couldn’t tell where one memory ended and another began. His hands shook. The mark on his palm flared.

He fell to his knees.

“This isn’t who I am!” he screamed.

And that’s when the chamber changed.

It wasn’t memories anymore. It was him. Multiple versions. A Jaxson who stayed in college and got a coaching gig. A Jaxson who blew out his knee and never went pro. A Jaxson who took the book and burned it.

They circled him, eyes full of contempt and pity. One of them leaned down. “You think learning a few tricks makes you special? You think you matter?”

And Jaxson stood.

“Yeah,” he said through clenched teeth. “I do. Because I’m still here.”

With that, the chamber snapped back. He was standing alone, soaked in sweat, breathing like he’d just run wind sprints for an hour. The door creaked open. Lira stood on the other side.

“Well,” she said, not smiling but less hard than usual. “You didn’t scream as much as most.”

He laughed, but it cracked in his throat. “How long was I in there?”

“About five minutes.”

Jaxson didn’t reply. Five minutes. It had felt like a lifetime.

Later that week, he returned to Cyclones practice. Something had shifted. He wasn’t just seeing the game now—he was feeling it. Patterns moved through the playbook like sigils. Blocking schemes shimmered with hidden geometries. Even his spiral throws curved with a quiet whisper of intention.

His coach noticed.

“Wilder, you’re sharper than usual. New diet?”

“Something like that,” Jaxson replied, grinning.

But not everyone was happy.

Tyrell Moore started sending messages. Nothing overt—just glances across the field, subtle flickers of Veil threads nudged in Jaxson’s direction. Once, a free safety hit him harder than should’ve been physically possible—and Jaxson swore he felt a spell wrapped around the tackle, like a coiled spring.

He confronted Tyrell again after a game.

“You trying to send a message?” he asked, backing the man against a locker.

Tyrell didn’t even blink. “Only that you’re not the only one on the board. You think magic makes you different? It just makes the game deeper. You’re either in it, or under it.”

“I’m not on your team.”

Tyrell leaned close. “You will be. Or you’ll lose everything.”

Jaxson didn’t flinch. But inside, something twisted.

Not fear.

Anticipation.

The game had changed. And Jaxson Wilder was just getting warmed up.

Late that night, he returned to the Hall of Threads and found Lira poring over an old parchment, her brow furrowed. She didn’t look up when he entered.

“What’s wrong?” he asked.

She tapped the scroll. “A new name surfaced. Another Veilborn.”

“Let me guess. Sports?”

“Worse. Broadcasting. A former player. Big following. Big mouth.”

Jaxson leaned over the scroll. The name written in red ink sent a chill up his spine.

“Bryce Delaney.”

He hadn’t heard that name in five years. Former teammate. Best friend. The man who’d taught him everything about handling fame—and then vanished after a scandal that had never quite made sense.

“Thought he was done.”

“So did everyone,” Lira said softly. “But he’s not just active. He’s climbing. And he’s Second Signal.”

The room went still. Jaxson’s fists clenched.

“Then we need to stop him.”

Lira looked at him. Her violet eyes hard. “Are you ready to go to war?”

He didn’t hesitate.

“Yeah,” he said. “I’m done playing safe.”

Chapter Two: Shadows in the Broadcast

Rain slid down the windows of the old radio tower like melted glass, streaking the city’s lights into nervous blurs. Inside, behind soundproof walls and vintage microphones that hadn’t worked in twenty years, Bryce Delaney stood in front of a black mirror that reflected nothing but the shimmer of magic—raw, red, and whispering.

He wasn’t the same man who used to run routes for the Cyclones, laughing on the sidelines and making the league’s top corners look like toddlers. His face was leaner now, his smile too practiced, and his voice—once smooth and easy—carried an edge honed by secrets.

“You’ve been reckless,” said a voice from the other end of the room. A woman emerged from the shadows, her features sharp as cut glass and framed by hair so white it looked sculpted from chalk. “The League is watching. The Veil’s threads ripple every time you speak.”

Bryce didn’t turn. “That’s the point, Dahlia. Let them feel the tremors.”

“You’re not supposed to shake the world yet,” she snapped. “The council agreed—”

“The council’s asleep,” he interrupted, his voice low but hard. “And I’m done waiting for them to wake up.”

He pressed his palm against the mirror. The red light pulsed, and a dozen whispers escaped—fragments of truth twisted into slogans, pieces of narratives he’d been leaking into broadcasts, podcasts, and halftime commentaries. All subtle. All coded. All intentional.

Bryce Delaney wasn’t just a pundit. He was a gatekeeper. And now, a recruiter.

“We have Jaxson Wilder’s attention,” he said. “That’s all I wanted.”

Dahlia’s mouth curled downward. “He’s not ready. And you might’ve just thrown gasoline on a bonfire.”

“Good,” Bryce said, finally smiling. “Let him burn.”

Jaxson couldn’t shake the name. Bryce Delaney. It echoed in his head through practices, media scrums, and long, restless nights in the Hall. They’d been close—once. Bryce had mentored him, shielded him from agents with teeth like razors, taught him how to manage endorsements without selling his soul. Then Bryce had disappeared. One day he was leading the league in receptions, the next he was gone—no press conference, no farewell, just gone.

The scandal that followed was vague. “Conduct violations.” “Personal matters.” Jaxson hadn’t bought it then, and now he knew why.

Lira wasted no time. She pressed deeper into the Veil’s records, using threads of memory stored in the Archive—a place so unstable it required three wards just to enter. There, old names flickered in magical ink and long-forgotten allegiances glowed beneath the surface.

“Delaney didn’t just vanish,” she explained as they sat among floating pages and glowing tomes. “He transitioned. Left the field and took a position with the Signal’s outer ring. They call it ‘Broadcasting’—a manipulation craft. Threadweaving through media. Words, images, interviews—all subtly enchanted.”

“You mean like enchantments through ESPN?” Jaxson asked, half in disbelief.

“Wider than that. Think influence loops. Emotional triggers. Viewers watch a game recap, and suddenly public sentiment shifts. They craft narratives, reframe players. And they’re good at it.”

Jaxson thought of the past season. The way his own media image had started to change. The subtle hostility. The suggestions he was “distracted,” “fading,” even “unreliable.” Now it made sense. Someone was spinning the thread.

“They’re poisoning the public,” he said.

“They’re conditioning it.”

Lira’s words were cold, calculated. But Jaxson could see the fear behind them. This wasn’t just politics. This was war. Not with armies—but with attention.

The plan was simple in theory: infiltrate Delaney’s studio.

Delaney had transformed an abandoned theater on the edge of Logan Square into a studio headquarters. It broadcast late-night interviews, exclusive sports commentary, and a popular podcast known as Gridiron Truths. Jaxson had always found the show slick, smart, a little too on-the-nose—but now he knew why. Bryce wasn’t just narrating the game. He was rewriting it.

“You’ll need to threadwalk,” Lira said, handing Jaxson a vial of shimmering liquid. “In and out. Quiet. If Delaney senses you, he’ll trap you in a feedback loop.”

“Can he really do that?”

She didn’t answer.

The threadwalk was like slipping into a memory soaked in electricity. Time bent. Sounds doubled and reversed. Jaxson emerged inside the rafters of the theater, twenty feet above a gleaming set wrapped in gold-trimmed curtains. The floor was etched with a sigil he’d never seen—an ouroboros swallowing a football, surrounded by eyes.

Below, Bryce stood alone, reciting a monologue into a live mic.

“...and that’s the truth the league won’t tell you. The rules don’t matter anymore. The talent’s just a vessel. What matters now is perception. That’s the real scoreboard.”

Jaxson froze, hidden in the threads above.

Bryce paused.

Then turned.

“You’re not as subtle as you think, Wilder.”

The rafters shook. The sigil flared. Jaxson leapt down instinctively, rolling across the stage and drawing a defensive weave across his arm. Bryce didn’t flinch.

“You came here to what? Lecture me? Stop me?”

“I came here to understand,” Jaxson said. “And maybe to end this.”

Bryce laughed. “Then you really don’t get it. You think this is about you? About us?”

He stepped forward. His voice carried not just sound, but intent. Jaxson felt the weight of it in his lungs.

“This is about evolution. The Veil isn’t a secret anymore. It’s a tool. And those who know how to wield it? They’ll shape the new world.”

Jaxson drew his hand up. Flame danced across his knuckles.

“I won’t let you twist the game.”

“You think the game wasn’t always twisted?” Bryce asked. “I’m just making the rules visible.”

With a snap, the sigil burst to life. Threads of crimson light erupted from the floor, spiraling around Bryce in a cyclone. Jaxson raised his defense just in time as a wave of sound hit him like a speaker turned inside out.

The studio trembled.

Spells collided like blitzes.

Jaxson countered with a binding weave, anchoring himself in his favorite play—one he’d run a thousand times, a crossing route that won a national title. That memory surged, hardened, and wrapped him in protection.

Bryce retaliated with a mirage field—illusions of failure, echoes of commentators saying Jaxson’s best days were behind him. He gritted his teeth. He remembered the Echo Chamber. This wasn’t new.

“You’re not strong enough yet,” Bryce hissed.

“I’m not alone anymore,” Jaxson answered—and he wasn’t bluffing.

A portal snapped open on the far end of the theater, and Lira stepped through, arms blazing with light-thread.

Together, they struck.

When the smoke cleared, the stage was shattered. The sigil was dark. Bryce was gone—vanished mid-thread, leaving only a scorched echo and a looping fragment of his voice playing from a cracked speaker: “The rules don’t matter anymore...”

Lira turned to Jaxson, face pale, breathing hard. “He was testing you.”

“He saw everything I could do.”

“And everything you couldn’t.”

Jaxson picked up the remains of the mic, twisted and half-melted.

“We’re going to need more than training,” he said.

“We’re going to need allies,” Lira replied.

The next week, the Cyclones lost a game they should have dominated. Jaxson played well—but the chemistry was off. His wide receiver kept looking distracted, his left tackle missed a block that he never missed. The fans booed. Social media exploded.

“Is Jaxson Wilder losing his grip?”

The threads whispered louder now. The Second Signal was everywhere.

And Jaxson knew one thing for certain.

If they were going to win this war, they couldn’t just fight from the shadows.

They’d have to take the game back—on the field, in the spotlight, and through the Veil.

And the next time he faced Bryce, there’d be no retreat.

The fallout from the confrontation at the studio didn’t hit Jaxson all at once. It came in waves—some subtle, others violent. The first sign was a shift in how his teammates looked at him. Not with suspicion, exactly, but with uncertainty, like they sensed something in him had changed and weren’t sure if it was a good thing.

Coach Braddock pulled him aside after a rough practice. The man was grizzled, silver-bearded, and had seen more locker room drama than a reality TV director, but his voice that day held an edge it hadn’t before.

“Wilder,” Braddock said, his arms crossed like a steel gate. “You all right?”

“I’m fine, Coach. Just tired.”

Braddock eyed him. “You’ve been tired a lot lately. Off in your own world. And I’m not the only one noticing. The guys? They’re starting to wonder if your head’s still in this.”

“It is,” Jaxson said too quickly. “It is.”

The coach grunted and looked away. “This league’s a shark tank, son. If you bleed weird, they bite.”

Jaxson nodded and walked away. But inside, something twisted. Because Braddock was right. He was bleeding weird now—and he wasn’t sure how much longer he could hide it.

That night, in the Hall of Threads, he asked Lira the question that had been simmering in him for weeks.

“What happens if the Veil and the game can’t mix anymore?”

Lira didn’t look up from the spellwork she was engraving into a quartz tablet. “They already do. The question is whether they can survive each other.”

“I’m serious.”

“So am I.”

Jaxson exhaled slowly, fingers tracing the edge of the star-shaped sigil on his palm. “I can’t be both, can I? Not really.”

Lira finally looked at him. “That’s the choice every threadweaver has to face. You’re not the first athlete to straddle both paths. But if you keep trying to balance the field and the flame, one will eventually burn the other out.”

He didn’t sleep much after that.

Days passed. Games were played. The city moved on. But the whispers didn’t stop.

During a routine press conference, Jaxson caught something odd in one of the reporter’s questions.

“Jaxson, there’s been some talk around the league about your... changes this season. You’ve looked unpredictable. Stronger, even. Any thoughts?”

It was an innocuous question, one any QB could shrug off. But the way the reporter leaned into the word stronger—like it meant more than physical—it lit a warning bell in Jaxson’s head.

Later, he looked the man up. Marcus Vonn. Beat writer turned digital sports commentator. Had a sudden rise in the past year. Frequent guest on Gridiron Truths.

Threadmarked.

Lira confirmed it.

“He’s a caster,” she said, studying an old broadcast clip where Vonn’s eyes flickered with unnatural light. “Delaney’s mouthpiece. His job isn’t to report the game—it’s to shape how people see it.”

Jaxson slammed his fist on the table. “Then we expose him.”

“Too early. We need proof, and more importantly, we need someone to listen.”

“You think I can’t make them?”

“I think,” Lira said, choosing her words carefully, “you’re walking into a chess match thinking you’re still on a football field.”

That stung.

But it didn’t make her wrong.

Two days later, he got a message. Not through his phone, not through Veil channels—in the mail. A thick envelope, hand-addressed, sealed with a ring of wax bearing the shape of a broken helmet. Inside was a folded photograph of Bryce and another man—older, bald, with eyes like shattered stone. The back of the photo bore a single word:

"Farron."

Lira froze when she saw it.

“That’s bad,” she said.

“Who is he?”

“Not who. What. Farron was once a caster of Balance—a mediator between Veil factions. But something changed. He disappeared fifteen years ago. They said he went rogue. Now he’s one of the Architects.”

Jaxson frowned. “Architects?”

“They build realities. Not illusions—structures in the Veil. Echo-planes. Alternate fields of influence. Think of them like gods with a design fetish.”

“Delaney’s working with this guy?”

“Worse,” Lira muttered, “Delaney might be a piece on his board.”

The thought chilled Jaxson. He hadn’t even gotten through the mid-tier recruits and already the monsters at the top were stepping onto the field.

That Sunday, everything came to a head.

The Cyclones were playing a prime-time game against the New York Titans—a brutal, hard-hitting team with a chip the size of the Hudson on their collective shoulder. Tyrell Moore’s team.

The media made it sound like a grudge match. Former MVPs. Two high-caliber quarterbacks with everything to prove. But for Jaxson, it was more than a rivalry. It was reconnaissance. A chance to see how deep the Signal’s claws had dug into the league.

The game started clean. The first quarter was a chess match—Jaxson dodging blitzes, threading needles to his tight end. Tyrell responding with deep throws and a tempo offense that kept Chicago’s defense on its heels. But by the second half, the air started to thrum.

Literally.

Jaxson could feel the Veil stir.

It was subtle—referees hesitating just slightly before calls, receivers slipping through tackles like they were coated in oil, play-clock malfunctions that never showed up on replays. Tyrell was threading beneath the surface, pulling luck like it was yarn.

By the fourth quarter, the Cyclones were down six with three minutes to go. The huddle was tense, but Jaxson didn’t hear the nerves—he heard the beat. The rhythm. A pulse behind the panic.

He closed his eyes for a breath and dropped his senses into the weave.

Every player was a thread. Every route a ripple. He didn’t throw the ball—he cast it. Not through strength, but through precision, bending its arc just slightly with intent.

Touchdown.

Stadium erupted.

On the sideline, Tyrell stood watching, helmet off, face unreadable.

After the game, he approached Jaxson beneath the stadium where cameras couldn’t follow.

“You’re growing fast,” he said.

“I learn quick.”

“You still think you’re on the right side of this?”

“I know I am.”

Tyrell didn’t argue. He nodded once. “Delaney’s not the worst of us.”

“Then who is?”

“You’ll find out. Sooner than you want to.”

Then he was gone.

Back in the Hall, Jaxson pored over the photo again. Farron’s face. The name. The weight of what it meant. They needed more. A base. A safe place. And most of all, a team.

“I know who we need to find next,” he told Lira.

She raised an eyebrow. “Who?”

“An old friend,” Jaxson said. “Played with me at LSU. Walked away from the league after one season. Said the pressure was killing him.”

Lira’s eyes narrowed. “You think he’s Veilborn?”

“I know he is. He used to see things. Talked about strings in the sky. I thought he was losing it.”

“Where is he now?”

Jaxson pulled out his phone and brought up a profile—grainy, under a new name, in a city far off the NFL radar.

“Denver. He runs a gym for high-risk youth. Name’s Devon Hale.”

Lira nodded. “Then that’s where we go next.”

They both knew what that meant. Leaving the Hall. Leaving the team. Stepping fully into the Veil’s undercurrents, chasing truths buried under spells and headlines.

Jaxson stood at the edge of the portal room, the air already flickering with anticipation.

The field was changing.

And this time, the playbook was unwritten.

Chapter Three: The Gym Beneath the Ground

The plane touched down in Denver under a sky smeared with gray and gold. Jaxson didn’t bring luggage. Just a duffel packed with essentials—a grimoire bound in synthetic leather, a shard of charged obsidian for emergency casting, and a Chicago Cyclones hoodie worn thin from years of sweat and ritual. He traveled light these days. The kind of light that could outrun consequences.

Denver looked the same as it had back in college—mountains haunting the horizon, wind sharp with altitude, and streets packed with an odd mix of tech start-ups and spiritual shops. It was a city straddling borders: old and new, earth and sky, visible and Veiled.

Lira met him at the terminal exit dressed in a hooded coat that seemed to shimmer slightly at the edges. Her eyes were restless, scanning every face that passed like a soldier walking into a known ambush.

“He’s still here,” she said before Jaxson even opened his mouth. “I traced his signature back to three separate thread-interactions in the Five Points district.”

“So we knock on the door and say what? ‘Hey, remember me from college? Want to fight a shadow war with the magical underground?’”

“You’d be surprised how often that works.”

Jaxson gave a dry chuckle as they walked toward the parking lot. “Devon Hale doesn’t trust anyone. Not since… well, since he broke.”

“You mean since the Veil tried to eat him and no one told him why.”

Jaxson frowned. Guilt bit at his ribs. Back at LSU, Devon had always been wired differently. Sensitive. Quiet, but not weak. He could feel people’s emotions before they spoke. Claimed he could “hear colors” and often knew where the ball was going before it was snapped. Most wrote it off as raw talent or superstition. But once, in the dorm, he told Jaxson he saw threads everywhere—woven around people like spider silk, vibrating with choices.

Jaxson had laughed it off. Then, Devon walked away from a promising NFL career before it even began, disappearing without a word. Now it all made sense.

They reached the gym just after sunset.

It was buried in the bones of an old train depot, half-reconstructed into a concrete-walled fitness center that looked like it hadn’t seen a renovation since the Reagan years. The faded sign read “Iron Tempo” in block letters. There were no cars out front, no music playing inside. Just silence and the slow hum of something beneath the threshold—a magical pulse, deep and slow like a waiting heart.

Jaxson approached the door, but it opened before he could knock.

Devon Hale stood in the doorway.

He hadn’t changed much—still broad-shouldered, eyes sharp, arms inked with veined glyphs Jaxson could now see. They weren’t tattoos. They were living runes, forged into his skin through force of will and pain.

Devon didn’t smile.

“You finally figured it out,” he said.

“Devon…” Jaxson stepped forward.

“You brought her,” Devon added, nodding to Lira. “Good. Saves time.”

Without another word, he turned and walked inside.

The gym was bigger than it looked from the outside—four floors deep, each level descending like a labyrinth into bedrock. The first floor held traditional equipment: racks, bags, free weights, sleds. But lower down, the gear changed. By the third floor, the machines were etched in silver, and the floor glowed faintly underfoot. Jaxson saw movement out of the corner of his eye—sparks of energy dancing between the machines like echoes of old workouts.

Devon led them into a side room that looked more like a sanctum than an office. The walls were covered in maps made of thread—actual thread, suspended midair and connected to pulsing beads of memory. Jaxson felt disoriented just looking at them.

“You’ve been busy,” Lira said softly.

Devon sat behind a low metal desk, fingers tapping in rhythmic patterns. “When I left the league, I didn’t leave the war. I just started fighting it on different turf.”

“You knew?” Jaxson asked. “About the Signal. About Delaney?”

Devon nodded. “I felt the Shift right before the draft. I didn’t know what it was. Nobody did. Not until I met an old runner from the ‘90s. Said his whole team went mad after a failed summoning during a playoff game. That’s when I knew it was bigger than us.”

“So you went underground,” Lira said.

Devon glanced at her. “And kept my head low until someone like him came knocking.” He pointed at Jaxson with a crooked smirk. “I figured if you ever got into the Veil, you’d bring fireworks with you.”

“I didn’t come for fireworks,” Jaxson said. “I came because we need help. Delaney’s building a network. Tyrell Moore’s already pulling threads mid-game. There’s a guy called Farron in the picture now. It’s spiraling.”

Devon leaned forward, his fingers steepled. “You don’t need help, Jax. You need structure. You’ve been reacting. That’s how they win. You need to plan, build, coordinate. You need a unit.”

“We were hoping you might have one,” Lira said carefully.

“I do.” Devon stood, walked to the wall, and pulled down a folded banner that shimmered with starlight. It bore a symbol: a broken whistle crossed by a line of thread.

“We’re called the Whispers. We don’t fight like Lira’s crew, and we don’t monologue like Delaney. We infiltrate, sabotage, and rethread from the roots up. Quiet and sharp.”

Jaxson stared at the symbol. “You’ve been recruiting.”

“I’ve been waiting,” Devon said. “Now the moment’s here. And if you’re serious—if you’re ready to burn your stat sheets and your cleats and your contract—then I’ll bring you in.”

Jaxson didn’t speak for a moment. His heart beat heavy. He thought of his teammates, the fans, his family back home still clinging to the idea of the game as salvation.

Then he nodded.

“I’m in.”

Devon extended a hand. Jaxson clasped it.

The threads around the gym pulsed once, then settled.

Something had changed.

Initiation wasn’t ceremonial. It was grueling.

Devon didn’t care about Jaxson’s MVPs or highlight reels. He stripped everything away, forcing him to channel spells while under duress, read coded broadcasts under psychic interference, and stand barefoot in the Silence—a space of pure Veil null where most casters cracked after five minutes. Jaxson lasted eleven.

“You’re stubborn,” Devon said.

“I’ve played through four concussions.”

“Same thing.”

Meanwhile, Lira worked with the Whispers’ thread-weavers, learning how they embedded protective runes into ordinary items—shoelaces, gloves, gum wrappers. The kind of magic that could slip past a thousand inspections.

They began mapping the spread of Second Signal influence. It was worse than they thought.

High-profile sports analysts, celebrity coaches, even retired legends—some knowingly allied, others puppeted by seeded suggestions. The game had become a stage for a ritual older than most remembered, and every touchdown, every controversy, was another notch in a growing diagram of control.

Then one night, while deep-diving into a cast-loop from Delaney’s latest episode, one of the Whispers—an analyst named Quinn—froze mid-ritual.

“Wait,” he muttered, pointing at the waveform.

Jaxson leaned in. It looked like static to him. But Quinn enhanced it, pulling the Veil’s audio signature forward.

A voice, layered beneath the commentary.

Not Bryce’s.

Farron’s.

It said one word, over and over again, laced into the silence between syllables.

“Ascend.”

Jaxson felt the chill in his teeth.

“They’re preparing a broadcast-level spell,” Lira whispered. “Not to influence the public. To convert them.”

Devon turned grim. “They’re going to unveil the Veil. Not just to a few. To everyone.”

The room went silent.

Jaxson finally spoke.

“Then we need to stop the signal before it airs.”

Devon nodded. “And to do that, we’ll need to get inside the Signal Tower.”

Lira looked at him sharply. “That place doesn’t exist anymore. They erased it from the weave.”

Devon smiled thinly. “Which is why we’re going to threadwalk backwards through time to find it.”

Jaxson blinked. “That’s a thing?”

“No,” Devon said. “It’s a suicide.”

“But it’s the only way.”

Jaxson rubbed his temples.

“Of course it is.”

Outside, the mountain winds howled.

The storm was coming.

Threadwalking backwards was not merely dangerous—it was blasphemous in some traditions of the Veil. The act unraveled chronology, untethered logic, and often left travelers stranded in memories that weren’t entirely theirs. Even Lira, who’d once pulled a dying child through a temporal fracture in New Delhi during a mass-casting event, hesitated before agreeing to Devon’s plan.

“You do this wrong,” she said to him in a voice stripped of irony, “and you won’t just break the weave—you’ll pull pieces of yourself loose. You’ll forget things. People. Your name. Sometimes you don’t come back with all your bones in the right stories.”

Devon didn’t flinch. “I know.”

Jaxson paced the edge of the sanctum. “What exactly are we looking for in the past?”

“An echo,” Devon said. “The original architecture of the Signal Tower. Before it went dark. Before they buried it in silence and scar tissue. Somewhere back there is a thread we can follow—maybe an address, maybe a face. Something to anchor us.”

“And once we find it?”

Lira answered this time. “We pull it forward. Make it real again.”

“Isn’t that... dangerous?”

“Oh, definitely. But it’s better than breaking into a building that technically doesn’t exist.”

They prepared the ritual on the fifth floor of the gym, in a chamber Devon called the Echo Room. It was built over the bones of an old railway junction and saturated with decades of movement and intent—perfect for temporal slipping. Threads were hung like tinsel from the ceiling, each one pulsing with a different hue of memory. Jaxson stood in the center, a ring of copper dust encircling his boots.

Devon and Lira stood on opposite sides of the circle, hands outstretched, their voices rising in an unsettling counterpoint chant that wove backward syllables into forward meanings. The room began to flicker, not with light but with moments—snapshots of other times blooming like oil slicks in the air.

The pressure in Jaxson’s skull spiked. He saw flashes: the draft room in 2017, his mother crying on the couch, the day he first held the book that had ruined and saved his life. Threads tangled around him, gripping at his ankles like vines.

And then—

Darkness.

Not absence, but a thick, breathing dark, filled with static and whispering windows. The Veil parted, and he saw it: a tower made of shifting mirrors and broadcast signals, anchored by bones too large to be human. It loomed above a forgotten stadium on the edge of a ruined field, where broken helmets lay like offerings. This wasn’t just a building. It was sentient. A consciousness carved from decades of televised worship.

He staggered. The vision bent, swirled.

A face appeared—distorted but familiar. Farron, watching him from the center of a broadcast room, lips moving in reverse.

“He is the anchor.”

Jaxson reached out.

The vision shattered.

He fell back into the room gasping, every nerve afire. The thread still crackled in his fingers—silver and red, marked with an alphanumeric ID: W-A57: Canton OH.

Devon leaned in. “What’d you see?”

“The original tower. Or something like it. It’s in Canton.”

Lira blinked. “As in the Hall of Fame Canton?”

“Looks like it.”

Devon gave a grim chuckle. “Of course they’d hide it there. Where better to bury magic than beneath the memory of greatness?”

They moved fast. Within hours, they had a plan.

The journey to Canton was quiet. The Whispers traveled under the radar in a nondescript RV retrofitted with thread-masking glyphs and internal field stabilizers. It looked like something a retiree couple would drive into the Grand Canyon, not a mobile command center for what might be the last attempt to stop a metaphysical coup.

Inside, the team prepared. Lira packed counterspells and cloaking threads. Devon mapped the entry points to the Hall of Fame and linked every modern blueprint to ancestral Veil-maps. Jaxson trained, but differently now—channeling magic through muscle memory, rewriting play routes into protective circles, mapping formations that functioned as real-time sigils when run at speed.

They arrived at night.

Canton lay quiet under a low fog. The Hall stood like a monolith, its curves and arches bathed in spotlights, banners waving lazily in the wind. No obvious guards, no sensors. But Jaxson could feel the static.

“They’re cloaking it,” he said. “Heavy dampening spells.”

Devon led them around the back. A service tunnel wound under the main rotunda, gated and rusted, but the metal shimmered when touched. Hidden threadlocks. They would’ve been invisible to most.

Lira muttered a series of unbinding runes, her breath frosting as the spells counteracted each other. The gate clicked open, slow and reluctant, like it remembered things it didn’t want to.

Inside, the tunnel descended into quiet.

The deeper they went, the less the building felt like a museum. The walls changed. From sterile white concrete to veined obsidian, lined with cables that pulsed faintly with breathless rhythm. Magic and machine—melded into something that shouldn’t exist.

At the bottom, they found it.

The Signal Tower. Or rather, the root of it.

A circular chamber pulsing with forgotten energy. Cameras lined the walls like watchful eyes. Screens flickered with ancient footage—moments of triumph, agony, scandal. Every highlight reel ever recorded seemed to bleed through the stone.

In the center, a control panel—archaic, analog. Dials and buttons worn down by time.

Jaxson approached and laid his hand on it.

The whole room breathed.

A voice, smooth and cold, poured from unseen speakers. Not Farron’s.

“Welcome, Jaxson Wilder. Thread ID recognized. Authority: Inherited. Access: Partial.”

Lira’s eyes narrowed. “It knows you.”

“I think this is where Delaney first broadcast from,” Jaxson said. “I think this is where it all began.”

Devon scanned the panel. “There’s a relay signal here. Not active—but it could be.”

Jaxson turned slowly toward him. “You’re saying we could use this?”

“We don’t just stop the Signal,” Devon replied, a fire flickering behind his normally calm expression. “We overwrite it.”

Lira stepped forward. “That’s too risky. You send a counter-signal from a corrupted node, and you could amplify their frequency. You could fry every mind connected to the weave.”

“Or,” Jaxson said, “we tell the truth louder than their lies.”

The idea hung in the air.

It was madness.

It was hope.

And somewhere deep within the tower’s systems, something shifted.

As if the building itself was listening.

Waiting.

Chapter Four: Fourth and Forever

Jaxson stood at the center of the broadcast chamber, hands resting on the strange, bone-cold surface of the control panel. The room pulsed softly, like a waiting heart, as if the tower itself had paused mid-breath, watching him. Around him, the flickering screens displayed fragments of forgotten plays, controversial calls, and fan footage spliced with haunting precision. This wasn’t just a room; it was a repository of the game’s collective memory. And it was haunted.

The air crackled with potential energy. Lira and Devon worked quickly, inspecting the equipment, whispering over schematics drawn from corrupted fragments of Veil blueprints. The rest of the Whispers secured the perimeter, casting anchoring runes into the walls to stabilize the chamber’s reality. Time wobbled faintly around them, years bleeding into minutes, the past skimming just beneath the surface of every breath.

“Whoever designed this,” Lira said, brushing dust off a side panel lined with crystalline tubing, “wasn’t just trying to hide magic inside the game. They were trying to bind them together. Fuse football with belief, spectacle with sorcery. Every play, every roar of the crowd, was a thread. A tiny offering.”

Devon knelt beside a rusted console covered in carvings that looked like a mix between circuit diagrams and summoning glyphs. “They didn’t build this to communicate. They built it to initiate. Once the signal’s complete, the stadiums won’t just be arenas. They’ll be temples. Shrines to control.”

Jaxson stared down at the interface beneath his fingers. A series of pressure pads and rotating dials blinked in patterns that felt eerily familiar—like variations of old passing routes. A fly, a slant, a post-corner. Whoever built this had known players. Had understood the instincts buried in their muscle memory. Had twisted that into code.

“What if we don’t just overwrite the signal?” he said. “What if we rewrite the field?”

Lira looked up sharply. “You’re talking about casting a mass-scale inversion spell through a half-dead reality anchor held together by rust and desperation.”

Jaxson smiled faintly. “So… just like calling an audible in overtime.”

She rolled her eyes, but the tension cracked slightly.

Devon stood, dusting off his palms. “We’ll need a tether. Something to ground the cast. Something that matters.”

“I have something,” Jaxson said, reaching into his duffel. He pulled out his Cyclones jersey—worn, faded, the stitched name nearly frayed away. It smelled like turf, sweat, and memory.

He laid it gently on the control panel. “This was the first time I felt like I mattered. The first time I believed I could shape the world.”

The glyphs lit up immediately.

The tower responded, recognizing the jersey as a sigil of intention.

“Begin the weave,” Lira said.

The casting took three hours.

It began with a memory loop—Jaxson feeding plays into the system, each one replayed through the tower’s projections, overlaid with emotional resonance: fear, hope, exhilaration. Devon and Lira bent the weave around it, layering counterthreads of clarity and resistance. Their goal wasn’t to erase the Signal—it was to vaccinate against it. To embed truth into the very patterns the enemy had corrupted.

The relay channels fought them.

Ghosts of old broadcasts screamed through the speakers. Clips of fabricated scandals warped and folded around them. For one harrowing moment, Jaxson saw himself—older, twisted, sneering from a corrupted press conference he had never given.

“That’s not real,” Devon growled, severing the thread with a bolt of nulllight.

“They’re trying to fracture us,” Lira warned. “Focus.”

Jaxson bit down on fear and leaned harder into the weave. He reached for his deepest memory—the one that had started it all. A backyard in Baton Rouge. Ten years old. His uncle tossing a football beneath a blazing August sky. No scouts, no pressure. Just the feeling of flight. The certainty, in that instant, that anything was possible.

He poured it into the circuit.

The tower shuddered.

Light erupted from the center console, bathing the room in a glow that cracked reality around the edges. Screens melted. Time inverted. For a few seconds, every voice in every broadcast across the country—podcast, sports radio, sideline mic—paused mid-sentence.

And then—

It began.

The counter-signal rippled outward.

In sports bars across the nation, televisions flickered, showing flashes of unfamiliar moments—players walking off fields, coaches weeping over silent fields, fans praying in empty seats. None of it had happened. All of it felt real.

On the airwaves, Delaney’s voice broke mid-monologue. A static burst overtook his feed. Listeners across the globe blinked as his carefully woven spell collapsed like sand beneath a crashing tide.

The Veil stirred. A fraction of it lifted.

And people saw.

Not everything. Just enough. A glint. A crack. An awareness that something existed beneath the surface of their passion. That the game they loved wasn’t just entertainment—it was theater for something ancient, and not entirely benign.

Jaxson collapsed beside the console, chest heaving.

“It’s done,” he whispered.

Lira crouched beside him, eyes glassy. “We bought time. That’s all.”

Devon nodded. “And now they’ll come for us.”

As if summoned by the words, alarms screamed through the structure.

Veil signatures surged.

They weren’t alone anymore.

The tower’s exits collapsed into smoke and shifting walls. The building had been dormant for
