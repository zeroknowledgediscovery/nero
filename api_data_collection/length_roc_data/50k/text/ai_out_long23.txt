Title: "Dust and Thunder"

Chapter One: The Wind Knows No Master

The morning sun cracked over the horizon like an egg over hot iron, spilling yolk-colored light across the Wyoming plains. The wind ran wild through the buffalo grass, tugging at loose boards on the weather-beaten barn and whispering secrets through the skeletal remains of barbed-wire fences. Hawks circled high overhead, tracing slow ellipses in the pale sky.

Carter Hayes rose before the sun as always. He’d never needed an alarm. His bones told time better than any clock. His dog, Mags, a grizzled blue heeler, limped alongside him as he stepped onto the porch, sipping hot black coffee from a cracked enamel mug. The wood beneath his boots creaked as if protesting the weight of another day.

"Storm’s comin'," Carter muttered to no one but Mags, who just huffed, eyes squinting against the breeze.

Hayes Ranch had been in Carter’s family since 1886. Five generations had plowed, fenced, grazed, and bled on these acres. Now, it was just him and a hired hand named Silas, who hadn't shown up sober in a week and spoke more to his whiskey than to Carter. The cattle were low in number, water scarcer than it ought to be, and debts taller than the tallest cottonwood. Still, Carter couldn’t imagine living anywhere else.

The ranch wasn't just a place. It was the only thing that hadn't walked away.

By midmorning, he was on horseback, riding out to check on a downed fence line near the creek. The wind was fierce, throwing grit into his eyes and whistling a tune older than memory. As he approached the bend in the creek, he spotted tire tracks—fresh ones. Too wide for his truck, too shallow for Silas’s beat-up Ford. His horse, Duke, snorted uneasily.

Carter dismounted, crouching to feel the dirt. Damp. Whoever it was had passed through maybe half an hour ago. And they hadn't gone through the front gate. Trespassers out here didn’t just mean disrespect. They meant danger.

Back at the ranch house that night, Carter stared long into the fire. Mags curled at his feet, twitching in her sleep. The wind had died down, leaving only silence and unease. Someone had been watching. He could feel it—like a weight in the air.

In the town of Clearwater, twenty-three miles east of the ranch, Sheriff Lorraine "Rainey" Bell sipped lukewarm coffee and scowled at the paperwork piling on her desk. She missed the days when being sheriff meant riding out to break up fights at the bar and checking on Miss Harper's chickens. Now there were bigger problems. Meth. Disappearances. Outsiders buying up land with oil money and promises that stank like old blood.

She glanced up when Deputy Kirk poked his head in. "We got a call from the Hayes place. Carter says someone's been poking around."

Rainey leaned back in her chair. "How recent?"

"This morning. He didn’t see anyone, just the tracks."

Her brow furrowed. "Get the cruiser. We’ll pay him a visit."

Carter wasn’t surprised to see the cruiser kick up dust down the long drive around noon. He met Rainey at the gate.

"You look like you haven’t slept in a week," she said, stepping out of the car.

"I sleep fine," Carter lied. "It's the days that wear me down."

"Tell me about the tracks."

As they walked the fence line together, Carter explained what he'd seen. Rainey crouched where he’d pointed, tracing the edges of a print with her gloved hand.

"Not local," she muttered. "Tread pattern’s wrong. And see this?"

Carter nodded. A cigarette butt, the paper crisp and unmarred by moisture. Whoever dropped it hadn’t been here long.

"Think someone’s after your land?"

"Wouldn’t be the first time."

"You still getting letters?"

Carter didn’t answer. His eyes drifted west, toward the hills where the sky seemed lower, heavier. Letters had come. Slick envelopes with corporate logos. Offers that felt more like threats. Oil companies, real estate developers, even a resort chain. But something about this latest intrusion felt different.

That night, Silas came stumbling into the bunkhouse drunk and mumbling about voices in the trees. Carter almost ignored it—Silas often heard things after a bottle—but the way his eyes wouldn’t stop darting around gave him pause.

“Big truck,” Silas whispered. “Blacked-out windows. Parked up on Dead Man’s Ridge. Saw it with my own eyes.”

Carter’s fists clenched.

Three days later, the storm rolled in—an honest-to-God spring squall that darkened the sky like war. Carter was rounding up strays when the wind turned savage, herding clouds like stampeding bulls. Lightning danced over the hills, and thunder cracked like the earth itself was splitting.

Through the sheets of rain, Carter saw it. Headlights—two of them—cutting through the curtain of water just beyond the rise. He pushed Duke hard, hooves throwing up mud as they climbed the ridge. The truck was gone by the time he reached it, but the grass bore fresh tire scars.

This time, there was something more.

Buried just off the side of the road, half-covered in mud and gravel, was a boot. Still on the foot of a man. Dead. Facedown. No ID. No phone.

By the time the sheriff arrived, the rain had stopped but the air hung heavy with ozone and secrets.

“Whoever did this didn’t mean for him to be found,” Rainey muttered, squinting into the gathering dusk.

Carter just stared down at the body. Something in the man’s hand caught his eye—a scrap of cloth. Navy blue. Embroidered with a gold ‘H.’

“Looks like he tried to fight back,” Carter said.

“Know anyone wears that brand?”

Carter’s jaw tightened. “I might.”

In the weeks that followed, the quiet war intensified. Cattle went missing. A shed burned down. Silas vanished one night and was found three days later, nearly frozen and babbling nonsense about black helicopters and men in masks. Rainey tried to investigate, but the body from the ridge disappeared from the morgue before an autopsy could be done. No records. No fingerprints.

One morning, Carter received a package on his porch. No return address. Inside: a photograph of his father, long dead, sitting beside a man Carter didn’t recognize. The same embroidered ‘H’ on the man's coat.

Carter poured himself a stiff drink. “What the hell were you mixed up in, Dad?”

Meanwhile, trouble was brewing in Clearwater. A young woman named Lila Morgan, a journalist from Denver, showed up asking too many questions. She said she was investigating land fraud and water rights, but Carter didn't believe that was the whole story.

“You’re not here for water,” he said when she cornered him in the feed store.

She blinked. “Excuse me?”

“You’ve got city hands. No one drives three hours out here to talk irrigation policy.”

Lila hesitated, then leaned in. “I think there’s something bigger going on out here, Mr. Hayes. Something people have died over.”

“You don’t say.”

“You’ve seen the letters, haven’t you? The ‘offers’? What if I told you some of those companies don’t exist?”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean they’re shells. Fronts. Money moves, names change. And every time a rancher refuses to sell, something bad happens.”

Carter stared at her. “Why you? Why are you looking into this?”

“My father died out here,” she said quietly. “Twenty years ago. They said it was a ranching accident. I don’t believe that anymore.”

The fire in her eyes reminded him of someone. Himself, maybe, back when he still believed the truth could save anything.

“All right,” he said. “But you’d better learn to ride.”

Their uneasy alliance bore fruit faster than either expected. Lila unearthed property records, lease transfers, LLC filings—all pointing to a single name buried deep in the paper trail: Holloway Energy. A conglomerate with more influence than most governments and a reputation for burying problems.

The 'H' on the cloth.

Carter remembered his father’s old stories. Rumors of a deal gone wrong in the seventies. Drilling rigs that poisoned the creek. A whistleblower that vanished. And a debt that had never quite been repaid.

The past was catching up.

One night, as thunder rolled in the distance again, Carter saddled up, rifle slung over his shoulder, and headed for the hills. Lila followed, recorder in her jacket pocket. What they found on Dead Man’s Ridge wasn’t a truck, but a hatch in the earth—half-buried, rusted, and bolted shut.

“I think we just found the real reason they want this land,” Lila whispered.

To be continued...

Carter stood at the edge of the hatch, the toe of his boot nudging aside the weeds and soil clumped around the rusted lip. The thing looked like it hadn't been opened in decades, yet there were fresh scuff marks in the dirt, as if someone had been down there recently. Lila crouched beside it, running her fingers along a welded seam.

“This wasn’t built by ranchers,” she said. “This is military-grade steel. Industrial. And look at that—”

She pointed to a faint symbol etched into the metal. A triangle within a circle, surrounded by a ring of letters too faded to read. Carter squinted, something stirring in the back of his mind, a memory long buried—his father, shouting in the middle of the night, back when Carter was just a boy. Something about “them coming back,” and “the doors that should’ve stayed shut.” It had made no sense then. Now it twisted in his gut like a live wire.

“This goes deeper than water rights,” Carter said, his voice low.

“I think it’s a site. Government. Cold War era, maybe. Whatever it is, they don’t want anyone finding it,” Lila said, her tone brisk, professional, but her eyes betrayed the tremor of unease creeping into her spine.

They didn’t try to open it then. Carter was pragmatic—he didn’t go poking around holes in the ground without knowing what was on the other side. But when they returned to the ridge the next morning with tools, the hatch was gone. Not just closed—gone. Like the earth had never been disturbed. Grass laid neatly, fresh sod in place. It was unnatural, too clean. Lila paled, biting back a curse.

“Someone’s watching us,” she said.

Carter didn’t answer. He already knew.

Rainey Bell drove out to the ranch herself the next day, uninvited, knocking on Carter’s screen door with the kind of expression that said she wasn’t taking any more of his usual stubborn silence. He let her in, though his face was stone.

“I got a call from a buddy at the state level,” she said once the door was shut and Mags had settled down with a low growl. “Said there was an unauthorized land survey done up near your north ridge two weeks ago. Helicopters. Lidar scans. Then radio silence. When he asked for the data, he was told it was classified.”

Carter’s hand curled tighter around his coffee mug. “Classified. On my land.”

“Officially, you still own it, but if someone above my pay grade wants to play dirty, you’ll wake up one morning and find a federal notice tacked to your barn.”

Lila stepped into the room from the hall, eyebrows raised. “It’s worse than we thought.”

“You’re not helping,” Rainey snapped. “You come out here chasing ghosts, and now Carter’s at the center of something that smells like black ops and oil futures.”

“Then let’s shine a light on it,” Lila shot back. “That’s what I do. That’s what journalism is for.”

Carter stood between them. “Enough. If we’re gonna make sense of this, we can’t turn on each other. We need proof. We need names, dates, documents—something solid.”

Rainey stared at him for a long moment. Then she nodded. “Fine. But if you find anything that puts people in danger, you come to me first. Not the paper. Not the internet. Me.”

Carter looked out the window toward the hills. “We’ll find what’s buried out there. One way or another.”

That night, Lila sifted through the archive Carter’s grandfather had kept in the barn’s loft. Yellowed ledgers, receipts, war letters, grainy photographs. She almost missed it—a box marked simply “1974.” Inside were faded blueprints, a few polaroids of men in hard hats, and a letter with no return address. The letter read:

    “Phase One is complete. Compartmentalization protocols enforced. Hayes land ideal for cover. No exposure expected. Transfer of operational authority to Holloway as per memo. Burn after reading.”

She read it twice before showing it to Carter, who sat at the table sharpening a knife, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the page.

“My dad knew,” he said, voice hollow. “He was part of it.”

Lila nodded. “Not just him. Your whole family. The ranch was a front, Carter. The land, the water—it was always about this installation. A cover story, a means to keep it hidden.”

“But hidden from who?” he asked, standing abruptly. “From Russians? From civilians? From us?”

Rainey’s cruiser pulled up just as the last light died beyond the hills. She entered without knocking, holding a manila envelope and a look of grim determination.

“I pulled records from the county vault. Stuff that’s not digitized yet. Found this mixed in with zoning permits from the late sixties.”

She laid out a photo: an aerial shot of the ranch with markings overlaid in red. At the center, a rectangle marked ‘Structure B.’ Beneath it: “Depth: 43m. Status: Contained.”

“Contained,” Carter repeated. “Like a prison.”

“Or a tomb,” Lila said quietly.

The room fell into silence.

Two nights later, Carter found himself alone on the ridge again. Mags trotted beside him, tail down, ears twitching. The wind had turned still, the kind of hush that felt like breath being held. He didn’t know what he expected to find, but part of him hoped that hatch had reappeared—that the earth hadn’t swallowed its secrets too cleanly.

Instead, he found something worse.

There, where the hatch had been, now stood a man. Tall. Thin. Wearing a black coat, face obscured by shadow. No flashlight. No vehicle. Just standing there, like he’d been waiting.

“Evenin’,” Carter said, hand close to the grip of his revolver.

The man didn’t respond. He didn’t move at all. Not until Carter took a step closer. Then, without sound or warning, he turned and walked straight into the hill—vanished, as if the earth had swallowed him whole.

Mags whined, backing up.

Carter turned and walked away, heart pounding. When he reached the house, he told no one. Some things didn’t need to be said to be real.

The following morning, Lila left early for a trip into Casper, where she said a contact might have more on Holloway Energy. She promised she’d be back by dusk. When she didn’t return by midnight, Carter started making calls.

No one had seen her.

By dawn, her car was found abandoned on Route 19, doors locked, phone on the seat. Inside the trunk, a single sheet of paper: a photocopy of the letter from 1974.

But this time, it had a signature.

M. Holloway.

Carter didn’t know who Holloway was. Not really. But he knew now the stakes had changed.

They weren’t just defending a ranch anymore. They were at the mouth of something deeper—something rotten that hadn’t seen light in fifty years.

And it was waking up.

Chapter Two: A Crack in the Silence

The wind howled with an unnatural persistence, tearing across the plains like it had a purpose, as if it meant to erase all traces of what had happened the night before. Carter stood in the doorway of the barn, his arms crossed tightly over his chest, eyes set on the far-off edge of the road where Lila's car had been found. The early light didn’t bring comfort. It only emphasized the emptiness.

Rainey had come out as soon as Carter called. She was pacing now, boots crunching on dry gravel, cursing under her breath.

“You’re telling me she just vanished? No sign of a struggle, no prints, nothing?” she asked, more to herself than to him.

“That’s what it looks like,” Carter replied, voice low. “But it ain’t what happened.”

“She had people watching her,” Rainey muttered. “She told me that. Said someone from Denver had warned her to be careful—journalist went missing in Utah last year. Now her. And just like that, the trail goes cold again.”

“I think it’s them,” Carter said, walking toward the old corral. “Same people behind that hatch. Same people that were watching the ridge. You don’t go to this much trouble to scare people. This ain’t about intimidation. It’s about control.”

Rainey followed him, pulling her coat tighter as the wind picked up. “You know, I used to think this job was about cattle rustlers and land disputes. Maybe a meth lab or two. But this?” She shook her head. “This is something else.”

Inside the barn, Carter unearthed the box again—the one marked “1974.” The documents had shifted slightly since they’d last seen them. He noticed it immediately. A page that hadn’t been there before now sat atop the stack. A map. Faint lines traced across topography he recognized: the north ridge, the low creekbed, the hill beyond Dead Man’s Ridge. At the bottom, in typewritten letters: SUBLEVEL ACCESS - RESTRICTED. EYES ONLY.

“Where the hell did this come from?” Rainey asked.

Carter didn’t answer. He didn’t know. But he recognized the coordinates on the map, and something cold settled in his chest. A depression near the creek—an old sinkhole that had been fenced off since his grandfather’s time. They’d always called it the Devil’s Hollow. Now it had another name.

“Sublevel Access,” Carter murmured. “It’s a back door.”

They left just after noon, taking Carter’s pickup across the pasture and toward the creekbed. The sky had gone gray, clouds rolling low and slow over the mountains like smoke. Carter drove without speaking, jaw clenched, eyes on the horizon. Rainey kept glancing at the map, checking landmarks. When they arrived, there was no doubt—they’d found the place.

The depression in the ground was deeper than he remembered, the fence sagging, rusted, more twisted than it should’ve been. Something had disturbed it recently.

Rainey stepped forward cautiously, drawing her weapon. “This where you want to start digging?”

“No,” Carter said, kneeling beside a pile of broken brush. “We don’t need to. Someone’s already done the work.”

A panel of soil had been shifted—moved, not dug—like a hatch buried beneath a layer of sod. Carter brushed it away, revealing a circular iron ring embedded in concrete. A steel door, smaller than the one on the ridge, but clearly similar.

“Well, Sheriff?” Carter said grimly. “You still think this is just about land?”

Rainey looked down at the ring, then back at him. “We’re not opening that without backup. Not without knowing what’s down there.”

“Then we won’t wait,” Carter replied. “We’ll bring the truth up instead.”

They returned to the ranch under a heavy dusk. Carter set to preparing tools—lights, ropes, gloves, anything that might be needed for an entry. Rainey insisted on calling her deputy, Kirk, to post a watch on the perimeter. As night deepened, the atmosphere thickened. Mags growled at nothing. The wind died completely.

Carter awoke just after midnight to a sound that didn’t belong—footsteps on gravel, deliberate, slow. He grabbed his rifle and moved to the window. Nothing. Just shadows, moonlight, and the silence of predators.

He slipped outside and moved along the porch, careful not to let the boards creak under him. A glint caught his eye near the barn. He stepped down, heart hammering.

There was a figure standing just past the corral. Still. Facing him. Wearing a suit.

“Who are you?” Carter barked.

No reply.

He raised the rifle. “Last chance.”

The figure stepped back—and then vanished. No flash, no sound, just gone. Carter rushed forward, but when he got there, there were no tracks. No footprints. Only a small object on the ground, blinking faintly: a flash drive.

He pocketed it and returned to the house.

Rainey showed up again before dawn, tension lining her face. “Kirk’s gone,” she said flatly.

“What do you mean?”

“He was watching the ridge. Radioed in around two a.m. Said he saw movement in the trees. Then nothing. I went out there an hour ago. His car was empty. Engine cold. Like he walked off into the dark.”

Carter handed her the flash drive. “This was left for me last night.”

She stared at it, then slowly nodded. “Let’s see what’s on it.”

They booted up an old laptop from the ranch office. The drive contained a single file—video footage. Grainy, timestamped 1975. It showed a room, concrete walls, men in lab coats. A figure sat at the center, strapped to a chair. The video had no sound, but the tension was evident. The man in the chair jerked, twisted, fought against the restraints. His eyes glowed faintly in the camera’s light.

At the end of the clip, a logo appeared: a triangle in a circle. Then a word.

PROJECT HOLLOWAY.

Rainey stood slowly. “That’s what your family was protecting.”

“No,” Carter said, voice low. “That’s what we were hiding.”

By the following evening, they had a plan. Carter, Rainey, and a friend of Lila’s—an ex-Navy mechanic named James she’d mentioned weeks ago—would descend into the hollow and document whatever lay beneath. They brought cameras, oxygen masks, backup batteries. James was skeptical, but the money Lila had wired before her disappearance had convinced him.

“You’re telling me we’re opening up a Cold War-era mystery hole with two flashlights and a prayer,” he said, shaking his head. “You people are nuts.”

But he came anyway.

The hatch yielded easily. Someone had already broken the internal lock. They descended one at a time, the ladder groaning under their weight. The air grew colder with each foot. At the bottom, they found a corridor. Lights flickered along the ceiling—low, emergency red. There was power. Somewhere down here, something still worked.

Rooms branched off the hallway. Observation windows. Examination tables. Notes pinned to boards in faded handwriting. It was a lab.

James moved ahead, calling softly. “Over here.”

They followed him into the farthest chamber.

And froze.

A body lay on the table. Desiccated, but unmistakably human. Tubes still in the arms. A tag on the toe. Carter stepped closer.

It read: Subject Zero. Holloway Protocol. Terminated: 1981.

Behind him, Rainey opened a filing cabinet, flipping through folders. “They were doing experiments down here. Bio-enhancement. Neural implants. Stuff that doesn’t make sense. Way ahead of its time.”

James cursed. “This isn’t just a lab. It’s a grave.”

Then the lights flickered again—and stayed off.

In the pitch black, Carter heard it: a breath not belonging to any of them. Then footsteps. Not on the floor—but in the walls.

Whatever had been terminated in 1981 hadn’t stayed that way.

The air grew thick with a stench that hadn't been stirred in decades—a rot that clung to the walls, woven into the very concrete of the facility. Carter strained his ears, hand clenched tight around the flashlight, his other gripping the stock of the rifle slung across his chest. Beside him, Rainey was frozen, breath shallow, eyes wide in the dark. Somewhere behind them, James was swearing under his breath, fumbling with a backup light.

Then a metallic clang rang through the corridor, sharp and close, like a door being slammed shut in the pitch black. Carter spun toward the sound, beam cutting across peeling paint, exposed wiring, and—just for a moment—what looked like a figure darting across the hallway at the far end. Tall, thin, but too fast. Too fluid.

“Did you see that?” Rainey whispered.

Carter nodded. “Something’s still down here.”

James got the backup light working. It flickered weakly, casting ghostly shadows as they retraced their steps. Every door they passed seemed darker than the last, each one half-open, revealing empty rooms—except for one. Room 12A. The door was locked tight, padlocked from the outside.

James tugged at it. “Why lock this one, when everything else was left to rot?”

Carter ran his fingers over the frame. There were scorch marks on the steel, like it had been welded shut before being forcibly reopened.

“This isn’t just storage,” he said.

Rainey found the logbook hanging beside the door. The handwriting was messy, rushed. The last entry read:

    “12A breached. Internal breach. Subject movement confirmed. Recommend immediate seal. Do not enter. May 6, 1981.”

Beneath it, someone else had scrawled a single word in red ink: “Still here.”

James let out a short, bitter laugh. “You people dragged me into a goddamn horror movie.”

Carter looked at Rainey. “We need to see what’s inside.”

“Are you insane?” she said, voice rising. “Whatever they locked in there, they did it for a reason.”

“We came here for answers. Lila came here for answers. You want to walk away from this now, knowing she might’ve ended up in the hands of whoever kept this place a secret?”

Rainey hesitated, her jaw set. Then she nodded once. “Fine. We open it. But we do it smart.”

They found a crowbar in a supply closet nearby, and James went to work on the padlock. It took longer than they expected—years of corrosion, thick metal—but eventually, with a groan and a snap, the lock gave way. Carter stepped back, rifle at the ready, as James slowly pulled the door open.

What they saw didn’t make sense.

The room was not like the others. It had been stripped clean—no equipment, no tables, no restraints. The floor had been painted black, walls scorched, as if scorched repeatedly. The ceiling above was charred. And in the center, drawn into the concrete with something thick and crimson, was a symbol: a spiral with jagged arrows branching from its sides, like a warped sun.

“Jesus Christ,” Rainey murmured. “What the hell is this place?”

Carter stepped inside carefully, light passing over the walls. Etchings covered the interior—scratches in the concrete, some shallow, others gouged deep as if by claws or metal. One phrase repeated over and over:

    He knows the silence.

James backed out, shaking his head. “This is wrong. This place is wrong. We need to go. We need to seal it again and forget we were ever here.”

But Carter stepped further in. Something about the phrase gnawed at him, a feeling like half-forgotten memory clawing at the edge of consciousness. “What does it mean, ‘He knows the silence’?”

As if in answer, a soft hum began—low, almost musical, vibrating through the walls. Rainey swore and grabbed Carter’s arm. “That wasn’t there before. We need to leave. Now.”

But it was too late.

From the far corner of the room, something moved. A shape rising slowly, uncoiling from the shadows like smoke. It wasn’t quite a man. It wasn’t quite anything. Limbs too long. Skin that shimmered like oil on water. Eyes that weren’t eyes at all—just pits of swirling darkness.

Carter didn’t wait. He fired twice, the shots deafening in the small room. The thing didn’t flinch. It stepped forward—no sound, no weight, as if it wasn’t touching the floor at all.

“Run!” he shouted, backing out.

Rainey was already moving. James slammed the door behind them as the thing approached, shoving the crowbar through the lock as a makeshift barricade. The metal groaned behind them, a low, animal sound echoing from inside.

They didn’t look back.

Outside, the sunlight nearly blinded them. They stumbled into the open air, lungs gasping for oxygen that hadn’t been filtered through rot and dust. Mags barked furiously at the mouth of the hollow, backing away as the group emerged, eyes wide and tail between her legs.

James collapsed onto the ground. “What the hell was that?”

“I don’t know,” Carter said, steadying himself against the truck, “but it wasn’t human.”

Rainey wiped her face with shaking hands. “Whatever it is, it was kept down there for a reason. And now we’ve woken it up.”

They drove back in silence, each of them processing what they’d seen—or what they thought they’d seen. Carter stared at the road, but his mind was elsewhere. The phrase repeated in his head over and over.

He knows the silence.

That night, Carter couldn’t sleep. He stood outside beneath the stars, the sky black and infinite. The ranch was quiet, too quiet, as if the land itself were holding its breath. Somewhere out in the dark, a coyote howled once—and then, nothing.

He went into the barn, pulled out the old letters again. Scanned every page, every margin. And there it was—on the back of one photo, almost invisible under the aging paper.

In his father’s handwriting:

    “I saw him in the silo. He didn’t speak, but I heard him. Heard him in my thoughts. Holloway said it was safe now. But the silence is growing.”

Carter dropped the paper.

He understood now. Project Holloway hadn’t been just about science. It hadn’t been about war or power. It had been about containment.

And something—someone—was no longer contained.

The following morning, Rainey met with Carter in the kitchen over coffee neither of them drank. They sat across from each other, the silence stretching between them.

“I put in a call to someone I trust,” she said finally. “Retired NSA analyst. Lives in Billings now. He owes me a favor. He’s going to run that footage—see if anything matches in the archives.”

“You think we’ll get answers?”

“I think we’ll get attention.”

“And Lila?”

Rainey looked away. “No trace. But if she’s alive, she knows more than we do. She might be trying to stay hidden. Or she’s being held.”

Carter nodded slowly. He felt older than he had in weeks. “We can’t just sit here and wait.”

“We won’t,” Rainey said. “But we need to be smart. That thing down there—whatever it was—it isn’t just dangerous. It’s wrong, Carter. It doesn’t belong in this world.”

He stood and looked out the window, gaze settling on the hills beyond the barn. “Then we find out where it came from.”

“Even if we don’t like the answer?” Rainey asked.

“Especially then.”

From the corner of the room, the old laptop pinged. A message had appeared on the screen—unprompted. No sender. No connection.

Just six words.

    “You opened the gate. He listens.”

The cursor blinked.

Then the lights went out.

Chapter Three: Black Water, Black Sky

The power outage lasted exactly seven minutes.

Carter stood motionless by the window, watching the ranch disappear into the kind of dark that didn’t feel natural. Not the quiet hush of an overcast night or the low velvet of a moonless sky, but something deeper—heavier. The kind of darkness that felt like a thing unto itself, coiled around the house, listening through the cracks.

When the lights flickered back on, nothing looked disturbed, but something was different. Mags was crouched beneath the kitchen table, teeth bared, eyes locked on the far corner of the room where the shadows still lingered, too long after the bulbs had returned to life.

Rainey slowly closed the laptop, its screen now blank. No trace of the message. No ping. No file log. “I want to believe that was just a virus,” she muttered. “But we both know better.”

Carter sat down, suddenly feeling the weight of everything settle in his bones like winter. “We’re being warned. Or watched. Maybe both.”

“Or invited,” Rainey said, then immediately regretted it.

They didn’t sleep that night. Instead, they spread the documents from the 1974 box across the table, sorting, cross-referencing, searching for the pattern neither of them fully understood. Carter pulled out a topographic survey dated June 1969—marked in faded pencil were four separate underground entry points across the ranch’s expanse. One had been the hatch on the ridge. Another was the Devil’s Hollow. The third was labeled simply “Wellsite 3.”

“What’s at Wellsite 3?” Rainey asked.

Carter didn’t answer right away. He was already pulling on his coat.

They drove out at dawn. The wind had returned, and with it came the low whine of distant turbines from the wind farm three miles off. The noise grated the nerves, just audible enough to feel like static under the skin.

Wellsite 3 had been inactive for decades. Carter remembered his father fencing it off sometime in the early ’90s, muttering something about “leaks” and “bad ground.” But there were no tanks, no valves, no visible equipment. Just a shed. Small. Cinderblock. Padlocked and sealed with rust.

Carter cut the lock with bolt cutters. Rainey stood to the side, one hand near her holster, eyes scanning the horizon as if expecting something to rise up out of the dirt.

Inside the shed, the floor was covered with loose gravel and hay, as though someone had tried to disguise what was beneath. Carter kicked aside the debris, revealing a steel trapdoor. Unlike the others, this one had a serial number and a keypad built into the concrete around it. Dead electronics, long without power.

“Guessing we’re not supposed to be here,” Rainey muttered.

“No one’s supposed to be anywhere out here,” Carter replied.

He found the manual override—an ancient lever in a wall-mounted casing. With effort, they managed to crank the door open, revealing a narrow staircase that descended into blackness. The air that wafted out was metallic and damp, tinged with sulfur.

This time, they brought more gear—portable lights, extra batteries, shortwave radios. They took their time descending. The walls were different here—newer, reinforced. This had been upgraded long after the other sections were built. More money, more secrets.

The stairwell ended in a chamber much larger than expected. Vaulted ceiling. Rows of sealed crates and metal filing cabinets bolted into place. Dust coated everything, but the air was unnaturally cool.

Carter flicked on his light. “This isn’t a lab. It’s storage.”

They moved through the room, opening drawers, prying open lids. Inside were documents—reams of paper, diagrams, photographs, sealed plastic folders with words like PHASE THREE, BIO-CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL, and MNEMONIC CATALYSIS. Rainey opened one and immediately closed it.

“These people were working on cognitive manipulation,” she said. “Language structure experiments. Subconscious messaging. Half this stuff reads like science fiction.”

“Except it’s not,” Carter said. He pointed to a wall of photographs pinned under cracked glass. Images of people—unidentified—sitting in white rooms. Wires on their heads. Black visors over their eyes. In each photo, the same symbol was etched on the wall behind them: the spiral sun.

And in one photo—dated March 7, 1976—was Carter’s father. Younger. Standing beside a man in a suit with his face blurred out, but the shape of the man was unmistakable. Tall. Thin. Just like the figure Carter had seen outside the barn.

“My dad knew all of this,” he whispered. “He was part of it right up until the end.”

Rainey pulled open a crate labeled AUDIO TESTS. Inside were dozens of reel-to-reel tapes. She selected one at random and turned the knob on a battered player stacked on a shelf.

The tape hissed to life.

At first, nothing. Then, faintly—a voice. Male. Calm, clinical.

    “Test forty-two. Subject still exhibits signs of conceptual drift. Spiral cognition holding. Silence maintains control.”

Another voice—different. High-pitched, strained.

    “It’s in my head… in the walls… not talking, but I hear it… the sound of not-sound…”

Then screaming. Abrupt. The tape cut out.

They stared at each other.

Rainey finally said, “We need to get these tapes to someone who can translate whatever the hell that means.”

“No,” Carter said. “We can’t take this out. Not yet. We don’t know what we’re holding.”

He turned back to the wall, where a single switch was embedded in the concrete. Labeled: LOCKDOWN OVERRIDE.

Beneath it, someone had scrawled: “Not yet. Not again.”

They emerged from the shed under the full light of day, but it felt dim, as if the brightness had been filtered through smoke. Rainey climbed into the truck without a word. Carter hesitated, then glanced back at the shed one last time.

The keypad blinked once—just once—then went dark again.

He didn’t tell Rainey.

By that evening, word had spread that another rancher—Reuben Shaw—had gone missing. His property bordered Carter’s to the east. Rainey drove out to investigate while Carter stayed behind to review the photographs from the vault.

The images revealed something horrifying in their consistency. Every test subject displayed the same progression—normal posture and expressions in the first frames, followed by confusion, terror, then blank stares. Hollow gazes. In the final frame of each sequence, the subject was unrecognizable, their features blurred by motion, expression twisted or utterly absent, as if something had been removed from them rather than captured.

One photo—just one—was different.

It showed a child. Maybe five years old. Curly hair. Staring directly at the camera with a smile. Her shirt bore the embroidered logo of a school in Denver. Beneath the photo: Subject 57 - Cassandra Morgan.

Lila’s last name.

Carter dropped the photo. “Jesus Christ.”

She hadn’t come here just for a story. She’d come for family.

Rainey returned that night with mud on her boots and a haunted look in her eyes.

“They found Reuben’s truck in the irrigation ditch,” she said. “Doors open, engine still running. Blood on the steering wheel. No sign of him.”

Carter handed her the photo.

Rainey stared for a long time. “This changes things.”

“Lila knew more than she let on. Her sister—or daughter?—was part of this. Maybe that’s why they took her.”

“Or maybe she was already part of it and didn’t know.”

They sat in silence for a long time, neither willing to say what they were both thinking.

The project wasn’t dormant. It had never stopped.

And now it was awake.

That night, the wind returned—but this time it didn’t howl. It whispered.

Carter stood on the porch, rifle across his lap, and listened. He couldn’t make out the words, but he felt them, deep in his skull. Shapes, thoughts, fragments of images not his own. Rooms without doors. Faces without names. And through it all, the symbol—the spiral sun—burning behind his eyes.

He whispered a name without knowing why.

“Holloway.”

And the wind fell silent.

The following morning dawned pale and still, the sky smothered by a sheet of cloud that refused to break. Carter moved through the routines of ranch life with a mechanical focus—feeding the cattle, checking fences, refilling the troughs—but his mind was still in the dark beneath Wellsite 3. Every time he blinked, he saw those photographs. The tape hissed in his ears when there was no sound. It was like the place had planted something inside him, some echo that refused to fade.

He kept thinking about the child in the photo. Cassandra Morgan. She couldn’t have been more than five or six, smiling in that off-center way kids do when they're coached into posing for a camera. It made no sense. What was a child doing in a lab like that? And why did Lila never mention her?

Rainey returned mid-morning, her cruiser kicking up dust on the road. She looked worse than she had the night before, eyes bloodshot, face pale beneath the brim of her hat.

“I’ve been on the phone since dawn,” she said as she stepped out, voice low and grim. “Tried reaching the Denver office of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Two contacts I know are either out or ‘no longer with the department.’ The third told me I should stop asking questions before she hung up on me.”

Carter nodded slowly. “They’re scrubbing.”

“Yeah. Fast. Quiet. Like they expected us to find this. Like they’re just cleaning up loose threads.”

“I found another one,” Carter said, holding out a manila envelope. Inside were four more photos, ones he hadn’t noticed until early that morning. They were tucked behind an envelope labeled “Alternate Protocols: Field-Ready Subjects.” These weren’t test subjects in a lab.

They were in towns. Grocery stores. Public spaces. Their expressions blank, almost mannequin-like. One showed a man in a Clearwater feed shop Carter recognized vaguely—John Thatcher, a recluse who had vanished three years ago. Another showed a woman walking into a courthouse in Cheyenne. The third was worse—a child standing in a school hallway, staring at a teacher with eyes that were unmistakably wrong.

The fourth was Lila.

She looked younger, maybe early twenties, but unmistakable. She wasn’t smiling. Just staring past the camera, like she wasn’t entirely there.

“What the hell is this?” Rainey asked, her voice hoarse.

“I think they released them,” Carter said. “Not just tested them. Let them loose. Maybe to monitor behavior. Maybe to study assimilation. Or maybe they were… switched off.”

Rainey sat down heavily on the porch step. “I don’t even know what I’m looking at anymore. This stopped being a missing persons case or a land dispute a long time ago. This is something else. I don’t even have a name for it.”

“Project Holloway,” Carter said. “That’s the only name we’ve got.”

They both fell quiet as Mags padded up from the barn, ears pinned flat, tail tucked. She whined softly, pawing at Carter’s leg.

Then they heard it—low and distant, not from the road but from under the earth. A vibration that made the loose boards under their boots tremble. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. A steady thrum.

Rainey stood. “That’s coming from the ridge.”

Carter was already walking.

The hatch at Dead Man’s Ridge was uncovered again. Not just exposed—propped open. Dirt shoved aside in long, messy grooves. It looked like something had clawed its way out rather than in. The steel door hung open at an angle, hinges bent, one of the bolts snapped entirely.

Carter raised his flashlight and swept the opening. The darkness inside didn’t seem passive—it reached back.

“I don’t think we should go in there again,” Rainey said quietly.

“We don’t have a choice,” Carter replied.

James met them at the entrance, having driven out after a panicked voicemail from Carter. He looked rough—eyes sunken, face unshaven, clothes rumpled like he hadn’t been home since their last descent into the underground. He carried a duffel bag filled with gear, including a drone camera he’d jury-rigged with infrared sensors.

“You’re sure it’s safe?” Rainey asked.

“No,” James said plainly, kneeling to unpack the drone. “But at least this time, I’m not walking in blind.”

They launched the drone first, watching the feed on a tablet as it buzzed quietly down the corridor beneath the hatch. The tunnel was different now—debris had been shifted, objects disturbed. Doors previously closed were now open, swinging slightly in some draft they couldn’t feel. At the far end of the corridor, something flickered across the camera’s view—something too fast to catch clearly. A blur of limbs, motion, and then nothing.

“Back it out,” Rainey said.

But the feed went static.

“I think we’re being drawn in,” Carter said.

James didn’t argue. He powered up the backup drone and started reassembling his pack. “Fine. But I’m not leaving the truck running this time.”

They descended as a group. The first chamber was unchanged. Empty shelves. Dust. That same, unbearable silence. Rainey kept glancing back at the tunnel entrance, hand near her sidearm.

They moved through a corridor they hadn’t noticed before, narrower than the rest, a service hall partially collapsed on one side. Behind the rubble, a rusted plate marked Observation Suite A had been bent backward by force. Inside was a room with a curved window overlooking something larger—an amphitheater-like pit descending several stories into the ground.

The walls of the pit were covered in metal panels, most of them scorched or broken. In the center stood a device—tall, monolithic, with cables leading into the concrete below. It was pulsing faintly with light.

Carter stepped closer to the glass. “That’s it. That’s what they were studying.”

Rainey exhaled. “It’s a machine.”

“Or a beacon,” James offered. “Or a prison.”

They didn’t see the figure behind them until it spoke.

“You shouldn’t be here.”

They turned as one. A man stood at the hallway entrance—middle-aged, hair graying, face pale and taut with fatigue. He wore no badge, no gear. Just a black jacket with a logo Carter didn’t recognize—three concentric circles, overlapping like a Venn diagram.

“Who the hell are you?” Rainey demanded, gun already drawn.

“I’m the last technician assigned to Holloway,” he said. “And I’ve been down here a very long time.”

Carter stepped forward, rifle lowered but ready. “What is this place? What were you doing?”

The man smiled faintly. “We weren’t building anything. We were keeping it asleep. But they stopped funding the containment ten years ago. Pulled out all staff except for three of us. The other two are gone now. I stayed.”

“Why?” James asked.

“Because if someone doesn’t watch the silence, it spreads.”

He turned and gestured toward the pit. “You’re standing above what we called the Breachwell. It wasn’t made—it was found. In 1957, during a uranium survey. A cavern with no natural explanation. No bottom. When they lowered a microphone into the shaft, they heard music. Structure. Patterns. Not human.”

“And the experiments?” Carter asked.

“They wanted to know if it could speak to us. Or through us.”

Rainey’s voice was tight. “Did it?”

The man looked at her, and for the first time, Carter saw real fear in his eyes. Not the fear of death. The fear of knowing.

“It doesn’t speak. It dreams. And when it dreams of you, you stop being you.”

A low tone vibrated through the floor again, stronger this time. The machine in the pit brightened.

“They’ll come for this place soon,” the technician said. “When they do, they’ll bury it in concrete, maybe fire. Maybe worse. But it won’t matter.”

“Why not?” Carter asked.

“Because it’s already here. You heard it, didn’t you? In your sleep. In the wind. The silence isn’t absence. It’s invitation.”

Rainey’s radio crackled suddenly. A voice hissed through the static—her deputy’s voice.

    “Rainey—he’s at the station. Someone’s here. Says he knows Carter Hayes. Says they used to serve together. Name’s Holloway—”

Then the radio cut out.

Carter felt the floor shift under his boots.

Rainey looked at him. “Did you serve with anyone named Holloway?”

Carter’s face had gone pale. “No. But my father did.”

Chapter Four: The Man Who Wasn’t There

They drove back to the ranch in silence, the road a blur under spinning tires, each mile soaked in the weight of that name. Holloway. It wasn’t a corporation. It wasn’t a project. It was a man—at least, once. And now, perhaps, something else. Rainey gripped the wheel like she was holding herself together. Carter sat rigid beside her, jaw clenched tight enough to ache. James followed behind in the battered pickup, hauling the gear they’d managed to extract from the underground.

“I’ve never heard of him before,” Carter said finally, breaking the tension. “Not directly. My father never mentioned a name. Just vague warnings. ‘Don’t dig too deep, son.’ ‘Some things grow teeth in the dark.’”

Rainey stared ahead. “But you think your father served with him?”

“Not in any war the Army ever recorded.”

They reached the ranch to find the gate already open.

Carter didn’t slow. He pulled the revolver from the glovebox and tucked it beneath his coat as they turned up the dirt drive. Dust curled behind them like smoke, the ranch house coming into view—and standing in front of it, a man in a tailored gray suit, hands folded behind his back, posture too calm for someone waiting without invitation.

James rolled to a stop behind them, stepping out with a crowbar slung over his shoulder, just in case. Mags barked twice and went silent.

The man watched them with a faint smile. His face was handsome in a sterile, forgettable way—skin without blemish, no laugh lines, no scars. His hair was combed back, not a strand out of place. But it was his eyes that chilled Carter most: pale gray, so light they almost didn’t seem real, and utterly devoid of motion.

“Carter Hayes,” the man said as they approached. His voice was pleasant, rhythmically measured, as though read from a teleprompter inside his skull. “And Sheriff Lorraine Bell. And our reluctant technician friend, Mr. James Fuller. How tidy. All the variables aligned in one place.”

Carter didn’t respond. He glanced at Rainey, who had her hand near her holster.

“Do I know you?” Carter asked.

The man smiled again, no teeth. “Not yet. But your father did. He was a reliable man in his way. Served his purpose. So did you.”

Carter narrowed his eyes. “You’re Holloway?”

The man’s expression didn’t change. “Names are fluid. My designation has worn many masks. Holloway is… functional. A placeholder for what exists in shadow. I didn’t come here to argue semantics.”

“What do you want?” Rainey asked.

“To clarify the terms of what’s to come.”

He stepped forward once, hands still behind his back. “You’ve opened the door. That was your function. Your father delayed the process. You have accelerated it. The seal has fractured. Now the breach is listening. And soon, it will answer.”

James muttered, “What the hell are you talking about?”

But Carter already knew. He could feel it—that pressure in the back of his mind since the hatch opened. The strange pull of dreams not his own. The symbols he couldn’t forget. The silence he could hear.

“It’s not a person, is it?” he said, voice low. “It’s a thing. Holloway’s not you. Holloway’s what's behind the door.”

The man’s smile widened just enough to show teeth now—too many, too perfect.

“Very good, Mr. Hayes. You’re adapting quickly. A trait we have long valued in your bloodline.”

Rainey stepped forward, drawing her weapon. “Back away from the house. Now.”

But the man didn’t move. His eyes twitched—just once—and Rainey’s arm dropped. Her hand trembled, the gun clattering to the ground as she stepped back, face blank with confusion.

“I don’t take kindly to threats,” the man said gently.

Carter raised his rifle and fired.

The shot struck the man in the shoulder—and passed through like mist. No blood. No impact. The figure simply rippled at the point of contact, like water disturbed by a stone.

The smile never left his face.

“Reaction predictable. Emotional response: primal. I understand. But I am n
