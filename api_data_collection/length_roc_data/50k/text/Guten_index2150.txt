Everybody knows, in a general way, that the finest place in the       world is—or, alas, _was_—the Dutch borough of       Vondervotteimittiss. Yet as it lies some distance from any of the       main roads, being in a somewhat out-of-the-way situation, there       are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit.       For the benefit of those who have not, therefore, it will be only       proper that I should enter into some account of it. And this is       indeed the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting public       sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a       history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred       within its limits. No one who knows me will doubt that the duty       thus self-imposed will be executed to the best of my ability,       with all that rigid impartiality, all that cautious examination       into facts, and diligent collation of authorities, which should       ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian.        By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am       enabled to say, positively, that the borough of       Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely       the same condition which it at present preserves. Of the date of       this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that       species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are, at       times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae. The       date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its       antiquity, cannot be less than any assignable quantity       whatsoever.        Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I       confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault. Among a multitude       of opinions upon this delicate point—some acute, some learned,       some sufficiently the reverse—I am able to select nothing which       ought to be considered satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of       Grogswigg—nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey—is to be       cautiously preferred.—It runs:—“Vondervotteimittis—Vonder, lege       Donder—Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz—Bleitziz obsol:—pro       Blitzen.” This derivative, to say the truth, is still       countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the       summit of the steeple of the House of the Town-Council. I do not       choose, however, to commit myself on a theme of such importance,       and must refer the reader desirous of information to the       “Oratiunculae de Rebus Praeter-Veteris,” of Dundergutz. See,       also, Blunderbuzzard “De Derivationibus,” pp. 27 to 5010, Folio,       Gothic edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher;       wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of       Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell.        Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the       foundation of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name,       there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always       existed as we find it at this epoch. The oldest man in the       borough can remember not the slightest difference in the       appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion       of such a possibility is considered an insult. The site of the       village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a       mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills,       over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For       this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe       there is anything at all on the other side.        Round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved       throughout with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty       little houses. These, having their backs on the hills, must look,       of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards       from the front door of each dwelling. Every house has a small       garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and       twenty-four cabbages. The buildings themselves are so precisely       alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other.       Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is       somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly       picturesque. They are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks,       red, with black ends, so that the walls look like a chess-board       upon a great scale. The gables are turned to the front, and there       are cornices, as big as all the rest of the house, over the eaves       and over the main doors. The windows are narrow and deep, with       very tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a vast       quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The woodwork, throughout,       is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it, with but a       trifling variety of pattern for, time out of mind, the carvers of       Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two       objects—a time-piece and a cabbage. But these they do exceedingly       well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity, wherever       they find room for the chisel.        The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture       is all upon one plan. The floors are of square tiles, the chairs       and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy       feet. The mantelpieces are wide and high, and have not only       time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real       time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the       middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each       extremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the       time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach       with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the       dial-plate of a watch.        The fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking       fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot       over it, full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of       the house is always busy in attending. She is a little fat old       lady, with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a       sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress       is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and       very short in the waist—and indeed very short in other respects,       not reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat thick,       and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings       to cover them. Her shoes—of pink leather—are fastened each with a       bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In       her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right       she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork. By her side there       stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its       tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way of a quiz.        The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden       attending the pig. They are each two feet in height. They have       three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to       their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes       with big silver buckles, long surtout coats with large buttons of       mother-of-pearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little       dumpy watch in his right hand. He takes a puff and a look, and       then a look and a puff. The pig—which is corpulent and lazy—is       occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the       cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater,       which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him       look as handsome as the cat.        Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed       chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is       seated the old man of the house himself. He is an exceedingly       puffy little old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge       double chin. His dress resembles that of the boys—and I need say       nothing farther about it. All the difference is, that his pipe is       somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke. Like       them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket. To       say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch       to attend to—and what that is, I shall presently explain. He sits       with his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance,       and always keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon       a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain.        This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town       Council. The Town Council are all very little, round, oily,       intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and       have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger       than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my       sojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings,       and have adopted these three important resolutions:        “That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things:”        “That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss:”       and—        “That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”        Above the session-room of the Council is the steeple, and in the       steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of       mind, the pride and wonder of the village—the great clock of the       borough of Vondervotteimittiss. And this is the object to which       the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the       leather-bottomed arm-chairs.        The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the seven sides of       the steeple—so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its       faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There       is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty       is the most perfect of sinecures—for the clock of       Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the       matter with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a       thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of       antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have       been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was       just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the       borough. Never was such a place for keeping the true time. When       the large clapper thought proper to say “Twelve o’clock!” all its       obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and       responded like a very echo. In short, the good burghers were fond       of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks.        All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less       respect, and as the belfry—man of Vondervotteimittiss has the       most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of       any man in the world. He is the chief dignitary of the borough,       and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence.       His coat-tail is very far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his       eyes, and his stomach, very far bigger—than those of any other       old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only       double, but triple.        I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss:       alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!        There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that       “no good can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that       the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy. It       wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when       there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the       ridge of the eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted       universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a       leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of       dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the       clock in the steeple.        By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll       object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive       foreign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great       rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him. He was       really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen       in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark       snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide       mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed       anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. What       with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his       face to be seen. His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done       up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed       black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of       white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black       stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black       satin ribbon for bows. Under one arm he carried a huge       _chapeau-de-bras_, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times       as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from       which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of       fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the       greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!—here was a       sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!        To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an       audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right       into the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited       no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day       would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric       handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his       swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous       indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a       fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the       remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his       steps.        The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to       get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a       minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the       midst of them; gave a _chassez_ here, and a _balancez_ there; and       then, after a _pirouette_ and a _pas-de-zephyr_, pigeon-winged       himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town       Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a       state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at       once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big       _chapeau-de-bras_ upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes       and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it       so long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so       fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that       there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the       devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of       Vondervotteimittiss.        There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this       unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for       the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon.       The bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and       pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his       watch. It was evident, however, that just at this moment the       fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business       to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had       any time to attend to his manœuvres, for they had all to count       the strokes of the bell as it sounded.        “One!” said the clock.        “Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every       leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss. “Von!” said       his watch also; “von!” said the watch of his vrow; and “von!”       said the watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on       the tails of the cat and pig.        “Two!” continued the big bell; and        “Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.        “Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!” said the bell.        “Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin! Den!” answered the       others.        “Eleven!” said the big one.        “Eleben!” assented the little ones.        “Twelve!” said the bell.        “Dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their       voices.        “Und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up       their watches. But the big bell had not done with them yet.        “Thirteen!” said he.        “Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale,       dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from       over their left knees.        “Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—Mein Gott, it is       Dirteen o’clock!!”        Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All       Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of       uproar.        “Vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys—“I’ve been       ongry for dis hour!”        “Vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “It has       been done to rags for this hour!”        “Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen,       “Donder and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”—and       they filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in       their arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the       whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.        Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it       seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing       in the shape of a timepiece. The clocks carved upon the furniture       took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the       mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and       kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking       and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.       But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up       any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to       their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place,       scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and       caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and       running under the petticoats of the people, and creating       altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is       possible for a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters       still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the       steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost. Every now       and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the       smoke. There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was       lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the villain held the       bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising       such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. On       his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all       time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the       nincompoop! of playing “Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’Rafferty.”        Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in       disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and       fine kraut. Let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore       the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting       that little fellow from the steeple.     LIONIZING        —— all people went      Upon their ten toes in wild wonderment.                     —_Bishop Hall’s Satires_.        I am—that is to say I was—a great man; but I am neither the       author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe,       is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of       Fum-Fudge.        The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with       both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius—my father       wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I       mastered before I was breeched.        I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to       understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently       conspicuous, he might, by merely following it, arrive at a       Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories alone.       Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed       a half dozen of drams.        When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step       with him into his study.        “My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of       your existence?”        “My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”        “And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”        “Sir,” I said, “it is the science of Noses.”        “And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a       nose?”        “A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been       variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here I       pulled out my watch.] “It is now noon or thereabouts—we shall       have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To       commence then:—The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that       protuberance—that bump—that excrescence—that—”        “Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “I am       thunderstruck at the extent of your information—I am       positively—upon my soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his       hand upon his heart.] “Come here!” [Here he took me by the arm.]       “Your education may now be considered as finished—it is high time       you should scuffle for yourself—and you cannot do a better thing       than merely follow your nose—so—so—so—” [Here he kicked me       downstairs and out of the door.]—“so get out of my house, and God       bless you!”        As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this       accident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided       by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my nose. I gave it       a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology       forthwith.        All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.        “Wonderful genius!” said the Quarterly.        “Superb physiologist!” said the Westminster.        “Clever fellow!” said the Foreign.        “Fine writer!” said the Edinburgh.        “Profound thinker!” said the Dublin.        “Great man!” said Bentley.        “Divine soul!” said Fraser.        “One of us!” said Blackwood.        “Who can he be?” said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.        “What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.        “Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.—But I paid these       people no attention whatever—I just stepped into the shop of an       artist.        The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the       Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess’ poodle; the Earl of       This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness       of Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.        I approached the artist and turned up my nose.        “Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.        “Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.        “Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.        “Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.        “What will you take for it?” asked the artist.        “For his nose!” shouted her Grace.        “A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.        “A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Beautiful!” said he, entranced.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.        “I do,” said I, blowing it well.        “Is it quite original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence.        “Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.        “Has no copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a       microscope.        “None,” said I, turning it up.        “Admirable!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the       beauty of the manœuvre.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Precisely,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Just so,” said I.        “You shall have them,” said he. “What a piece of virtu!” So he       drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I       engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the       ninety-ninth edition of the “Nosology,” with a portrait of the       proboscis.—That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me       to dinner.        We were all lions and _recherchés_.        There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus,       Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.        There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgôt, Price,       Priestly, Condorcêt, De Staël, and the “Ambitious Student in Ill       Health.”        There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were       philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.        There was Æstheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms;       bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive       intelligence and homoömeria.        There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus;       heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism;       Homousios and Homouioisios.        There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned       Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with _velouté_ sauce; veal _à       la St_. Menehoult; marinade _à la_ St. Florentin; and orange       jellies _en mosaïques_.        There was Bibulus O’Bumper. He touched upon Latour and       Markbrünnen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and St.       George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and       Preignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon St.       Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told, with his       eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.        There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of       Cimabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino—of the gloom of       Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of       the frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.        There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of       opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in       Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.        There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking       that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in       the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth       was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of       green horns.        There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the       eighty-three lost tragedies of Æschylus; of the fifty-four       orations of Isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches       of Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus;       of the eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of       Pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty       tragedies of Homer Junior.        There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all       about internal fires and tertiary formations; about aëriforms,       fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist       and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about       blende and horn-blende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about       cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about       antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please.        There was myself. I spoke of myself;—of myself, of myself, of       myself;—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up       my nose, and I spoke of myself.        “Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.        “Superb!” said his guests;—and next morning her Grace of       Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.        “Will you go to Almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me       under the chin.        “Upon honor,” said I.        “Nose and all?” she asked.        “As I live,” I replied.        “Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be there?”        “Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”        “Pshaw, no!—but with all your nose?”        “Every bit of it, my love,” said I:—so I gave it a twist or two,       and found myself at Almack’s. The rooms were crowded to       suffocation.        “He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.        “He is coming!” said somebody farther up.        “He is coming!” said somebody farther still.        “He is come!” exclaimed the Duchess. “He is come, the little       love!”—and, seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice       upon the nose. A marked sensation immediately ensued.        “_Diavolo!_” cried Count Capricornutti.        “_Dios guarda!_” muttered Don Stiletto.        “_Mille tonnerres!_” ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.        “_Tousand teufel!_” growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.        It was not to be borne. I grew angry. I turned short upon       Bluddennuff.        “Sir!” said I to him, “you are a baboon.”        “Sir,” he replied, after a pause, “_Donner und Blitzen!_”        This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards. At       Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose—and then called       upon my friends.        “_Bête!_” said the first.        “Fool!” said the second.        “Dolt!” said the third.        “Ass!” said the fourth.        “Ninny!” said the fifth.        “Noodle!” said the sixth.        “Be off!” said the seventh.        At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.        “Father,” I asked, “what is the chief end of my existence?”        “My son,” he replied, “it is still the study of Nosology; but in       hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark.       You have a fine nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none.       You are damned, and he has become the hero of the day. I grant       you that in Fum-Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to       the size of his proboscis—but, good heavens! there is no       competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all.”     X-ING A PARAGRAB         As it is well known that the ‘wise men’ came ‘from the East,’ and       as Mr. Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows       that Mr. Bullet-head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of       the matter be needed, here we have it—Mr. B. was an editor.       Irascibility was his sole foible, for in fact the obstinacy of       which men accused him was anything but his foible, since he       justly considered it his forte. It was his strong point—his       virtue; and it would have required all the logic of a Brownson to       convince him that it was ‘anything else.’        I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and       the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible, was when,       abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men, the East, he       migrated to the city of Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, or some       place of a similar title, out West.        I must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made up       his mind finally to settle in that town, it was under the       impression that no newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed       in that particular section of the country. In establishing ‘The       Tea-Pot’ he expected to have the field all to himself. I feel       confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence       in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, in       Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named John       Smith (if I rightly remember), who for many years had there       quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the       ‘Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis Gazette.’ It was solely,       therefore, on account of having been misinformed, that Mr.       Bullet-head found himself in Alex—— suppose we call it Nopolis,       ‘for short’—but, as he did find himself there, he determined to       keep up his character for obst—for firmness, and remain. So       remain he did; and he did more; he unpacked his press, type,       etc., etc., rented an office exactly opposite to that of the       ‘Gazette,’ and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued       the first number of ‘The Alexan’—that is to say, of ‘The Nopolis       Tea-Pot’—as nearly as I can recollect, this was the name of the       new paper.        The leading article, I must admit, was brilliant—not to say       severe. It was especially bitter about things in general—and as       for the editor of ‘The Gazette,’ he was torn all to pieces in       particular. Some of Bullet-head’s remarks were really so fiery       that I have always, since that time, been forced to look upon       John Smith, who is still alive, in the light of a salamander. I       cannot pretend to give all the ‘Tea-Pot’s’ paragraphs verbatim,       but one of them runs thus:        ‘Oh, yes!—Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! The editor over the way       is a genius—O, my! Oh, goodness, gracious!—what is this world       coming to? Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!’        A philippic at once so caustic and so classical, alighted like a       bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of Nopolis. Groups       of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets.       Every one awaited, with heartfelt anxiety, the reply of the       dignified Smith. Next morning it appeared as follows:        ‘We quote from “The Tea-Pot” of yesterday the subjoined       paragraph: “Oh, yes! Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! Oh, my! Oh,       goodness! Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!” Why, the fellow is all O! That       accounts for his reasoning in a circle, and explains why there is       neither beginning nor end to him, nor to anything he says. We       really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasn’t       an O in it. Wonder if this O-ing is a habit of his? By-the-by, he       came away from Down-East in a great hurry. Wonder if he O’s as       much there as he does here? “O! it is pitiful.”’        The indignation of Mr. Bullet-head at these scandalous       insinuations, I shall not attempt to describe. On the       eel-skinning principle, however, he did not seem to be so much       incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have       imagined. It was the sneer at his style that drove him to       desperation. What!—he Touch-and-go Bullet-head!—not able to write       a word without an O in it! He would soon let the jackanapes see       that he was mistaken. Yes! he would let him see how much he was       mistaken, the puppy! He, Touch-and-go Bullet-head, of       Frogpondium, would let Mr. John Smith perceive that he,       Bullet-head, could indite, if it so pleased him, a whole       paragraph—aye! a whole article—in which that contemptible vowel       should not once—not even once—make its appearance. But no;—that       would be yielding a point to the said John Smith. He,       Bullet-head, would make no alteration in his style, to suit the       caprices of any Mr. Smith in Christendom. Perish so vile a       thought! The O forever; He would persist in the O. He would be as       O-wy as O-wy could be.        Burning with the chivalry of this determination, the great       Touch-and-go, in the next ‘Tea-Pot,’ came out merely with this       simple but resolute paragraph, in reference to this unhappy       affair:        ‘The editor of the “Tea-Pot” has the honor of advising the editor       of the “Gazette” that he (the “Tea-Pot”) will take an opportunity       in tomorrow morning’s paper, of convincing him (the “Gazette”)       that he (the “Tea-Pot”) both can and will be _his own master_, as       regards style;—he (the “Tea-Pot”) intending to show him (the       “Gazette”) the supreme, and indeed the withering contempt with       which the criticism of him (the “Gazette”) inspires the       independent bosom of him (the “Tea-Pot”) by composing for the       especial gratification (?) of him (the “Gazette”) a leading       article, of some extent, in which the beautiful vowel—the emblem       of Eternity—yet so offensive to the hyper-exquisite delicacy of       him (the “Gazette”) shall most certainly not be avoided by his       (the “Gazette’s”) most obedient, humble servant, the “Tea-Pot.”       “So much for Buckingham!”’        In fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather       than decidedly enunciated, the great Bullet-head, turning a deaf       ear to all entreaties for ‘copy,’ and simply requesting his       foreman to ‘go to the d——l,’ when he (the foreman) assured him       (the ‘Tea-Pot’!) that it was high time to ‘go to press’: turning       a deaf ear to everything, I say, the great Bullet-head sat up       until day-break, consuming the midnight oil, and absorbed in the       composition of the really unparalleled paragraph, which follows:—        ‘So ho, John! how now? Told you so, you know. Don’t crow, another       time, before you’re out of the woods! Does your mother know       you’re out? Oh, no, no!—so go home at once, now, John, to your       odious old woods of Concord! Go home to your woods, old owl—go!       You won’t! Oh, poh, poh, John don’t do so! You’ve _got_ to go,       you know! So go at once, and don’t go slow, for nobody owns you       here, you know! Oh! John, John, if you don’t go you’re no       homo—no! You’re only a fowl, an owl; a cow, a sow; a doll, a       poll; a poor, old, good-for-nothing-to-nobody, log, dog, hog, or       frog, come out of a Concord bog. Cool, now—cool! Do be cool, you       fool! None of your crowing, old cock! Don’t frown so—don’t! Don’t       hollo, nor howl nor growl, nor bow-wow-wow! Good Lord, John, how       you do look! Told you so, you know—but stop rolling your goose of       an old poll about so, and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl!’        Exhausted, very naturally, by so stupendous an effort, the great       Touch-and-go could attend to nothing farther that night. Firmly,       composedly, yet with an air of conscious power, he handed his MS.       to the devil in waiting, and then, walking leisurely home,       retired, with ineffable dignity to bed.        Meantime the devil, to whom the copy was entrusted, ran up stairs       to his ‘case,’ in an unutterable hurry, and forthwith made a       commencement at ‘setting’ the MS. ‘up.’        In the first place, of course,—as the opening word was ‘So,’—he       made a plunge into the capital S hole and came out in triumph       with a capital S. Elated by this success, he immediately threw       himself upon the little-o box with a blindfold impetuosity—but       who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without       the anticipated letter in their clutch? who shall paint his       astonishment and rage at perceiving, as he rubbed his knuckles,       that he had been only thumping them to no purpose, against the       bottom of an empty box. Not a single little-o was in the little-o       hole; and, glancing fearfully at the capital-O partition, he       found _that_, to his extreme terror, in a precisely similar       predicament. Awe-stricken, his first impulse was to rush to the       foreman.        ‘Sir!’ said he, gasping for breath, ‘I can’t never set up nothing       without no o’s.’        ‘What do you mean by that?’ growled the foreman, who was in a       very ill humor at being kept so late.        ‘Why, sir, there beant an o in the office, neither a big un nor a       little un!’        ‘What—what the d—l has become of all that were in the case?’        ‘I don’t know, sir,’ said the boy, ‘but one of them ere “G’zette”       devils is bin prowling ’bout here all night, and I spect he’s       gone and cabbaged ‘em every one.’        ‘Dod rot him! I haven’t a doubt of it,’ replied the foreman,       getting purple with rage ‘but I tell you what you do, Bob, that’s       a good boy—you go over the first chance you get and hook every       one of their i’s and (d——n them!) their izzards.’        ‘Jist so,’ replied Bob, with a wink and a frown—‘I’ll be into       ‘em, I’ll let ‘em know a thing or two; but in de meantime, that       ere paragrab? Mus go in to-night, you know—else there’ll be the       d—l to pay, and—’        ‘And not a bit of pitch hot,’ interrupted the foreman, with a       deep sigh, and an emphasis on the ‘bit.’ ‘Is it a long paragraph,       Bob?’        ‘Shouldn’t call it a _wery_ long paragrab,’ said Bob.        ‘Ah, well, then! do the best you can with it! We must get to       press,’ said the foreman, who was over head and ears in work;       ‘just stick in some other letter for o; nobody’s going to read       the fellow’s trash anyhow.’        ‘Wery well,’ replied Bob, ‘here goes it!’ and off he hurried to       his case, muttering as he went: ‘Considdeble vell, them ere       expressions, perticcler for a man as doesn’t swar. So I’s to       gouge out all their eyes, eh? and d-n all their gizzards! Vell!       this here’s the chap as is just able for to do it.’ The fact is       that although Bob was but twelve years old and four feet high, he       was equal to any amount of fight, in a small way.        The exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in       printing-offices; and I cannot tell how to account for it, but       the fact is indisputable, that when the exigency does occur, it       almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the       letter deficient. The true reason, perhaps, is that x is rather       the most superabundant letter in the cases, or at least was so in       the old times—long enough to render the substitution in question       an habitual thing with printers. As for Bob, he would have       considered it heretical to employ any other character, in a case       of this kind, than the x to which he had been accustomed.        ‘I shell have to x this ere paragrab,’ said he to himself, as he       read it over in astonishment, ‘but it’s jest about the awfulest       o-wy paragrab I ever did see’: so x it he did, unflinchingly, and       to press it went x-ed.        Next morning the population of Nopolis were taken all aback by       reading in ‘The Tea-Pot,’ the following extraordinary leader:        ‘Sx hx, Jxhn! hxw nxw? Txld yxu sx, yxu knxw. Dxn’t crxw, anxther       time, befxre yxu’re xut xf the wxxds! Dxes yxur mxther knxw       yxu’re xut? Xh, nx, nx!—sx gx hxme at xnce, nxw, Jxhn, tx yxur       xdixus xld wxxds xf Cxncxrd!

The first definite idea entertained by       the populace was, that some diabolical treason lay concealed in       the hieroglyphics; and there was a general rush to Bullet-head’s       residence, for the purpose of riding him on a rail; but that       gentleman was nowhere to be found. He had vanished, no one could       tell how; and not even the ghost of him has ever been seen since.        Unable to discover its legitimate object, the popular fury at       length subsided; leaving behind it, by way of sediment, quite a       medley of opinion about this unhappy affair.        One gentleman thought the whole an X-ellent joke.        Another said that, indeed, Bullet-head had shown much X-uberance       of fancy.        A third admitted him X-entric, but no more.        A fourth could only suppose it the Yankee’s design to X-press, in       a general way, his X-asperation.        ‘Say, rather, to set an X-ample to posterity,’ suggested a fifth.        That Bullet-head had been driven to an extremity, was clear to       all; and in fact, since that editor could not be found, there was       some talk about lynching the other one.        The more common conclusion, however, was that the affair was,       simply, X-traordinary and in-X-plicable. Even the town       mathematician confessed that he could make nothing of so dark a       problem. X, everybody knew, was an unknown quantity; but in this       case (as he properly observed), there was an unknown quantity of       X.        The opinion of Bob, the devil (who kept dark about his having       ‘X-ed the paragrab’), did not meet with so much attention as I       think it deserved, although it was very openly and very       fearlessly expressed. He said that, for his part, he had no doubt       about the matter at all, that it was a clear case, that Mr.       Bullet-head ‘never could be persuaded fur to drink like other       folks, but vas continually a-svigging o’ that ere blessed XXX       ale, and as a naiteral consekvence, it just puffed him up savage,       and made him X (cross) in the X-treme.’     METZENGERSTEIN        Pestis eram vivus—moriens tua mors ero.                     —_Martin Luther_        Horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. Why       then give a date to this story I have to tell? Let it suffice to       say, that at the period of which I speak, there existed, in the       interior of Hungary, a settled although hidden belief in the       doctrines of the Metempsychosis. Of the doctrines themselves—that       is, of their falsity, or of their probability—I say nothing. I       assert, however, that much of our incredulity—as La Bruyère says       of all our unhappiness—“_vient de ne pouvoir être seuls_.” {*1}        But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which       were fast verging to absurdity. They—the Hungarians—differed very       essentially from their Eastern authorities. For example, “_The       soul_,” said the former—I give the words of an acute and       intelligent Parisian—“_ne demeure qu’un seul fois dans un corps       sensible: au reste—un cheval, un chien, un homme même, n’est que       la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux._”        The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at       variance for centuries. Never before were two houses so       illustrious, mutually embittered by hostility so deadly. The       origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an       ancient prophecy—“A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as       the rider over his horse, the mortality of Metzengerstein shall       triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing.”        To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning. But       more trivial causes have given rise—and that no long while ago—to       consequences equally eventful. Besides, the estates, which were       contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs       of a busy government. Moreover, near neighbors are seldom       friends; and the inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might       look, from their lofty buttresses, into the very windows of the       palace Metzengerstein. Least of all had the more than feudal       magnificence, thus discovered, a tendency to allay the irritable       feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy Berlifitzings. What       wonder then, that the words, however silly, of that prediction,       should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two       families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of       hereditary jealousy? The prophecy seemed to imply—if it implied       anything—a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful       house; and was of course remembered with the more bitter       animosity by the weaker and less influential.        Wilhelm, Count Berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at       the epoch of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man,       remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal       ant
