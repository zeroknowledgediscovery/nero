Lights Between Lies

Chapter One: The Audition

Los Angeles, for all its sun-drenched glamour, stank of desperation in the early mornings. The sidewalks shimmered with the vague residue of last night’s failures, and the air buzzed with a peculiar static of expectation. Jesse Lorne, 29 years old and still clinging to the prefix “aspiring,” stood outside the Ventura Boulevard casting office with a coffee cup that trembled just slightly in his hand.

He was handsome in that generic way that agents found reassuring—sharp cheekbones, brooding eyes, hair that curled in exactly the right places to look rebellious without threatening commercial viability. But his eyes—his eyes were tired. There was something quietly collapsed about him that no lighting technician could fix.

He rehearsed the lines again. “I’m not afraid of dying. I’m afraid of disappearing.” It sounded stale to his ears now, parched. Every other guy inside that waiting room probably delivered it with the same clenched jaw and faux gravitas. Jesse hadn’t worked in nearly eight months. His last gig had been a short-lived web series called Fangs & Fables, where he played a werewolf with a secret heart of gold. The show had been canceled halfway through its second season, and no one had even told him personally. He found out from Twitter.

Inside, a bored assistant called his name. “Jesse Lorne? You’re up.”

He stepped into the audition room, where a folding table separated him from three people who didn’t look up from their laptops. Behind the camera, a woman with prematurely gray hair gave him a brittle smile. “Slate please.”

“Jesse Lorne. Six feet. Repped by Varner & Lee.”

“Whenever you’re ready.”

He started the scene, but halfway through his second line, the man in the center—presumably the director—sighed. Loudly.

“Hold up. Can you, like, actually feel it? This isn’t CSI: Glendale, alright? This guy’s supposed to be wrecked. You ever lose something that mattered?”

Jesse blinked. “Yes. I have.”

“Then bring that.”

He did the scene again. Slower this time. Quieter. He didn’t raise his voice. Didn’t reach. The fear in his chest wasn’t theatrical; it was real. Afterward, no one said anything for a moment too long. The gray-haired woman gave a nod.

“Thanks, Jesse. That was… better.”

He left the room. The sunlight outside seemed blinding, accusatory. He took out his phone, then put it back in his pocket. No one to call. No one who would care. He walked down the boulevard until he reached a bus stop. He didn’t get on the bus. Just sat on the bench and watched the cars glide past like ghosts on rails.

Chapter Two: The Callback

He got the callback two days later.

His agent, a relentlessly optimistic woman named Sherri, called while he was microwaving a burrito. “You’re pinned for Sins of Empire. The new Netflix limited series. It’s down to you and one other guy for the lead.”

Jesse blinked. “The lead?”

“I told you they were looking for someone raw. You’re raw as hell, Jesse. That scene, that audition? It wasn’t acting. It was... cracked open.”

He didn’t know what to say to that. Gratitude stuck somewhere in his chest. “Do we know who the other guy is?”

“Probably someone with a verified Instagram. Who cares? You’re in the room now. Wear something black. Moody sells.”

The callback was more intense. They had him do a chemistry read with a tall actress named Wren Moretti, who had already been cast. She had this haunting look about her, all angles and pale skin and eyes like broken glass. She didn’t speak to him before the read. Just nodded once, briskly.

In the scene, she played a war correspondent and he a jaded ex-soldier turned vigilante. Jesse forgot the camera was there. When she reached out and touched his arm in the scene, something unspoken cracked between them. A moment later, the casting director said, “Cut,” and Jesse realized his hands were shaking.

Afterward, Wren finally looked at him. “You’re not faking it,” she said. Not a question.

“No,” he said.

“Good. Then maybe we won’t screw this up.”

Chapter Three: Filming Begins

Jesse got the part.

They flew him to Vancouver. He stayed in a furnished apartment that smelled faintly of lemon cleanser and someone else’s memories. The shoot was grueling. Long days. Short nights. Emotional landmines buried in every scene. The director, Marcus Hollin, was a legend—a self-described "actor’s director" who liked to whisper secrets into ears right before the take. He once told Jesse that the character, Kade Rilke, had attempted suicide off-screen. That wasn't in the script.

“You don’t need to say it. But feel it.”

The camera loved Jesse. He could feel it. When he cried, it wasn’t performative. When he screamed, it was hoarse and real. He didn’t know where Kade ended and he began.

Wren was brilliant. Distant. They didn’t talk much between scenes, but on-screen, their chemistry crackled like live wires. Rumors started—gossip blogs whispering about an off-camera romance. There wasn’t one. Unless you counted the silences between them, which seemed thick with something unnamed.

“Why don’t you ever talk after we shoot?” Jesse asked her one night.

They were alone in the makeup trailer. She was wiping off blood from a stunt scene.

“Because it bleeds over,” she said. “If I start talking, I don’t know who I’ll be. Me or her.”

He understood that. Too well.

Chapter Four: Fame Arrives

When Sins of Empire dropped, it exploded. Jesse woke up one morning to 200k Instagram followers. Then half a million. The show topped charts. Critics raved. His face was everywhere—billboards, memes, magazine covers. The New Yorker called his performance “brutally honest, with edges carved from trauma and truth.”

People recognized him at gas stations. Waitresses smiled too long. Paparazzi began following him, especially when he and Wren were seen leaving the same hotel in Manhattan.

They weren’t together, not really. They’d slept together exactly twice. Both times after late-night reshoots, both times without speaking after. There was a sadness in her that matched his, and that sort of thing doesn’t lead to love. Just reflection.

His agent got offers. Marvel wanted to meet. A Scorsese project circled. His name was being said in rooms he never imagined he’d enter.

But something was unraveling.

Chapter Five: The Lie Beneath

Jesse’s mother called one evening. She lived in Idaho, ran a quilting shop, didn’t watch television.

“You okay, hon?”

He hesitated. “Yeah.”

“You sound hollow,” she said. “Like you’re echoing.”

That stuck with him.

He started drinking more. Not recklessly, just enough to blur the lines. Wren vanished after the premiere. Wouldn’t return texts. Rumor said she was in a rehab clinic in Arizona, but no one confirmed it.

Then came the leak.

A Reddit thread. A video. Grainy footage of Jesse screaming at a PA on set. Calling him “a worthless extra in the background of his life.”

It spread fast. People tweeted things like “Jesse Lorne = canceled” and “Another fake nice guy revealed.”

The studio issued a statement. Jesse’s publicist crafted an apology. He read it like a script.

“I’m deeply sorry for my behavior. That wasn’t me.”

But it was him. A version.

He disappeared for a while. Upstate cabin. No internet. Just snow and pine trees and silence.

One day, Wren showed up.

“How’d you find me?”

She shrugged. “Everyone’s findable. Even ghosts.”

They didn’t talk much. She stayed three days. They didn’t sleep together.

When she left, she said, “You should write something. Tell your own story. Otherwise, they’ll keep writing it for you.”

He stared at the fire after she left. The logs hissed. Something old inside him cracked open.

Jesse walked for almost an hour without direction, letting the hum of traffic and the sharpness of late morning sun push against his skin. His thoughts turned to static—snippets of dialogue, the director’s sigh, the way his voice caught in his throat halfway through the final line. There was a flavor to rejection in this town that never quite dulled with repetition. It always found new edges, new angles to twist from. By the time he reached Laurel Canyon, he realized he’d walked past his apartment by several blocks. He doubled back, passing the same rusted red Jeep parked beside the curb, same man in a trucker hat chain-smoking with his phone pressed to his ear, arguing about headshots.

Back in his apartment—third floor walk-up, faded carpet, cracked tiles in the kitchenette—he dropped the keys into the chipped bowl near the door and let himself fall onto the couch. The cushions gave a long sigh, as if they too were tired of pretending they belonged in someone’s success story.

He picked up the script again, eyes scanning lines he no longer felt connected to. The role—Kade Rilke, ex-Marine turned reluctant hero in the fictional civil collapse of America—had layers, but they were the kind of layers executives liked: enough trauma to be brooding, but not enough to be alienating. Jesse could see what they wanted in him. The sadness he carried was palatable. It didn’t repel. It looked good on camera.

He was nearly asleep when his phone buzzed. Sherri’s name flashed on the screen.

“You were good,” she said, no hello.

“How do you know?” he asked, rubbing sleep from his eyes.

“I got a text from casting. They ‘liked what you brought to the table.’ That’s code for you’re still in it. So don’t go full tortured artist just yet.”

He didn’t say anything for a moment. The idea of hope was almost more exhausting than failure.

“Did they say when callbacks are?”

“Not yet. But soon. Probably this week. And Jesse?”

“Yeah?”

“Don’t self-destruct, okay? These things move fast when they want to. You’ll blink and be famous. Or you’ll blink and it’s over. Either way, stay upright.”

After she hung up, he sat in silence, watching the fan rotate in lazy circles above his head. He thought about what it would mean to land the part. What it would change. What it wouldn’t. He tried to imagine his face on a billboard. It felt like thinking about someone else.

Later that night, he walked down to Mel’s Diner. The place was half-empty, neon casting a violet sheen over the cracked pleather booths. He ordered pancakes and black coffee and tried not to think. But everywhere around him were conversations echoing with ambition. A man in the next booth talking loudly about a spec script he was shopping around. A pair of girls at the counter discussing a dance audition for a music video. The city was swollen with dreams. It was hard to breathe sometimes.

A server named Nikki, who knew his name but not much else, brought over his check with a smile.

“You look like you either booked something or got dumped,” she said, half-joking.

“Maybe both,” he replied, and she laughed without asking questions.

He walked home past rows of flickering street lamps, thinking of all the versions of himself he’d left behind at auditions over the years—dozens of Jesses, each trapped in a different failed monologue. A graveyard of performances, scattered across LA’s casting rooms.

By the time he got home, a message blinked on his phone. An unfamiliar number. Short. To the point.

"Callback. Friday. 3PM. Same place."

No name. Just a time and an expectation.

He felt it then, the first stirrings of something real beneath the numbness. Fear, maybe. Or hope’s more dangerous cousin—potential. He stared at the screen for a long time, then set the phone down and picked up the script again. This time, the words didn’t feel so stale. This time, he read them like they mattered.

The days leading up to the callback passed in a quiet sort of pressure. He didn’t tell anyone—not even Alex, his roommate, who was off somewhere filming a commercial for allergy medication. Jesse spent most of his time walking through the scenes, mumbling to himself, recording voice memos, listening back to them, deleting most. He tried different versions. Angrier. More broken. Colder. None felt quite right.

On Wednesday, he went to a workshop run by a washed-up theater actor who now taught "emotional unlocking" classes out of a rented space in Echo Park. There were maybe seven people in the room, all doing breathing exercises and screaming into the air like they were shedding snakeskin. Jesse didn’t scream. He just sat and watched.

The actor leading the group—Dorian something—noticed.

“You’re holding back,” he said after the session, wiping sweat from his forehead.

“Maybe,” Jesse said.

“You’re scared of being seen.”

“Isn’t everyone?”

Dorian laughed at that. “Some of us make a living pretending we’re not. Come back Friday. You might scream then.”

Jesse didn’t go back. But something about the comment stuck. Scared of being seen. It felt truer than anything he’d been told during actual auditions. Scarier, too.

Friday came. He wore a plain black T-shirt, dark jeans. No jewelry, no flash. He looked at himself in the mirror before leaving and tried to see what they saw. He couldn’t. He looked like a man trying not to look afraid.

The waiting room was fuller this time. At least a dozen guys. One of them he recognized from a cable show—someone who’d played a detective with a drinking problem. Another looked like a TikTok star. They all had the same tense stillness, the same vague half-smile that said “I’m fine” while hiding “I need this.”

They called his name again. He stood, chest tight.

The room was the same. The folding table. The gray-haired woman. The man in the center with tired eyes. But this time, Wren Moretti was there too.

She didn’t look up when he entered. She was flipping through the sides, one leg crossed over the other, a pencil between her teeth. She looked like she belonged there, like the room rotated around her.

“Ready?” the director asked, barely glancing at Jesse.

He nodded.

They launched into the scene. No preamble. Wren turned toward him, and everything else fell away. The lines felt different coming from her. Sharper. Charged.

“I didn’t ask for your ghosts,” she said, voice low.

“They came anyway,” Jesse replied, quieter still.

There was a pause. A breath.

“I don’t want to save you,” she said, barely audible.

“I never asked you to.”

When it was over, no one spoke. Wren’s eyes stayed on him a moment longer than necessary. Then she looked away.

The director leaned forward. “That’s more like it.”

Jesse left the room in a daze, unsure of what had just happened. The sun was hot outside, the kind of heat that pressed down rather than warmed. He walked to his car without remembering the steps. Inside, he gripped the steering wheel for a long minute before starting the engine.

Something had shifted. He could feel it. But whether it was the world or just the tremor in his own spine, he wasn’t sure yet.

Chapter Two: The Callback

The city changed when you had a reason to be hopeful. It wasn’t that the skyline looked different or that the sidewalks were less cracked; it was subtler, like the traffic didn’t sting as sharply, the smog didn’t cling to your skin in quite the same way. Jesse walked into the callback two days later carrying something invisible but unmistakable—momentum. He’d barely slept the night before, nerves unspooling like thread in his chest, every minute dragging itself out like it was performing its own private audition for eternity. But under the exhaustion, he felt something else—clarity. A fragile sense of place.

This time, the waiting room was quieter. Fewer actors. One or two looked at him and nodded with the tired solidarity of those who understood exactly how much it cost to sit in that chair again. Jesse nodded back, unsure whether he recognized them from previous roles or just from the thousands of faces he had competed against over the years. The anonymity of competition had its own sort of intimacy. Everyone wanted the same thing and knew they couldn’t all have it.

When the assistant appeared—same frizzed bun, same clipboard held like a shield—she didn’t call names. Just looked straight at him and jerked her head. He followed her down the corridor. The fluorescent lights overhead flickered once, as though they, too, were nervous about what was coming.

Inside, the room was colder this time, the air-conditioning turned too high. The casting director sat with arms crossed, his expression unreadable. The producer, a woman with bleached hair and sharp cheekbones, scrolled absently on a phone. And then there was Wren. She stood near the camera, already in character—eyes shadowed, hair pulled back, a small smudge of makeup beneath her left eye to suggest weariness. She didn’t acknowledge Jesse beyond a glance, but he felt her energy wrap around him like static.

They skipped introductions. The moment he stepped onto his mark, the camera began rolling. Wren looked up, and the transformation was instant. She was no longer a famous actress in a room full of professionals—she was Rhea Halsey, foreign correspondent caught in the dust and despair of a nation eating itself alive. Jesse responded in kind, not because he was trying but because he couldn’t help it. There was something in her gaze that drew the truth from him like splinters from a wound.

“I didn’t come here to be your salvation,” she said, voice brittle.

“I didn’t come here to be saved.”

Their words hung between them, heavy with something deeper than dialogue. Jesse stepped closer, but not too close—just enough to suggest danger without inviting it. Wren didn’t flinch. She met him, beat for beat.

“You think I haven’t seen what men like you do when the world stops watching?”

“And you think I haven’t seen what reporters twist when they don’t get the ending they want?”

Silence again. Then, unexpectedly, she reached up, brushed his cheek with the back of her hand.

“You're not a villain,” she whispered. “You're just tired.”

He didn’t reply. He didn’t have to.

The director murmured, “Cut,” but no one moved for a moment. The air between them still crackled. Then Wren stepped back, folded the sides of the script and nodded once.

Jesse looked around the room, trying to gauge the response, but all he found were blank expressions. The kind that could mean everything or nothing. The producer leaned in to the director, whispered something. He didn’t look at Jesse. Not yet.

“You’ll hear soon,” was all the gray-haired woman said as she walked them out.

Wren finally glanced at him as they stood by the elevator.

“You feel it?” she asked.

“Yeah,” he replied. “Like falling and flying at the same time.”

She didn’t smile. Just nodded and stepped inside the elevator. The doors closed, and Jesse was left staring at his reflection in the polished steel. For once, he didn’t hate the face staring back.

He walked back to his car on autopilot, the audition replaying in his head like an echo he couldn’t quiet. For the first time in a long time, he hadn’t been performing. The words hadn’t been filtered through layers of intention and technique. He had simply existed within them. He wondered if that’s what good acting was—less of a craft and more of a surrender.

Later that night, Jesse found himself pacing his apartment. The walls felt too small, the air too still. He thought about calling his father but dismissed it. They hadn’t spoken in over two years, and he doubted a callback, no matter how promising, would be enough to bridge that silence. His father had never understood the acting thing. Thought it was a waste of time, a parade of false emotions for people too fragile for real life.

“You want to pretend for a living?” he’d once said. “Then don’t come crying to me when nobody believes you.”

Instead, Jesse texted Sherri.

"Call me if you hear anything. I think… this might be it."

She responded five minutes later with a thumbs-up emoji and a gif of someone popping champagne. He smiled despite himself.

The next morning, the call came.

“You booked it.”

That’s all Sherri said.

There was a long silence.

“You’re kidding,” he finally said.

“I don’t kid about money. Jesse—this is it. You’re Kade Rilke. All ten episodes. Netflix is behind it. It’s already greenlit. And you start in three weeks. Vancouver. They’re flying you out. You’ll get scripts next week, but listen… it’s real now. You did it.”

He sat down on the floor of his kitchen, suddenly unable to stand. The linoleum felt cool beneath his hands. His breath came in shallow gulps.

“Jesse?” Sherri’s voice was distant.

“I’m here.”

“You okay?”

“I think so.”

“You sound weird.”

“I think that’s because I forgot what it feels like to win.”

There was a pause. “Well,” she said gently, “get used to it.”

The days that followed moved like water caught between rocks—slow in some places, rushing in others. He met with wardrobe, signed contracts, had an hour-long Zoom with the series creator, a wiry man named Theo Lasker who had the kind of voice that made everything sound like a secret. Jesse learned that the show was based on a novel, a dystopian thriller set in the near future, where a fractured America was descending into localized regimes. Kade Rilke was a reluctant soldier-turned-mercenary caught between old loyalties and a desperate need for redemption.

“Think Children of Men meets The Hurt Locker,” Theo had said. “But with more nuance. Less explosions, more pain.”

“You ever serve?” Jesse asked.

“No,” Theo replied, lighting a cigarette even though the call was virtual. “But I know what it’s like to carry guilt.”

Jesse received the first three scripts by the end of the week. He printed them out, old-school style, and spread them across his kitchen table. Each page felt like a corridor, narrow and filled with shadows. Kade was a complex man, scarred but not ruined. Angry but soft in places. Jesse read and reread the lines until they bled into his dreams.

The flight to Vancouver was uneventful. He wore sunglasses and a hoodie, though no one at LAX looked at him twice. That would change. He knew it would. Fame was a slow bleed until it wasn’t—until it gushed, irreversible.

At the airport gate, he saw Wren again. She was wearing headphones and flipping through a thick binder. When she noticed him, she pulled off one earbud.

“You get a window or aisle?” she asked.

“Aisle.”

She nodded. “I’m window. Guess we’re stuck together.”

They didn’t speak much on the flight. But somewhere over Oregon, she handed him a page from the script. It was a scene they hadn’t shot yet—episode four, a quiet conversation in an abandoned church.

“You good with running lines?” she asked.

He took the page and read. It was a simple scene, but beneath the surface, it seethed. Regret, trust, the slow forming of something that might be love but didn’t want to name itself yet. When they finished, she looked at him with something close to approval.

“You don’t fake it,” she said. “That’s rare.”

He didn’t know what to say, so he said nothing.

By the time they landed, Vancouver was wrapped in gray clouds, the kind that promised weeks of rain. Jesse didn’t mind. The mood suited him.

A black car met them at the terminal. The driver held a sign: LORNE / MORETTI. Jesse smiled for the first time in days.

Something was beginning. Something vast.

The production schedule was a brutal thing—six days a week, twelve-hour shoots, night scenes that stretched into dawn and makeup calls that started before the sky even softened into blue. Jesse found himself waking in darkness and collapsing into bed well past the last light of day, his internal clock reduced to a tight coil of tension and caffeine. But he didn’t complain. He didn’t dare. Not when he’d clawed so hard to be here, not when he could feel the show wrapping itself around him like a second skin.

The production office had leased him a furnished apartment in Yaletown, minimalist and expensive, the kind of place with furniture that looked like it had never been touched and lighting that seemed more designed for mood than utility. He wandered the space like a guest at first, touching things carefully, as though afraid the illusion would shatter if he leaned too hard on the sleek gray couch or dropped his keys too loudly into the metal tray near the door.

Every morning, a black SUV picked him up and drove him to the set—an abandoned rail yard on the outskirts of the city, where the art department had constructed a decaying town square complete with boarded-up storefronts, graffiti-scrawled monuments, and the charred husk of a fictional courthouse. The illusion was total. From certain angles, Jesse could believe he was somewhere else entirely—somewhere ravaged, hollow, and utterly real.

The first few days were mostly B-roll and insert shots—sweeping overhead drone footage, background chaos, choreographed panics that were reset again and again until the movement of smoke and bodies looked effortless. Jesse spent most of that time with the stunt coordinator and his on-set handler, a quiet man named Callum who had the kind of face that looked as if it had never once flinched.

Callum ran him through firearms training, basic tactical movement, breath control. Jesse had handled weapons in previous projects, but this was different. There was no glamor to it, no fantasy. This was raw, unsentimental motion. They practiced again and again, clearing rooms, stacking on doors, transitioning from rifle to sidearm and back. Jesse bruised his shoulder more than once. Callum never commented on it.

“You’re fast,” he said on the third day. “But your eyes lag behind your body.”

“What does that mean?” Jesse asked, panting, sweat soaking through his shirt.

“It means your body’s acting, but your head’s still thinking. That gets people killed.”

Jesse didn’t respond. He just reset the rifle and ran the drill again.

When the first dialogue scene finally came, it hit like a storm. They were filming inside a gutted post office—broken windows, scattered mail still drifting through the rafters like ghosts. Wren was already in position, hair damp from the artificial rain, costume torn and bloodied. Jesse took his mark and nodded at her. She nodded back, tight-lipped.

The camera rolled.

“You left me,” she said, her voice flat but trembling.

“There was no choice.”

“There’s always a choice.”

He stepped closer, boots crunching on broken glass. “You think I wanted to survive that? You think I didn’t want to die with the rest of them?”

Her face changed then. A flicker of something raw passed through it, something that didn’t feel rehearsed.

“Then why didn’t you?” she asked.

And he couldn’t answer. Not in the scene. Not in real life.

“Cut,” the director called, but no one moved. The air between them still thrummed like a struck chord.

Jesse stepped back, exhaled. Wren didn’t look at him.

The next few weeks passed in a blur of scenes and reshoots. Each day peeled something off of him. The script demanded not just emotion but exposure—long takes that lingered on his face, monologues delivered while caked in blood and dust, moments of silence where his eyes were expected to say everything. He couldn’t coast. Not here. Not in this.

Wren remained a mystery. Off-camera, she was cordial but distant. They never rehearsed together unless asked. She stayed in her own trailer, took her meals alone or with Marcus, the director. Rumors circulated, as they always did—some said she was difficult, others said she was brilliant and only tolerated fools when paid to. Jesse didn’t ask. He didn’t want to know the version of her that existed outside of the story. It was easier this way.

One night, after a particularly grueling shoot involving a flashback scene where Kade carried a dying child through a field of wreckage, Jesse found himself wandering the set long after everyone else had cleared out. The fake town lay in eerie silence, lit only by the spill of a few safety lights and the moon’s pale glare.

He sat on the steps of the fake church, still in costume, streaks of fake blood dried against his arms. The wind blew paper across the ground, a staged apocalypse still pretending even in rest. He closed his eyes and tried to breathe.

“You stay in character too long, you’ll forget how to be yourself,” came a voice behind him.

He opened his eyes. Wren stood there, wrapped in a heavy coat, cigarette between her fingers.

“I wasn’t in character,” he said.

“That’s worse.”

She sat beside him without asking. For a while, they didn’t speak.

“You were good today,” she said eventually.

“You say that like it’s rare.”

She smiled, barely. “I say it like it cost you something.”

“It did.”

“You think it’s worth it?”

He thought about that. Thought about his mother’s voice, about the nights in LA where he went to bed hungry, about the fear that had lived in his chest since the day he realized how easily the world could forget him.

“I don’t know,” he admitted. “Ask me when it’s over.”

She didn’t reply. Just flicked ash into the wind.

The next day, they shot a sequence in the burned-out shell of an office tower. Jesse spent most of it ducking through debris, running take after take with a rifle that left bruises along his collarbone. At one point, Marcus pulled him aside.

“Less posture. More desperation,” he said. “You’re not a hero. You’re a man trying not to fall apart.”

Jesse nodded and went back into the smoke.

By the end of the month, word started to spread. Crew members whispered about the dailies, about how the studio executives were watching rough cuts and nodding. Jesse caught a glimpse of one of the editors walking through set one day, muttering to a production assistant, “We’ve got something. It’s dark, but it’s real.”

That night, Sherri called.

“They’re already talking press schedules,” she said. “It’s early, but they’re thinking Emmy campaign. You’re trending on IMDb. Did you know that?”

He hadn’t.

“Don’t let it go to your head,” she added. “But don’t shrink from it either. This kind of thing doesn’t happen by accident.”

He didn’t sleep well that night. Dreams blurred with scenes. He woke with the taste of smoke in his throat, even though the pyrotechnics had been days ago. He began carrying a notebook, jotting down things his character might say, things he was afraid he himself might believe. Lines blurred. The performance no longer felt like a mask—it felt like skin, and he wasn’t entirely sure he remembered how to take it off.

One morning, between takes, he looked at Wren across the set. She was laughing at something the sound guy said, her face open and unguarded in a way he hadn’t seen before. For a second, she looked young—too young to be carrying so many ghosts. Then she turned, saw him watching, and the expression shuttered.

Later, in their scene, she said a line that wasn’t in the script.

“I think we broke something we don’t know how to fix.”

Jesse didn’t miss a beat. “Then let it stay broken.”

After the director called cut, neither of them said anything.

The scene stayed in the final version of the episode. No one ever mentioned the deviation. Sometimes, the best lines weren’t written—they were revealed.

Chapter Three: The First Cut

The rain in Vancouver arrived like it had something to prove. By late November, it became a presence more than a weather condition, soaking the streets, warping plywood facades on set, creeping into the seams of everything. The production carried on regardless, swathed in plastic tarps and waterproof cables, actors wrapped in emergency ponchos between takes. Jesse had stopped checking forecasts. It didn’t matter anymore. Wet was the new normal.

He was in the ADR booth when he saw his face on screen for the first time.

It was a rough cut of Episode 2—still missing most of the sound design, the color grading half-finished—but the footage was real, projected larger than life in the darkened soundstage. Jesse watched himself stumble through a war-ravaged street, blood streaking his temple, mouth set in a kind of despair that looked eerily honest. The sound engineer paused the playback to mark a line, and the screen froze on his face.

“Do I always look that angry?” Jesse asked, leaning back in the chair.

Marcus Hollin, the director, looked up from a notebook. “Not angry. Haunted. People will project what they want.”

Jesse stared at the screen a moment longer. “What do you want them to see?”

Marcus didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he closed the notebook and gestured toward the frozen frame. “I want them to see a man trying not to be swallowed. You don’t have to act that, Jesse. You just have to let them watch you drown.”

It should have sounded dramatic, maybe even absurd. But Jesse nodded. It made a kind of grim sense.

The ADR session continued for another hour. He re-recorded three lines, mimicking the inflection of dialogue spoken months earlier while dodging squibs and falling set pieces. Afterward, he stepped outside for air, the rain waiting for him like a patient curse. He didn’t bother pulling up his hood. The water was cold and bracing, the kind that shocked you into the present.

Back in his apartment, the walls felt tighter. The script pages strewn across his dining table curled slightly from the damp air, the corners lifting like paper breathing. Jesse stared at them, wondering what would happen once it was all finished. Once the scenes were no longer his to perform but had become something else—permanent, static, commodified.

He hadn’t been sleeping well. The lines between himself and Kade Rilke had thinned to a membrane. At night, he dreamed of explosions and half-spoken apologies. Sometimes, he woke with his jaw clenched so tight his molars ached. He didn’t tell anyone. Wren might have understood, but she kept to herself more than ever. Even the rare moments they shared on set felt choreographed now, like they were mimicking a closeness that had once been accidental and pure.

It was during a break on a cold Thursday that he saw her crying.

She was behind one of the trailers, crouched against the wall, shoulders hunched, face buried in her hands. Jesse didn’t mean to find her—it had been an accident, an aimless wander after a scene left him feeling disassembled. He froze when he saw her, unsure whether to step forward or vanish. But then she looked up. Her mascara had smeared, but she didn’t try to hide her face.

“I’m not fragile,” she said without preamble.

“I didn’t say you were.”

She wiped at her cheeks. “They’ll cut that scene.”

“What scene?”

“The one from yesterday. The church.”

He felt something twist in his chest. “Why?”

“They said it’s too still. That it ‘drags the narrative.’” She laughed once, sharp and bitter. “You pour your heart into something, and they chop it because the plot needs momentum.”

Jesse sat down beside her, the gravel cold through his jeans.

“We can’t control what survives,” he said quietly.

“I know.” She stared at the sky. “Doesn’t mean it hurts less.”

After a beat, she turned to him.

“You still have nightmares?” she asked.

“Every night.”

She nodded like she’d expected the answer.

When they got the dailies from Episode 5, Jesse watched them with the rest of the principal cast in a small makeshift screening room. The lights were low, the coffee burned, the seats uncomfortable. But when the credits rolled, no one moved. The episode was devastating—a slow descent through betrayal, the fracture of trust between Kade and Rhea complete by the final scene.

When Jesse’s final line landed—“Then don’t wait for me to come back”—the silence in the room was total. Even the production assistant who usually checked her phone throughout looked stunned.

Afterward, Marcus stood and stretched.

“That,” he said, “is the one.”

He meant awards. He meant articles, nominations, panels. Jesse didn’t care about any of that. All he could think about was how hollow his own voice had sounded in that last scene—like a man already gone, speaking from the edge of something cold and final.

The studio began pushing harder. The marketing department emailed mockups of posters. Jesse’s face, half in shadow, the tagline reading: Hope is a casualty of war. His publicist reached out with talking points for interviews, articles to skim, facts to memorize about the fictional world of Sins of Empire. He was told to avoid politics, mention how "proud he was to work with such a visionary team," and to always pivot back to “the human story.”

He nodded through every meeting, but the words blurred. It was all noise.

The premiere date was set: February 18th. There would be a press junket in New York, a magazine spread in GQ, possibly a slot on Late Night with Fallon. Sherri was ecstatic.

“They’re positioning you as the new face of modern drama,” she said, her voice tight with excitement. “You’re going to be everywhere, Jesse.”

He didn’t say what he was thinking: that being everywhere meant losing the last pieces of who he was when no one was watching.

In mid-December, they wrapped filming.

The final scene—a quiet one, just Jesse alone in the woods, burying something unseen—was shot in a single take. No music. No dialogue. Just the sound of shovel against dirt and the slow rise of breath against frost. When Marcus called “cut,” no one clapped. The crew stood silently, a kind of reverence settling over the space.

Wren approached him afterward. They were still in costume, her coat slung over one shoulder, his hands muddy and raw.

“It’s over,” she said.

“Feels like it never happened.”

“It did. We’ll just forget it happened this way.”

He looked at her then, really looked. There was a softness to her now, something unguarded.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

She didn’t answer. Just reached out, touched his face with the backs of her fingers.

“Tell the truth in your interviews,” she said. “Even when they don’t want to hear it.”

Then she turned and walked away, her silhouette disappearing into the pale gray trees.

Jesse stood alone, hands still stained with dirt, the cold finally seeping into his skin.

Something had ended. And something else—something bigger, less certain—had just begun.

The wrap party was held in a converted warehouse just outside the city, all exposed brick and hanging Edison bulbs, as if the production team wanted to simulate something rustic and warm despite the industrial chill of the place. There were high tables filled with catered food, bartenders wearing black aprons and blank expressions, a playlist rotating between indie pop and moody synth ballads. Jesse arrived late and lingered by the door longer than necessary, his coat still damp from the freezing rain. Inside, the cast and crew mingled in bursts of laughter, flurries of recognition and nostalgia already beginning to settle in.

He moved through the room quietly, nodding to grips and gaffers, exchanging brief hugs with extras he barely remembered, taking a drink from a passing tray out of reflex. He didn’t know how to feel. He wanted to celebrate. He also wanted to be alone. The experience of filming had occupied his every hour, every breath, for months. Now that it was over, a weight had lifted, but in its place came an unfamiliar lightness, the kind that made him feel like he might float away if he stopped concentrating.

He found Callum near the back, standing by a pool table with two other members of the stunt team. The man gave him a subtle nod.

“You survive?” Callum asked.

“Barely,” Jesse said. “You?”

“I don’t bleed on camera, so it’s easier.”

They shared a brief grin before falling into a companionable silence. Jesse sipped from his glass—something amber and bitter—and watched the others. He spotted Wren across the room, talking to Marcus, her laughter big and sudden, catching a few heads in its wake. She looked different tonight, as though she'd shrugged off the weight of her character and stepped fully into her own frame again. Her posture was looser, her smile freer. But when her eyes swept the room and met his, something shifted. She excused herself from Marcus and made her way over.

“You came,” she said, stopping beside him.

“I thought it was mandatory.”

“It’s not. But you’d regret skipping it.”

“Would I?”

She looked at him a moment. “Maybe not.”

They stood together at the edge of the crowd, the music swelling slightly, the room pulsing with end-of-project adrenaline. Around them, people were already talking about what came next—new pilots, other films, the possibility of a season two, despite the series being labeled as limited. Jesse wondered if anyone really believed endings were permanent in this industry. Nothing ended. Not really. It just got rebranded.

“You going back to LA tomorrow?” Wren asked.

“Day after. Want to see the city once more without a call sheet.”

“Don’t expect it to look the same.”

He gave her a sideways glance. “You?”

“I’m going to Iceland for a while. No phones, no press, no fake scripts.”

“Retreating.”

“Healing,” she said. “There’s a difference.”

He let that hang in the air. Then: “Did you mean what you said? About telling the truth in interviews?”

She nodded. “It doesn’t always make you likable. But it makes you real.”

“I don’t know if I’m ready for real.”

“No one is. That’s why it works.”

A photographer wandered over, asked for a picture of the two of them. They stood side by side, neither touching, both staring into the lens like people trying to leave something behind. The flash went off, moment frozen, already destined for someone’s Instagram story.

Later, as the party thinned and people filtered out into the wet streets, Jesse found himself back at his apartment, buzzed but not drunk, more restless than tired. He sat at the table and stared at the script pile, now covered in spilled wax from a candle he hadn’t lit in weeks. He touched the edges of the topmost page, already beginning to yellow from exposure.

He should’ve felt accomplished. Instead, he felt… unfinished.

The next morning, he got a call from Theo Lasker, the showrunner.

“I know we said limited series,” Theo began, no greeting, just his usual burst of frenetic energy. “But Netflix loves it. Test audiences are screaming. And the execs see potential for at least one more season. Possibly two.”

Jesse rubbed the bridge of his nose. “You want Kade back.”

Theo didn’t hesitate. “Only if it’s you. There’s no show without you. They’ll pay. They’ll let us take the story somewhere darker.”

Jesse didn’t respond right away.

Theo sighed. “Look, I know what this took out of you. I do. But this is rare, Jesse. What you did onscreen… it stuck. People feel it. This isn’t just a job anymore. It’s a voice.”

“I’ll think about it,” Jesse said, though a part of him already knew that he would say yes.

That night, he opened his laptop and started typing. Not a script. Not even a journal. Just fragments—memories, lines that hadn’t made it into the final episodes, pieces of dialogue he wished Kade had said. He wasn’t sure what it would become. A book? A screenplay? A way to process the ghosts the show had left behind?

The cursor blinked on the white screen like a pulse.

"He was never a hero," Jesse wrote. "He was just the last one willing to stand still while the world burned."

He stopped, stared at the line. It didn’t feel like acting anymore. It felt like confession.

He shut the laptop, leaned back, and listened to the wind scraping against the windowpane. Vancouver had gone quiet. The crew had gone home. The character was gone, too. But Jesse remained—changed, unmoored, alive.

A notification buzzed on his phone. An email: Subject: FINAL POSTER APPROVED. Attached was an image of him, staring dead ahead, gun slung over one shoulder, ash in the air behind him. His name—JESSE LORNE—hovered above the title like a crown.

He turned off the screen.

Outside, the rain began again, softer this time.

Chapter Four: Exposure

Los Angeles had changed in his absence. Or maybe Jesse had. The bougainvillea still crawled over the stucco walls of West Hollywood houses, the billboards still rotated faces too pretty to last, the traffic still pulsed like a clogged artery. But he noticed things differently now. Noticed the way waiters at brunch restaurants looked at him longer, the way strangers glanced twice when he walked down Melrose without sunglasses. Fame wasn’t a thunderclap. It was a slow-dripping leak that soaked everything before you even knew the roof had cracked.

Sins of Empire premiered to staggering numbers. Within a week, it had climbed into the top three shows on Netflix’s global chart. It held there. The critics poured in next, many comparing Jesse’s performance to early De Niro or post-Breaking Bad Cranston. The New York Times ran a long-form review that called the show “visceral, aching, and inescapably timely.” They mentioned Jesse by name six times.

He read every word. Then he read them again, quietly, like he was touching something holy.

Sherri kept his calendar filled. He bounced between press events, podcast interviews, roundtables, and red carpets. Each appearance was choreographed, styled, lit, and edited. They flew him to New York, then London. At Heathrow, he passed a kiosk selling magazines and saw his own face twice—one cover full of shadows, the other cropped tight on his eyes, the headline declaring: “Jesse Lorne: Hollywood’s Most Honest Man.”

He laughed, bitterly. It had taken years of pretending to be someone else to be called authentic.

The interviews began to bleed together. Everyone asked the same questions with different phrasing: “What drew you to the character?” “How did you prepare for the emotional depth of Kade?” “Was there a particular scene that stayed with you after filming?” He gave answers that were true but incomplete. He talked about trauma in general terms, loss in abstract language. When one journalist asked if he’d based the character on someone in his life, he replied: “Yes, but they’re not alive anymore.”

It wasn’t a lie. But it wasn’t what they thought either.

They ate it up. The myth of the actor who suffered for his art. The wounded leading man. It played well.

He ran into Wren at a panel for Deadline, one of those industry Q&A events at a Beverly Hills hotel, with uncomfortable chairs and bottled water that tasted like money. She wore a slate-gray pantsuit and minimal makeup, her expression composed, elegant. They hadn’t spoken since Vancouver.

Backstage, she greeted him with a faint smile. “Still breathing?”

“Some days,” he said. “You?”

“Iceland was quiet. Too quiet. I started talking to rocks.”

“I thought that was just called ‘acting.’”

She laughed, and for a moment the distance between them evaporated.

Onstage, they were seated next to each other. The moderator asked about chemistry, about the intensity of the shoot, about the possibility of a second season. Wren sidestepped questions with the finesse of a diplomat. Jesse tried to follow suit, but when they asked what the hardest day on set had been, he surprised even himself.

“It was the scene in episode six,” he said slowly, choosing his words. “Where Kade breaks down outside the bunker. We shot it at three in the morning. I’d been up for eighteen hours. The crew was exhausted. Wren… she looked at me and didn’t say a word, but I knew what to do. That kind of silence—that kind of trust—is rare.”

Wren turned to him, something unreadable in her eyes. The moderator moved on.

Afterward, they found themselves alone near the loading dock, the sound of generators humming in the background.

“I thought you weren’t going to talk about that night,” Wren said.

“Why not? It was the truth.”

“Sometimes the truth isn’t what they’re looking for.”

“They can have the performance,” he said. “But the truth’s mine.”

She lit a cigarette. “Careful with that thinking. It’ll make you lonely.”

“I’ve been lonely longer than I’ve been famous.”

They didn’t touch, didn’t embrace, but the silence between them felt warmer now. As though they were standing on the other side of something and finally had language for what it cost.

That weekend, the Emmy buzz started.

Sherri called breathless. “You’re on all the lists. You and Wren both. Supporting cast too. Even Marcus. If this holds, you’ll be nominated. Maybe win.”

Jesse didn’t know how to respond. He thanked her, then hung up and sat at his kitchen table, staring at a half-empty cup of tea that had gone cold hours ago.

Fame, he realized, was not satisfying. It didn’t come with closure. It was just another layer of the costume, stitched tighter each day.

He started having trouble sleeping again. Not nightmares this time, just the hollow insomnia of overstimulation. He lay in bed, scrolling through headlines about himself, watching reaction videos, checking Twitter tags. At first, it was intoxicating. Then it was nauseating. Everyone had an opinion. Some of them adored him. Others called him overrated. Some accused him of being too political. Others said he was too vague. There were theories about his sexuality, his childhood, his drinking habits.

One article claimed he was dating Wren. Another claimed they hadn’t spoken in months. Both were wrong.

He found himself reading Reddit threads about the show, deep dives into Kade’s motivations, essays about masculinity, about grief, about whether his character was redeemable. Some posts were thoughtful. Others were cruel. One commenter wrote: “I think Jesse Lorne is playing himself. That’s why it hurts to watch.”

He closed the laptop.

That night, he walked for hours through his neighborhood, hood up, headphones in, music loud. He passed bars he used to work at, cafés that had once served as makeshift offices while he ran lines. He passed a casting office and saw a familiar face leaning against the brick wall—Eli, an actor he’d auditioned with three years ago, back when they both still wore nervous smiles and borrowed shoes.

Eli didn’t notice him. Jesse kept walking.

He stopped by a small bar near Silver Lake, one of those places with no sign and a single red light above the door. Inside, it smelled like wood and cheap bourbon. He sat at the far end of
