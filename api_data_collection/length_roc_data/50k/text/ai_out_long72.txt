Chapter One: The Summer That Seemed to Last Forever

The summer that seemed to last forever began on a Tuesday. That was the day the cicadas sang louder than ever, the heat shimmered off the asphalt like something alive, and the days started to blur at their edges. It was the kind of summer that felt like a myth even as it was happening — one that made you forget what school felt like, or what came after. Time stretched long and slow in the town of Linton’s Edge, wrapped in a haze of honeysuckle and smoke from distant grills. People left their windows open at night and trusted the dark not to come too close.

Sixteen-year-old Eli Whitaker didn’t know it then, but that was the last ordinary day he’d ever live.

He was riding his bike past the old railroad yard when he saw her.

A girl in a blue dress, standing alone near the rusted water tower. Her dress flapped in the hot wind and her hair was a deep, strange red that reminded him of sunset bleeding through clouds. She wasn’t from Linton’s Edge — he knew that instantly. Eli knew everyone in that town. The church kids, the trailer park toughs, the rich ones whose parents played golf at the country club and wore linen even when it didn’t make sense.

She didn’t belong to any of them.

Her eyes tracked him as he slowed his bike, curiosity gnawing at his gut. She was barefoot, standing in the scorched grass like it didn’t bother her, arms folded across her chest.

“Hi,” he called out, sweat making his shirt stick to his back. “You okay?”

The girl tilted her head. “Are you Eli?”

He blinked. “Yeah… how do you know that?”

She didn’t answer. Just turned and walked into the trees behind the tower, vanishing into the green shadow like it had swallowed her.

Eli didn’t sleep well that night. He kept seeing the girl’s face in the dark — her calm expression, the way she’d known his name. He didn’t tell anyone about her. Not his mom, who worked night shifts at the clinic and slept through the day in their tiny apartment above the bakery. Not his best friend Miles, who would’ve laughed and said Eli was going all Twin Peaks again. And definitely not Delaney, who would’ve stared at him like he’d started quoting witchcraft.

Instead, he went back.

The next morning he rode out early, even before the sun had burned the dew off the grass. The railroad yard was empty. No girl, no signs anyone had been there. But carved into the metal door of the water tower — fresh and deep — were three letters:

A.M.E.

He traced them with his finger. The edges were rough, like they’d been made with something sharp. A knife, maybe.

“Ame,” he whispered.

“No,” said a voice behind him. “A. M. E. Three different things.”

He spun. She was standing there again — same blue dress, same bare feet, this time holding a folded paper in her hand.

“You came back,” he said.

“You were supposed to.” She handed him the paper. “This is for you.”

He unfolded it slowly. It was a hand-drawn map. Not to anywhere he recognized — just a sprawl of lines and strange symbols. In the center was a circle with a dot inside it.

“What’s this?”

“A way out,” she said. “Or a way in. Depends on how you see it.”

He looked up. “What’s your name?”

She gave him the tiniest smile. “Call me Marrow.”

Linton’s Edge had secrets. Eli had always suspected that. There were things people didn’t talk about — like the old mining tunnels under the hills, or the time the river had turned black for a whole week in ‘82. His grandpa had told stories before he died. About things buried deep and watching. About doors in the woods that didn’t lead anywhere good.

Eli never believed him. Not really.

But now he had a map. And a girl named Marrow who talked like riddles and wrote his name in the air with her finger when she thought he wasn’t looking.

“Why me?” he asked her one afternoon, sitting beside her near the dried-up creek that everyone just called Dead Hollow. “Why now?”

She didn’t answer right away. Just picked up a pebble and threw it, hard, so it bounced off a dead tree trunk.

“Because you’re already halfway there,” she said.

“Halfway to what?”

“To remembering.”

Things started to get strange.

Not in big ways — not yet. But odd little glitches in the edges of the world.

Birds froze midair for a second too long. His mom spoke in her sleep, in a language Eli couldn’t understand. A photo of his dad — who’d died when Eli was three — suddenly showed a man with a different face.

And every time he turned away from the map, the lines rearranged themselves. He tested it. Took pictures. The pictures changed, too.

Miles noticed something was off.

“Dude, you’ve been spacing out hard lately,” he said, tossing a tennis ball against the side of Eli’s apartment. “Like, I called your name five times yesterday before you even blinked. And what’s with the whole ‘exploring the woods like it’s Narnia’ thing?”

Eli wanted to tell him. Really did. But the words caught in his throat like fishhooks.

Marrow had warned him: “Some truths don’t like being said out loud. They fight back.”

Instead, he lied. “Just clearing my head.”

“Well, clear it faster,” Miles said. “Delaney’s throwing that lake party Saturday. Everyone’s going.”

“I’ll think about it.”

He did go.

Mostly because he hoped Marrow would show up. She didn’t.

Instead, Delaney cornered him by the firepit, beer in one hand, the smell of watermelon vape on her breath.

“You’re acting weird,” she said.

“Thanks.”

“No, I mean — like haunted or something. Did someone die?”

“No.”

“Then why do you look like you’ve seen a ghost every time I look at you?”

Eli didn’t answer. Behind Delaney, in the shadows beyond the party, someone was watching.

Marrow.

She raised a hand, not to wave — but to point. Toward the trees. Toward something Eli couldn’t see yet.

And when he blinked, she was gone.

Later that night, he followed the map.

It led him down an old trail behind the cemetery, into the forgotten stretch of woods locals called Old Ash. His phone stopped working halfway there. The stars above flickered like candlelight. And the trees — they moved. Just slightly. Like they were breathing.

The center of the map was real. A circle of stones, half-sunken in the earth. Something was buried in the middle — something round, metal, rusted. A hatch.

He touched it, and pain lanced up his arm like he’d grabbed a live wire.

Then the hatch opened.

Not up. Not down.

It opened outward, like a mouth, and something whispered his name in a voice made of leaves and teeth.

Eli.

Eli.

Remember.

He fell forward into blackness.

When he woke, the world had changed.

Linton’s Edge was the same — but not. People looked at him like they’d never met him. His mom didn’t recognize him. The bakery above which he lived was boarded up. Miles wasn’t in school — no one had heard of him. Delaney’s house was empty, the yard overgrown by ten years of wildness.

And on every wall downtown, in spray paint that dripped red like blood:

A.M.E. IS COMING

Eli wandered through the new-old version of Linton’s Edge with a growing sense of vertigo. Every building was a copy of itself, twisted just slightly — the windows were narrower, the paint colors subtly wrong, the sky a shade dimmer even at noon. It was like walking through a dream someone else had built using his memories. The worst part was that no one knew who he was. The woman at the diner who used to give him free pie slices on Thursdays stared right through him. Principal Marsh, who’d once threatened to expel him for putting glue in the teacher’s lounge coffee pot, asked if he was lost and needed directions. The town hadn’t just forgotten him. It had erased him.

He sat for hours on the steps of what used to be his apartment, the wooden sign for McKinley’s Bakery above him cracked down the center. Dust covered the windows, and ivy crept between the bricks. He didn’t try to open the door. He already knew what he’d find — nothing, or worse, something pretending to be his life. He held the map in his hand and stared at the now-familiar lines. They hadn’t changed this time. The circle at the center remained still, and he wondered if it meant he had arrived… or if this was just another layer, another loop to fall through.

The only place that looked unchanged was the railroad yard. The same iron skeletons of boxcars rusting into the soil, the same tower with the carved letters: A.M.E. But now the letters were glowing faintly in the dusk, pulsing with a sickly reddish light that seemed to burn behind his eyes. He stepped toward them instinctively, heart hammering in his chest. The closer he got, the louder the sound grew — not cicadas anymore, but something deeper, like machines grinding stone into powder beneath the earth.

Marrow was waiting.

She stood beside the tower, no longer barefoot, now wearing black boots that laced to her knees. Her hair had grown longer in just the span of days — or had it been longer all along? She looked at him like someone expecting a soldier back from war.

“You made it through,” she said softly.

Eli took a shaky breath. “What is this place?”

“The same town. Another version. One of many.”

“And the people — why don’t they remember me?”

“Because you’re not you here,” she said. “Not yet.”

He flinched. “That doesn’t make any sense.”

Marrow stepped closer and took the map from his hand. She folded it once, then twice, and then again, until it was small enough to tuck behind her ear like a cigarette. “Sense is overrated. Especially here.”

“But… my mom. Miles. They’re gone. Everything’s gone.”

“They’re not gone,” she said. “They’re out of phase. You slipped. Like a gear skipping teeth. The things you remember are real, but they’re part of a different configuration.”

He stared at her. “I don’t understand anything you’re saying.”

“You will. You have to.”

Marrow looked up at the tower, where the letters flared once and then dimmed. “A.M.E. — it’s not just a name. It’s a trigger. A sequence. You activated it.”

“Why me?”

“Because the town chose you. Or maybe you chose the town. Doesn’t really matter anymore. The point is, you’ve started something.”

Eli sat on the dirt, arms around his knees. “This feels like a punishment.”

She crouched beside him. “It’s a door.”

“To what?”

“To the truth. About the town. About yourself. About what’s coming.”

He was quiet for a long time. A train horn echoed in the distance, but the tracks had been dead for years. Or had they? He couldn’t trust what he remembered anymore.

Finally, he asked, “What does A.M.E. stand for?”

Marrow looked at him, and for the first time since he met her, she looked afraid.

“Apocryphal. Memory. Engine,” she said. “It’s alive. And it’s waking up.”

That night, Eli dreamt of tunnels.

He was deep underground, crawling through narrow passages where the walls pulsed like veins. Every time he turned, the tunnel shifted — stone became metal, metal became bone. He could hear someone calling his name, but it wasn’t his mother or Miles. It was his own voice, from somewhere deeper.

He came to a chamber at last, a vast space filled with floating objects: keys, shoes, pencils, pieces of broken glass. They rotated slowly around a central pillar, and the pillar was made of mirrors. But none of them reflected him. In each, he saw another boy — older, younger, taller, burned, blind, scarred — and each one stared at him without blinking.

He woke up gasping, drenched in sweat, the bedsheets coiled around his legs like vines.

Except… there were no bedsheets. No bed.

He was lying on the floor of the water tower, and outside, the sky was the color of bruised ash.

Over the next few days — if they were days — he followed Marrow through what she called the “cracks.” Places in Linton’s Edge where reality was thinner, the rules less strict. The roof of the old library, where the stars were always different. A rusted swing set behind the elementary school that made whoever sat on it forget who they were for exactly seven minutes. The convenience store freezer aisle, where every carton of milk had a missing person’s photo, and every photo was of Eli.

“You’re being edited,” Marrow said. “Every time you remember something, the Engine tries to erase it. That’s its job. To smooth things over. To keep the simulation clean.”

“This isn’t a simulation,” Eli said. “This is real.”

Marrow gave him a long, tired look. “Real is just the version you’re used to.”

They climbed a fire escape behind the shuttered movie theater and looked out across the town. From here, Eli could see the pattern: buildings aligned in strange geometry, streets bending at angles that shouldn’t exist. The town had a symmetry that made his head hurt. Marrow traced her finger through the air and drew a symbol — three lines and a circle — and it glowed before fading.

“This town is a key,” she said. “And we’re inside the lock.”

He looked at her. “Then what happens when it turns?”

She didn’t answer.

It was Miles who found him.

Not the Miles from before — but something that looked like him. His smile was wrong, too wide. His eyes blinked at different speeds.

“Eli,” he said. “You’ve been gone a long time, man.”

Eli backed away. “You’re not him.”

“I am,” the not-Miles said, stepping closer. “I’m just… post-render.”

Marrow stood between them suddenly, a knife in her hand made of silver and bone. “Stay back.”

Not-Miles tilted his head. “You can’t protect him from us. He belongs to the town now. You both do.”

He opened his mouth wider than a jaw should allow — and inside, Eli saw gears turning. Teeth made of clock hands.

Then the sky tore open.

A rip, clean across the horizon, revealing something beneath the clouds that pulsed with a thousand lights and none of them were colors he recognized. The ground shook, and from the tear came a sound like every voice he’d ever heard, speaking at once:

AWAKENING PROTOCOL CONFIRMED

Marrow grabbed Eli’s wrist and ran.

As they sprinted through the empty streets, the town began to change again — buildings folding in on themselves, streets becoming rivers of static. Trees grew sideways, birds exploded into sparks.

Eli shouted over the roar, “What do we do?”

Marrow didn’t look back. “We find the core.”

“Where is it?”

She turned her head, her eyes blazing.

“Under the school.”

Chapter Two: The Core Beneath

Eli had never liked Linton’s Edge High. It smelled of floor polish and mildew, and the lockers always seemed slightly damp no matter how dry the air outside was. But as he and Marrow stood at the edge of the school’s cracked parking lot, staring at the building that had become a kaleidoscope of shifting angles and flickering windows, he felt something much deeper than dislike. It was fear. Not the kind of fear that made you scream or run. This was the kind that wrapped around your spine and whispered that nothing would ever be normal again.

The school loomed in the dusk-light like a broken cathedral. Its bricks pulsed faintly, red and amber, like coals buried under skin. The American flag at the front had been replaced with a long strip of black fabric, symbols stitched into it that changed every time Eli tried to read them. The wind didn’t blow anymore. It moved around them like breath — slow, aware, thick with meaning.

Marrow didn’t hesitate. She walked straight toward the front doors, her boots crunching over glass and broken tiles. Eli followed, gripping the flashlight she’d handed him earlier even though it barely cut through the fog that had begun to rise from the ground. Every instinct in him screamed to turn back. But something deeper — a pull, like gravity in his blood — urged him on.

Inside, the school had been hollowed out. The halls were longer than they should be, and the walls stretched into impossible arches. Doors opened onto rooms filled with sand, or with water, or with nothing at all. At one point, they stepped through a classroom and emerged in what looked like the interior of a church — pews lined with mannequins dressed in old prom clothes, each one staring blankly at the chalkboard where someone had scrawled:

The Core Remembers. Do You?

Marrow led them through a series of passages behind the gymnasium, down a staircase Eli had never seen before. It descended much farther than the school should’ve allowed — past the basement, past what felt like bedrock itself. The walls turned from painted cinderblock to smooth obsidian, etched with spirals and glyphs that hurt to look at directly.

They stopped before a large iron door with no handle. Marrow pressed her palm to the surface, and the metal rippled under her touch like water. The door split open with a slow hiss, revealing a chamber beyond lit by a cold, white light.

The Core.

It wasn’t what Eli expected. There were no machines, no spinning reactors. Instead, the chamber was filled with roots — black, glistening, coiling through the walls like veins. At the center of it all stood a monolith, smooth and mirror-like, rising from the floor with no visible base. The surface shimmered, and within it, images flickered: faces, places, memories. Eli saw himself, as a child, hiding under the kitchen table during a thunderstorm. He saw his mother weeping at a stove. He saw Miles, real Miles, holding a dead bird in his hands, whispering something Eli couldn’t hear.

“It’s not just a machine,” Marrow said, her voice low. “It’s alive. And it’s been feeding.”

“Feeding on what?”

“Us. Our stories. Our changes. Every version of every person who’s ever lived in Linton’s Edge — it keeps them all. It watches. It remembers.”

Eli stepped closer, unable to stop himself. The monolith reacted, the images growing clearer. Now he saw other versions of himself — one in a hospital gown, eyes empty; one covered in burns, curled in a corner; another standing in front of a city skyline that didn’t exist.

“What does it want?”

“To survive,” Marrow said. “And to be believed.”

He turned to her. “Why show me this now?”

“Because you’re the breach. The moment you touched the hatch, you became part of the cycle. The Core sees you as unstable — unpredictable. You’re the only variable it can’t smooth over.”

Eli looked at the flickering images. They were speeding up now — dozens of versions of him flashing past in a blur, each one more distorted than the last. Then suddenly, they stopped. The monolith showed a single image: Eli standing in this very room, bleeding from his eyes, mouth open in a silent scream.

He staggered back.

“That’s the future?” he asked.

“One of them,” Marrow replied. “The Core doesn’t show you what will be. It shows you what might be, if nothing changes.”

“So how do I stop it?”

Marrow reached into her coat and pulled out a small object — a shard of mirror, jagged at the edges. It pulsed faintly with the same light as the monolith.

“You go deeper. Past this room. Past the tunnels beneath it. You go into the heart of the Engine and you break the pattern. Only you can.”

Eli took the shard. It was warm to the touch, and as he held it, a line of blood trickled from his nose.

“What’s down there?”

“Everything the town has hidden from itself. The First Memory. The Prime Version. The original lie.”

Before he could respond, the room began to shake. The roots convulsed, recoiling from the walls. The light in the monolith flared.

“It’s waking up fully,” Marrow said, grabbing his arm. “We need to go now.”

They ran through a passage behind the chamber, a narrow corridor that sloped downward. The further they went, the more the world distorted — colors reversed, gravity shifted sideways, time felt elastic. At one point, Eli stumbled and fell upward, floating for a few seconds before Marrow dragged him back down.

Eventually, they reached a massive gate, etched with thousands of names. Eli recognized some — teachers, neighbors, even Delaney. But others were strangers. Above the gate, in jagged script, were three words:

THE FIRST LOOP

Marrow placed both hands against the gate. “This is the point of no return. Once we go through, the Engine won’t let us back.”

Eli swallowed hard. “And if we don’t go through?”

“Then this version of the town collapses, and every version dies with it.”

She pushed the gate, and it swung open with a sound like thunder cracking inside a cave.

Beyond was darkness.

Not the kind that felt empty — but the kind that watched.

As they stepped into it, the world behind them folded shut.

The darkness beyond the gate wasn’t just absence of light — it had density, weight, texture. It pressed in on Eli from all sides, thick and hot like tar. It felt as though it was peeling something off him, layer by layer, stripping memories from his skin like old paint. His name began to feel foreign in his own mind, and for a terrifying moment, he couldn’t remember Marrow’s face even though she was holding his hand. She seemed to notice, because she squeezed tighter and whispered something — not in English, not in any language Eli recognized — but the sound of it re-anchored him.

The path ahead unfolded slowly. It wasn’t made of stone or earth, but of flickering memories stitched together like film frames. Every step brought up an echo — an argument from his childhood, a scent from the bakery, a forgotten birthday. The walls were made of static and whispers. Some of the whispers spoke his name, others called him things he didn’t yet understand. “Remnant.” “Threadbearer.” “Unspooled.”

They walked for what could’ve been hours or days. Time stretched and warped in the depths of the Core. At one point they passed through a field of floating desks, each one occupied by a sleeping child — hundreds of them, drifting through darkness, their dreams leaking out like mist. Eli reached toward one and saw it — a version of himself, perhaps ten years old, clutching a math workbook with a bite taken out of the cover.

“Don’t touch,” Marrow warned softly. “They’re anchors. Interacting with them wakes the Loop.”

Eli lowered his hand. “What are they dreaming about?”

“The same day. Over and over.”

Eventually the passage narrowed, and they came to a platform suspended in a void. At the center of the platform was a pedestal, and on it rested an orb — cracked, pulsing weakly, wrapped in thin tendrils of light. As they approached, the whispers crescendoed into something intelligible: voices in unison, repeating a phrase again and again.

“Linton’s Edge is safe. Linton’s Edge is stable. Linton’s Edge is sacred.”

Eli flinched. “Is that… a mantra?”

“It’s the town’s programming,” Marrow said. “This orb — it’s the First Memory. The founding lie. The illusion everything else was built around.”

“What happens if we break it?”

Marrow looked him in the eye. “We wake up.”

She handed him the mirror shard again. It was pulsing more violently now, the heat from it radiating up his arm. The orb reacted to his presence, its glow intensifying, the tendrils reaching toward him like fingers desperate for contact. Eli raised the shard, hesitated, then struck.

The moment the shard touched the orb, the world detonated.

He didn’t see light — he became light. He was flung through centuries, cities, storms. He lived and died a hundred times in the space between heartbeats. He felt himself become a school desk, a dead bird, a rusting bicycle, a mother’s broken heart. He saw Linton’s Edge be born, burn, rebuild, shift, fracture. He saw himself — versions with metal skin, versions made of shadow, versions that laughed while bleeding.

Then, silence.

Eli stood alone in a white room. The walls were paper-thin, and behind them danced silhouettes — some familiar, others monstrous. In front of him stood a child — a boy no older than eight, barefoot, wearing an old T-shirt that said “I VISITED THE CAVES OF MAMMOTH.”

The boy looked up at him and smiled.

“You made it.”

Eli’s throat was raw. “Who are you?”

“I’m you,” the boy said. “The first you. Before the loops began.”

“This… is the First Memory?”

“No. You are.”

The room began to unravel. The paper-thin walls tore like silk, and behind them was not darkness, but sky — a pale blue stretching on forever. The child stepped forward and took Eli’s hand.

“You broke the Loop. That means you get to choose.”

“Choose what?”

“To wake up. Or to stay.”

Eli stared at the sky. He could see a shape far off — a town not yet corrupted, a version of Linton’s Edge untouched by the Engine’s hunger.

“If I wake up,” he asked, “what happens to Marrow?”

The boy hesitated. “She only exists here.”

Eli’s chest ached. “But she’s real.”

“She’s important,” the child agreed. “But not part of the waking world.”

The sky darkened slightly. The outlines of buildings formed below, familiar ones. His school. The bakery. The railroad yard. A version of home.

“If I stay?”

“You’ll forget who you are. But you’ll help others wake up. Like she helped you.”

Eli closed his eyes. He saw Marrow — standing by the tower, knife in hand, watching the town collapse and rebuild again and again. He saw Miles, still trapped somewhere in one of the bad versions, his laugh twisted by the Engine. He saw his mother, crying in a kitchen that wasn’t hers, calling a name that didn’t exist anymore.

“I want to help,” he whispered.

The child nodded.

“Then remember this,” he said, placing something cold into Eli’s hand — the mirror shard. “When the sky cracks, you’re close.”

The world bent again — not violently this time, but gently, like a curtain drawing closed.

Eli opened his eyes to a new morning.

He was standing at the edge of the woods behind the school, the sun barely up, the grass wet with dew. Birds chirped lazily from the trees. The town was still — not perfect, but peaceful. He looked down at his hands. The mirror shard was gone.

In his pocket, he found something else: a folded map, hand-drawn, with a circle in the middle.

And three letters carved in the corner.

A.M.E.

He turned toward the sound of a train whistle — real this time, distant but clear.

Linton’s Edge was waking up.

So was he.

Eli walked back into town as the sun edged over the horizon, its light slanting gold across rooftops that no longer shimmered or twisted. The strange angles, the broken physics — they were gone. Birds moved the way birds should. Cars idled at intersections. A breeze moved the leaves without trying to speak. But it wasn’t just that the town had changed. He had. There was a stillness in his chest, like the air before thunder, and a thread of tension strung through his ribs that hummed with every step.

He passed people he knew — or used to. Mrs. Canning watering her plants. Toby Barnes riding his skateboard across the cracked sidewalk. They nodded, offered greetings, smiled — not with empty eyes, but not with full ones either. It struck Eli how carefully balanced everything seemed. As if the world had been restored to a delicate, artificial equilibrium, one that could unravel with the slightest misstep. He wondered if any of them remembered. Or if he was the only one who had carried the truth back up from underneath.

The bakery had reopened. The wood on the front door looked freshly sanded and painted. The “help wanted” sign hung in the window, a curl of steam drawing from the chimney. He climbed the stairs, his legs stiff, feeling as though he had aged a decade underground. The apartment door was open. Inside, his mother was humming as she set two plates on the table.

She looked up at him with the kind of warmth he hadn’t seen in months — not since before everything twisted.

“Morning, sweetheart. You hungry?”

Eli froze. “You… know me?”

She smiled and raised a brow. “Of course I know you. Don’t be silly.”

He sat down slowly. The table was set with eggs and toast and a chipped blue mug full of coffee — just the way he remembered from when he was a kid. There was no hint of strangeness in her eyes, no flicker of memory behind them, but no hollowness either. She was real. Here. Present. But as he lifted his fork, a thought struck him cold.

This version of her might not be the same. She might be a copy — or maybe he was. Maybe the version of Eli that had clawed his way into the Core hadn’t truly made it out, and this was just the final delusion: a life too neat to trust.

Still, he ate.

Afterward, he wandered. Miles’ house was still at the end of Cedar Drive, but there was a different car in the driveway. The mailbox said “Calhoun” instead of “Henderson.” He knocked. A girl answered — younger than him, freckles, braces. She looked at him like he was lost.

“Does Miles live here?”

She shook her head. “No one by that name.”

He walked away before she could ask more.

Later, he found himself back at the railroad yard. The water tower stood tall and silent. The letters — A.M.E. — were still there, though dull now, as if their purpose had been fulfilled. He climbed the rusted ladder, muscles aching. From the top, he saw the entire town laid out like a model: familiar and distant, clean and unknowable. Something about it felt fragile. Temporarily repaired.

The wind picked up. In the east, clouds gathered.

Behind him, he heard a voice.

“Took you long enough.”

He turned. Marrow was sitting on the ledge, legs dangling over the drop, looking out across the town with a tired half-smile. Her boots were dusty. A new scar split her eyebrow.

“You’re still here,” he said.

She shrugged. “Sort of. I’m not built for your world. Not entirely. But you left the door cracked when you made your choice. That buys me some time.”

Eli sat beside her, silence stretching between them. He watched as she pulled something from her pocket — the mirror shard. It had dulled, but it still glinted with something more than light.

“Did I do the right thing?” he asked.

“There isn’t a ‘right thing.’ There’s just what comes next.” She handed him the shard. “You’ll need this again.”

“I thought I broke the Loop.”

“You did. But you didn’t end it.”

She leaned back on her elbows and looked toward the sky, which had begun to darken along the edges with that strange, bruised violet color he now recognized as a warning. The first tremor of unease stirred in his stomach.

“The Engine isn’t one place,” she said. “It’s a network. This town was one node. You cracked it. But the system’s vast. Global. Maybe older than us. Definitely older than Linton’s Edge.”

Eli frowned. “So it’s not over?”

Marrow shook her head. “The Core’s gone quiet here, for now. But it’ll wake somewhere else. Or someone else will stumble into a door like you did. The question is whether they’ll have anyone to guide them.”

She stood and dusted off her coat. The sky had grown more agitated — not stormy, exactly, but watchful, like a giant eye opening behind clouds.

“I’m leaving soon,” she said. “Can’t hold myself together in this layer much longer.”

Eli stood, too. “Where will you go?”

She smirked. “Another crack. Another town. Maybe a lighthouse this time. Or a hospital.”

He hesitated, then stepped forward and hugged her. She stiffened for a second before returning it — not warm, but real.

“You saved me,” he said.

“No,” she replied. “You remembered. I just helped you listen.”

And then she was gone — not with a flash or a scream, but with a ripple of light that dissolved into wind.

Eli climbed back down slowly. The world felt both heavier and lighter than it had before. He had no illusions now. No safety in comfort. The truth was raw and open like a wound — but it was truth, and he carried it like fire in his chest.

That night, he dreamed of a city where no one had faces. He stood in the middle of a crumbling plaza, holding a map that changed each time he blinked. Above him, the sky cracked.

The next morning, he packed a bag.

Inside it, he placed the map, the shard, and a notebook. He had already begun to write down what he’d seen — not just to remember, but to prepare.

There were other towns.

Other loops.

Other Engines.

He would find them.

Or they would find him.

Chapter Three: The Town Without Shadows

The bus rolled along a winding highway that split a vast sea of green hills, its tires humming a monotonous lullaby against the cracked pavement. Eli sat near the back, his head against the window, watching a town grow out of the landscape like it had been sleeping beneath the earth, waiting for someone like him to arrive. He hadn’t spoken much since leaving Linton’s Edge. There hadn’t been a need. Everything inside him had rearranged, like puzzle pieces shuffled into a new picture. Each day brought a new awareness — a sixth sense that itched behind his eyes and buzzed in his fingertips.

The notebook lay open in his lap, a page half-filled with sketches and phrases that had come to him in dreams. Words like “veil memory,” “inversion bleed,” “subduction layer.” Things that didn’t mean anything yet but vibrated with importance. On the last page, he’d drawn a rough map. Not to anywhere real — at least not in the waking world. But it led somewhere. A series of nodes marked with circles, like pinpricks through reality. At the center, always, was a spiral.

The town ahead was called Bellbrook, according to the faded sign on the side of the road. Population: 4,881. Beneath that number, someone had spray-painted a second one in black: 0. Someone had crossed that out, then written 1.

The bus hissed to a stop in front of a lonely convenience store, its windows tinted so dark they reflected only the approaching twilight. Eli stepped off into the heavy summer air, the scent of rain clinging to the wind, though the clouds above were perfectly clear. He adjusted the strap of his bag and stood still for a moment, listening. The town sounded wrong — not in volume, but in shape. The silence curved inward, echoing back at him. It was too round.

He walked.

Bellbrook’s streets were narrow, lined with houses that looked like they’d been copied from a textbook on Americana — perfect angles, fresh paint, picket fences. Not a blade of grass out of place. But there were no people. No cars. Windows were lit but uncurtained, rooms exposed like museum displays. As he passed one house, he caught sight of a woman sitting at a dining table with her hands folded neatly, staring at a plate of untouched food. She didn’t blink. Didn’t move.

The most unsettling thing was the light. It came from the wrong direction. The sun was clearly setting in the west, yet shadows stretched nowhere. Even objects that should’ve cast long lines across the pavement — trees, fences, Eli himself — had no shadows. It was like the town had refused to acknowledge them.

The hair on his arms stood up.

He turned down what looked like a main street, with its closed storefronts and lamp posts that flickered despite it being too early for nightfall. A hardware store. A barbershop. A diner with a flickering neon sign: MARLENE’S – OPEN 24 HOURS. The “O” buzzed like an insect trapped inside.

Eli entered.

Inside, the diner was lit in sickly yellow. A few patrons sat at booths, all perfectly still. A waitress moved behind the counter in slow, mechanical strides, her motions too fluid, too practiced. She didn’t look up when he entered. No one did.

He sat at the counter and waited. The waitress eventually drifted over and placed a menu in front of him without a word. Her eyes were cloudy — not blind, just distant, like someone mid-dream.

“Hi,” he said cautiously. “I’m just passing through. Looking for somewhere to stay.”

She stared at him, then blinked once, twice.

“You’re not from here,” she said.

“No.”

The diner fell silent, as if the very air around them leaned in. A man in the corner turned his head slightly, just enough to make Eli aware of the angle. A boy at the window lowered his milkshake and stared. Not at Eli, but through him.

“You should go,” the waitress said quietly.

“I just got here.”

“Then you’re already too late.”

Before he could ask more, the lights flickered. The sound of static — faint and high-pitched — trickled down from the ceiling tiles. The waitress stepped back, her face blanking over like someone had turned off the part of her that cared. She turned and walked away.

Eli stood and left.

Outside, the shadows were beginning to form — but not where they belonged. Instead, they clung to walls, hovered beneath windows, and crept up streetlamps like vines. The sunset hadn’t changed, but the light no longer reached the corners. And somewhere behind it all, he could feel a rhythm: the slow, pulsing beat of something underground.

He followed it.

Down a residential lane lined with identical houses, then through a crumbling gate at the edge of a park that no longer smelled of grass. Trees leaned inward, their branches too heavy with leaves. The path twisted in ways the map in his notebook hadn’t predicted, and yet it still felt familiar.

At the center of the park stood a gazebo, its paint peeled and rotted. A rusted sign hung from the top: MEET HERE AT FIRST DARK. Beneath it, carved into the floorboards, were more letters.

A.M.E.

Eli sat at the edge of the gazebo and opened his notebook again. The map didn’t match the town’s layout anymore — it had shifted. Bellbrook wasn’t part of the existing spiral. It was outside it. A break in the pattern.

Or worse — an eye of the storm.

“You’re early,” a voice said from the trees.

He turned.

A girl stepped out of the underbrush. She was tall, angular, with skin like old parchment and eyes like ink. Her clothes were mismatched: a coat two sizes too large, a skirt made from torn book pages stitched together with thread. She had no shoes. Around her neck hung a chain of keys — dozens of them, all old, none matching.

“Who are you?” Eli asked.

“I’m the Custodian.”

“Of what?”

She tilted her head. “Of what’s left.”

They stared at each other for a moment, the dark thickening like smoke between them.

“Bellbrook isn’t real, is it?” he asked.

“It was. A long time ago.”

“And now?”

“Now it’s waiting.”

“For what?”

“You.”

He felt a chill coil through his stomach.

The Custodian stepped closer, and when she moved, the shadows moved with her. Not behind her — on her. They clung to her ankles, rippled across her wrists, curled around her eyes like kohl. She reached into her coat and pulled out a slip of paper — yellowed, brittle. She handed it to him.

He unfolded it.

QUERY ACCEPTED. WAKE SEQUENCE PENDING. DOOR OPEN: 27%.

“What is this?” he asked.

“A status report. The Engine beneath this town is fragmented. Broken in parts. But it’s starting to remember.”

Eli looked around. “Where’s the Core?”

“There is no Core. Not here. Just echoes.”

He swallowed. “Then why bring me?”

She pointed at his notebook. “Because you have the map. And because you still remember the spiral.”

Eli didn’t respond. He looked down at the drawing — crude lines, loops intersecting, expanding — and suddenly, he saw it. Bellbrook wasn’t a town. It was a nexus. A forgotten node.

And something was waking beneath it.

The Custodian’s voice dropped to a whisper.

“Tomorrow, the sky will crack. Just like before. When it does, you’ll have a choice.”

Eli stood slowly, his legs stiff.

“What choice?”

“To leave it be.”

“Or?”

“To finish what you started.”

She walked past him, vanishing into the trees.

He stayed at the gazebo until the sun was gone.

When the first stars appeared — wrong stars, crooked constellations — he opened the notebook again.

The map had changed.

Bellbrook was at the center now.

And something beneath it had started to glow.

Eli woke before dawn, curled beneath the gazebo as dew settled on the grass around him like a thin skin of frost. The town was silent again, the kind of quiet that carried too much meaning. He sat up, brushing leaves from his jacket, and immediately reached for the notebook. The map had changed again during the night — or rather, it had unfolded. A new set of lines spiraled outward from Bellbrook’s center, twisting into a knot-like symbol that pulsed faintly on the page. Whatever lay beneath the town was active now. It was no longer sleeping.

He walked into the early morning with careful steps. Something had shifted in the town overnight. The buildings were still there — perfect, symmetrical, paper-thin in their design — but now their walls seemed to breathe. Windows bulged outward and then sucked inward with invisible pressure. The street signs changed fonts when he wasn’t looking directly at them. And worst of all, there was music — soft and slow, like a phonograph playing underwater. It came from everywhere and nowhere, rising in broken waltz-time from the very foundation of the town.

People were awake, but they moved like they were caught in a loop: opening doors, stepping outside, returning inside, repeating the motion with eerie synchronicity. Eli passed one woman sweeping her porch. She looked at him and smiled, but her hand never stopped moving, brushing the broom over the same clean patch of wood, over and over.

The shadows, too, had returned — not in their usual passive role, but alive. They lingered under trees like oil slicks and pooled at the corners of buildings like spilled ink. Eli caught his own reflection in a shop window and saw that even his shadow moved with a slight delay, lagging half a beat behind every motion. That wasn’t just the town — that was the Engine’s pull, reaching for him, threading its fingers through his spine.

He returned to the park by instinct. As he passed through the iron gate, the grass underfoot flattened without being touched. The gazebo looked the same, but the carvings on the wood had spread, curling like veins across the structure. At the center of the floorboards, a new symbol had appeared overnight — not letters this time, but a spiral carved deep, black and slick with some fluid that wasn’t quite sap or ink.

The Custodian stood beside it.

She didn’t greet him. She simply gestured to the spiral.

“It’s ready,” she said. “The breach point.”

Eli stepped forward slowly. “I thought you said the Core here was gone.”

“It is. But this is where the memory folded inward. The echo chamber. All the fragments come here when they’re too damaged to exist elsewhere.”

He crouched beside the spiral and touched it with two fingers. The wood was ice cold.

“What happens if I go down?”

“You won’t go down,” she said. “You’ll go through. This isn’t a descent. It’s a traversal.”

Eli looked up at her. “And you?”

“I stay here. I keep watch.”

She removed one of the keys from the chain around her neck and handed it to him. It was small, brass, pitted with age. A faint letter “B” was stamped on its head.

“You’ll need this when the recursion starts.”

He didn’t ask what that meant. The deeper he went into these places, the more he understood that language was just a suggestion. The real answers were encoded in the rhythm of things: the way people moved, how light bent, how time stuttered in the corners.

The moment he pressed the key against the spiral, the gazebo dissolved.

There was no sensation of falling. No tunnel or tunnel vision. He was simply elsewhere.

The sky was red.

Not sunset red — deeper, bloodier, endless. It hung above a landscape of ruins: a city shattered into spirals, its buildings curved and twisted like melted bones. Roads split and looped on themselves, forming impossible intersections where cars floated, mid-collision, never finishing the crash. Sound was muffled, like someone had stuffed the world with cotton. And all around him, dust fell like snow, except it rose from the ground instead of descending from the sky.

He turned slowly.

Behind him, a structure loomed — part tower, part engine, part cathedral. It groaned with mechanical breath, its walls sliding in and out like lungs. Pipes ran along the outside, pumping black ichor into a basin at its base. And above the door, written in the same script he had seen back in Linton’s Edge:

A.M.E. — MEMORY THREAD 0193-A

This was one of the older ones.

A failed loop.

A memory too corrupted to keep, but too dangerous to delete.

Eli stepped forward.

The door opened of its own accord, and inside, the temperature dropped sharply. The air tasted like static and burnt paper. The walls of the Engine chamber were lined with mirrors, each one reflecting not him — but someone else. Another Eli. Hundreds of them. Some younger. Some warped. Some weeping. One stood completely still, missing his mouth. Another had wires growing from his skull.

At the center of the room was a chair. A high-backed seat made of wires, bone, and fragments of wood from the gazebo above.

A voice spoke behind him.

“You’re early,” it said.

He turned, expecting the Custodian.

But it was Marrow.

Except… not the same Marrow.

This version wore a black suit, her eyes empty hollows of white. Her hair had been shaved to the skin, and her voice echoed when she spoke — not from her mouth, but from the room itself.

“You’ve reached Thread 0193-A,” she said. “Do you wish to restore?”

Eli didn’t answer. Something was wrong here. This wasn’t a memory — it was a trap. A containment thread. The Engine was using her image like a lure.

The Marrow-thing stepped closer. “You’re bleeding influence,” she said. “You shouldn’t have come without the key.”

Eli pulled the brass key from his pocket.

Instantly, the air shifted. The mirrors rattled. A low, resonant hum rose from the floor. The Engine recoiled — not visibly, but spiritually. Something deep within the structure cracked.

The Marrow-thing smiled. “So you did bring it. Good. Then you’ve already chosen your role.”

“What role?”

“To be the Fracture.”

The hum turned into a scream.

The mirrors shattered.

And every version of Eli in them stepped forward.

Suddenly he was surrounded by himself — but not quite. Each one flickered, like bad film, caught mid-frame. One reached for him, whispering, “We never left.” Another shoved him back, eyes bleeding light. One dropped to his knees and begged him not to remember.

Eli screamed and stabbed the key into the floor.

The scream silenced.

The chamber collapsed inward.

When he opened his eyes, he was back in the gazebo.

The Custodian was gone.

The park was gone.

Bellbrook itself was gone.

He stood on a platform floating in a white void, the brass key warm in his palm.

Far below, the spiral pulsed — not as ink, not as a symbol, but as a door.

One more version waited to be breached.

And he had only just begun.

Chapter Four: The Ash-Root Signal

The white void lasted longer than it should have, stretching into a timeless drift where sound and weight had no meaning. Eli stood on the floating platform, his limbs tingling from the proximity to the spiral below. It pulsed at regular intervals now — slow, then fast, then slow again — like the heartbeat of something deciding whether or not to let him pass. Around him, there were no stars, no floor, no edge to the world, only that pale expanse and the humming brass key in his pocket, which now seemed to carry more weight than the bag on his shoulders.

He had seen so many versions of himself now that he no longer feared them. But there was something deeper he hadn’t yet seen — something older. The original lie. Every loop had hinted at it: Marrow’s warnings, the fragmented symbols, the threads tangled around Linton’s Edge and Bellbrook. They all pointed to a first breach, one no one spoke of. The place where the spiral began.

When he stepped off the platform, he didn’t fall.

He shifted.

Like passing through silk into stone.

The world snapped back into shape around him with such force that he staggered and dropped to one knee. Grass. Trees. A scent of earth, damp and cold. He was in a forest — dense, dark, quiet in a way that warned him it was only pretending. Above, the canopy filtered out most of the moonlight, leaving only patches of silver that seemed to flicker. The air felt wrong — not poisoned, but artificially preserved. Too clean. As if the forest had been saved in a jar for decades, untouched by decay or time.

He rose slowly.

This wasn’t like Bellbrook, or Linton’s Edge. The structures here were not buildings — they were organic. As he walked through the trees, he saw shapes forming in the fog: huts woven from branches, towers that grew directly from the roots of enormous oaks, bridges made of knotted vines and animal bones. There were no signs of people, yet the place felt occupied — not by any one thing, but by an old intelligence, stretched thin over the land like a second skin.

A low sound thrummed from deep within the trees, faint but persistent. A rhythm, not unlike the Engine’s earlier hum, but rawer — tribal, even. A beat that felt like it belonged to drums, but none were playing.

He followed it.

The path led him through a clearing, across a field where thousands of feathers had been planted in the ground like flowers, their shafts upright, their tips sharp as blades. Every feather shimmered slightly with color, yet when he tried to count them, they flickered — some vanished, others multiplied. At the center of the field stood a lone figure.

It wasn’t human.

Or, it had once been.

It stood tall and skeletal, with bark for skin and a twisted crown of roots circling its skull. Its eyes were empty sockets filled with flickering light, and from its chest hung dozens of necklaces — not of beads or bone, but of teeth. Human, animal, something in between.

Eli didn’t move. Neither did the creature.

Then it spoke, and its voice was like gravel caught in wind.

“You bring the key.”

He swallowed. “You know what it is?”

“We remember,” it said. “We are the memory that was first burned.”

Eli stepped forward. “This is where it started, isn’t it? The spiral. The recursion. The Engine. This is the origin.”

The creature tilted its head. “This is the first warning.”

“What happened here?”

The creature reached out, and though its fingers never touched him, the world around them melted — the field of feathers faded into fire. Suddenly Eli was somewhere else, standing in a town made of wood and smoke. Not a modern one — something ancient, built before maps, be
