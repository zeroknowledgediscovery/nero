A STORY.   ONCE there was a nice young hen that we will call Mrs. Feathertop.  She was a hen of most excellent family, being a direct descendant of the Bolton Grays, and as pretty a young fowl as you could wish to see of a summer’s day.  She was, moreover, as fortunately situated in life as it was possible for a hen to be.  She was bought by young Master Fred Little John, with four or five family connections of hers, and a lively young cock, who was held to be as brisk a scratcher and as capable a head of a family as any half-dozen sensible hens could desire.  I can’t say that at first Mrs. Feathertop was a very sensible hen.  She was very pretty and lively, to be sure, and a great favourite with Master Bolton Gray Cock, on account of her bright eyes, her finely shaded feathers, and certain saucy dashing ways that she had which seemed greatly to take his fancy.  But old Mrs. Scratchard, living in the neighbouring yard, assured all the neighbourhood that Gray Cock was a fool for thinking so much of that flighty young thing; _that_ she had not the smallest notion how to get on in life, and thought of nothing in the world but her own pretty feathers.  “Wait till she comes to have chickens,” said Mrs. Scratchard; “then you will see.  I have brought up ten broods myself—as likely and respectable chickens as ever were a blessing to society—and I think I ought to know a good hatcher and brooder when I see her; and I know _that_ fine piece of trumpery, with her white feathers tipped with gray, never will come down to family life. _She_ scratch for chickens!  Bless me, she never did anything in all her days but run round and eat the worms which somebody else scratched up for her.”  When Master Bolton Gray heard this he crowed very loudly, like a cock of spirit, and declared that old Mrs. Scratchard was envious, because she had lost all her own tail-feathers, and looked more like a worn-out old feather-duster than a respectable hen, and that therefore she was filled with sheer envy of anybody that was young and pretty.  So young Mrs. Feathertop cackled gay defiance at her busy rubbishy neighbour, as she sunned herself under the bushes on fine June afternoons.  Now Master Fred Little John had been allowed to have these hens by his mamma on the condition that he would build their house himself, and take all the care of it; and to do Master Fred justice, he executed the job in a small way quite creditably.  He chose a sunny sloping bank covered with a thick growth of bushes, and erected there a nice little hen-house with two glass windows, a little door, and a good pole for his family to roost on.  He made, moreover, a row of nice little boxes with hay in them for nests, and he bought three or four little smooth white china eggs to put in them, so that, when his hens _did_ lay, he might carry off their eggs without their being missed.  This hen-house stood in a little grove that sloped down to a wide river, just where there was a little cove which reached almost to the hen-house.                      [Picture: Erecting the Hen-House]  This situation inspired one of Master Fred’s boy advisers with a new scheme in relation to his poultry enterprise.  “Hallo!  I say, Fred,” said Tom Seymour, “you ought to raise ducks; you’ve got a capital place for ducks there.”  “Yes; but I’ve bought _hens_, you see,” said Freddy; “so it’s no use trying.”  “No use!  Of course there is.  Just as if your hens couldn’t hatch ducks’ eggs.  Now you just wait till one of your hens wants to sit, and you put ducks’ eggs under her, and you’ll have a family of ducks in a twinkling. You can buy ducks’ eggs a plenty of old Sam under the hill.  He always has hens hatch his ducks.”  So Freddy thought it would be a good experiment, and informed his mother the next morning that he intended to furnish the ducks for the next Christmas dinner and when she wondered how he was to come by them, he said mysteriously, “Oh, I will show you how,” but did not further explain himself.  The next day he went with Tom Seymour and made a trade with old Sam, and gave him a middle-aged jack-knife for eight of his ducks’ eggs. Sam, by-the-by, was a woolly-headed old negro man, who lived by the pond hard by, and who had long cast envying eyes on Fred’s jack-knife, because it was of extra fine steel, having been a Christmas present the year before.  But Fred knew very well there were any number more of jack-knives where that came from, and that, in order to get a new one, he must dispose of the old; so he made the purchase and came home rejoicing.  Now about this time Mrs. Feathertop, having laid her eggs daily with great credit to herself, notwithstanding Mrs. Scratchard’s predictions, began to find herself suddenly attacked with nervous symptoms.  She lost her gay spirits, grew dumpish and morose, stuck up her feathers in a bristling way, and pecked at her neighbours if they did so much as look at her.  Master Gray Cock was greatly concerned, and went to old Dr. Peppercorn, who looked solemn, and recommended an infusion of angle-worms, and said he would look in on the patient twice a day till she was better.  “Gracious me, Gray Cock!” said old Goody Kertarkut, who had been lolling at the corner as he passed, “ain’t you a fool?—cocks always are fools. Don’t you know what’s the matter with your wife?  She wants to sit, that’s all; and you just let her sit.  A fiddlestick for Dr. Peppercorn! Why, any good old hen that has brought up a family knows more than a doctor about such things.  You just go home and tell her to sit if she wants to, and behave herself.”  When Gray Cock came home, he found that Master Freddy had been before him, and had established Mrs. Feathertop upon eight nice eggs, where she was sitting in gloomy grandeur.  He tried to make a little affable conversation with her, and to relate his interview with the doctor and Goody Kertarkut; but she was morose and sullen, and only pecked at him now and then in a very sharp, unpleasant way.  So after a few more efforts to make himself agreeable he left her, and went out promenading with the captivating Mrs. Red Comb, a charming young Spanish widow, who had just been imported into the neighbouring yard.  “Bless my soul,” said he, “you’ve no idea how cross my wife is.”  “O you horrid creature!” said Mrs. Red Comb.  “How little you feel for the weaknesses of us poor hens!”  “On my word, ma’am,” said Gray Cock, “you do me injustice.  But when a hen gives way to temper, ma’am, and no longer meets her husband with a smile—when she even pecks at him whom she is bound to honour and obey—”  “Horrid monster! talking of obedience!  I should say, sir, you came straight from Turkey.”  And Mrs. Red Comb tossed her head with a most bewitching air, and pretended to run away; and old Mrs. Scratchard looked out of her coop and called to Goody Kertarkut,—  “Look how Mr. Gray Cock is flirting with that widow.  I always knew she was a baggage.”  “And his poor wife left at home alone,” said Goody Kertarkut.  “It’s the way with ’em all!”  “Yes, yes,” said Dame Scratchard, “she’ll know what real life is now, and she won’t go about holding her head so high, and looking down on her practical neighbours that have raised families.”  “Poor thing! what’ll she do with a family?” said Goody Kertarkut.  “Well, what business have such young flirts to get married?” said Dame Scratchard.  “I don’t expect she’ll raise a single chick; and there’s Gray Cock flirting about, fine as ever.  Folks didn’t do so when I was young.  I’m sure my husband knew what treatment a sitting hen ought to have,—poor old Long Spur! he never minded a peck or so and then.  I must say these modern fowls ain’t what fowls used to be.”  Meanwhile the sun rose and set, and Master Fred was almost the only friend and associate of poor little Mrs. Feathertop, whom he fed daily with meal and water, and only interrupted her sad reflections by pulling her up occasionally to see how the eggs were coming on.  At last “Peep, peep, peep,” began to be heard in the nest, and one little downy head after another poked forth from under the feathers, surveying the world with round, bright, winking eyes; and gradually the brood were hatched, and Mrs. Feathertop arose, a proud and happy mother, with all the bustling, scratching, care-taking instincts of family-life warm within her breast.  She clucked and scratched, and cuddled the little downy bits of things as handily and discreetly as a seven-year-old hen could have done, exciting thereby the wonder of the community.                         [Picture: The Brood Hatched]  Master Gray Cock came home in high spirits, and complimented her; told her she was looking charmingly once more, and said, “Very well, very nice,” as he surveyed the young brood.  So that Mrs. Feathertop began to feel the world going well with her, when suddenly in came Dame Scratchard and Goody Kertarkut to make a morning call.  “Let’s see the chicks,” said Dame Scratchard.  “Goodness me,” said Goody Kertarkut, “what a likeness to their dear papa!”  “Well, but bless me, what’s the matter with their bills?” said Dame Scratchard.  “Why, my dear, these chicks are deformed!  I’m sorry for you, my dear; but it’s all the result of your inexperience.  You ought to have eaten pebble-stones with your meal when you were sitting.  Don’t you see, Dame Kertarkut, what bills they have?  That’ll increase, and they’ll be frightful!”  “What shall I do?” said Mrs. Feathertop, now greatly alarmed.  “Nothing, as I know of,” said Dame Scratchard, “since you didn’t come to me before you sat.  I could have told you all about it.  Maybe it won’t kill ’em, but they’ll always be deformed.”  And so the gossips departed, leaving a sting under the pin-feathers of the poor little hen mamma, who began to see that her darlings had curious little spoon-bills, different from her own, and to worry and fret about it.  “My dear,” she said to her spouse, “do get Dr. Peppercorn to come in and look at their bills, and see if anything can be done.”  Dr. Peppercorn came in, and put on a monstrous pair of spectacles, and said, “Hum! ha! extraordinary case; very singular.”  “Did you ever see anything like it, doctor?” said both parents in a breath.  “I’ve read of such cases.  It’s a calcareous enlargement of the vascular bony tissue, threatening ossification,” said the doctor.  “Oh, dreadful!  Can it be possible?” shrieked both parents.  “Can anything be done?”  “Well, I should recommend a daily lotion made of mosquitoes’ horns and bicarbonate of frogs’ toes, together with a powder, to be taken morning and night, of muriate of fleas.  One thing you must be careful about: they must never wet their feet, nor drink any water.”  “Dear me, doctor, I don’t know what I _shall_ do, for they seem to have a particular fancy for getting into water.”  “Yes, a morbid tendency often found in these cases of bony tumification of the vascular tissue of the mouth; but you must resist it, ma’am, as their life depends upon it.”  And with that Dr. Peppercorn glared gloomily on the young ducks, who were stealthily poking the objectionable little spoon-bills out from under their mother’s feathers.  After this poor Mrs. Feathertop led a weary life of it; for the young fry were as healthy and enterprising a brood of young ducks as ever carried saucepans on the end of their noses, and they most utterly set themselves against the doctor’s prescriptions, murmured at the muriate of fleas and the bicarbonate of frogs’ toes, and took every opportunity to waddle their little ways down to the mud and water which was in their near vicinity.  So their bills grew larger and larger, as did the rest of their bodies, and family government grew weaker and weaker.  “You’ll wear me out, children, you certainly will,” said poor Mrs. Feathertop.  “You’ll go to destruction, do ye hear?” said Master Gray Cock.  “Did you ever see such frights as poor Mrs. Feathertop has got?” said Dame Scratchard.  “I knew what would come of _her_ family—all deformed, and with a dreadful sort of madness which makes them love to shovel mud with those shocking spoon-bills of theirs.”  “It’s a kind of idiocy,” said Goody Kertarkut.  “Poor things! they can’t be kept from the water, nor made to take powders, and so they get worse and worse.”  “I understand it’s affecting their feet so that they can’t walk, and a dreadful sort of net is growing between their toes.  What a shocking visitation!”  “She brought it on herself,” said Dame Scratchard.  “Why didn’t she come to me before she sat?  She was always an upstart, self-conceited thing; but I’m sure I pity her.”  Meanwhile the young ducks throve apace.  Their necks grew glossy, like changeable green and gold satin, and though they would not take the doctor’s medicine, and would waddle in the mud and water—for which they always felt themselves to be very naughty ducks—yet they grew quite vigorous and hearty.  At last one day the whole little tribe waddled off down to the bank of the river.  It was a beautiful day, and the river was dancing and dimpling and winking as the little breezes shook the trees that hung over it.  “Well,” said the biggest of the little ducks, “in spite of Dr. Peppercorn, I can’t help longing for the water.  I don’t believe it is going to hurt me; at any rate, here goes,” and in he plumped, and in went every duck after him, and they threw out their great brown feet as cleverly as if they had taken swimming lessons all their lives, and sailed off on the river, away, away among the ferns, under the pink azaleas, through reeds and rushes, and arrow-heads and pickerel-weed, the happiest ducks that ever were born; and soon they were quite out of sight.  “Well, Mrs. Feathertop, this is a dispensation!” said Mrs. Scratchard. “Your children are all drowned at last, just as I knew they’d be.  The old music-teacher, Master Bullfrog, that lives down in Water-Dock Lane, saw ’em all plump madly into the water together this morning.  That’s what comes of not knowing how to bring up a family!”  Mrs. Feathertop gave only one shriek and fainted dead away, and was carried home on a cabbage-leaf; and Mr. Gray Cock was sent for, where he was waiting on Mrs. Red Comb through the squash-vines.  “It’s a serious time in your family, sir,” said Goody Kertarkut, “and you ought to be at home supporting your wife.  Send for Dr. Peppercorn without delay.”  Now as the case was a very dreadful one, Dr. Peppercorn called a council from the barn-yard of the squire, two miles off, and a brisk young Dr. Partlett appeared, in a fine suit of brown and gold, with tail-feathers like meteors.  A fine young fellow he was, lately from Paris, with all the modern scientific improvements fresh in his head.  When he had listened to the whole story, he clapped his spur into the ground, and leaning back laughed so loudly that all the cocks in the neighbourhood crowed.  Mrs. Feathertop rose up out of her swoon, and Mr. Gray Cock was greatly enraged.  “What do you mean, sir, by such behaviour in the house of mourning?”  “My dear sir, pardon me; but there is no occasion for mourning.  My dear madam, let me congratulate you.  There is no harm done.  The simple matter is, dear madam, you have been under a hallucination all along. The neighbourhood and my learned friend the doctor have all made a mistake in thinking that these children of yours were hens at all.  They are ducks, ma’am, evidently ducks, and very finely-formed ducks I daresay.”                    [Picture: The Hen that Hatched Ducks]  At this moment a quack was heard, and at a distance the whole tribe were seen coming waddling home, their feathers gleaming in green and gold, and they themselves in high good spirits.  “Such a splendid day as we have had!” they all cried in a breath.  “And we know now how to get our own living; we can take care of ourselves in future, so you need have no further trouble with us.”  “Madam,” said the doctor, making a bow with an air which displayed his tail-feathers to advantage, “let me congratulate you on the charming family you have raised.  A finer brood of young, healthy ducks I never saw.  Give me your claw, my dear friend,” he said, addressing the eldest son.  “In our barn-yard no family is more respected than that of the ducks.”  And so Madam Feathertop came off glorious at last.  And when after this the ducks used to go swimming up and down the river like so many nabobs among the admiring hens, Dr. Peppercorn used to look after them and say, “Ah, I had the care of their infancy!” and Mr. Gray Cock and his wife used to say, “It was our system of education did that!”     _THE NUTCRACKERS OF NUTCRACKER LODGE_.   MR. and Mrs. Nutcracker were as respectable a pair of squirrels as ever wore gray brushes over their backs.  They were animals of a settled and serious turn of mind, not disposed to run after vanities and novelties, but filling their station in life with prudence and sobriety.  Nutcracker Lodge was a hole in a sturdy old chestnut overhanging a shady dell, and was held to be as respectably kept an establishment as there was in the whole forest.  Even Miss Jenny Wren, the greatest gossip of the neighbourhood, never found anything to criticise in its arrangements; and old Parson Too-whit, a venerable owl who inhabited a branch somewhat more exalted, as became his profession, was in the habit of saving himself much trouble in his parochial exhortations by telling his parishioners in short to “look at the Nutcrackers” if they wanted to see what it was to live a virtuous life.  Everything had gone on prosperously with them, and they had reared many successive families of young Nutcrackers, who went forth to assume their places in the forest of life, and to reflect credit on their bringing up,—so that naturally enough they began to have a very easy way of considering themselves models of wisdom.  But at last it came along, in the course of events, that they had a son named Featherhead, who was destined to bring them a great deal of anxiety.  Nobody knows what the reason is, but the fact was, that Master Featherhead was as different from all the former children of this worthy couple as if he had been dropped out of the moon into their nest, instead of coming into it in the general way.  Young Featherhead was a squirrel of good parts and a lively disposition, but he was sulky and contrary and unreasonable, and always finding matter of complaint in everything his respectable papa and mamma did.  Instead of assisting in the cares of a family,—picking up nuts and learning other lessons proper to a young squirrel,—he seemed to settle himself from his earliest years into a sort of lofty contempt for the Nutcrackers, for Nutcracker Lodge, and for all the good old ways and institutions of the domestic hole, which he declared to be stupid and unreasonable, and entirely behind the times. To be sure, he was always on hand at meal-times, and played a very lively tooth on the nuts which his mother had collected, always selecting the very best for himself; but he seasoned his nibbling with so much grumbling and discontent, and so many severe remarks, as to give the impression that he considered himself a peculiarly ill-used squirrel in having to “eat their old grub,” as he very unceremoniously called it.  Papa Nutcracker, on these occasions, was often fiercely indignant, and poor little Mamma Nutcracker would shed tears, and beg her darling to be a little more reasonable; but the young gentleman seemed always to consider himself as the injured party.  Now nobody could tell why or wherefore Master Featherhead looked upon himself as injured or aggrieved, since he was living in a good hole, with plenty to eat, and without the least care or labour of his own; but he seemed rather to value himself upon being gloomy and dissatisfied.  While his parents and brothers and sisters were cheerfully racing up and down the branches, busy in their domestic toils, and laying up stores for the winter, Featherhead sat gloomily apart, declaring himself weary of existence, and feeling himself at liberty to quarrel with everybody and everything about him.  Nobody understood him, he said;—he was a squirrel of a peculiar nature, and needed peculiar treatment, and nobody treated him in a way that did not grate on the finer nerves of his feelings.  He had higher notions of existence than could be bounded by that old rotten hole in a hollow tree; he had thoughts that soared far above the miserable, petty details of every-day life, and he could not and would not bring down these soaring aspirations to the contemptible toil of laying up a few chestnuts or hickory-nuts for winter.  “Depend upon it, my dear,” said Mrs. Nutcracker solemnly, “that fellow must be a genius.”  “Fiddlestick on his genius!” said old Mr. Nutcracker; “what does he _do_?”  “Oh, nothing, of course; that’s one of the first marks of genius. Geniuses, you know, never can come down to common life.”  “He eats enough for any two,” remarked old Nutcracker, “and he never helps to gather nuts.”  “My dear, ask Parson Too-whit.  He has conversed with him, and quite agrees with me that he says very uncommon things for a squirrel of his age; he has such fine feelings,—so much above those of the common crowd.”  “Fine feelings be hanged!” said old Nutcracker.  “When a fellow eats all the nuts that his mother gives him, and then grumbles at her, I don’t believe much in his fine feelings.  Why don’t he set himself about something?  I’m going to tell my fine young gentleman that, if he doesn’t behave himself, I’ll tumble him out of the nest, neck and crop, and see if hunger won’t do something towards bringing down his fine airs.”  But then Mrs. Nutcracker fell on her husband’s neck with both paws, and wept, and besought him so piteously to have patience with her darling, that old Nutcracker, who was himself a soft-hearted old squirrel, was prevailed upon to put up with the airs and graces of his young scapegrace a little longer; and secretly in his silly old heart he revolved the question whether possibly it might not be that a great genius was actually to come of his household.  The Nutcrackers belonged to the old-established race of the Grays, but they were sociable, friendly people, and kept on the best of terms with all branches of the Nutcracker family.  The Chipmunks of Chipmunk Hollow were a very lively, cheerful, sociable race, and on the very best of terms with the Nutcracker Grays.  Young Tip Chipmunk, the oldest son, was in all respects a perfect contrast to Master Featherhead.  He was always lively and cheerful, and so very alert in providing for the family, that old Mr. and Mrs. Chipmunk had very little care, but could sit sociably at the door of their hole and chat with neighbours, quite sure that Tip would bring everything out right for them, and have plenty laid up for winter.  Now Featherhead took it upon him, for some reason or other, to look down upon Tip Chipmunk, and on every occasion to disparage him in the social circle, as a very common kind of squirrel, with whom it would be best not to associate too freely.  “My dear,” said Mrs. Nutcracker one day, when he was expressing these ideas, “it seems to me that you are too hard on poor Tip; he is a most excellent son and brother, and I wish you would be civil to him.”  “Oh, I don’t doubt that Tip is _good_ enough,” said Featherhead carelessly; “but then he is so very common! he hasn’t an idea in his skull above his nuts and his hole.  He is good-natured enough, to be sure,—these very ordinary people often are good-natured,—but he wants manner; he has really no manner at all; and as to the deeper feelings, Tip hasn’t the remotest idea of them.  I mean always to be civil to Tip when he comes in my way, but I think the less we see of that sort of people the better; and I hope, mother, you won’t invite the Chipmunks at Christmas,—these family dinners are such a bore!”  “But, my dear, your father thinks a great deal of the Chipmunks; and it is an old family custom to have all the relatives here at Christmas.”  “And an awful bore it is!  Why must people of refinement and elevation be forever tied down because of some distant relationship?  Now there are our cousins the High-Flyers,—if we could get them, there would be some sense in it.  Young Whisk rather promised me for Christmas; but it’s seldom now you can get a flying squirrel to show himself in our parts, and if we are intimate with the Chipmunks it isn’t to be expected.”  “Confound him for a puppy!” said old Nutcracker, when his wife repeated these sayings to him.  “Featherhead is a fool.  Common, forsooth!  I wish good, industrious, painstaking sons like Tip Chipmunk _were_ common.  For my part, I find these uncommon people the most tiresome.  They are not content with letting us carry the whole load, but they sit on it, and scold at us while we carry them.”  But old Mr. Nutcracker, like many other good old gentlemen squirrels, found that Christmas dinners and other things were apt to go as his wife said, and his wife was apt to go as young Featherhead said; and so, when Christmas came, the Chipmunks were not invited, for the first time in many years.  The Chipmunks, however, took all pleasantly, and accepted poor old Mrs. Nutcracker’s awkward apologies with the best possible grace; and young Tip looked in on Christmas morning with the compliments of the season and a few beech-nuts, which he had secured as a great dainty.  The fact was, that Tip’s little striped fur coat was so filled up and overflowing with cheerful good-will to all, that he never could be made to understand that any of his relations could want to cut him; and therefore Featherhead looked down on him with contempt, and said he had no tact, and couldn’t see when he was not wanted.  It was wonderful to see how, by means of persisting in remarks like these, young Featherhead at last got all his family to look up to him as something uncommon.  Though he added nothing to the family, and required more to be done for him than all the others put together,—though he showed not the smallest real perseverance or ability in anything useful,—yet somehow all his brothers and sisters, and his poor foolish old mother, got into a way of regarding him as something wonderful, and delighting in his sharp sayings as if they had been the wisest things in the world.  But at last old papa declared that it was time for Featherhead to settle himself to some business in life, roundly declaring that he could not always have him as a hanger-on in the paternal hole.  “What are you going to do, my boy?” said Tip Chipmunk to him one day. “We are driving now a thriving trade in hickory-nuts, and if you would like to join us—”  “Thank you,” said Featherhead; “but I confess I have no fancy for anything so slow as the hickory trade; I never was made to grub and delve in that way.”  The fact was that Featherhead had lately been forming alliances such as no reputable squirrel should even think of.  He had more than once been seen going out evenings with the Rats of Rat Hollow,—a race whose reputation for honesty was more than doubtful.  The fact was, further, that old Longtooth Rat, an old sharper and money-lender, had long had his eye on Featherhead as just about silly enough for their purposes,—engaging him in what he called a speculation, but which was neither more nor less than downright stealing.  Near by the chestnut-tree where Nutcracker Lodge was situated was a large barn filled with corn and grain, besides many bushels of hazel-nuts, chestnuts, and walnuts.  Now old Longtooth proposed to young Featherhead that he should nibble a passage into this loft, and there establish himself in the commission business, passing the nuts and corn to him as he wanted them.  Old Longtooth knew what he was about in the proposal, for he had heard talk of a brisk Scotch terrier that was about to be bought to keep the rats from the grain; but you may be sure he kept his knowledge to himself, so that Featherhead was none the wiser for it.  “The nonsense of fellows like Tip Chipmunk!” said Featherhead to his admiring brothers and sisters—“the perfectly stupid nonsense!  There he goes, delving and poking, picking up a nut here and a grain there, when _I_ step into property at once.”  “But I hope, my son, you are careful to be honest in your dealings,” said old Nutcracker, who was a very moral squirrel.  With that, young Featherhead threw his tail saucily over one shoulder, winked knowingly at his brothers, and said, “Certainly, sir!  If honesty consists in getting what you can while it is going, I mean to be honest.”  Very soon Featherhead appeared to his admiring companions in the height of prosperity.  He had a splendid hole in the midst of a heap of chestnuts, and he literally seemed to be rolling in wealth; he never came home without showering lavish gifts on his mother and sisters; he wore his tail over his back with a buckish air, and patronized Tip Chipmunk with a gracious nod whenever he met him, and thought that the world was going well with him.  But one luckless day, as Featherhead was lolling in his hole, up came two boys with the friskiest, wiriest Scotch terrier you ever saw.  His eyes blazed like torches, and poor Featherhead’s heart died within him as he heard the boys say, “Now we’ll see if we can’t catch the rascal that eats our grain.”                        [Picture: Enemies in waiting]  Featherhead tried to slink out at the hole he had gnawed to come in by, but found it stopped.  “Oh, you are there, are you, mister?” said the boy.  “Well, you don’t get out; and now for a chase!”  And, sure enough, poor Featherhead ran distracted with terror up and down, through the bundles of hay, between barrels, and over casks, but with the barking terrier ever at his heels, and the boys running, shouting, and cheering his pursuer on.  He was glad at last to escape through a crack, though he left half of his fine brush behind him; for Master Wasp the terrier made a snap at it just as he was going, and cleaned all the hair off of it, so that it was bare as a rat’s tail.  Poor Featherhead limped off, bruised and beaten and bedraggled, with the boys and dog still after him; and they would have caught him, after all, if Tip Chipmunk’s hole had not stood hospitably open to receive him.  Tip took him in, like a good-natured fellow as he was, and took the best of care of him; but the glory of Featherhead’s tail had departed for ever. He had sprained his left paw, and got a chronic rheumatism, and the fright and fatigue which he had gone through had broken up his constitution, so that he never again could be what he had been; but, Tip gave him a situation as under-clerk in his establishment, and from that time he was a sadder and a wiser squirrel than he ever had been before.     _THE HISTORY OF TIP-TOP_.   UNDER the window of a certain pretty little cottage there grew a great old apple-tree, which in the spring had thousands and thousands of lovely pink blossoms on it, and in the autumn had about half as many bright red apples as it had blossoms in the spring.  The nursery of this cottage was a little bower of a room, papered with mossy-green paper, and curtained with white muslin; and here five little children used to come, in their white nightgowns, to be dressed and have their hair brushed and curled every morning.  First, there were Alice and Mary, bright-eyed, laughing little girls, of seven and eight years; and then came stout little Jamie, and Charlie; and finally little Puss, whose real name was Ellen, but who was called Puss, and Pussy, and Birdie, and Toddlie, and any other pet name that came to mind.  Now it used to happen, every morning, that the five little heads would be peeping out of the window, together, into the flowery boughs of the apple-tree; and the reason was this.  A pair of robins had built a very pretty, smooth-lined nest in a fork of the limb that came directly under the window, and the building of this nest had been superintended, day by day, by the five pairs of bright eyes of these five children.  The robins at first had been rather shy of this inspection; but as they got better acquainted, they seemed to think no more of the little curly heads in the window than of the pink blossoms about them, or the daisies and buttercups at the foot of the tree.  All the little hands were forward to help; some threw out flossy bits of cotton,—for which, we grieve to say, Charlie had cut a hole in the crib quilt,—and some threw out bits of thread and yarn, and Allie ravelled out a considerable piece from one of her garters, which she threw out as a contribution; and they exulted in seeing the skill with which the little builders wove everything in.  “Little birds, little birds,” they would say, “you shall be kept warm, for we have given you cotton out of our crib quilt, and yarn out of our stockings.”  Nay, so far did this generosity proceed, that Charlie cut a flossy, golden curl from Toddlie’s head and threw it out; and when the birds caught it up the whole flock laughed to see Toddlie’s golden hair figuring in a bird’s-nest.  When the little thing was finished, it was so neat, and trim, and workman-like, that the children all exulted over it, and called it “our nest,” and the two robins they called “our birds.”  But wonderful was the joy when the little eyes, opening one morning, saw in the nest a beautiful pale-green egg; and the joy grew from day to day, for every day there came another egg, and so on till there were five little eggs; and then the oldest girl, Alice, said, “There are five eggs: that makes one for each of us, and each of us will have a little bird by-and-by;”—at which all the children laughed and jumped for glee.  When the five little eggs were all laid, the mother-bird began to sit on them; and at any time of day or night, when a little head peeped out of the nursery window, might be seen a round, bright, patient pair of bird’s eyes contentedly waiting for the young birds to come.  It seemed a long time for the children to wait; but every day they put some bread and cake from their luncheon on the window-sill, so that the birds might have something to eat; but still there she was, patiently sitting!                    [Picture: The Nest in the Apple-Tree]  “How long, long, long she waits!” said Jamie impatiently.  “I don’t believe she’s ever going to hatch.”  “Oh, yes she is!” said grave little Alice.  “Jamie, you don’t understand about these things; it takes a long, long time to hatch eggs.  Old Sam says his hens sit three weeks;—only think, almost a month!”  Three weeks looked a long time to the five bright pairs of little watching eyes; but Jamie said the eggs were so much smaller than hens’ eggs that it wouldn’t take so long to hatch them, he knew.  Jamie always thought he knew all about everything, and was so sure of it that he rather took the lead among the children.  But one morning, when they pushed their five heads out of the window, the round, patient little bird-eyes were gone, and there seemed to be nothing in the nest but a bunch of something hairy.  Upon this they all cried out, “O mamma, _do_ come here! the bird is gone and left her nest?”  And when they cried out, they saw five wide little red mouths open in the nest, and saw that the hairy bunch of stuff was indeed the first of five little birds.  “They are dreadful-looking things,” said Mary; “I didn’t know that little birds began by looking so badly.”  “They seem to be all mouth,” said Jamie.  “We must feed them,” said Charlie.—“Here, little birds, here’s some gingerbread for you,” he said; and he threw a bit of his gingerbread, which fortunately only hit the nest on the outside, and fell down among the buttercups, where two crickets made a meal of it, and agreed that it was as excellent gingerbread as if old Mother Cricket herself had made it.  “Take care, Charlie,” said his mamma; “we do not know enough to feed young birds.  We must leave that to their papa and mamma, who probably started out bright and early in the morning to get breakfast for them.”  Sure enough, while they were speaking, back came Mr. and Mrs. Robin, whirring through the green shadows of the apple tree; and thereupon all the five little red mouths flew open, and the birds put something into each.  It was great amusement, after this, to watch the daily feeding of the little birds, and to observe how, when not feeding them, the mother sat brooding on the nest, warming them under her soft wings, while the father-bird sat on the topmost bough of the apple-tree and sang to them. In time they grew and grew, and, instead of a nest full of little red mouths, there was a nest full of little, fat, speckled robins, with round, bright, cunning eyes, just like their parents; and the children began to talk together about their birds.  “I’m going to give my robin a name,” said Mary.  “I call him Brown-Eyes.”  “And I call mine Tip-Top,” said Jamie, “because I know he’ll be a tip-top bird.”  “And I call mine Singer,” said Alice.  “I ’all mine Toddy,” said little Toddlie, who would not be behindhand in anything that was going on.  “Hurrah for Toddlie!” said Charlie; “hers is the best of all.  For my part, I call mine Speckle.”  So then the birds were all made separate characters by having each a separate name given it.  Brown-Eyes, Tip-Top, Singer, Toddy, and Speckle made, as they grew bigger, a very crowded nestful of birds.  Now the children had early been taught to say in a little hymn:—      “Birds in their little nests agree;        And ’tis a shameful sight     When children of one family        Fall out, and chide, and fight;”—  and they thought anything really written and printed in a hymn must be true; therefore they were very much astonished to see, from day to day, that _their_ little birds in their nest did _not_ agree.  Tip-Top was the biggest and strongest bird, and he was always shuffling and crowding the others, and clamouring for the most food; and when Mrs. Robin came in with a nice bit of anything, Tip-Top’s red mouth opened so wide, and he was so noisy, that one would think the nest was all his. His mother used to correct him for these gluttonous ways, and sometimes made him wait till all the rest were helped before she gave him a mouthful; but he generally revenged himself in her absence by crowding the others and making the nest generally uncomfortable.  Speckle, however, was a bird of spirit, and he used to peck at Tip-Top; so they would sometimes have a regular sparring-match across poor Brown-Eyes, who was a meek, tender little fellow, and would sit winking and blinking in fear while his big brothers quarrelled.  As to Toddy and Singer, they turned out to be sister birds, and showed quite a feminine talent for chattering; they used to scold their badly behaving brothers in a way that made the nest quite lively.  On the whole Mr. and Mrs. Robin did not find their family circle the peaceable place the poet represents.  “I say,” said Tip-Top one day to them, “this old nest is a dull, mean, crowded hole, and it’s quite time some of us were out of it.  Just give us lessons in flying, won’t you? and let us go.”  “My dear boy,” said Mother Robin, “we shall teach you to fly as soon as your wings are strong enough.”  “You are a very little bird,” said his father, “and ought to be good and obedient, and wait patiently till your wing-feathers grow; and then you can soar away to some purpose.”  “Wait for my wing-feathers?  Humbug!” Tip-Top would say, as he sat balancing with his little short tail on the edge of the nest, and looking down through the grass and clover-heads below, and up into the blue clouds above.  “Father and mother are slow old birds; they keep a fellow back with their confounded notions.  If they don’t hurry up, I’ll take matters into my own claws, and be off some day before they know it.  Look at those swallows, skimming and diving through the blue air!  That’s the way I want to do.”  “But, dear brother, the way to learn to do that is to be good and obedient while we are little, and wait till our parents think it best for us to begin.”  “Shut up your preaching,” said Tip-Top; “what do you girls know of flying?”  “About as much as you,” said Speckle.  “However, I’m sure I don’t care how soon you take yourself off, for you take up more room than all the rest put together.”  “You mind yourself, Master Speckle, or you’ll get something you don’t like,” said Tip-Top, still strutting in a very cavalier way on the edge of the nest, and sticking up his little short tail quite valiantly.  “O my darlings,” said their mamma, now fluttering home, “cannot I ever teach you to live in love?”  “It’s all Tip-Top’s fault,” screamed the other birds in a flutter.  “My fault?  Of course, everything in this nest that goes wrong is laid to me,” said Tip-Top; “and I’ll leave it to anybody, now, if I crowd anybody.  I’ve been sitting outside, on the very edge of the nest, and there’s Speckle has got my place.”  “Who wants your place?” said Speckle.  “I’m sure you can come in, if you please.”  “My dear boy,” said the mother, “do go into the nest and be a good little bird, and then you will be happy.”  “That’s always the talk,” said Tip-Top.  “I’m too big for the nest, and I want to see the world.  It’s full of beautiful things, I know.  Now there’s the most lovely creature, with bright eyes, that comes under the tree every day, and wants me to come down in the grass and play with her.”  “My son, my son, beware!” said the frightened mother; “that lovely-seeming creature is our dreadful enemy, the cat,—a horrid monster, with teeth and claws.”  At this, all the little birds shuddered and cuddled deeper in the nest; only Tip-Top in his heart disbelieved it.  “I’m too old a bird,” said he to himself, “to believe _that_ story; mother is chaffing me.  But I’ll show her that I can take care of myself.”  So the next morning, after the father and mother were gone, Tip-Top got on the edge of the nest again, and looked over and saw lovely Miss Pussy washing her face among the daisies under the tree, and her hair was sleek and white as the daisies, and her eyes were yellow and beautiful to behold, and she looked up to the tree bewitchingly, and said, “Little birds, little birds, come down; Pussy wants to play with you.”  “Only look at her!” said Tip-Top; “her eyes are like gold.”  “No, don’t look,” said Singer and Speckle.  “She will bewitch you, and then eat you up.”  “I’d like to see her try to eat me up,” said Tip-Top, again balancing his short tail over the nest.  “Just as if she would.  She’s just the nicest, most innocent creature going, and only wants us to have fun.  We never do have any fun in this old nest!”  Then the yellow eyes below shot a bewildering light into Tip-Top’s eyes, and a voice sounded sweet as silver: “Little birds, little birds, come down; Pussy wants to play with you.”  “Her paws are as white as velvet,” said Tip-Top, “and so soft!  I don’t believe she has any claws.”  “Don’t go, brother, don’t!” screamed both sisters.  All we know about it is, that a moment after a direful scream was heard from the nursery window.  “O mamma, mamma, do come here!  Tip-Top’s fallen out of the nest, and the cat has got him!”  Away ran Pussy with foolish little Tip-Top in her mouth, and he squeaked dolefully when he felt her sharp teeth.  Wicked Miss Pussy had no mind to eat him at once; she meant just as she said, to “play with him.”  So she ran off to a private place among the currant-bushes, while all the little curly heads were scattered up and down looking for her.  Did you ever see a cat play with a bird or a mouse?  She sets it down, and seems to go off and leave it; but the moment it makes the first movement to get away,—pounce! she springs on it, and shakes it in her mouth; and so she teases and tantalizes it, till she gets ready to kill and eat it.  I can’t say why she does it, except that it is a cat’s nature; and it is a very bad nature for foolish young robins to get acquainted with.  “Oh, where is he? where is he?  Do find my poor Tip-Top,” said Jamie, crying as loud as he could scream.  “I’ll kill that horrid cat,—I’ll kill her!”                      [Picture: Tip-Top in bad Company]  Mr. and Mrs. Robin, who had come home meantime, joined their plaintive chirping to the general confusion; and Mrs. Robin’s bright eyes soon discovered her poor little son, where Pussy was patting and rolling him from one paw to the other under the currant-bushes; and settling on the bush above, she called the little folks to the spot by her cries.  Jamie plunged under the bush, and caught the cat with luckless Tip-Top in her mouth; and, with one or two good thumps, he obliged her to let him go.  Tip-Top was not dead, but in a sadly draggled and torn state.  Some of his feathers were torn out, and one of his wings was broken, and hung down in a melancholy way.  “Oh, what _shall_ we do for him?  He will die.  Poor Tip-Top!” said the children.  “Let’s put him back into the nest, children,” said mamma.  “His mother will know best what to do with him.”  So a ladder was got, and papa climbed up and put poor Tip-Top safely into the nest.  The cat had shaken all the nonsense well out of him; he was a dreadfully humbled young robin.  The time came at last when all the other birds in the nest learned to fly, and fluttered and flew about everywhere; but poor melancholy Tip-Top was still confined to the nest with a broken wing.  Finally, _as_ it became evident that it would be long before he could fly, Jamie took him out of the nest, and made a nice little cage for him, and used to feed him every day, and he would hop about and seem tolerably contented; but it was evident that he would be a lame-winged robin all his days.                      [Picture: Feeding the lame Robin]  Jamie’s mother told him that Tip-Top’s history was an allegory.  “I don’t know what you mean, mamma,” said Jamie.  “When something in a bird’s life is like something in a boy’s life, or when a story is similar in its meaning to reality, we call it an allegory.  Little boys, when they are about half grown up, sometimes do just as Tip-Top did.  They are in a great hurry to get away from home into the great world; and then temptation comes, with bright eyes and smooth velvet paws, and promises them fun; and they go to bad places; they get to smoking, and then to drinking; and, finally, the bad habit gets them in its teeth and claws, and plays with them as a cat does with a mouse.  They try to reform, just as your robin tried to get away from the cat; but their bad habits pounce on them and drag them back.  And so, when the time comes that they want to begin life, they are miserable, broken-down creatures, like your broken-winged robin.  “So, Jamie, remember, and don’t try to be a man before your time, and let your parents judge for you while you are young; and never believe in any soft white Pussy, with golden eyes, that comes and wants to tempt you to come down and play with her.  If a big boy offers to teach you to smoke a cigar, that is Pussy.  If a boy wants you to go into a billiard-saloon, that is Pussy.  If a boy wants you to learn to drink anything with spirit in it, however sweetened and disguised, remember Pussy is there.  And Pussy’s claws are long, and Pussy’s teeth are strong; and if she gives you one shake in your youth, you will be like a broken-winged robin all your days.”     _MISS KATY-DID AND MISS CRICKET_.   MISS KATY-DID sat on the branch of a flowering azalea, in her best suit of fine green and silver, with wings of point-lace from Mother Nature’s finest web.  Miss Katy was in the very highest possible spirits, because her gallant cousin, Colonel Katy-did, had looked in to make her a morning visit.  It was a fine morning, too, which goes for as much among the Katy-dids as among men and women.  It was, in fact, a morning that Miss Katy thought must have been made on purpose for her to enjoy herself in.  There had been a patter of rain the night before, which had kept the leaves awake talking to each other till nearly morning; but by dawn the small winds had blown brisk little puffs, and whisked the heavens clear and bright with their tiny wings, as you have seen Susan
