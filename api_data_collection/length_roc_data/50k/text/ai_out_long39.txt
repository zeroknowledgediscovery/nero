THE BLOODLESS HEX
By Ellison Grimm
Chapter One: The Red Thread

Fog hung like gauze over the crooked spires of Hallowmere, as if the town itself were trying to hide from the dawn. A bell tolled somewhere, though the hour was wrong and the sound too thin, too distant, as if it passed through layers of cotton before reaching the ear. In the uppermost room of an ancient, leaning townhouse, a warlock sat rigidly still, watching a single drop of blood inch down the side of a porcelain teacup.

It was not his blood.

“Out,” whispered Elric, voice barely audible above the ticking of the long-dead grandfather clock in the corner. His hands trembled, long fingers curled with restraint. “Out, you damned thing.”

The drop persisted, defying his command. It meandered lazily toward the lip of the saucer, thick and glistening. It didn’t matter that the blood came from a clumsy cut on the apprentice’s finger. It was blood. And Elric Varn was very, very afraid of blood.

“Master Varn?” The girl’s voice pierced his dread. “Should I fetch a cloth?”

“Out,” he repeated. “Just—go. Fetch nothing. Take the cup with you. All of it.”

Marla hesitated. She had only arrived in Hallowmere two weeks ago, a curious, sharp-eyed girl of fifteen who claimed her dreams were haunted by books that whispered incantations. She’d come to study magic under Elric, unaware of his peculiar affliction. Or perhaps she had known and was testing him—she had the look of someone who enjoyed unraveling things.

“I’ll take it,” she said finally, and gathered the teacup, her own bleeding finger wrapped hastily in her sleeve. The door shut behind her with a tired creak.

Elric exhaled sharply, realizing he had been holding his breath.

He rose with effort and moved to the window. Outside, the fog was giving way to the sallow light of morning, casting everything in an off-kilter pallor. The cobbled streets gleamed with moisture, and here and there the figures of early risers moved like shadows caught in amber.

Elric touched his temple. The flesh there throbbed faintly, an echo of some deeper pain. The visions were returning. Blood in cups. Blood on mirrors. A well filled with blood. And always the laughter—mocking, lilting, impossible to locate.

He had to do something.

In the town square, a procession was forming. Black banners, embroidered with silver vines, flapped without wind. A group of cloaked figures gathered near the base of the old gallows, now draped in white silk. They were the Silents, members of a reclusive order that spoke only through gestures. Their presence here was rare, and never good.

Marla watched from the edge of the crowd. Her bandaged finger pulsed where the needle had pricked her. She scanned the square for Elric, but the warlock was not one for public appearances. Especially not at ceremonies that might involve even the slightest bloodletting.

The Mayor, a tall woman with a face like a stern candle, raised her hands. “Citizens of Hallowmere,” she began. “This day marks the tenth year since the Crimson Collapse. Let us bow our heads in remembrance.”

Heads lowered. Marla did not bow. Her eyes flicked toward the platform where a man in iron manacles knelt. He was young, perhaps nineteen, and his eyes were glassy with either drug or despair.

“By decree of the Ninefold Tribunal, Elias Quarn is condemned,” the Mayor continued. “His blood bears the Mark of the Splinter, and shall be spilt to cleanse the air and warn the dark.”

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Elias struggled against his bonds. The Silents stepped forward, a silver knife cradled like a holy relic between two palms.

Marla felt sick.

Then the fog thickened. Not mist. Not weather.

Magic.

A gust scattered the banners. People gasped and stumbled. And with a sound like a page tearing from a book, Elric Varn appeared atop the gallows platform.

“Stop,” he said, voice flat.

The Silents froze, the knife suspended in air. The Mayor looked outraged.

“This is Tribunal business, Varn,” she snapped. “You will not interfere.”

“I will,” Elric said, “because the blood of this boy is corrupted, yes—but not by choice. Something has returned. Something from the old wood.”

The crowd shifted uneasily. Even the Silents looked to one another.

Elric walked forward carefully, his eyes on the knife. “Let me take him.”

“On whose authority?”

“Mine.” He extended his hand. “And by pact with the Diaphanous Covenant.”

Gasps again. The Mayor turned pale.

“You haven’t invoked that name in a decade,” she said.

“I know,” Elric replied, and winced. The throb in his temple surged. “But it’s come again. The Thread is bleeding.”

Elias Quarn sat in Elric’s study later that night, wrapped in a blanket and silence. He had not spoken since his release. Marla watched him from a stool by the hearth, her curiosity tempered by caution. The boy’s eyes flicked constantly toward the corners of the room, as if something waited just beyond the candlelight.

“Who gave you the mark?” Elric asked.

Elias didn’t answer.

“Elric,” Marla said quietly. “Look at this.”

She held up a sliver of parchment she’d found in Elias’s boot. It was old, brittle, and written in a cramped, spiraling hand. The letters twisted as if alive.

Elric’s lips pressed thin. “Where did you get this?” he asked Elias.

“I don’t remember,” the boy whispered. “I found it, maybe. Or it found me. There was a well. North of the Karklin pass. I heard… something.”

Marla’s fingers went cold. “You heard whispering?”

Elias nodded. “It said my blood was a gate. It showed me a face—no eyes, only mouths. I thought I dreamed it.”

Elric took the parchment and studied it. His skin went visibly pale.

“This is a bloodcall,” he said. “Old magic. Forbidden magic. It shouldn’t exist anymore.”

“But it does,” Marla said.

Elric turned to the fire and threw the parchment in. Flames swallowed it greedily, flickering green for a moment.

“I will take you north,” he told Elias. “To the well. If it’s speaking again, we must hear what it says.”

“But you hate blood,” Marla said.

“I do,” Elric replied. “But I hate what comes from blood left unlistened to even more.”

The road to Karklin wound through fields of pale wheat and gnarled black trees. The three travelers moved quietly, each preoccupied. Elias murmured in his sleep, though he never remembered doing so. Marla wrote in her journal, recording symbols she didn’t understand. And Elric felt the pressure behind his eyes grow worse with every mile.

They reached the well at dusk.

It was hidden in a copse of dead ash trees, the stones around it sunk with time and moss. A rope still hung from the beam above, though the bucket had long since rotted away. Flies buzzed, though there was no water to attract them.

Elias stepped forward and knelt beside the well. “It’s down there,” he said.

Marla held her breath.

Elric looked. At first, only darkness. Then—a glint. Red. Moving.

“Back,” Elric said. “Now.”

But it was too late. The rope lashed out like a living thing and wrapped around Elias’s wrist. Blood spurted as the skin split. He screamed, but did not resist. His eyes were wide and unblinking.

“Elric!” Marla shouted.

The warlock moved forward, mouth already shaping a spell. “Unbind the tether, break the thread, silence what should not have fled—”

The well howled.

A sound like a thousand mouths moaning. Wind surged from the pit. Symbols burst into light around its rim, written in blood, not ink. Elias was pulled to the edge, his feet dragging grooves in the dirt.

Then—Elric cut the rope with a blade of raw glyph-light. The tether snapped. Elias fell back, unconscious. The well screamed one final time, then fell silent.

Only then did Elric notice the blood on his hands. Thick, warm, real.

He stumbled away, retching.

Elric Varn did not sleep that night. He sat in the farthest corner of the small cabin they had taken shelter in, a threadbare wool blanket wrapped tight around his shoulders like armor. Outside, the wind muttered through the skeleton trees, and the dying embers of the fire cast sickly shadows that crawled like fingers across the walls. His gaze fixed on his palms—scrubbed raw and red, the skin nearly torn from the effort of cleansing them. Still he saw it: blood, gleaming and persistent, a memory that clung to his flesh like smoke.

The whispering had not stopped. Even now, it dripped between the cracks of his thoughts, curling behind his ears, murmuring in a tongue older than bone. Not words, not truly—more like impressions, emotion wrapped in the shape of language. It had started the moment he touched the blood on Elias’s arm. And now it would not let go.

He thought of running. Of disappearing back into the winding alleys of Hallowmere or deeper still, into the wildlands where magic could be muffled and minds forgotten. But the rope—the bloodcall—the well—these things had returned. That meant the seal had weakened. The old seals. And that meant something was pushing from the other side.

“Are you hearing it too?”

Marla’s voice was low, but not hesitant. She stood in the doorway to the cabin, her frame outlined by moonlight. Her long coat was dusted with frost, and a satchel bulged at her hip. She had gone out for firewood, but the bundle in her arms was sparse—more bark than branches.

Elric nodded slowly, his mouth dry. “You shouldn’t be able to yet.”

“I’m not like you.” She crossed the room and dropped the wood into the hearth, scattering ash. “Or like him.”

Elric raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.

Marla crouched, striking a flint to spark the tinder. The fire hissed and flared, throwing the light back into Elric’s face. He winced. “What do you mean?”

“I dream in runes,” she said without turning. “Not words. Shapes. Symbols. When Elias screamed, I saw one of them flash in my head. Bright and hot. The same symbol that burned around the well.”

“You should have told me this before,” Elric said, rubbing his temple. “Those are signs of attunement. Dangerous signs.”

“Dangerous to who?” Marla asked, a sharp note in her voice. “You? Or to whatever’s leaking through that crack in the world?”

Elric stood, slowly. His legs ached with fatigue, but the firelight made him feel steadier. “To you, child. Attunement means the veil is thinner for you. Easier for things to slip through. Once they learn your name, they can wear your face.”

Marla stood too, her eyes locked to his. “Then teach me how to stop them.”

He looked away, jaw tense. “You assume it can be stopped.”

Behind them, Elias stirred on his pallet. A hoarse sound escaped his lips—half-moan, half-whisper. His eyes fluttered beneath closed lids, and sweat ran in small rivers down his cheeks. Marla crossed the room quickly and knelt beside him.

“He’s burning,” she said. “Do you have anything—feverroot, shadeleaf—”

Elric moved closer, examining the boy’s face. He was pale beneath the flush, the veins in his neck beginning to darken. Elric’s breath caught.

“He’s marked.”

Marla frowned. “What does that mean?”

Elric didn’t answer immediately. He reached into his satchel and pulled out a slender bone wand, etched with tiny glyphs. With careful precision, he touched the tip to Elias’s brow. The mark flared to life—a sigil in deep crimson, shaped like an eye with thorns for lashes. The skin beneath it cracked slightly, as if scorched from within.

“He was touched. Not just spoken to. They’ve laid claim.”

“Can you break it?”

Elric shook his head. “No. Not alone. This kind of sigil—it predates the Four Schools. Pre-Root magic. I’d need a circle, a conduit, and a tether to his memory. And even then, I’d only be scraping it off the surface. Not cleansing it.”

Marla sat back on her heels, frustration etched into every angle of her posture. “So what do we do? Leave him to rot?”

“No,” Elric said. “We bring him to the Wane.”

Marla blinked. “The Wane is a myth.”

“And so is a rope that drinks blood,” Elric replied. “But you saw that.”

By morning, the frost had stiffened into ice. The trees groaned under its weight, their limbs bending toward the earth as though supplicating. Elric wrapped Elias in thick quilts and secured him to the back of a small donkey they’d bartered from a hill farmer weeks prior. The animal blinked lazily, unaware it was now burdened with the fate of something ancient and terrible.

Marla walked ahead, guiding the way. She had taken to carving runes in the trunks of trees as they passed, claiming it helped her focus. Elric didn’t argue. The truth was, her symbols calmed him too. As though each carving disrupted the invisible net stretching over their path.

It took them three days to reach the edge of the Bone Forest, where the trees grew tall and pale and creaked even when there was no wind. The ground here was soft and black, and the smell of iron hung in the air like a warning. The Wane was said to lie within. Not a place, exactly, but a presence—a tear in the world, sealed long ago by a coven of witches who had traded their eyes for the spell.

They entered at dusk. The forest swallowed them whole.

Inside the Bone Forest, the rules changed.

Sound behaved oddly—echoing without cause, vanishing mid-note, returning minutes later as whispers behind their ears. Light bent and splintered through the trees, casting patterns that looked suspiciously like faces. And the paths—there were too many of them. Branching, doubling back, disappearing entirely when they turned to look again.

Elias mumbled continuously now. His fever had worsened, and his skin was taking on a bluish tint. The mark on his brow pulsed faintly, as if breathing.

“We’re being followed,” Marla said on the second night.

Elric nodded. “I know.”

He had sensed it since they entered—something old and aware, keeping pace just beyond sight. It did not make noise. It simply watched, and waited. If they stopped for too long, the trees leaned in.

“We need to find the hollow.”

Marla stared at him. “You said the Wane was just a tear. A spell.”

“It’s both,” Elric said. “And it sleeps in the hollow. Beneath the oldest tree. If the stories are true, the witches left a guardian there.”

“A guardian of a forbidden rift in reality,” she muttered. “Lovely.”

By midday on the fourth day, they found it.

The tree stood in a clearing devoid of wind, birds, or even insects. It was vast—its trunk wide enough to house a cottage, and its bark white as chalk. Around its base, carved into the ground itself, was a spiral of runes etched in silver.

Elric approached slowly, eyes wary.

“You sure?” Marla asked, holding Elias’s reins.

“No,” Elric admitted. “But we’re out of time.”

He stepped into the circle.

The runes flared, not with light—but with absence. A coldness so pure it erased warmth. Elric fell to his knees, teeth chattering. Then—it spoke.

You fear the river. But the river knows you.

Elric closed his eyes. “I seek release for the marked.”

You seek to unmake a thread already spun. It frays. It sings. It bleeds.

A figure emerged from behind the tree.

It was not human. Not anymore. Its skin was bark, eyes hollow, voice like wind between teeth.

“The Wane accepts,” it said aloud, and held out a hand. “But payment is blood.”

Elric’s heart seized.

Marla stepped forward. “Take mine.”

The guardian looked at her. “Yours is too loud.”

Elric stood shakily. “Then take mine. But don’t show it to me.”

The guardian nodded once.

And with a blade of light so thin it cast no shadow, it made the cut.

Elric did not scream.

He could not.

His world had turned red.

Chapter Two: Names in the Dark

The pain left him hollow.

Elric came back to himself sometime after the bleeding stopped. The world swam in and out of focus, wrapped in waves of nausea and shivering cold. He lay on his side at the base of the ancient tree, the wound across his palm bandaged in moss that pulsed faintly with magic. Above him, the canopy had shifted—it was no longer made of leaves but threads, crisscrossing like the weaving of some great loom. They glistened in a color he could not name, and shimmered when he tried to focus on any single one. The Wane had accepted the offering. For now.

He sat up slowly, feeling as though his limbs were filled with broken glass. A fire crackled nearby, small but steady, casting enough light to keep the shadows from slithering too close. Marla was seated on a rock with her knees drawn up to her chest, watching him intently. Her eyes were ringed with exhaustion, but her posture was tense, alert.

“You’re alive,” she said, voice flat.

“Disappointed?”

“No.” She stood and dusted her coat. “Relieved. Just trying not to act like it.”

Elric smiled weakly. “Good instinct.”

He turned to check on Elias. The boy lay still, wrapped in his quilt, the fever receded. The mark on his brow had faded, replaced by a faint scar that throbbed rhythmically, as if breathing.

“It worked?” Elric asked.

“For now,” Marla said. “The guardian said the mark is buried, not broken. You gave it a price it couldn’t refuse.”

Elric nodded, though the idea made his stomach twist. “Magic that demands blood always wants more. This buys us time. That’s all.”

“We need more than time,” she said. “We need answers. What is this thing that’s calling from the other side? And why Elias?”

Elric reached for his pack and pulled out a folded map, fingers fumbling. His hands were still trembling. “We go east. To Glaiveport. There’s a woman there—Irabeth Crow. She studies forbidden cartography.”

Marla tilted her head. “Maps?”

“Maps of things that no longer exist,” he said. “Or that shouldn’t exist. If the bloodcall is tied to a forgotten place—or a sealed one—she’ll know where to look.”

They set off before dawn. The Bone Forest let them leave.

Glaiveport was not a city so much as a carcass repurposed into commerce. Built on the back of a colossal beast that had died in ancient times—some said a leviathan, others a god—the city’s spires grew from bones, its alleys twisted between ribs, and its markets sprawled across the broad flat planes of vertebrae.

Elric, Marla, and Elias arrived beneath a sky choked with gulls and coal smoke. The air stank of salt, sweat, and fish. Glaiveport pulsed with movement—sailors shouting in five languages, tinkers dragging carts filled with whispering stones, priests in bone masks handing out blessings for coin. Elias kept his hood pulled low and clutched Marla’s arm with white-knuckled fingers. He had not spoken since the forest.

They made their way through the Skullward—the northern district where scholars, outlaws, and those with no taste for daylight kept their rooms. Irabeth’s shop sat nestled between a shuttered plague apothecary and a brothel that catered exclusively to ghosts.

The door bore a sigil of reversal—an inverted compass with a crack through its center. Marla paused before it.

“Should I knock?” she asked.

“No,” Elric said, and pushed it open.

The shop smelled of parchment and mildew. Every wall was covered with maps: tattered ones, stitched ones, maps painted on animal hides and inscribed on plates of silver. Some pulsed faintly, as if remembering places now swallowed by time.

A woman with hair like a candle’s flame emerged from behind a curtain. Her left eye was glass, the right glittered with too much knowledge.

“Elric Varn,” she said, the corners of her mouth quirking. “You look like someone who’s seen the inside of a bone.”

“I have,” he replied, pulling off his gloves. “And it stared back.”

She squinted past him at Marla and Elias. “These your new apprentices? That one looks cracked.”

Elric nodded. “He’s marked. Was marked.”

“Unmarking always leaves splinters,” Irabeth muttered. She gestured them into the back room—a space half-lit by blue candles, where the air shimmered with latent wards.

Marla sat beside Elias while Elric handed Irabeth a sealed bone token—the price of consultation. She turned it in her fingers, sniffed it, then bit down.

“Genuine,” she said. “Pain-etched. What do you want?”

Elric unfolded a sketch Marla had made from memory—the symbol from Elias’s brow. “We’re looking for this. And where it came from.”

Irabeth studied it for a long moment. Then she reached into a drawer and pulled out a scroll bound in sinew. “You’re lucky. One of the last seekers came to me with the same mark.”

Elric froze. “When?”

“Three months ago. Didn’t give a name. Just a coin that screamed when I touched it. He left with a map that led to the Red Hollow, out past the Wyrmclutch hills.”

“The Hollow again,” Marla whispered. “It keeps coming up.”

Irabeth handed Elric the scroll. “He said the voices started after a dream. Said the blood was pulling him toward something older than history. I told him not to go. I doubt he listened.”

“Did he mention the Splinter?” Elric asked.

Irabeth shook her head. “But he bled when he spoke.”

That night, they stayed in a crumbling inn built into the curve of an old ribcage. The windows rattled when the tide changed, and the walls sweated salt. Marla sat near Elias’s bed, turning the scroll over in her lap. It was old—older than the seal on it—and yet the ink looked fresh, the leather warm.

“I don’t like this place,” she said.

“You don’t like most places,” Elric replied. He was brewing a mild sleep-draught in a cracked porcelain cup.

Marla scowled. “This place knows things. It watches.”

He passed her the cup. “Everything does, if you look long enough.”

Elias stirred.

He sat up abruptly, eyes wide. “I saw it again.”

Marla leaned forward. “What did you see?”

“It was… behind the threads. A shape. No eyes. Just… mouths. But not screaming. Praying.”

“To what?”

Elias shook his head. “To me. They were chanting my name. Over and over.”

Elric crossed the room in two strides. “That’s not possible.”

“They were holding something. A book, I think. The cover was wet.”

Marla’s voice was quiet. “Was it red?”

Elias nodded slowly.

The scroll snapped open of its own accord.

Runes flared across its surface, shifting like oil on water. Lines redrew themselves, roads reshaping into a spiral that led—not to the Red Hollow—but beneath it.

Elric stared at the map, throat dry.

“This isn’t a guide,” he said. “It’s a summoning.”

Marla looked at Elias.

Elias looked at nothing.

And the candlelight bent toward him, like gravity in reverse.

The innkeeper was gone by morning.

No trace, no note, not even a wrinkle in the rumpled bedsheets of the front room where he had slept each night. The only sign that he had ever existed was the small collection of keys left on the front counter, neatly stacked and warm to the touch as though someone had only just placed them there. Elric stared at the keys a moment longer than necessary. It was not that he cared particularly for the man himself—he had exchanged no more than ten words with him—but rather that the absence itself felt... constructed. As if someone had written him out of the space.

“We need to leave,” he muttered.

Marla was already packing her satchel. “Back to the Hollow?”

“No. We go to the Spiral Vein first. If this map is what I think it is, the Vein will tell us if the route has been altered.”

Elias stood at the window, motionless. The sky was overcast, and the sea looked bruised beneath the light. He hadn’t spoken since the dream—if it could be called that—and now simply watched the horizon with the blank stillness of someone waiting for an answer they were terrified to hear.

Marla joined Elric by the map scroll. “You said it was a summoning. Who is it calling?”

“Not who,” Elric said, rolling the parchment up tightly. “What.”

The Spiral Vein lay east of Glaiveport, hidden beneath the overgrown ruins of an old cathedral swallowed by ivy and erosion. The stones had once been white, but centuries of wind and salt had left them green and gray, blotched with creeping moss and the faint outlines of warding glyphs worn to obscurity.

They descended the spiral stair at midday. Each step creaked, though the stone itself was whole. The air grew cold, damp, thick with something that clung to the inside of the lungs. Elias coughed and rubbed his arms as they walked, the veins along his neck throbbing in slow, deliberate pulses.

“It’s down here,” he said suddenly, breaking his silence. “I can feel it.”

Marla looked to Elric. He nodded, urging them on.

The stair ended in a narrow chamber shaped like a funnel—walls curving up and in, as though trying to close over them. At its center was the Vein: a column of black stone carved in spirals so tight they seemed to move, even in stillness. Light didn’t reflect off its surface. It sank into it.

Elric approached it cautiously, reaching into his cloak for a small mirror etched with words in broken Latin. He held it out toward the Vein.

Nothing happened.

Then the mirror cracked.

A spiderweb fracture ran through the glass from corner to corner. Elric hissed, pulled his hand back, and dropped the mirror into his satchel.

“It’s already been opened,” he said grimly.

Marla touched the edge of the spiral. “What does that mean?”

“It means we’re not alone on this thread. Someone has gone ahead and laid claim to the path. We’ll be following a trail that doesn’t want to be followed.”

“Do we have a choice?”

Elric turned to her. “No. But I want you to understand what that means.”

“It means the road wants blood,” Marla said. “Same as everything else these days.”

Elias stepped forward. “They’ll be waiting for us at the Hollow.”

“Who?” Marla asked.

“The things that wear names. The ones who found me.”

They made camp that night in the broken archway of what might have once been a chapel. The stars above were unfamiliar—blotted by moving clouds and the faint shimmer of northern lights in shades of violet and gold. Marla slept with her dagger unsheathed beside her. Elric sat awake, feeding the fire as if its glow could keep the thoughts from rising.

Elias stirred again, twitching in his sleep. His lips moved, whispering syllables that didn’t belong to any human language. Elric recognized them all the same—tones from the Spiral, words not meant for the waking world.

He moved to the boy’s side and placed two fingers on his temple.

A sharp intake of breath—and suddenly, he was inside.

Not in Elias’s mind exactly, but near it. Close enough to feel the pull of the mark buried beneath his skin. It glowed now, fully visible in this shared dream-space, and spun slowly like a wheel made of bone. Around it danced figures, mouthless and eyeless, draped in robes that writhed independently from any breeze. Their hands held sigils, inverted from what Elric knew. These were not just invocations. They were un-namings—glyphs meant to undo, to unravel.

“You should not be here.”

The voice came from behind him, female, and hollow with age. Elric turned slowly.

She stood alone in the darkness, her eyes stitched shut with golden thread. Her mouth had been sealed with wax. But her voice echoed, pure and clear.

“You carry the stain of the Covenant. The Diaphanous will not protect you here.”

Elric stood straighter. “You’re a Remnant.”

“I am what remains when names are peeled away.”

“You were a Seer once. One of the Wane.”

She did not deny it. Instead, she stepped forward and extended a hand. “You seek to cut the thread. But the thread is you now.”

Elric felt his knees begin to buckle. The pressure behind his eyes pulsed, a familiar pain now with a new texture—like teeth gnawing gently on the inside of his skull.

“What is it they want?” he asked.

“Not want,” she whispered. “Need.”

The scene buckled. The dream shattered.

He woke gasping beside a cold fire. Marla was staring at him, eyes wide.

“You screamed.”

“I was elsewhere,” Elric said, wiping blood from his nose. “And not alone.”

Elias sat up, blinking. “I felt it too.”

By dawn, they resumed their path northeast.

The Red Hollow was not marked on any modern map. It existed in stories, whispered by waykeepers and cursed mariners—a place where threads unraveled and paths were eaten. Irabeth’s scroll showed it hidden beyond the salt flats of Quereen’s Mouth, nestled between the Shorn Hills and a fracture in the earth known as the Bleeding Ridge.

The terrain turned to ash-colored stone, dotted with spines of petrified trees. The further they traveled, the more distorted the land became. Hills curved in impossible ways, and shadows fell in directions that made no sense given the sun’s position.

On the second night, they found a cairn that had not been there before.

A ring of white stones, each bearing a different name.

Marla bent to read one. “It says ‘Varn.’”

Elric’s stomach turned. He checked another. “Marla.”

Another. “Elias.”

“These were laid by something watching us,” he said. “Not to guide. To warn.”

Or to promise, he thought, but did not say.

By the fourth day, they arrived.

The Red Hollow yawned before them like the mouth of a buried beast. It was not a place, not exactly. More a cavity in the world, where the laws of nature had frayed and folded inward. The ground here was not earth, but scar tissue. The wind carried voices that did not echo. The air was thick with colorless light.

In the center of the Hollow stood a pillar of flesh.

It pulsed, and from its base grew roots—veins, too many to count—spreading across the basin and digging deep into the ground. Elric stared in horror.

“It’s a heart,” he said. “A living heart.”

Elias moved toward it, trance-like.

“Elric!” Marla shouted, but the boy was already running.

Elric reached for a spell, fingers scribing a glyph of restraint in the air, but the sigil shattered as it formed.

The ground beneath Elias split open—and he fell.

Marla screamed.

Elric ran to the edge. Below, there was only darkness, and the sound of names being spoken by mouths that had no breath.

Chapter Three: The Mouth Below

The fall did not kill him.

Elias struck the darkness as though it were water, though there was no splash, no weightless drift. The light from above dwindled almost instantly, shrinking to a distant pinhole that pulsed like a weak star. He floated—no, hung—in an endless space with no gravity, no temperature, no boundary to speak of. Only the sound remained. A constant murmur of voices, layered and indistinct, as if hundreds of mouths were pressed just behind a veil, chanting names in the wrong direction.

His name.

Elias Quarn. Elias Quarn. Elias...

He tried to scream but his throat only produced silence. Not even the rasp of breath reached his ears. His body convulsed, not in pain, but in recoil—every nerve rebelling against the idea of existing in such a space. He clawed at the air, trying to find anything solid, but his limbs moved too slowly, dragged by invisible tendrils.

Then, something touched him.

Not skin. Not bone. But presence—a sensation like fingers, brushing gently across the back of his mind. He could feel it attempting to part him, to read him, not as a mind or a soul but as a scroll: a message written in blood, waiting to be unsealed.

The chanting stopped.

A single voice replaced it.

You are the ink. The page. The hand.

It had no tone, no gender, and it did not come from a location. It simply was. Around him, things began to stir—massive shapes twisting in the dark, things whose contours made his brain flinch. A jaw unhinged beneath him, wider than a cathedral, lined with teeth shaped like runes. It did not open. It was open, and always had been.

We found you.

Elias felt a warmth trickle down his brow. He reached up instinctively. Blood. The mark had reopened, and it burned as if something were pushing its way out.

Above, Marla paced the perimeter of the Hollow like a caged animal. Her face was pale, her lips drawn tight. The rope she had tied to her waist dangled into the chasm, but it had met no bottom. She knew Elric was thinking the same thing she was—if there was no bottom, then where had Elias gone?

Elric stood still, eyes closed, one hand hovering above the wound on his palm. He was attempting a tracing spell—one that would bind his own blood to Elias’s and draw a line between them. It was dangerous magic. The kind that didn’t simply find but joined. And if Elias was gone—truly gone—it might pull Elric in after him.

“You sure about this?” Marla asked.

“No,” he said, and let the drop of blood fall from his hand into the Hollow.

At first, nothing.

Then the rope tensed. Not tugged. Pulled.

Marla grabbed it instinctively. “He’s there.”

“No,” Elric said grimly. “Something’s there.”

The rope began to rise—not from being retrieved, but as though it were being returned. When it reached the edge, a bundle lay coiled at the end.

It was a book.

Leather-bound, stained. Still warm.

Marla bent to touch it but Elric stopped her. “Let me.”

He opened it carefully.

Inside, written in thick, looping script, was a single repeated line: I am the vessel. I am the thread. I am the gate.

Each line followed the last, but each was in a different hand. Some childlike, others ancient and scrawled with maddening precision. The final page was empty—except for a single smear of blood across its center.

“He’s still alive,” Elric said.

“You’re sure?”

“This blood hasn’t dried yet. It’s his. He’s writing now. Or being written.”

Marla looked back at the Hollow. “Then we need to go in after him.”

Elric’s silence stretched.

“You’re going, right?” she asked, voice rising. “You’re not going to leave him down there—”

“I didn’t say that.”

“Then what are we waiting for?”

Elric looked back at the beating heart in the center of the Hollow. “We need an anchor.”

The ritual took hours.

Elric carved runes in a circle around the lip of the Hollow, each drawn with his own blood diluted in ashwater. Marla stood at the center, eyes closed, chanting a binding litany to keep their spirits tethered. Elric would descend, but not physically. To send his flesh would be to feed it to whatever ruled the pit. Instead, he would send his mind—the thread of his soul—along the vein already formed between himself and Elias.

“Don’t break the circle,” he warned her. “No matter what you see. No matter what I say.”

She nodded.

He sat cross-legged, palms up, breath slow. The wind died. The Hollow quieted.

Then he was falling.

This time, he did not enter the same place Elias had. His descent was filtered by intent, sharpened by purpose. The void did not swallow him—it invited him, recognizing the blood pact.

He arrived in a library.

No walls. No floor. Only endless shelves of books, suspended in void. The air smelled of wax and mildew. Each book whispered. Pages turned on their own. Shapes moved between the stacks—readers, perhaps, or keepers. They wore robes like woven shadow, faces covered in blank masks of copper.

Elric moved forward, following the whisper of Elias’s name.

A shelf opened before him, revealing a staircase that wound downward, deeper than sight. He followed.

At the base, he found a room.

Circular. Lined with mirrors. At its center stood Elias, eyes vacant, hands open at his sides. The mark on his brow had grown—no longer a scar, but a living glyph, pulsing with breath.

“Elric,” Elias said, but did not turn. “They gave me a name.”

“What name?”

“I can’t say it. My mouth won’t let me. But it’s mine now.”

Elric moved closer. The mirrors reflected neither of them. Instead, each showed a different version of Elias—young, old, monstrous, weeping, crowned, skeletal. Each mirror offered a different fate. Each a possible thread.

“Choose one,” said a voice that seemed to come from every mirror at once.

“Don’t,” Elric warned. “It’s a trap.”

“They said I could leave if I picked one.”

“They’re lying.”

“They said you picked already,” Elias whispered. “Long ago.”

The words hit Elric like a blow.

The mirrors flickered. In each one, he saw himself—casting a spell, walking away, cutting a thread, closing a door.

“You were one of us once,” the voice said.

“I was nothing,” Elric snapped. “And I chose to be.”

The voice laughed—a dry, papery sound like pages burning.

“You feared blood because it led you here. You were always afraid of what it would show you.”

Elric reached for Elias. “Come with me.”

But the boy didn’t move. “If I leave, they’ll follow.”

“Then let them,” Elric said, and grabbed Elias’s wrist.

The room fractured.

Mirrors shattered inward. The glyph on Elias’s forehead burst into threads of red light. The voices howled. The library shook.

And then—Elric opened his eyes.

He was back at the edge of the Hollow. The sun had risen. Marla was kneeling beside him.

He turned—Elias was there, breathing, eyes open. No mark on his brow.

“You pulled him out,” she said.

Elric didn’t respond immediately. He stood and walked to the edge of the chasm.

The Hollow was no longer empty.

At its bottom stood a tower of bone. It hadn’t been there before. But it was there now. And at its pinnacle, something watched them.

Elric turned to Marla.

“We’ve changed the thread,” he said.

“Is that good?”

He shook his head.

“It means we’re part of the story now.”

The climb out of the Hollow was harder than the descent. The world resisted their return. Stones slipped beneath their boots. The rope swayed as if breathed on by unseen lungs. Several times Elric felt a pressure at his back, subtle but constant, like someone leaning in just behind his shoulder, whispering in a voice he could no longer distinguish from his own thoughts. Marla climbed just ahead of Elias, her fingers bleeding from the rough hemp, but she never let go. Not once. Not even when the wind howled and the rocks began to hum with the same chant that had echoed through Elias’s dreams.

By the time they reached the lip, the sun was nearly swallowed by cloud. The basin of the Hollow stretched behind them in silence. No wind. No voices. No pulse. Even the tower of bone had vanished, as though retreating into a fold in space they could no longer perceive. Marla was the first to stand upright. She turned to look back only once before she spat into the dirt and tied the rope off with shaking hands.

“I want to burn this place,” she muttered.

“So do I,” Elric replied, already reaching for the satchel that held the map. “But some wounds don’t burn. They just fester.”

Elias didn’t speak. He sat quietly beside a stone, his knees drawn up, his face buried in his arms. The mark on his forehead was gone—truly gone—but something had taken its place in his eyes. Not a presence exactly, but an awareness. The kind Elric had only seen in seers after their first trances, and in soldiers after their first kill.

“Can you walk?” Elric asked.

Elias nodded without raising his head.

They walked until nightfall, putting as much distance between themselves and the Hollow as the terrain allowed. The Bleeding Ridge loomed to the north—crimson cliffs etched by ancient rainfall and streaked with rusted minerals. The ground began to change beneath their feet. Softer. Less brittle. They found shelter in the ruins of what had once been a signal tower, now a hollowed-out rib cage of stone and shattered glass. They lit no fire. They spoke in whispers. Not from fear of being heard, but from the simple recognition that this part of the world did not tolerate arrogance.

Marla finally broke the silence.

“What was that place really?”

Elric sighed. He had asked himself the same question every hour since they left it behind.

“It was a fracture,” he said. “A point where the pattern of things—of reality—was weakened. They appear where blood has been spilled over time with purpose. Where ritual goes wrong. Where magic sinks too deeply and forgets how to climb out.”

“You knew,” she said. “You’ve been there before.”

He didn’t deny it.

“I was taken there,” he admitted. “Years ago. Before I renounced the Covenant. I wasn’t marked like Elias, but I was meant to become a vessel.”

“And you escaped?”

“I made a trade.”

Marla didn’t press further. But her expression was heavy with the questions she didn’t ask.

Later that night, after Elias fell into a twitching, dreamless sleep, Elric pulled the book from his satchel—the one that had returned with the rope. He hadn’t dared open it since. The pages were still warm. Still breathing.

He opened to the first.

The writing had changed.

No longer a single phrase repeated in countless hands. Instead, the ink twisted into dense, clustered lines of prose—scraps of prophecy, curses in forgotten dialects, invocations spelled backward and bound with glyphs of silence. And beneath it all, the faint outline of a map. Not drawn, but grown—etched into the parchment like veins under skin.

He held it closer to the firelight and saw that the map didn’t lead to a place. It led to a person.

A name scrawled in delicate crimson: Nheraval, the Weaver Beneath.

He didn’t know the name, but the weight of it was unbearable. It pressed into his lungs, into the marrow of his bones. The script curled at the edges of the page, and the ink flared with a heat that had no source.

He quickly closed the book.

Marla stirred nearby. “What did it say?”

“Nothing useful,” he lied.

She didn’t challenge him.

In the early hours of the morning, when sleep became impossible and time seemed to bend unnaturally, Elric crept from the ruins and walked to the edge of the ridge. From here, he could see the outline of the Hollow, distant but persistent. He closed his eyes and tried to forget the taste of the place, the hum of its voice in his blood. But it clung to him. The price of entry was always return.

And worse still—he feared this was only the threshold.

They arrived in a village called Brackenfold two days later, a farming settlement known for its silence and its moss-covered roofs. The people did not greet strangers warmly, but they offered no hostility either—only sidelong glances and tight-lipped nods.

Elric knew why.

Brackenfold sat on the seam between worlds. Not one of the major ley points, but a subtle thread—a resonance point where magic echoed longer than it should. Birds flew in strange spirals above the rooftops. Wells never ran dry. Children occasionally spoke in tongues they couldn’t remember learning.

They took a room at the edge of the village, in a squat timber house with a crooked chimney and a goat that refused to blink.

Marla watched the villagers through a crack in the shutters as Elric examined the map again. He traced the paths with gloved fingers, careful not to let his skin touch the parchment. It reacted even to proximity now. The lines shifted, reformed, pointing southward toward the Drowned Border—a flooded expanse where a city had once stood before the river rebelled.

“What are we looking for there?” Marla asked.

“A name,” Elric said.

“I thought we already found one.”

“That was a warning.”

She leaned against the wall. “What’s this one?”

“A key.”

They left the next morning with a guide—an old man named Farris who claimed he had once seen the edge of the Drowned Border during a particularly cruel winter, when the ice cracked and the city’s bones surfaced. He spoke little, but he never lost his pace. His eyes, milky with age, saw things none of them did. More than once, he raised a hand to stop them just before a sinkhole revealed itself, or veered left when the ground began to moan beneath their feet.

“Most don’t come this way,” he said as they passed beneath the remains of a collapsed aqueduct. “Something lives in the water.”

“What kind of something?” Marla asked.

“Something that remembers.”

They reached the edge of the Drowned Border on the fifth day.

The world ended in a flat sheet of dark, rippling water. Dead trees jutted from the surface like spears. Beneath the reflection, shapes moved—slow, deliberate, too large to be fish. The remains of spires and towers protruded from the lakebed in the distance, their forms warped by algae and years.

“This was once Caer Vassa,” Elric said. “Before the flood.”

“You’ve been here?” Elias asked, his voice rough from disuse.

“No,” Elric said. “But I know its name.”

He held up the map. The veins within had turned crimson, spreading in all directions from a single point in the water. It pulsed like a heartbeat.

“We’re close.”

“Close to what?” Marla asked.

Elric didn’t answer.

Instead, he stepped into the water.

Chapter Four: The Drowned Name

The water of the Drowned Border was colder than thought, colder than memory. It clung to Elric's skin like oil, slow and deliberate, leeching heat and sound. Every step sent ripples into the stillness, but they returned oddly delayed, as if time hesitated to continue their echo. Behind him, Marla called out, her voice warping against the low hum that began the moment he entered the lake. Elias remained at the edge, unmoving, his eyes fixed on the submerged ruins beyond.

Elric moved forward with deliberate pace. The water deepened quickly, and by the time it reached his ribs, he could feel the pull of something beneath, not strong enough to drag but persistent, like fingers brushing his ankles. The map was sealed in wax and tied to his chest beneath his tunic. Its warmth had gone, replaced by a quiet pressure that felt like it was waiting.

The remains of Caer Vassa rose before him, spires cracked and half-submerged, their stone surfaces overtaken by long black vines that grew in slow, pulsing knots. Windows stared blankly, some shattered, others blinking faintly as though eyes watched from within. As he neared what had once been the outer wall, a gate materialized below the surface—its arch broken but still intact enough to mark a passage.

He paused.

The glyph in his palm flared.

Above the water, the air changed. He heard it in the way the birds stopped calling, in the sudden absence of the breeze that had followed them for days. Even the insects fell silent. A stillness as dense as fog rolled in from nowhere.

Marla shouted again.

“Elric!”

He turned but could not see her. A wall of mist had risen between them, thick and opalescent, shimmering with colors that weren’t visible elsewhere in the world.

Too late to go back now.

He dove.

Beneath the water, silence took shape.

Not absence of sound, but the presence of silence—an active thing, pressing in on his ears, squeezing at his lungs. Light fractured oddly, bending around shapes that should not have existed: staircases descending into darkness, doors framed in bone-white coral, statues whose faces had been scratched away.

Elric swam downward, following the pulse he felt through the wax-sealed map. His mind swam with impressions—voices half-remembered, warnings whispered long ago in the halls of the Covenant, tales of drowned cities and the spells that sleep within them.

He saw it then.

A chapel.

Its roof long gone, walls partially collapsed, but the altar still stood, preserved by magic or by reverence. Behind it, a mural stretched across stone—barely visible, etched in pale green light. He moved closer.

The image was familiar. A figure with no eyes and too many mouths, arms outstretched. From its hands, threads unraveled in all directions, weaving through the spines of kneeling humans below.

At the bottom of the mural, a name had been scratched in blood-rust.

Nheraval.

Elric reached into his tunic and pulled free the waxed packet. It broke open at his touch, not with force, but like fruit rotting under its own weight. Inside was the book, and the map now shone with eerie light, its veins vibrating softly. A line extended from its heart, pointing toward the altar.

He approached.

The moment his foot touched the cracked stone step, the chapel breathed.

Water shuddered. Columns groaned. The mural shimmered—and the figure moved. Just slightly, a twitch of one hand, but Elric saw it. A ripple ran through the image as though painted on water rather than stone.

He placed the map on the altar.

Immediately, a mouth opened in the floor.

Not metaphor. Not magic in metaphor. A real, fleshy, circular maw, ringed with teeth like keys. No sound emerged. No suction. It simply waited, gaping.

A voice filled the chapel, not heard with ears, but inside the body, echoing through ribs and bones.

You carry the name. You feared it. You buried it. But you are stitched to the thread.

Elric dropped to his knees. His head ached. Blood trickled from his nose. His eyes burned with pressure, and suddenly the truth came to him—not spoken, not taught, but remembered. He knew why he feared blood.

Because once, long ago, he had spilled it to bind a name.

His name.

He had not simply encountered the Hollow. He had not merely brushed the old forces.

He had served them.

And the name they gave him then, the name he tore from his own soul to bury in a secret rite, was rising again.

A shape emerged from the mouth.

Long. Thin. Unfolding as though it had no end. A thread of something neither flesh nor spirit. It hovered before Elric and touched his forehead.

His mind fractured.

He awoke choking.

Marla knelt over him, drenched, her face ashen. Elias stood behind her, arms crossed tight over his chest, eyes flicking between them and the lake.

“You stopped breathing,” she said.

“You were under for ten minutes,” Elias added, voice trembling. “You were… not alone.”

Elric coughed and rolled to his side. His skin felt burned, but no wound showed. The map lay beside him, completely dry, though no longer warm. The book was closed, sealed with a fresh wax sigil shaped like a mouth sewn shut.

“Did you find the name?” Marla asked.

“I remembered it,” he whispered.

“What is it?”

He hesitated. The syllables swam just beneath his tongue, begging to be spoken. But he knew the cost. Names had power. Spoken names had direction. A thing with a name could be called—and a thing called would come.

Instead, he turned to Elias. “I saw the Chapel of Threads. I saw your place in it. You were meant to be a vessel for what comes next.”

Elias nodded slowly. “I felt it. That something is inside me still. Watching.”

Marla looked from one to the other. “What do we do now?”

Elric sat up. The pain in his head ebbed, replaced with clar
