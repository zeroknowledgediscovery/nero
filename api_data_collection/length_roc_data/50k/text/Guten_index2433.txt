CHAPTER I.  FOOT-FARING.  It was a lovely morning in the first of summer. Donal Grant was descending a path on a hillside to the valley below--a sheep-track of which he knew every winding as well as any boy his half-mile to and from school. But he had never before gone down the hill with the feeling that he was not about to go up again. He was on his way to pastures very new, and in the distance only negatively inviting. But his heart was too full to be troubled--nor was his a heart to harbour a care, the next thing to an evil spirit, though not quite so bad; for one care may drive out another, while one devil is sure to bring in another.  A great billowy waste of mountains lay beyond him, amongst which played the shadow at their games of hide and seek--graciously merry in the eyes of the happy man, but sadly solemn in the eyes of him in whose heart the dreary thoughts of the past are at a like game. Behind Donal lay a world of dreams into which he dared not turn and look, yet from which he could scarce avert his eyes.  He was nearing the foot of the hill when he stumbled and almost fell, but recovered himself with the agility of a mountaineer, and the unpleasant knowledge that the sole of one of his shoes was all but off. Never had he left home for college that his father had not made personal inspection of his shoes to see that they were fit for the journey, but on this departure they had been forgotten. He sat down and took off the failing equipment. It was too far gone to do anything temporary with it; and of discomforts a loose sole to one’s shoe in walking is of the worst. The only thing was to take off the other shoe and both stockings and go barefoot. He tied all together with a piece of string, made them fast to his deerskin knapsack, and resumed his walk. The thing did not trouble him much. To have what we want is riches, but to be able to do without is power. To have shoes is a good thing; to be able to walk without them is a better. But it was long since Donal had walked barefoot, and he found his feet like his shoe, weaker in the sole than was pleasant.  “It’s time,” he said to himself, when he found he was stepping gingerly, “I gae my feet a turn at the auld accomplishment. It’s a pity to grow nae so fit for onything suner nor ye need. I wad like to lie doon at last wi’ hard soles!”  In every stream he came to he bathed his feet, and often on the way rested them, when otherwise able enough to go on. He had no certain goal, though he knew his direction, and was in no haste. He had confidence in God and in his own powers as the gift of God, and knew that wherever he went he needed not be hungry long, even should the little money in his pocket be spent. It is better to trust in work than in money: God never buys anything, and is for ever at work; but if any one trust in work, he has to learn that he must trust in nothing but strength--the self-existent, original strength only; and Donal Grant had long begun to learn that. The man has begun to be strong who knows that, separated from life essential, he is weakness itself, that, one with his origin, he will be of strength inexhaustible. Donal was now descending the heights of youth to walk along the king’s highroad of manhood: happy he who, as his sun is going down behind the western, is himself ascending the eastern hill, returning through old age to the second and better childhood which shall not be taken from him! He who turns his back on the setting sun goes to meet the rising sun; he who loses his life shall find it. Donal had lost his past--but not so as to be ashamed. There are many ways of losing! His past had but crept, like the dead, back to God who gave it; in better shape it would be his by and by! Already he had begun to foreshadow this truth: God would keep it for him.  He had set out before the sun was up, for he would not be met by friends or acquaintances. Avoiding the well-known farmhouses and occasional village, he took his way up the river, and about noon came to a hamlet where no one knew him--a cluster of straw-roofed cottages, low and white, with two little windows each. He walked straight through it not meaning to stop; but, spying in front of the last cottage a rough stone seat under a low, widespreading elder tree, was tempted to sit down and rest a little. The day was now hot, and the shadow of the tree inviting.  He had but seated himself when a woman came to the door of the cottage, looked at him for a moment, and probably thinking him, from his bare feet, poorer than he was, said--  “Wad ye like a drink?”  “Ay, wad I,” answered Donal, “--a drink o’ watter, gien ye please.”  “What for no milk?” asked the woman.  “’Cause I’m able to pey for ’t,” answered Donal.  “I want nae peyment,” she rejoined, perceiving his drift as little as probably my reader.  “An’ I want nae milk,” returned Donal.  “Weel, ye may pey for ’t gien ye like,” she rejoined.  “But I dinna like,” replied Donal.  “Weel, ye’re a some queer customer!” she remarked.  “I thank ye, but I’m nae customer, ’cep’ for a drink o’ watter,” he persisted, looking in her face with a smile; “an’ watter has aye been grâtis sin’ the days o’ Adam--’cep’ maybe i’ toons i’ the het pairts o’ the warl’.”  The woman turned into the cottage, and came out again presently with a delft basin, holding about a pint, full of milk, yellow and rich.  “There!” she said; “drink an’ be thankfu’.”  “I’ll be thankfu’ ohn drunken,” said Donal. “I thank ye wi’ a’ my heart. But I canna bide to tak for naething what I can pey for, an’ I dinna like to lay oot my siller upo’ a luxury I can weel eneuch du wantin’, for I haena muckle. I wadna be shabby nor yet greedy.”  “Drink, for the love o’ God,” said the woman.  Donal took the bowl from her hand, and drank till all was gone.  “Wull ye hae a drap mair?” she asked.  “Na, no a drap,” answered Donal. “I’ll gang i’ the stren’th o’ that ye hae gi’en me--maybe no jist forty days, guidwife, but mair nor forty minutes, an’ that’s a guid pairt o’ a day. I thank ye hertily. Yon was the milk o’ human kin’ness, gien ever was ony.”  As he spoke he rose, and stood up refreshed for his journey.  “I hae a sodger laddie awa’ i’ the het pairts ye spak o’,” said the woman: “gien ye hadna ta’en the milk, ye wad hae gi’en me a sair hert.”  “Eh, guidwife, it wad hae gi’en me ane to think I had!” returned Donal. “The Lord gie ye back yer sodger laddie safe an’ soon’! Maybe I’ll hae to gang efter ’im, sodger mysel’.”  “Na, na, that wadna do. Ye’re a scholar--that’s easy to see, for a’ ye’re sae plain spoken. It dis a body’s hert guid to hear a man ’at un’erstan’s things say them plain oot i’ the tongue his mither taucht him. Sic a ane ’ill gang straucht till ’s makker, an’ fin’ a’thing there hame-like. Lord, I wuss minnisters wad speyk like ither fowk!”  “Ye wad sair please my mither sayin’ that,” remarked Donal. “Ye maun be jist sic anither as her!”  “Weel, come in, an’ sit ye doon oot o’ the sin, an’ hae something to ait.”  “Na, I’ll tak nae mair frae ye the day, an’ I thank ye,” replied Donal; “I canna weel bide.”  “What for no?”  “It’s no sae muckle ’at I’m in a hurry as ’at I maun be duin’.”  “Whaur are ye b’un’ for, gien a body may speir?”  “I’m gaein’ to seek--no my fortin, but my daily breid. Gien I spak as a richt man, I wad say I was gaein’ to luik for the wark set me. I’m feart to say that straucht oot; I haena won sae far as that yet. I winna du naething though ’at he wadna hae me du. I daur to say that--sae be I un’erstan’. My mither says the day ’ill come whan I’ll care for naething but his wull.”  “Yer mither ’ill be Janet Grant, I’m thinkin’! There canna be twa sic in ae country-side!”  “Ye’re i’ the richt,” answered Donal. “Ken ye my mither?”  “I hae seen her; an’ to see her ’s to ken her.”  “Ay, gien wha sees her be sic like ’s hersel’.”  “I canna preten’ to that; but she’s weel kent throuw a’ the country for a God-fearin’ wuman.--An’ whaur ’ll ye be for the noo?”  “I’m jist upo’ the tramp, luikin’ for wark.”  “An’ what may ye be pleast to ca’ wark?”  “Ow, jist the communication o’ what I hae the un’erstan’in’ o’.”  “Aweel, gien ye’ll condescen’ to advice frae an auld wife, I’ll gie ye a bit wi’ ye: tak na ilka lass ye see for a born angel. Misdoobt her a wee to begin wi’. Hing up yer jeedgment o’ her a wee. Luik to the moo’ an’ the e’en o’ her.”  “I thank ye,” said Donal, with a smile, in which the woman spied the sadness; “I’m no like to need the advice.”  She looked at him pitifully, and paused.  “Gien ye come this gait again,” she said, “ye’ll no gang by my door?”  “I wull no,” replied Donal, and wishing her good-bye with a grateful heart, betook himself to his journey.  He had not gone far when he found himself on a wide moor. He sat down on a big stone, and began to turn things over in his mind. This is how his thoughts went:  “I can never be the man I was! The thoucht o’ my heart’s ta’en frae me! I canna think aboot things as I used. There’s naething sae bonnie as afore. Whan the life slips frae him, hoo can a man gang on livin’! Yet I’m no deid--that’s what maks the difficlety o’ the situation! Gien I war deid--weel, I kenna what than! I doobt there wad be trible still, though some things micht be lichter. But that’s neither here nor there; I maun live; I hae nae ch’ice; I didna mak mysel’, an’ I’m no gaein’ to meddle wi’ mysel’! I think mair o’ mysel’ nor daur that!  “But there’s ae queston I maun sattle afore I gang farther--an’ that’s this: am I to be less or mair nor I was afore? It’s agreed I canna be the same: if I canna be the same, I maun aither be less or greater than I was afore: whilk o’ them is ’t to be? I winna hae that queston to speir mair nor ance! I’ll be mair nor I was. To sink to less wad be to lowse grip o’ my past as weel ’s o’ my futur! An’ hoo wad I ever luik her i’ the face gien I grew less because o’ her! A chiel’ like me lat a bonnie lassie think hersel’ to blame for what I grew til! An’ there’s a greater nor the lass to be considert! ’Cause he seesna fit to gie me her I wad hae, is he no to hae his wull o’ me? It’s a gran’ thing to ken a lassie like yon, an’ a gran’er thing yet to be allooed to lo’e her: to sit doon an’ greit ’cause I’m no to merry her, wad be most oongratefu’! What for sud I threip ’at I oucht to hae her? What for sudna I be disapp’intit as weel as anither? I hae as guid a richt to ony guid ’at’s to come o’ that, I fancy! Gien it be a man’s pairt to cairry a sair hert, it canna be his pairt to sit doon wi’ ’t upo’ the ro’d-side, an’ lay ’t upo’ his lap, an’ greit ower ’t, like a bairn wi’ a cuttit finger: he maun haud on his ro’d. Wha am I to differ frae the lave o’ my fowk! I s’ be like the lave, an’ gien I greit I winna girn. The Lord himsel’ had to be croont wi’ pain. Eh, my bonnie doo! But ye lo’e a better man, an’ that’s a sair comfort! Gien it had been itherwise, I div not think I could hae borne the pain at my hert. But as it’s guid an’ no ill ’at’s come to ye, I haena you an’ mysel’ tu to greit for, an’ that’s a sair comfort! Lord, I’ll clim’ to thee, an’ gaither o’ the healin’ ’at grows for the nations i’ thy gairden.  “I see the thing as plain ’s thing can be: the cure o’ a’ ill ’s jist mair life! That’s it! Life abune an’ ’ayont the life ’at took the stroke! An’ gien throuw this hert-brak I come by mair life, it’ll be jist ane o’ the throes o’ my h’avenly birth--i’ the whilk the bairn has as mony o’ the pains as the mither: that’s maybe a differ ’atween the twa--the earthly an’ the h’avenly!  “Sae noo I hae to begin fresh, an’ lat the thing ’at’s past an’ gane slip efter ither dreams. Eh, but it’s a bonnie dream yet! It lies close ’ahint me, no to be forgotten, no to be luikit at--like ane o’ thae dreams o’ watter an’ munelicht ’at has nae wark i’ them: a body wadna lie a’ nicht an’ a’ day tu in a dream o’ the sowl’s gloamin’! Na, Lord; mak o’ me a strong man, an’ syne gie me as muckle o’ the bonnie as may please thee. Wha am I to lippen til, gien no to thee, my ain father an’ mither an’ gran’father an’ a’body in ane, for thoo giedst me them a’!  “Noo I’m to begin again--a fresh life frae this meenute! I’m to set oot frae this verra p’int, like ane o’ the yoongest sons i’ the fairy tales, to seek my portion, an’ see what’s comin’ to meet me as I gang to meet hit. The warl’ afore me’s my story-buik. I canna see ower the leaf till I come to the en’ o’ ’t. Whan I was a bairn, jist able, wi’ sair endeevour, to win at the hert o’ print, I never wad luik on afore! The ae time I did it, I thoucht I had dune a shamefu’ thing, like luikin’ in at a keyhole--as I did jist ance tu, whan I thank God my mither gae me sic a blessed lickin’ ’at I kent it maun be something dreidfu’ I had dune. Sae here’s for what’s comin’! I ken whaur it maun come frae, an’ I s’ mak it welcome. My mither says the main mischeef i’ the warl’ is, ’at fowk winna lat the Lord hae his ain w’y, an’ sae he has jist to tak it, whilk maks it a sair thing for them.”  Therewith he rose to encounter that which was on its way to meet him. He is a fool who stands and lets life move past him like a panorama. He also is a fool who would lay hands on its motion, and change its pictures. He can but distort and injure, if he does not ruin them, and come upon awful shadows behind them.  And lo! as he glanced around him, already something of the old mysterious loveliness, now for so long vanished from the face of the visible world, had returned to it--not yet as it was before, but with dawning promise of a new creation, a fresh beauty, in welcoming which he was not turning from the old, but receiving the new that God sent him. He might yet be many a time sad, but to lament would be to act as if he were wronged--would be at best weak and foolish! He would look the new life in the face, and be what it should please God to make him. The scents the wind brought him from field and garden and moor, seemed sweeter than ever wind-borne scents before: they were seeking to comfort him! He sighed--but turned from the sigh to God, and found fresh gladness and welcome. The wind hovered about him as if it would fain have something to do in the matter; the river rippled and shone as if it knew something worth knowing as yet unrevealed. The delight of creation is verily in secrets, but in secrets as truths on the way. All secrets are embryo revelations. On the far horizon heaven and earth met as old friends, who, though never parted, were ever renewing their friendship. The world, like the angels, was rejoicing--if not over a sinner that had repented, yet over a man that had passed from a lower to a higher condition of life--out of its earth into its air: he was going to live above, and look down on the inferior world! Ere the shades of evening fell that day around Donal Grant, he was in the new childhood of a new world.  I do not mean such _thoughts_ had never been present to him before; but to _think_ a thing is only to look at it in a glass; to know it as God would have us know it, and as we must know it to live, is to see it as we see love in a friend’s eyes--to have it as the love the friend sees in ours. To make things real to us, is the end and the battle-cause of life. We often think we believe what we are only presenting to our imaginations. The least thing can overthrow that kind of faith. The imagination is an endless help towards faith, but it is no more faith than a dream of food will make us strong for the next day’s work. To know God as the beginning and end, the root and cause, the giver, the enabler, the love and joy and perfect good, the present one existence in all things and degrees and conditions, is life; and faith, in its simplest, truest, mightiest form is--to do his will.  Donal was making his way towards the eastern coast, in the certain hope of finding work of one kind or another. He could have been well content to pass his life as a shepherd like his father but for two things: he knew what it would be well for others to know; and he had a hunger after the society of books. A man must be able to do without whatever is denied him, but when his heart is hungry for an honest thing, he may use honest endeavour to obtain it. Donal desired to be useful and live for his generation, also to be with books. To be where was a good library would suit him better than buying books, for without a place in which to keep them, they are among the _impedimenta_ of life. And Donal knew that in regard to books he was in danger of loving after the fashion of this world: books he had a strong inclination to accumulate and hoard; therefore the use of a library was better than the means of buying them. Books as possessions are also of the things that pass and perish--as surely as any other form of earthly having; they are of the playthings God lets men have that they may learn to distinguish between apparent and real possession: if having will not teach them, loss may.  But who would have thought, meeting the youth as he walked the road with shoeless feet, that he sought the harbour of a great library in some old house, so as day after day to feast on the thoughts of men who had gone before him! For his was no antiquarian soul; it was a soul hungry after life, not after the mummy cloths enwrapping the dead.     CHAPTER II.  A SPIRITUAL FOOT-PAD.  He was now walking southward, but would soon, when the mountains were well behind him, turn toward the east. He carried a small wallet, filled chiefly with oatcake and hard skim-milk cheese: about two o’clock he sat down on a stone, and proceeded to make a meal. A brook from the hills ran near: for that he had chosen the spot, his fare being dry. He seldom took any other drink than water: he had learned that strong drink at best but discounted to him his own at a high rate.  He drew from his pocket a small thick volume he had brought as the companion of his journey, and read as he ate. His seat was on the last slope of a grassy hill, where many huge stones rose out of the grass. A few yards beneath was a country road, and on the other side of the road a small stream, in which the brook that ran swiftly past, almost within reach of his hand, eagerly lost itself. On the further bank of the stream, perfuming the air, grew many bushes of meadow-sweet, or _queen-of-the-meadow_, as it is called in Scotland; and beyond lay a lovely stretch of nearly level pasture. Farther eastward all was a plain, full of farms. Behind him rose the hill, shutting out his past; before him lay the plain, open to his eyes and feet. God had walled up his past, and was disclosing his future.  When he had eaten his dinner, its dryness forgotten in the condiment his book supplied, he rose, and taking his cap from his head, filled it from the stream, and drank heartily; then emptied it, shook the last drops from it, and put it again upon his head.  “Ho, ho, young man!” cried a voice.  Donal looked, and saw a man in the garb of a clergyman regarding him from the road, and wiping his face with his sleeve.  “You should mind,” he continued, “how you scatter your favours.”  “I beg your pardon, sir,” said Donal, taking off his cap again; “I hadna a notion there was leevin’ cratur near me.”  “It’s a fine day!” said the minister.  “It is that, sir!” answered Donal.  “Which way are you going?” asked the minister, adding, as if in apology for his seeming curiosity, “--You’re a scholar, I see!”--with a glance towards the book he had left open on his stone.  “Nae sae muckle as I wad fain be, sir,” answered Donal--then called to mind a resolve he had made to speak English for the future.  “A modest youth, I see!” returned the clergyman; but Donal hardly liked the tone in which he said it.  “That depends on what you mean by a scholar,” he said.  “Oh!” answered the minister, not thinking much about his reply, but in a bantering humour willing to draw the lad out, “the learned man modestly calls himself a scholar.”  “Then there was no modesty in saying I was not so much of a scholar as I should like to be; every scholar would say the same.”  “A very good answer!” said the clergyman patronizingly. “You’ll be a learned man some day!” And he smiled as he said it.  “When would you call a man learned?” asked Donal.  “That is hard to determine, seeing those that claim to be contradict each other so.”  “What good then can there be in wanting to be learned?”  “You get the mental discipline of study.”  “It seems to me,” said Donal, “a pity to get a body’s discipline on what may be worthless. It’s just as good discipline to my teeth to dine on bread and cheese, as it would be to exercise them on sheep’s grass.”  “I’ve got hold of a humorist!” said the clergyman to himself.  Donal picked up his wallet and his book, and came down to the road. Then first the clergyman saw that he was barefooted. In his childhood he had himself often gone without shoes and stockings, yet the youth’s lack of them prejudiced him against him.  “It must be the fellow’s own fault!” he said to himself. “He shan’t catch me with his chaff!”  Donal would rather have forded the river, and gone to inquire his way at the nearest farm-house, but he thought it polite to walk a little way with the clergyman.  “How far are you going?” asked the minister at length.  “As far as I can,” replied Donal.  “Where do you mean to pass the night?”  “In some barn perhaps, or on some hill-side.”  “I am sorry to hear you can do no better.”  “You don’t think, sir, what a decent bed costs; and a barn is generally, a hill-side always clean. In fact the hill-side’s the best. Many’s the time I have slept on one. It’s a strange notion some people have, that it’s more respectable to sleep under man’s roof than God’s.”  “To have no settled abode,” said the clergyman, and paused.  “Like Abraham?” suggested Donal with a smile. “An abiding city seems hardly necessary to pilgrims and strangers! I fell asleep once on the top of Glashgar: when I woke the sun was looking over the edge of the horizon. I rose and gazed about me as if I were but that moment created. If God had called me, I should hardly have been astonished.”  “Or frightened?” asked the minister.  “No, sir; why should a man fear the presence of his saviour?”  “You said _God_!” answered the minister.  “God is my saviour! Into his presence it is my desire to come.”  “Under shelter of the atonement,” supplemented the minister.  “Gien ye mean by that, sir,” cried Donal, forgetting his English, “onything to come ’atween my God an’ me, I’ll hae nane o’ ’t. I’ll hae naething hide me frae him wha made me! I wadna hide a thoucht frae him. The waur it is, the mair need he see ’t.”  “What book is that you are reading?” asked the minister sharply. “It’s not your Bible, I’ll be bound! You never got such notions from _it_!”  He was angry with the presumptuous youth--and no wonder; for the gospel the minister preached was a gospel but to the slavish and unfilial.  “It’s Shelley,” answered Donal, recovering himself.  The minister had never read a word of Shelley, but had a very decided opinion of him. He gave a loud rude whistle.  “So! that’s where you go for your theology! I was puzzled to understand you, but now all is plain! Young man, you are on the brink of perdition. That book will poison your very vitals!”  “Indeed, sir, it will never go deep enough for that! But it came near touching them as I sat eating my bread and cheese.”  “He’s an infidel!” said the minister fiercely.  “A kind of one,” returned Donal, “but not of the worst sort. It’s the people who call themselves believers that drive the like of poor Shelley to the mouth of the pit.”  “He hated the truth,” said the minister.  “He was always seeking after it,” said Donal, “though to be sure he didn’t get to the end of the search. Just listen to this, sir, and say whether it be very far from Christian.”  Donal opened his little volume, and sought his passage. The minister but for curiosity and the dread of seeming absurd would have stopped his ears and refused to listen. He was a man of not merely dry or stale, but of deadly doctrines. He would have a man love Christ for protecting him from God, not for leading him to God in whom alone is bliss, out of whom all is darkness and misery. He had not a glimmer of the truth that eternal life is to know God. He imagined justice and love dwelling in eternal opposition in the bosom of eternal unity. He knew next to nothing about God, and misrepresented him hideously. If God were such as he showed him, it would be the worst possible misfortune to have been created.  Donal had found the passage. It was in _The Mask of Anarchy_. He read the following stanzas:--       Let a vast assembly be,      And with great solemnity      Declare with measured words that ye      Are, as God has made ye, free.       Be your strong and simple words      Keen to wound as sharpened swords,      And wide as targes let them be,      With their shade to cover ye.       And if then the tyrants dare,      Let them ride among you there,      Slash, and stab, and maim, and hew--      What they like, that let them do.       With folded arms and steady eyes,      And little fear, and less surprise,      Look upon them as they slay,      Till their rage has died away.       And that slaughter to the Nation      Shall steam up like inspiration,      Eloquent, oracular--      A volcano heard afar.  Ending, the reader turned to the listener. But the listener had understood little of the meaning, and less of the spirit. He hated opposition to the powers on the part of any below himself, yet scorned the idea of submitting to persecution.  “What think you of that, sir?” asked Donal.  “Sheer nonsense!” answered the minister. “Where would Scotland be now but for resistance?”  “There’s more than one way of resisting, though,” returned Donal. “Enduring evil was the Lord’s way. I don’t know about Scotland, but I fancy there would be more Christians, and of a better stamp, in the world, if that had been the mode of resistance always adopted by those that called themselves such. Anyhow it was _his_ way.”  “Shelley’s, you mean!”  “I don’t mean Shelley’s, I mean Christ’s. In spirit Shelley was far nearer the truth than those who made him despise the very name of Christianity without knowing what it really was. But God will give every man fair play.”  “Young man!” said the minister, with an assumption of great solemnity and no less authority, “I am bound to warn you that you are in a state of rebellion against God, and he will not be mocked. Good morning!”  Donal sat down on the roadside--he would let the minister have a good start of him--took again his shabby little volume, held more talk with the book-embodied spirit of Shelley, and saw more and more clearly how he was misled in his every notion of Christianity, and how different those who gave him his notions must have been from the evangelists and apostles. He saw in the poet a boyish nature striving after liberty, with scarce a notion of what liberty really was: he knew nothing of the law of liberty--oneness with the will of our existence, which would have us free with its own freedom.  When the clergyman was long out of sight, he rose and went on, and soon came to a bridge by which he crossed the river. Then on he went through the cultivated plain, his spirits never flagging. He was a pilgrim on his way to his divine fate!     CHAPTER III.  THE MOOR.  The night began to descend and he to be weary, and look about him for a place of repose. But there was a long twilight before him, and it was warm.  For some time the road had been ascending, and by and by he found himself on a bare moor, among heather not yet in bloom, and a forest of bracken. Here was a great, beautiful chamber for him! and what better bed than God’s heather! what better canopy than God’s high, star-studded night, with its airy curtains of dusky darkness! Was it not in this very chamber that Jacob had his vision of the mighty stair leading up to the gate of heaven! Was it not under such a roof Jesus spent his last nights on the earth! For comfort and protection he sought no human shelter, but went out into his Father’s house--out under his Father’s heaven! The small and narrow were not to him the safe, but the wide and open. Thick walls cover men from the enemies they fear; the Lord sought space. There the angels come and go more freely than where roofs gather distrust. If ever we hear a far-off rumour of angel-visit, is it not from some solitary plain with lonely children?  Donal walked along the high table-land till he was weary, and rest looked blissful. Then he turned aside from the rough track into the heather and bracken. When he came to a little dry hollow, with a yet thicker growth of heather, its tops almost as close as those of his bed at his father’s cottage, he sought no further. Taking his knife, he cut a quantity of heather and ferns, and heaped it on the top of the thickest bush; then creeping in between the cut and the growing, he cleared the former from his face that he might see the worlds over him, and putting his knapsack under his head, fell fast asleep.  When he woke not even the shadow of a dream lingered to let him know what he had been dreaming. He woke with such a clear mind, such an immediate uplifting of the soul, that it seemed to him no less than to Jacob that he must have slept at the foot of the heavenly stair. The wind came round him like the stuff of thought unshaped, and every breath he drew seemed like God breathing afresh into his nostrils the breath of life. Who knows what the thing we call air is? We know about it, but _it_ we do not know. The sun shone as if smiling at the self-importance of the sulky darkness he had driven away, and the world seemed content with a heavenly content. So fresh was Donal’s sense that he felt as if his sleep within and the wind without had been washing him all the night. So peaceful, so blissful was his heart that it longed to share its bliss; but there was no one within sight, and he set out again on his journey.  He had not gone far when he came to a dip in the moorland--a round hollow, with a cottage of turf in the middle of it, from whose chimney came a little smoke: there too the day was begun! He was glad he had not seen it before, for then he might have missed the repose of the open night. At the door stood a little girl in a blue frock. She saw him, and ran in. He went down and drew near to the door. It stood wide open, and he could not help seeing in.  A man sat at the table in the middle of the floor, his forehead on his hand. Donal did not see his face. He seemed waiting, like his father for the Book, while his mother got it from the top of the wall. He stepped over the threshold, and in the simplicity of his heart, said:--  “Ye’ll be gaein’ to hae worship!”  “Na, na!” returned the man, raising his head, and taking a brief, hard stare at his visitor; “we dinna set up for prayin’ fowk i’ this hoose. We ley that to them ’at kens what they hae to be thankfu’ for.”  “I made a mistak,” said Donal. “I thoucht ye micht hae been gaein’ to say guid mornin’ to yer makker, an’ wad hae likit to j’in wi’ ye; for _I_ kenna what I haena to be thankfu’ for. Guid day to ye.”  “Ye can bide an’ tak yer parritch gien ye like.”  “Ow, na, I thank ye. Ye micht think I cam for the parritch, an’ no for the prayers. I like as ill to be coontit a hypocrite as gien I war ane.”  “Ye can bide an’ hae worship wi’ ’s, gien ye tak the buik yersel’.”  “I canna lead whaur ’s nane to follow. Na; I’ll du better on the muir my lane.”  But the guidwife was a religious woman after her fashion--who can be after any one else’s? She came with a Bible in her hand, and silently laid it on the table. Donal had never yet prayed aloud except in a murmur by himself on the hill, but, thus invited, could not refuse. He read a psalm of trouble, breaking into hope at the close, then spoke as follows:--  “Freens, I’m but yoong, as ye see, an’ never afore daured open my moo’ i’ sic fashion, but it comes to me to speyk, an’ wi’ yer leave, speyk I wull. I canna help thinkin’ the guidman’s i’ some trible--siclike, maybe, as King Dawvid whan he made the psalm I hae been readin’ i’ yer hearin’. Ye observt hoo it began like a stormy mornin’, but ye h’ard hoo it changed or a’ was dune. The sun comes oot bonnie i’ the en’, an’ ye hear the birds beginnin’ to sing, tellin’ Natur to gie ower her greitin’. An’ what brings the guid man til ’s senses, div ye think? What but jist the thoucht o’ him ’at made him, him ’at cares aboot him, him ’at maun come to ill himsel’ afore he lat onything he made come to ill. Sir, lat ’s gang doon upo’ oor knees, an’ commit the keepin’ o’ oor sowls to him as til a faithfu’ creator, wha winna miss his pairt ’atween him an’ hiz.”  They went down on their knees, and Donal said,  “O Lord, oor ain father an’ saviour, the day ye hae sent ’s has arrived bonnie an’ gran’, an’ we bless ye for sen’in’ ’t; but eh, oor father, we need mair the licht that shines i’ the darker place. We need the dawn o’ a spiritual day inside ’s, or the bonnie day ootside winna gang for muckle. Lord, oor micht, speyk a word o’ peacefu’ recall to ony dog o’ thine ’at may be worryin’ at the hert o’ ony sheep o’ thine ’at’s run awa; but dinna ca’ him back sae as to lea’ the puir sheep ’ahint him; fess back dog an’ lamb thegither, O Lord. Haud ’s a’ frae ill, an’ guide ’s a’ to guid, an’ oor mornin’ prayer ’s ower. Amen.”  They rose from their knees, and sat silent for a moment. Then the guidwife put the pot on the fire with the water for the porridge. But Donal rose, and walked out of the cottage, half wondering at himself that he had dared as he had, yet feeling he had done but the most natural thing in the world.  “Hoo a body ’s to win throuw the day wantin’ the lord o’ the day an’ the hoor an’ the meenute, ’s ’ayont me!” he said to himself, and hastened away.  Ere noon the blue line of the far ocean rose on the horizon.     CHAPTER IV.  THE TOWN.  Donal was queer, some of my readers will think, and I admit it; for the man who regards the affairs of life from any other point than his own greedy self, must be queer indeed in the eyes of all who are slaves to their imagined necessities and undisputed desires.  It was evening when he drew nigh the place whither he had directed his steps--a little country town, not far from a famous seat of learning: there he would make inquiry before going further. The minister of his parish knew the minister of Auchars, and had given him a letter of introduction. The country around had not a few dwellings of distinction, and at one or another of these might be children in want of a tutor.  The sun was setting over the hills behind him as he entered the little town. At first it looked but a village, for on the outskirts, through which the king’s highway led, were chiefly thatched cottages, with here and there a slated house of one story and an attic; but presently began to appear houses of larger size--few of them, however, of more than two stories. Most of them looked as if they had a long and not very happy history. All at once he found himself in a street, partly of quaint gables with corbel steps; they called them here _corbie-steps_, in allusion, perhaps, to the raven sent out by Noah, for which lazy bird the children regarded these as places to rest. There were two or three curious gateways in it with some attempt at decoration, and one house with the pepperpot turrets which Scotish architecture has borrowed from the French chateau. The heart of the town was a yet narrower, close-built street, with several short closes and wynds opening out of it--all of which had ancient looking houses. There were shops not a few, but their windows were those of dwellings, as the upper parts of their buildings mostly were. In those shops was as good a supply of the necessities of life as in a great town, and cheaper. You could not get a coat so well cut, nor a pair of shoes to fit you so tight without hurting, but you could get first-rate work. The streets were unevenly paved with round, water-worn stones: Donal was not sorry that he had not to walk far upon them.  The setting sun sent his shadow before him as he entered the place. He kept the middle of the street, looking on this side and that for the hostelry whither he had despatched his chest before leaving home. A gloomy building, apparently uninhabited, drew his attention, and sent a strange thrill through him as his eyes fell upon it. It was of three low stories, the windows defended by iron stanchions, the door studded with great knobs of iron. A little way beyond he caught sight of the sign he was in search of. It swung in front of an old-fashioned, dingy building, with much of the old-world look that pervaded the town. The last red rays of the sun were upon it, lighting up a sorely faded coat of arms. The supporters, two red horses on their hind legs, were all of it he could make out. The crest above suggested a skate, but could hardly have been intended for one. A greedy-eyed man stood in the doorway, his hands in his trouser-pockets. He looked with contemptuous scrutiny at the bare-footed lad approaching him. He had black hair and black eyes; his nose looked as if a heavy finger had settled upon its point, and pressed it downwards: its nostrils swelled wide beyond their base; underneath was a big mouth with a good set of teeth, and a strong upturning chin--an ambitious and greedy face. But ambition is a form of greed.  “A fine day, landlord!” said Donal.  “Ay,” answered the man, without changing the posture of one taking his ease against his own door-post, or removing his hands from his pockets, but looking Donal up and down with conscious superiority, then resting his eyes on the bare feet and upturned trousers.  “This’ll be the Morven Arms, I’m thinkin’?” said Donal.  “It taksna muckle thoucht to think that,” returned the inn-keeper, “whan there they hing!”  “Ay,” rejoined Donal, glancing up; “there is something there--an’ it’s airms I doobtna; but it’s no a’body has the preevilege o’ a knowledge o’ heraldry like yersel’, lan’lord! I’m b’un’ to confess, for what I ken they micht be the airms o’ ony ane o’ ten score Scots faimilies.”  There was one weapon with which John Glumm was assailable, and that was ridicule: with all his self-sufficiency he stood in terror of it--and the more covert the ridicule, so long as he suspected it, the more he resented as well as dreaded it. He stepped into the street, and taking a hand from a pocket, pointed up to the sign.  “See til ’t!” he said. “Dinna ye see the twa reid horse?”  “Ay,” answered Donal; “I see them weel eneuch, but I’m nane the wiser nor gien they war twa reid whauls.--Man,” he went on, turning sharp round upon the fellow, “ye’re no cawpable o’ conceivin’ the extent o’ my ignorance! It’s as rampant as the reid horse upo’ your sign! I’ll yield to naebody i’ the amoont o’ things I dinna ken!”  The man stared at him for a moment.  “I s’ warran’,” he said, “ye ken mair nor ye care to lat on!”  “An’ what may that be ower the heid o’ them?--A crest, ca’ ye ’t?” said Donal.  “It’s a base pearl-beset,” answered the landlord.  He had not a notion of what a _base_ meant, or _pearl-beset_, yet prided himself on his knowledge of the words.  “Eh,” returned Donal, “I took it for a skate!”  “A skate!” repeated the landlord with offended sneer, and turned towards the house.  “I was thinkin’ to put up wi’ ye the nicht, gien ye could accommodate me at a rizzonable rate,” said Donal.  “I dinna ken,” replied Glumm, hesitating, with his back to him, between unwillingness to lose a penny, and resentment at the supposed badinage, which was indeed nothing but humour; “what wad ye ca’ rizzonable?”  “I wadna grudge a saxpence for my bed; a shillin’ I wad,” answered Donal.  “Weel, ninepence than--for ye seemna owercome wi’ siller.”  “Na,” answered Donal, “I’m no that. Whatever my burden, yon’s no hit. The loss o’ what I hae wad hardly mak me lichter for my race.”  “Ye’re a queer customer!” said the man.  “I’m no sae queer but I hae a kist comin’ by the carrier,” rejoined Donal, “direckit to the Morven Airms. It’ll be here in time doobtless.”  “We’ll see whan it comes,” remarked the landlord, implying the chest was easier invented than believed in.  “The warst o’ ’t is,” continued Donal, “I canna weel shaw mysel’ wantin’ shune. I hae a pair i’ my kist, an’ anither upo’ my back,--but nane for my feet.”  “There’s sutors eneuch,” said the innkeeper.  “Weel we’ll see as we gang. I want a word wi’ the minister. Wad ye direc’ me to the manse?”  “He’s frae hame. But it’s o’ sma’ consequence; he disna care aboot tramps, honest man! He winna waur muckle upo’ the likes o’ you.”  The landlord was recovering himself--therefore his insolence.  Donal gave a laugh. Those who are content with what they are, have the less concern about what they seem. The ambitious like to be taken for more than they are, and may well be annoyed when they are taken for less.  “I’m thinkin’ ye wadna waur muckle on a tramp aither!” he said.  “I wad not,” answered Glumm. “It’s the pairt o’ the honest to discoontenance lawlessness.”  “Ye wadna hang the puir craturs, wad ye?” asked Donal.  “I wad hang a wheen mair o’ them.”  “For no haein’ a hoose ower their heids? That’s some hard! What gien ye was ae day to be in want o’ ane yersel’!”  “We’ll bide till the day comes.--But what are ye stan’in’ there for? Are ye comin’ in, or are ye no?”  “It’s a some cauld welcome!” said Donal. “I s’ jist tak a luik aboot afore I mak up my min’. A tramp, ye ken, needsna stan’ upo’ ceremony.”  He turned away and walked further along the street.     CHAPTER V.  THE COBBLER.  At the end of the street he came to a low-arched gateway in the middle of a poor-looking house. Within it sat a little bowed man, cobbling diligently at a boot. The sun had left behind him in the west a heap of golden refuse, and cuttings of rose and purple, which shone right in at the archway, and let him see to work. Here was the very man for Donal! A _respectable_ shoemaker would have disdained to patch up the shoes he carried--especially as the owner was in so much need of them.  “It’s a bonnie nicht,” he said.  “Ye may weel mak the remark, sir!” replied the cobbler without looking up, for a critical stitch occupied him. “It’s a balmy nicht.”  “That’s raither a bonnie word to put til ’t!” returned Donal. “There’s a kin’ o’ an air aboot the place I wad hardly hae thoucht balmy! But trowth it’s no the fau’t o’ the nicht!”  “Ye’re richt there also,” returned the cobbler--his use of the conjunction impressing Donal. “Still, the weather has to du wi’ the smell--wi’ the mair or less o’ ’t, that is. It comes frae a tanneree nearby. It’s no an ill smell to them ’at’s used til ’t; and ye wad hardly believe me, sir, but I smell the clover throuw ’t. Maybe I’m preejudized, seein’ but for the tan-pits I couldna weel drive my trade; but sittin’ here frae mornin’ to nicht, I get a kin’ o’ a habit o’ luikin’ oot for my blessin’s. To recognize an auld blessin’ ’s ’maist better nor to get a new ane. A pair o’ shune weel cobblet ’s whiles full better nor a new pair.”  “They are that,” said Donal; “but I dinna jist see hoo yer seemile applies.”  “Isna gettin’ on a pair o’ auld weel-kent an’ weel men’it shune, ’at winna nip yer feet nor yet shochle, like waukin’ up til a blessin’ ye hae been haein’ for years, only ye didna ken ’t for ane?”  As he spoke, the cobbler lifted a little wizened face and a pair of twinkling eyes to those of the student, revealing a soul as original as his own. He was one of the inwardly inseparable, outwardly far divided company of Christian philosophers, among whom individuality as well as patience is free to work its perfect work. In that glance Donal saw a ripe soul looking out of its tent door, ready to rush into the sunshine of the new life.  He stood for a moment lost in eternal regard of the man. He seemed to have known him for ages. The cobbler looked up again.  “Ye’ll be wantin’ a han’ frae me i’ my ain line, I’m thinkin’!” he said, with a kindly nod towards Donal’s shoeless feet.  “Sma’ doobt!” returned Donal. “I had scarce startit, but was ower far to gang back, whan the sole o’ ae shue cam aff, an’ I had to tramp it wi’ baith my ain.”  “An’ ye thankit the Lord for the auld blessin’ o’ bein’ born an’ broucht up wi’ soles o’ yer ain!”  “To tell the trowth,” answered Donal, “I hae sae mony things to be thankfu’ for, it’s but sma’ won’er I forget mony ane o’ them. But noo, an’ I thank ye for the exhortation, the Lord’s name be praist ’at he gae me feet fit for gangin’ upo’!”  He took his shoes from his back, and untying the string that bound them, presented the ailing one to the cobbler.  “That’s what we may ca’ deith!” remarked the cobbler, slowly turning the invalided shoe.  “Ay, deith it is,” answered Donal; “it’s a sair divorce o’ sole an’ body.”  “It’s a some auld-farrand joke,” said the cobbler, “but the fun intil a thing doesna weir oot ony mair nor the poetry or the trowth intil ’t.”  “Who will say there was no providence in the loss of my shoe-sole!” remarked Donal to himself. “Here I am with a friend already!”  The cobbler was submitting the shoes, first the sickly one, now the sound one, to a thorough scrutiny.  “Ye dinna think them worth men’in’, I doobt!” said Donal, with a touch of anxiety in his tone.  “I never thoucht that whaur the leather wad haud the steek,” replied the cobbler. “But whiles, I confess, I’m jist a wheen tribled to ken hoo to chairge for my wark. It’s no barely to consider the time it’ll tak me to cloot a pair, but what the weirer’s like to git oot o’ them. I canna tak mair nor the job ’ill be worth to the weirer. An’ yet the waur the shune, an’ the less to be made o’ them, the mair time they tak to mak them worth onything ava’!”  “Surely ye oucht to be paid in proportion to your labour.”  “I’ that case I wad whiles hae to say til a puir body ’at hadna anither pair i’ the warl’, ’at her ae pair o’ shune wasna worth men’in’; an’ that wad be a hert-brak, an’ sair feet forby, to sic as couldna, like yersel’, sir, gang upo’ the Lord’s ain shune.”  “But hoo mak ye a livin’ that w’y?” suggested Donal.  “Hoots, the maister o’ the trade sees to my wauges!”  “An’ wha may he be?” asked Donal, well foreseeing the answer.  “He was never cobbler himsel’, but he was ance carpenter; an’ noo he’s liftit up to be heid o’ a’ the trades. An’ there’s ae thing he canna bide, an’ that’s close parin’.”  He stopped. But Donal held his peace, waiting; and he went on.  “To them ’at maks little, for rizzons guid, by their neebour, he gies the better wauges whan they gang hame. To them ’at maks a’ ’at they can, he says, ‘Ye helpit yersel’; help awa’; ye hae yer reward. Only comena near me, for I canna bide ye.’--But aboot thae shune o’ yours, I dinna weel ken! They’re weel eneuch worth duin’ the best I can for them; but the morn’s Sunday, an’ what hae ye to put on?”  “Naething--till my kist comes; an’ that, I doobt, winna be afore Monday, or maybe the day efter.”  “An’ ye winna be a
