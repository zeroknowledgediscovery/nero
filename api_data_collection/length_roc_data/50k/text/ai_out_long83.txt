Chapter One: The Stranger on the Porch

The rain had started hours ago, a quiet drizzle at first, barely audible against the rustling dry leaves that carpeted the narrow front yard. By evening, it had swelled into a full-downpour, a heavy curtain of water that blurred the world outside the small bungalow on Taylor Avenue. Streetlamps flickered yellow halos into the night, casting the sidewalk into strange, shifting shadows.

Carmen wiped her hands on the hem of her hoodie and glanced through the peephole. The figure standing outside had been there for five solid minutes, unmoving. Just the outline of a woman — maybe mid-thirties, hard to say in the dim light — standing still under a red umbrella. Carmen's heart thudded. She glanced back down the hall. The twins were still on the couch, heads bowed over their tablets, the blue glow painting their faces like ghosts.

“Stay here,” she called, her voice unsteady. She unlocked the door and opened it just a crack.

“Can I help you?”

The woman looked up. She was soaked, despite the umbrella, with dark curls plastered to her forehead and cheeks flushed from the cold. There was something brittle in her eyes, something almost wild.

“You don’t know me,” the woman began, “but I—I need to ask you for something.”

Carmen tightened her grip on the door.

“You have the wrong house.”

“No,” the woman said quickly. “I know it’s strange. I know how it looks. But please—hear me out.”

A car passed, hissing through the wet street, and for a moment neither of them spoke.

“My name’s Lydia.” She paused. “I don’t have any family left. And I don’t have time. I need someone to take care of my kids.”

Carmen’s stomach dropped. The door started to close instinctively, but Lydia reached forward—not threatening, just a hand out, trembling.

“Please. Just listen for a minute.”

Carmen hadn’t meant to let her in. She would tell herself that for weeks, for months after. But Lydia had said “kids,” plural, and something about that had cracked open a hollow place inside Carmen that she hadn’t touched in years.

The living room was dim and warm, a contrast to the cold rain outside. Carmen made tea without asking, the way you do when you’re stalling, and Lydia sat on the edge of the couch like she was afraid it would bite her.

“They’re asleep. In the car,” Lydia said quietly.

“You left your kids in the car?”

“I needed to know if you’d even open the door first.” She didn’t flinch under Carmen’s stare. “I didn’t come here randomly. I’ve been watching. You’ve got your own—what are they, twins?”

Carmen didn’t answer.

“You keep them fed. You don’t yell in the yard. You walk them to school when it’s warm. I’ve seen enough bad to know when something’s… less bad.”

“That’s not exactly a glowing review.”

Lydia cracked a ghost of a smile. “It’s all I’ve got. Look—this isn’t a forever thing. Just… a few days. I can’t explain. I need to go somewhere, and I can’t take them with me.”

“Then take them to a shelter. Or the police.”

“They’d separate them.”

Carmen sipped her tea and didn’t reply.

Lydia reached into her coat and pulled out an envelope. Thick. Sealed with tape. She dropped it on the coffee table.

“There’s money in there. Enough for food. Rent for a few weeks if you want. I’ll be back. I swear it.”

“Do you even know who I am?”

“No,” Lydia said. “But I know how you look at your own kids. And I know I’ve run out of other options.”

Carmen stood under the awning watching the car’s brake lights fade into the rainy distance. She couldn’t believe she was doing this. Her brain screamed at her to call someone, to report it, to fix it the right way.

Instead, she opened the backseat and peered in.

The boy stirred first—dark-haired, maybe six, with a streak of dried blood on his cheek. The girl was younger, maybe four, curled around a stuffed fox like it was her only lifeline.

“Hi,” Carmen whispered. “I’m—uh—I’m Carmen. Let’s get you inside.”

The boy looked at her with open distrust, but didn’t fight. The girl didn’t wake up at all, just whimpered as Carmen lifted her.

She carried them both through the rain, wondering what the hell she’d just signed up for.

By morning, it was clear nothing about Lydia's story was going to be easy.

The boy’s name was Micah. He wouldn’t tell her the girl’s name at first, just said “she’s my sister.” He watched everything, didn’t cry, didn’t smile. Carmen recognized the look. It was the same one she’d seen in the mirror after her ex left.

She gave them cereal. Found old clothes from the twins’ smaller years. Called in sick from work.

That night, after her kids were asleep, Carmen opened the envelope Lydia had left.

There was cash. A lot of it. A crumpled photo of the two children in front of a worn-down house. And a note.

Don’t try to find me. Don’t trust anyone who asks about them. Keep them safe. Especially from the man with the silver wristwatch. - L

Carmen stared at the note for a long time. The handwriting was messy. Uneven. Rushed.

Then she turned off the light and went to bed with a kitchen knife under her pillow.

Over the next few days, the strangers became less strange. Carmen’s twins, Zoe and Ella, adapted quickly—too quickly, Carmen thought sometimes. They liked the idea of new playmates, even if Micah hardly ever spoke. The little girl, whose name turned out to be Rowan, followed Carmen everywhere. Watched her like a shadow. Flinched if someone raised their voice, even on TV.

Then came the knock at the door.

Not hard. Not loud. But deliberate.

Carmen froze in the hallway. Micah immediately pulled Rowan behind him, toward the kitchen.

Through the peephole, she saw a man in a gray suit. Bald. Tall. Calm. On his left wrist, a silver watch gleamed in the sunlight.

She didn’t answer.

The man waited. Knocked once more. Then left.

When she opened the door a crack, a white card lay on the mat. No name. Just an address. No message.

She burned it in the sink.

Carmen tried calling shelters. Schools. Missing persons lines. Nothing. No one matching Lydia’s description. No police reports on Micah or Rowan. No trace.

She asked Micah once, carefully, who the man with the silver watch was.

He looked her dead in the eyes and said, “He’s the reason Mommy ran.”

That night, she pushed the couch against the front door.

Weeks passed. The money lasted longer than she expected. Zoe and Ella went back to school. Carmen took up part-time remote work again. Micah started talking a little. Rowan laughed once, then not again for a long time.

Then one day, Carmen opened her email and found a message with no sender.

Subject line: “You can’t keep them hidden.”

And the only thing in the body of the message was:

You’re not the only one watching.

She stared at it for a long time before slamming the laptop shut.

That night, Lydia came back.

Bleeding.

And not alone.

Carmen hadn’t locked the door. She didn’t know why—habit maybe, or foolish hope—but when the knob turned just after midnight and the hinges gave a soft creak, she was already awake on the couch, heart thudding under the too-thin blanket. The living room lamp threw a pale glow across the floor, highlighting every slow footstep.

Lydia stepped inside, limping, her left hand clutching her side. Her coat was soaked through, stuck to her skin, and blood had begun to dry in thick patches along the seam near her ribs. Her hair hung loose in wild tangles, and her eyes darted toward the hallway.

“They okay?” she croaked.

“They’re asleep,” Carmen said, getting to her feet.

Lydia gave a slow nod and then collapsed onto the couch, gasping. Carmen knelt beside her without thinking. “What happened?”

“I didn’t have time,” Lydia said, wincing as she tried to sit up straighter. “They found me. I got away, but not clean.”

“I should call someone. A doctor—”

“No. No hospitals. Please.”

There was a desperate edge in Lydia’s voice that left no room for argument. Carmen hesitated, then went to fetch a towel and a bottle of peroxide from under the bathroom sink. The blood was mostly superficial—shallow cuts, bruising along the ribs, some deeper gouges on her back. She worked quickly and quietly, the sting of antiseptic sharp in the air.

“They sent someone here,” Carmen said at last, not looking up. “Tall guy. Bald. Silver watch.”

Lydia’s entire body went rigid.

“Did he talk to the kids?” she asked.

“No. Just left a card on the mat. Blank except an address.”

Lydia exhaled, low and rough. “Then we’ve got time. Not much, but some.”

“You said a few days,” Carmen said. “It’s been two weeks.”

“I know. I didn’t think they’d be that fast. Thought I had more time to throw them off.”

Carmen threw the bloodied towel in the laundry basket and sat across from her. “Who are you, Lydia? Who’s after you?”

Lydia looked at her for a long moment. Then she leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper.

“They think I stole something. But I didn’t. I only found it.”

“Found what?”

“Proof. Names. Transfers. It was buried—old records from a place I used to work. A facility upstate. A private contractor, supposedly medical, but really just another front for them. The whole thing was a shell game. Illegal testing. Disappearing people. Kids.”

Carmen’s skin prickled.

“I was a data clerk. They didn’t think I mattered. But I saw things. I made a copy of a few files. Thought maybe I’d take it to the press. Then I realized people who tried that had a tendency to vanish.”

“And you had kids.”

“Exactly,” Lydia said. “Micah was born while I was still there. Rowan came after. Once I saw what they did to the others—children—God, I couldn’t risk staying. So I ran.”

Carmen was silent. She wanted to doubt it, needed to for her own sanity, but something in Lydia’s eyes told her it wasn’t a fantasy. The kind of fear that lived in the bones.

“You think they want the kids?”

“I think they want silence,” Lydia said. “And my kids are the only leverage they need.”

In the days that followed, Carmen felt the ground beneath her life shift in ways she hadn’t expected. Lydia stayed hidden in the attic during daylight, venturing down only after sunset. They made a plan—rough, imperfect—but a plan nonetheless. They would leave the city. Find somewhere anonymous. Safe. Lydia had contacts, she said, people who owed her favors from before everything went sideways. Carmen didn’t ask too many questions.

Micah began to open up more. He told Carmen about a house with gray walls and buzzing lights, a place with white-coated men who smiled too much and rooms that always smelled like bleach. Rowan had night terrors—silent, writhing things that left her breathless and clinging to Carmen in the dark.

Once, Carmen found a thin scar behind Micah’s ear. When she asked, he only said, “That’s where the doctor put the needle.”

Her stomach turned.

Lydia never spoke about the place directly again, but sometimes Carmen would catch her staring at the window, jaw clenched, hands shaking.

One night, after putting the kids to bed, Carmen asked, “How much danger are we really in?”

Lydia didn’t answer right away.

“They don’t want the kids back because they love them,” she said finally. “They want to know what was done to them. What stuck. What didn’t.”

“You mean… experiments?”

Lydia nodded. “They were testing something. Micah’s blood showed anomalies. Strong resistance to certain neurotoxins. Immunity markers that shouldn’t exist. It wasn’t natural. I think they tried to engineer it and ended up getting more than they bargained for.”

“What about Rowan?”

“She was born after I left. Never touched the place. But Micah says they were watching her too. She’s… different.”

“Different how?”

“Just watch her next time she draws. Look at the shapes. The patterns. You’ll see.”

That weekend, Carmen took the kids to the park, needing a break from the house that had started to feel too small, too watched. Lydia stayed behind, too weak to walk far. The park was crowded, but open. Carmen relaxed slightly. Zoe and Ella darted between the swings while Micah stuck close to Rowan, guiding her around the climbing structures like a bodyguard.

Carmen sat on a bench, eyes scanning out of habit.

That’s when she saw the man again.

Not bald this time. No silver watch. But the same posture. The same stillness.

Watching.

He wasn’t looking at her. He was looking at Micah.

Carmen stood slowly and crossed the grass toward her kids. She scooped Rowan up, took Zoe and Ella by the hands. “Come on,” she said. “We’re leaving.”

“Why?” Zoe whined. “We just got—”

“Now.”

The man didn’t follow. He didn’t even move. But as they left, Carmen glanced back and saw him raise something to his mouth—a phone, a radio—and murmur a few quiet words.

That night, they started packing.

Lydia found an old SUV from a friend who didn’t ask questions. Carmen withdrew the rest of the money. They bought fake IDs, burner phones, maps instead of GPS.

And two days later, under cover of dawn, they left Taylor Avenue behind.

But as the city disappeared in the rearview mirror and the road opened ahead, Carmen couldn’t shake the feeling that something had already found them. That they hadn’t just been watched.

They’d been marked.

Chapter Two: Crossroads in Hollow Creek

The town of Hollow Creek wasn’t on most maps. Carmen had picked it from a crumpled atlas Lydia kept tucked under the passenger seat, her finger landing by chance between two frayed folds. It was the kind of place where mailboxes leaned and gas stations doubled as grocery stores. The landscape shifted as they drove—the cracked sprawl of the city giving way to rolling hills and narrow bridges that looked too fragile for their weight. Trees clustered close to the roadside, like they were leaning in to listen.

They arrived just after noon, the sky blank and low with clouds. The town was a single main street flanked by shuttered storefronts and sagging awnings. A faded sign welcomed them with the words: “Hollow Creek – Est. 1873. Population 1,406.” Carmen stared at the number a moment too long, wondering if it was still accurate. Wondering if someone like her would even be counted.

They rented a small house on the edge of town, a one-story brick thing with crooked steps and a leaning chimney. The owner—a lanky man with sunspots and nicotine-stained fingers—handed over the keys without much talk, just a tired shrug and a muttered, “Pay cash, don’t ask, don’t tell. Fine by me.” It was perfect.

Inside, the place smelled like old books and mothballs. The plumbing whined when Carmen turned on the taps. A single heater in the hallway gave off weak warmth, and the back door’s lock needed a firm shoulder push to shut. But it had four walls, a roof, and silence. That was enough.

Micah took the smallest room without complaint, pulling Rowan’s mattress close to his. They still wouldn’t sleep apart. Zoe and Ella, who’d been mostly quiet since they left the city, seemed to understand something heavy had settled over them all. They didn’t ask when they were going back. Carmen didn’t lie about it either.

They weren’t going back.

Hollow Creek had the sleepy rhythm of a town that hadn’t changed in decades. The grocery store had one register and a corkboard full of handwritten ads—Firewood $5/bundle, Room for Rent, Missing Cat, responds to “Pickle.” People noticed Carmen and the kids, but they didn’t ask many questions. She introduced herself as a widow named Marla Jensen, and no one pressed for details. Lydia stayed hidden most days, only going out in a thick scarf and sunglasses. Her limp had worsened.

“I’ve got a contact in Roanoke,” Lydia said one night over instant coffee. “Name’s Marcus. He’s got a line into a journalist. Someone not on the payroll.”

“You trust him?” Carmen asked, watching steam curl from her cup.

“I trust him more than I trust being found.”

Micah had taken to drawing strange symbols in the margins of his schoolwork. Carmen noticed it first when helping him with a reading worksheet—tiny spirals, zigzag shapes, and repeating clusters of lines that looked like a kind of code. When she asked about it, he shrugged.

“They’re dreams,” he said. “I remember them better this way.”

“Are you having bad dreams?”

“Not bad. Just… not mine.”

She didn’t push. Instead, she saved the pages, stuffing them in a drawer when he wasn’t looking.

One morning, while Carmen was filling out school registration forms at the Hollow Creek Elementary front office, the receptionist glanced up with mild curiosity.

“We don’t get a lot of transfers this time of year,” she said, adjusting her glasses.

“We just needed a change,” Carmen replied, keeping her voice light.

“Well, our teachers are good. Small class sizes. Kids usually do better here than in the cities.”

Carmen nodded. She was about to ask about bus routes when the door behind the counter opened and a woman stepped through. Mid-forties, sharp features, a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.

“New enrollment?” the woman asked.

“Yes. My two—Zoe and Ella Jensen. And these two—cousins. Micah and Rowan.”

The woman’s eyes lingered on the names. Carmen felt her pulse stutter.

“I’m Ms. Denning,” the woman said. “Vice Principal. Let us know if they have any special needs. Medical conditions. Or behavioral things.”

“Of course.”

They shook hands. Ms. Denning’s skin was cold.

Back at the house, Lydia was waiting with the laptop open. She waved Carmen over, pointing at the screen.

“I got an email from Marcus. Coded, but it’s him.”

“What’s it say?”

“He wants to meet. Says they’ve intercepted chatter. That someone’s tracking a pair of kids that match Micah and Rowan’s profile.”

“Here? In Hollow Creek?”

Lydia hesitated. “Not yet. But close.”

Carmen felt the walls pressing in. “We just got here. The kids just started feeling normal again.”

“There’s no normal anymore,” Lydia said. “We move or we die.”

That night, Micah woke up screaming.

Carmen rushed to his room, heart pounding. He sat bolt upright, eyes wild, Rowan clinging to his side.

“They’re in the trees,” he whispered. “I saw them. They were watching.”

Carmen checked the windows. Nothing but wind and shadows. Still, she moved their mattresses into the living room and stayed up all night, eyes fixed on the back door.

In the morning, she found footprints by the kitchen window. Not hers. Not Lydia’s. A deep set of boot prints in the frost.

They didn’t call. Didn’t knock. Just stood there.

Watching.

Two days later, they left Hollow Creek in the middle of the night.

No goodbyes. No explanations.

Just headlights on an empty road, and the sound of Rowan crying softly into her stuffed fox.

They didn’t speak again until the sun rose behind them.

The road out of Hollow Creek was narrower than Carmen remembered. The trees arched in over the asphalt like ribs, the early morning light dripping through in thin gold threads. Lydia sat in the passenger seat with the map on her lap and a thermos gripped tightly in her hand, her knuckles white. The kids were asleep in the backseat, tangled together in a pile of legs and jackets. Carmen kept one eye on the rearview mirror, even though the road had been empty for miles.

“They were getting close,” Lydia said without looking up. “Too close.”

“You said Roanoke. How far?”

“If we stay off the interstate? About six hours.”

“And after that?”

Lydia didn’t answer right away. She traced a path with her finger along a dotted road on the map, then folded it slowly and rested it on her lap.

“After that, we find a place to disappear for good.”

They drove until the sun was high, stopping only once at a gas station that smelled like fried grease and bleach. Carmen paid cash for everything—fuel, water, a bag of apples, a box of cereal, a road atlas just in case Lydia’s tore clean through at the fold. The attendant, a young man with sleepy eyes and earbuds, didn’t look twice at them.

Back on the road, the silence stretched. Carmen glanced at Lydia again, then spoke softly. “You haven’t told me what happened to their father.”

Lydia exhaled sharply, the kind of breath that comes before pain.

“He was part of it,” she said. “Not at first. We met before I ever got that job. He was sweet. Smart. Knew how to fix things—real mechanical mind. But he always had a streak in him. The kind of man who gets a little too interested when people start talking about power and potential.”

Carmen kept her eyes on the road.

“When I found out what they were doing, I went to him first. Told him we needed to leave, to go somewhere far. He told me I was being dramatic. That it was all in the name of science. That we were doing the world a favor.”

“And when you ran?”

Lydia gave a short, bitter laugh. “He helped them look. He called in favors. Used what he knew to track me. I got lucky—I had help. A nurse. An old janitor who’d seen too much and didn’t care anymore. They got me out, but it cost.”

“He’s still alive?”

“Oh, yeah,” Lydia said, voice cold. “He’s still on the payroll. Still doing what he does best.”

They were quiet again. Carmen didn’t press.

They made it to Roanoke by mid-afternoon. The city was bigger than Hollow Creek, but small enough that they didn’t stand out. Carmen found a cheap motel on the edge of town, the kind with flickering signs and rooms that smelled like mildew. She paid for three nights up front, and Lydia made the call to Marcus from a gas station payphone, even though Carmen thought it was overcautious.

“He said meet at 8,” Lydia reported back. “Public place. Quiet. Safe.”

Carmen stayed behind with the kids. Lydia left just before sunset, wearing a different coat and a pair of sunglasses too large for her face. She walked like someone going to a funeral.

When she hadn’t returned by midnight, Carmen started pacing.

By one, she was sure something had gone wrong.

She waited until two, then bundled the kids into the car and drove to the meet location herself—a diner near the train station, half-lit with neon, empty except for a waitress wiping down the counter. No sign of Lydia. No Marcus. No anything.

She asked the waitress if a woman matching Lydia’s description had come in.

“Lady with the limp?” the woman asked. “Came in around eight. Sat in the corner. Left before she ordered. Some guy followed her out.”

“Guy?” Carmen’s throat tightened.

“Tall. Big coat. Looked like he didn’t belong here.”

Carmen thanked her, then drove aimlessly for an hour, circling blocks, scanning sidewalks. Nothing.

She returned to the motel just before sunrise.

Micah was awake, sitting by the window with Rowan asleep beside him. He turned to her with tired eyes.

“They have her, don’t they?” he said quietly.

“I don’t know,” Carmen replied, her voice breaking.

But she did.

The next morning, a package arrived at the motel.

No return address. Just their room number scribbled in red pen.

Carmen opened it carefully. Inside was a phone—cheap, plastic, disposable—and a single Polaroid.

It was Lydia. Tied to a chair. Eyes open. Blood on her shirt. A date scrawled across the bottom in sharp black ink: June 30.

The phone vibrated as soon as Carmen touched it.

A text message appeared.

You want her alive. Bring the boy.

She stared at it for a long time.

Then she put the photo away, tucked the phone in her bag, and turned to Micah.

“We’re going to need a plan,” she said.

They spent the day holed up in the motel, curtains drawn, lights dim. Carmen pulled every scrap of information Lydia had shared from memory and wrote it down: names, facility codes, cities, nicknames, dates. She opened Micah’s schoolwork and laid out his drawings—the patterns, the symbols, the dreams.

“You remember anything else?” she asked him.

He nodded slowly. “They used to give me pictures. Told me to draw them again. But backwards. Said they were testing my memory.”

“What kind of pictures?”

“Like the ones I’ve been making. Circles inside circles. Letters that aren’t letters.”

“And what about Rowan?”

Micah hesitated. “She can hear things. In people. I don’t know how to explain it. Sometimes she tells me what people are feeling even when they don’t say anything.”

Carmen felt a chill run down her spine.

“She’s… like a mirror,” he added. “She shows them back their own noise.”

Carmen stood up and crossed to the sink. She ran cold water over her wrists and tried to breathe.

The phone buzzed again.

You have five days. No cops. No lies. You bring the boy, or we bring the house down.

She deleted the message.

That night, Carmen found a burner laptop in a pawn shop down the street and used it to contact Marcus directly. She didn’t trust him, but he was all she had. The email was short.

She’s been taken. They want Micah. I need a way in. I need to end this.

She didn’t expect a reply until morning.

It came within ten minutes.

You’ll never find them alone. But I know where they keep the others. Meet me tomorrow, 9 a.m., Clifton Quarry. Come alone.

She stared at the message. At the phrase the others.

She didn’t sleep that night.

Neither did Micah.

The morning sun filtered through the dirty motel curtains in shafts of pale yellow light. Carmen watched the dust hang in the air like suspended time, unmoving, fragile. Clifton Quarry was twenty miles outside Roanoke—half-abandoned, overgrown, once a limestone site that had shut down after a series of quiet worker injuries and one unspoken death. Lydia had once mentioned it in passing, calling it “one of the dark ones.” A place where things had happened that no one recorded.

Carmen packed a backpack with essentials: a flashlight, rope, bottled water, the Polaroid, the burner phone, a small crowbar she found in the motel’s laundry room. She gave Micah instructions not to open the door for anyone, not even her, unless she said the phrase "Blue door, red handle." He nodded solemnly, hands folded on his lap, Rowan tucked in beside him with her fox clutched under her arm.

“If I don’t come back by tonight,” she started, but Micah cut her off.

“You will.”

There was something in his voice—calm, definite, too old for his years. Carmen didn’t argue. She just pressed her hand against his head, then left without looking back.

The road to the quarry wound through scrub and rusting farm fences, wide swaths of land where nothing seemed to grow anymore. The air was thick and quiet, the kind of silence that chokes sound before it starts. Her tires crunched over gravel as she pulled off the main road and followed a barely visible trail into the trees.

Clifton Quarry appeared like a wound in the earth—gray limestone cliffs torn into jagged spines, scaffolding rusted and hanging like skeletal arms over pools of stagnant water. There were no signs. No fences. Just a stillness that seemed deliberate.

Marcus was waiting near the base of the largest overhang, wearing a hooded jacket and old jeans. His face was lean, his eyes sunken. Carmen recognized him from a photo Lydia once showed her, but even that had been ten years and thirty pounds ago.

“You’re brave,” he said, not bothering with a greeting.

“Where is she?”

“They moved her. She's not far. But getting to her isn't the hard part.”

“What is?”

He pointed up, toward the northern ridge. “See that? That’s where the old transport tunnel used to run. Leads to a compound carved into the cliff. Military-grade once. Now private use. Off-books. That’s where they’ve got the others.”

“What others?”

“Subjects. Failures. Kids who didn’t pass their protocols. Some of them don’t talk anymore. Some of them can’t. One of them hasn't blinked in five years.”

Carmen stared at him.

“You’re telling me they kept them alive?”

“Kept? No. Used.”

“And you just know this because…?”

“I used to be on payroll too. Logistics. Back when I thought this was some covert humanitarian program. Lydia wasn’t the only one who got a rude awakening.”

He handed her a keycard. Plain white. No markings.

“This’ll get you through the first gate. Maybe. After that, you’re on your own.”

“You’re not coming?”

“I’m a coward, not a liar,” he said. “They catch me again, I disappear. I’ve already been warned once.”

Carmen didn’t thank him. She just pocketed the card, turned, and started walking toward the cliff face.

The tunnel entrance was half-hidden behind a collapsed outbuilding and a thick curtain of moss. Carmen found a keypad mounted beside a metal door, barely visible beneath years of grime. The keycard slid through easily, and the door clicked open with a sound that felt too loud.

Inside, the tunnel was cold and damp. Concrete walls stretched into darkness, broken only by flickering fluorescent lights overhead. Carmen moved quickly but cautiously, her ears straining for any sound that didn’t belong—footsteps, movement, breathing.

She passed through a second door using the card. The corridor beyond branched left and right, marked by faded arrows and numbers: Block A, Storage, Med Archive. She chose left.

After a few hundred feet, she found the first cell.

The room was small, windowless. A narrow bed. A tray with uneaten food. A child, no older than ten, sat in the corner with her knees pulled to her chest, eyes glassy, rocking slightly. She didn’t look up when Carmen entered. Carmen didn’t speak, just backed out, heart pounding.

She moved on.

In Block C, the doors were heavier, sealed with bolts instead of locks. Carmen peeked through the narrow view windows where she could. One room held a boy with tubes in his arms, asleep or sedated, a monitor blinking faint green in the gloom. Another was empty, smeared with dried blood and a single discarded shoe.

At the end of the corridor, she found her.

Lydia was tied to a chair, her face swollen, one eye nearly shut. A guard sat beside her with a magazine on his lap, half-asleep.

Carmen didn’t hesitate.

She lifted the crowbar and brought it down hard on the back of his neck.

He dropped instantly, chair clattering, arms twitching.

Lydia groaned as Carmen knelt beside her, cutting through zip ties with a utility knife from the bag.

“You came,” Lydia whispered.

“They were going to move you again.”

“They already started the process.”

Carmen helped her up. Lydia staggered but stayed on her feet.

“There are kids here,” Carmen said. “Dozens.”

“I know.”

“We can’t leave them.”

Lydia looked at her, eyes blazing despite the swelling.

“I didn’t plan to.”

The escape wasn’t clean.

By the time they reached the main hall, an alarm had started. Red lights spun overhead. Footsteps echoed from all directions.

“Emergency staircase,” Lydia hissed, pointing. “Behind the med archive.”

They moved fast, ducking between crates and columns, dragging a boy with them—maybe eleven, wide-eyed and silent. Carmen didn’t know his name, but he followed them willingly.

A siren began to blare. A voice barked orders over the intercom, too garbled to understand.

At the top of the stairs, two men waited with rifles.

Carmen froze.

Then the boy stepped forward.

He didn’t speak.

He didn’t move.

But the lights above them flickered, then popped.

The two men clutched their heads and screamed, dropping to their knees.

Blood dripped from their noses. Then ears.

Then silence.

The boy blinked once.

And kept walking.

They made it out before backup arrived.

Carmen drove. Lydia passed out in the backseat with the boy’s head on her shoulder. The sun was setting again, orange light flashing through the trees like fire.

She didn’t know where they would go next.

But for the first time since this nightmare began, she knew one thing.

They weren’t running anymore.

They were fighting back.

Chapter Three: Signals in the Static

The first safehouse was a farmhouse north of Richmond, hidden down a gravel road flanked by trees with limbs like outstretched arms. Carmen found it through a number passed on by Marcus before he vanished—no warning, no goodbye, just silence after that night at Clifton Quarry. The house belonged to an older woman named Maureen who didn’t flinch when Carmen showed up with two children she hadn’t had the week before, a half-conscious Lydia, and a boy who hadn’t spoken a word but had already stopped two surveillance drones dead in the air with a single glance.

“You got twenty-four hours,” Maureen had said, leaning against the doorway, smoking a cigarette down to the filter. “Then you’re someone else’s problem.”

That was fine. Carmen didn’t expect grace anymore.

Inside, the house creaked with age. The wallpaper peeled in long strips and the power flickered when too many lights were on. But there was hot water, clean linens, and a pantry full of canned goods. Carmen tucked the children into cots upstairs and sat watch all night by the front window, the crowbar across her knees.

She didn’t sleep.

In the morning, Lydia was sitting up. Her eye was still swollen, her lip split, but she looked more like herself. She had a mug of black coffee cupped in her hands, steam curling up against her bruised cheek.

“You should rest,” Carmen said.

“I’ve been unconscious for half a day. That’s enough rest.”

Carmen sat down across from her at the old wooden table. The boy—who still hadn’t given them a name—was sitting in the corner, sketching in the margins of an old catalog he’d found. Spirals again. Always spirals.

“Who is he?” Carmen asked.

Lydia looked toward him. “His number was 83A. They didn’t bother giving him a name. One of the last groups they pulled in before I escaped. I think they were trying something new with that batch. Less chemical, more... signal-based.”

“Signal?”

“Frequencies. Brainwave modulations. We used to joke about mind control in the early days, back when we thought it was still science fiction. But by the end, it wasn’t a joke.”

Carmen looked toward the boy. “Is he dangerous?”

“Only to them,” Lydia said, and then, after a pause: “And maybe to himself.”

Carmen said nothing.

Later that day, Maureen handed Carmen a prepaid phone and muttered, “Your ghost left you a message.” She lit another cigarette and walked away before Carmen could ask what that meant.

There was one message on the phone. Text only.

You’re not alone. The relay wakes at midnight. Listen for the static.
—R

Carmen stared at it for several seconds. Then she showed it to Lydia.

“R,” Lydia said softly. “Reid.”

“Friend?”

“Not exactly. He’s the one who got me out the second time. And the one who sold the footage of 37C to the underground. He’s a broker. Smarter than most. Greedier too.”

“And the relay?”

Lydia shook her head. “It’s a pirate signal. Shortwave. Shows up once every few weeks on different frequencies. Sometimes it’s just noise, sometimes… it’s messages. Maps. Drops. Passwords.”

“So this is a scavenger hunt.”

Lydia shrugged. “That’s how it’s always been.”

That night, Carmen found an old shortwave radio in Maureen’s attic. Dusty, wires frayed, but it worked. She sat with Lydia at the kitchen table, tuning carefully as midnight approached. The air outside was still, silent. The kind of quiet that usually came before a storm.

At 12:03 a.m., the static changed.

It was subtle at first—just a shift in tone, like someone tuning a violin an octave too low. Then a sequence of beeps began. Slow, then rapid, then slow again. Carmen scribbled them down. Morse.

.-- . ... - / --. .- - . / 17

“West gate seventeen,” Lydia translated. “That’s an entrance code. And a location.”

“To what?”

Lydia’s eyes narrowed. “Site Lambda.”

Carmen didn’t like the way she said that.

They left before dawn.

Maureen didn’t ask questions, just waved from the porch and muttered something about bad blood and worse luck. Carmen handed her a wad of cash Lydia had tucked in the lining of her jacket.

“Godspeed,” the old woman said, and that was that.

The journey to Site Lambda took them south, deep into the Appalachian foothills. The trees grew thicker, the roads narrower. Carmen stayed off GPS and relied on Lydia’s half-remembered directions, scrawled notes, and occasional signs hidden in plain sight—spray-painted rocks, trail markers that didn’t match any official system. Micah sat quietly in the backseat, watching the trees. Rowan held her fox tightly and hummed to herself. 83A—the boy—rarely blinked, but when he did, he always looked in the direction they were going, never back.

They reached a remote access road by dusk. The gate was unguarded but closed—heavy steel with no panel. Carmen parked a short distance away. Lydia walked up, tapped the edge with her knuckle in a rhythm. The gate opened.

“How?” Carmen asked, watching it creak aside.

“Some locks still listen to ghosts.”

Beyond the gate, the road turned to gravel and then dirt. They followed it by foot until they came upon a cluster of concrete bunkers half-sunk into the ground like buried scars. They looked abandoned—ivy climbing the walls, rust bleeding from the hinges.

But when 83A approached one of them, the door hissed and clicked open.

Inside was a staircase descending into darkness.

They hesitated only briefly.

Then they stepped into the silence below.

The air in Site Lambda was dry and stale, like breathing dust. Emergency lights cast an amber glow along the hallways, flickering in uncertain intervals. The complex had the feel of something unfinished—bare wires looped from the ceiling, cables ran through water-stained gutters, and walls bore smudges like fingerprints that never faded.

They moved in silence, Carmen leading with her flashlight, Lydia close behind with the boy. Micah stayed between them, gripping Rowan’s hand tightly.

“What are we looking for?” Carmen asked after they’d passed the third empty observation room.

“Answers,” Lydia replied. “The files they never got to destroy. Proof.”

The fourth door led into what had once been a control room. Banks of screens lined the wall, dead now, coated with a fine layer of dust. Carmen stepped over a toppled chair and moved toward the console. Lydia flipped open an old cabinet and whistled.

“Backups,” she said, holding up a weathered external drive. “They missed these.”

83A stepped forward and placed a hand flat against one of the monitors. The screen flared to life for a moment—just static, then a flicker of numbers, then darkness.

He stepped back.

Lydia looked at Carmen. “They’re still running scans somewhere. Someone’s still plugged in.”

“That means they’re watching?”

“Worse,” Lydia said. “They’re waiting.”

They heard the noise before they saw the light—distant, mechanical, the thud of hydraulics and the low whir of something powering up.

“We need to go,” Carmen said.

Lydia grabbed the drive, Carmen grabbed the kids, and they turned back down the hallway.

Behind them, a new door opened.

From it came the sound of something breathing.

But not human.

Something slower. Deeper. Engineered.

83A turned, stared into the dark, and muttered the first word anyone had heard from him since they’d escaped the compound.

“Run.”

They ran.

The sound behind them followed—a low, metallic scrape, like steel fingers dragging across concrete, followed by something wet, almost rhythmic. Carmen didn’t look back. She couldn’t. Lydia pushed ahead with the hard drive clutched tight to her chest, one arm gripping Rowan. Micah ran on his own, his breath ragged but steady. 83A brought up the rear, not even panting, just turning every few seconds with his jaw clenched and eyes narrowed.

The tunnel curved and split. Carmen turned left instinctively, skidding on the damp floor, her boots nearly slipping. The emergency lights overhead began to flicker more rapidly now, almost pulsing. Rowan tripped, scraped her knee, but Carmen scooped her up without stopping. She could hear something behind them now—something that was trying to mimic footsteps, but couldn’t quite get the rhythm right.

“What is it?” she shouted.

“I don’t know!” Lydia yelled back, her voice raw. “They never finished it! It was from the second phase—subject AI-Δ!”

Carmen didn’t ask what that meant.

A door appeared on the left—half-open, lit with the green glow of emergency power. She kicked it fully open and shoved the kids inside. The room was lined with lockers, some open, some still sealed. A workstation blinked faintly in the corner. It smelled of dust and ozone.

Lydia slammed the door shut behind them and bolted it with a thick metal pin.

A heartbeat later, something heavy slammed against the other side.

The wall shook. Dust rained from the ceiling.

“Not long,” Lydia gasped. “We have minutes.”

Carmen grabbed a chair and jammed it under the door handle.

“What the hell is it?” she asked again, quieter this time.

Lydia leaned against the wall, panting. “It was part of an autonomous unit. Meant to track psychic resonance. Designed to mimic thought patterns. But it couldn’t separate thought from memory. From identity. It started copying the kids.”

“Copying?”

Lydia nodded. “It didn’t just mimic behavior. It absorbed it. Every scream, every nightmare, every echo of fear—it turned it all into code. That was the flaw.”

Another slam hit the door. The pin bent slightly.

Micah backed away, clutching Rowan’s hand so hard she winced. The boy—83A—walked to the door and stood there, hand pressed flat against the metal.

“No,” he whispered.

Carmen reached for him. “Get away from there!”

But he didn’t move.

He closed his eyes.

Outside, the banging stopped.

Silence.

Not just quiet—complete absence. The kind of silence that comes when the air itself holds its breath.

Then the door buckled inward as if struck by a wrecking ball.

Carmen stumbled backward. Lydia caught Rowan. Micah screamed.

But the door didn’t fall.

Instead, it bent outward—toward the hallway.

83A remained still.

Then, slowly, he opened his eyes.

Blood trickled from his nose, from his ears, even his fingertips.

But he smiled.

The banging stopped entirely.

“I sent it away,” he whispered.

Then he collapsed.

They didn’t wait.

Carmen threw open the opposite door, leading out the back of the locker room into another hall—one with stairs marked EXIT ACCESS in faded letters.

They climbed.

Lydia nearly fell twice. Carmen carried the boy. He didn’t wake, but he was breathing.

They reached a service hatch and kicked it open into overgrown brush and cold night air.

The sky above them was moonless, but full of stars.

For the first time in hours, Carmen let herself exhale.

They were alive.

They found another car two miles down the road, abandoned at an old ranger station. It started after Lydia hotwired it, and the gas tank was half full. They didn’t speak for the first hour of driving. Just silence, broken only by Rowan’s breathing and the occasional rattle of the hard drive in Lydia’s lap.

Eventually, Carmen said, “That thing back there… is it gone?”

Lydia shook her head slowly. “It’s gone for now. But it knows us now. It knows him.”

She looked at 83A in the rearview mirror, slumped unconscious in the backseat.

“He shut it down?”

“He shut it out. There’s a difference.”

Carmen gripped the wheel tighter.

Micah, sitting beside his sister, finally spoke.

“I heard it whispering.”

“Whispering what?” Carmen asked.

He looked out the window.

“It was saying we were all already copies.”

Lydia closed her eyes and leaned back.

They drove through the night until they found a truck stop on the state line. Bright lights, a handful of parked rigs, and a diner that promised “Coffee strong enough to start your heart.” Carmen pulled into the lot and parked between two semis. They needed a plan. They needed to breathe.

Inside, the diner was mostly empty. A bored teenager leaned against the counter while an old jukebox played a crackling rendition of “House of the Rising Sun.” Carmen ordered pancakes and five coffees. The waitress didn’t ask questions.

Lydia sat across from her with a notepad open, sketching a rough map of everything she remembered from the compound. Room numbers, equipment, locations, dates. Carmen chewed on cold eggs and tried not to think about how many children had been locked in those rooms.

Across the booth, 83A finally stirred.

His eyes opened slowly. He blinked several times, then whispered, “My name’s Jonah.”

Carmen blinked.

Lydia reached across the table and took his hand.

“Hello, Jonah,” she said gently.

He smiled.

The drive resumed before dawn. Carmen headed west this time. Through Tennessee, then into Arkansas, following no highway for too long, changing direction often, switching vehicles whenever they found one unlocked and unattended. They left no trail.

By the time they reached the outskirts of an abandoned mining town, they had found a rhythm—broken, irregular, but steady. Rowan was laughing again. Micah had stopped flinching at every loud noise. Jonah still hadn’t said much more, but when he spoke, it was deliberate.

And one night, as they sat around a fire behind an old church, he looked at Carmen and said, “They’re building another one.”

Carmen stiffened. “Another what?”

“Another machine. A better one. And they’re feeding it memories from people who never existed.”

“How do you know?”

“Because I remember them.”

Carmen didn’t sleep that night.

None of them did.

The stars above were bright, too bright, and somewhere in the trees beyond, the wind began to whisper things in a language no one should ever know.

Chapter Four: The Hollow Archive

The mine town—called Elioth in cracked signage and forgotten property deeds—hadn’t seen people in decades. Half the houses had collapsed into themselves, and those that hadn’t were overrun by vines and mold that spread like a slow infection. Carmen found a narrow brick building near the end of what had once been Main Street, with shattered windows but a dry attic. It was enough.

They moved in silently, instinctively, unpacking bags they never kept fully packed. The children took the upstairs room. Carmen and Lydia barricaded the staircase each night with a dresser and nailed a steel rod across the back door. They didn’t talk much during the day. Nights were worse—dreams too vivid, shadows that shifted slightly when no one was looking.

Carmen marked each day on the wall with a nail scratch. It helped, somehow.

On the sixth day, Lydia made contact with a name from her past—someone called Warren, who had once worked inside a communications tower outside St. Louis. “Used to handle internal broadcast filtration,” she explained as she typed on the burner laptop. “He’s one of the last people who still has access to physical backups. The ones they didn’t digitize.”

Carmen frowned. “Why not?”

“Because some data never should’ve been uploaded. Even they knew that.”

“What's in these backups?”

Lydia hesitated. “The Hollow Archive.”

Carmen didn’t like the name. “Why hollow?”

“Because everything inside it has been erased from public systems. Redacted from birth certificates, employment logs, hospital databases, everything. People who existed, and then didn’t. Memories that became state secrets. Programs they buried under layers of unrelated metadata. They never expected anyone to pull it together.”

“And Warren has it?”

“He has the index. Maybe not the whole thing. But enough to point us to the origin of this entire operation.”

Carmen leaned against the wall and exhaled. “What do we do when we find it?”

“We find out what they’re trying to become,” Lydia said, her voice quieter. “Because this isn’t about science anymore. Not really. It’s about control.”

They left Elioth the next morning under a thin veil of fog. The air was cold, filled with the scent of old smoke and wet earth. Jonah had taken to staring out the window, head tilted like he could hear something no one else could. Rowan held his hand now more than Micah’s, as though some quiet understanding had passed between them.

By the time they reached the edge of Missouri, Carmen realized they were being followed again.

It wasn’t obvious. No tail lights in the mirror, no dark SUVs this time. But things shifted slightly. Gas station clerks stared too long. A blue car showed up in two separate towns on opposite sides of the state. Once, a man in a beige coat stepped out of a diner just as Carmen was leaving and said her assumed name—Marla Jensen—under his breath like a curse.

She didn’t wait. They drove straight through that night, past St. Louis and into the rust-colored hills beyond. Warren’s directions led them to a structure half-eaten by trees—a decommissioned data facility that had once processed long-range communications for government field teams. Now it stood rotting, its windows boarded, its roof peeled back in places like old skin.

They found Warren inside, surrounded by towers of paper boxes and humming server stacks patched together with parts that hadn’t been manufactured in fifteen years. He looked like a scarecrow in a thermal vest—thin, wild-haired, with eyes that jittered as though his thoughts moved too quickly to contain.

“You brought them here,” he said as soon as they stepped inside. “They’ll find you. Even in here.”

Lydia moved forward. “We need the index.”

“You’re already in it,” Warren said.

“What?”

He tapped the side of his head. “They track you by thought signature. By conceptual residue. You think about escape, they register avoidance. You think about secrets, they taste static. The only way to hide is to be boring. Invisible. Emotionally flat.”

Carmen narrowed her eyes. “That’s why they want the children. They’re not emotionally flat.”

“They’re signal bursts,” Warren said. “Micah hums across the full bandwidth of empathic range. Rowan emits emotional reflection. And Jonah?” He paused, swallowed hard. “Jonah writes frequency.”

“I don’t understand,” Carmen said.

“His drawings. They’re not images. They’re pulse patterns. He’s not remembering things—he’s sending them. He’s already in their system.”

Jonah, standing quietly near the door, looked up.

“They’ve started building the next gate,” he said. “It’s almost ready.”

Everyone went still.

Warren turned to his server stack and pulled out a hard drive the size of a shoebox. “Here. The index. It maps all erased r
