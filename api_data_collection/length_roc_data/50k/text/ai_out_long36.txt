Title: The Green Flame

Chapter One: The Mireborn

Mud caked his boots, and not the usual slimy gray of the Slitherfen—but a darker, heavier muck that clung like regret. Skrag shuffled forward, hunched low, as if his shoulders had grown tired of bearing his own misfortune.

“Stupid rain,” he muttered, pulling the hood tighter over his crooked ears. “Stupid sun when it’s not rain. Stupid... everything.”

Skrag was a goblin, and by all accounts, a proper one. He picked his nose with vigor, had a fondness for shiny things of questionable value, and spoke with an accent thicker than treacle. He lived on the edge of Blightroot Mire in a hollowed-out badger den, where he kept a fine collection of rusted spoons and broken mirror shards. And he was perfectly content with that, more or less.

Until the sky burned green.

It happened on a Wednesday. Or maybe a Fangeday. Time kept no schedule in the mire, and days slipped past like eels. One moment, Skrag was gnawing on a firebeetle wing, the next he was staring at the heavens, mouth agape, as the clouds split and a column of emerald fire lanced down to the earth miles away, somewhere beyond the Jagtooth Hills.

“Wot in the swamp-mother’s backside…” he croaked.

Something in his chest quivered. Not fear. Not exactly. It was the sensation a rock might feel if it discovered it could bleed.

He didn’t sleep that night. The frogs croaked wrong. The fog drifted counterwise. Even the willowtrees whispered among themselves, leaves rustling with ill omen. Skrag tucked himself beneath his moldy blanket and tried to pretend the world hadn’t changed.

But it had.

—

The next morning, or perhaps two mornings later, a knock came at his door. An actual knock, not the usual skitter-scratch of a swamp rat testing boundaries. This was a real, polite, rhythmic knock. Skrag blinked.

“No one knocks,” he mumbled, squinting toward the burrow's mouth.

He peeked out and immediately regretted it. A human stood there. Tall. Cloaked in gray. Hair like silver spider silk and eyes that shimmered with moonlight. She did not smell like rot or fungi. She smelled like… fresh parchment and cold wind.

“Goblin Skrag?” she asked, voice too smooth.

“Nope,” he said, trying to shut the burrow. She jammed her boot in the door.

“You are the Mireborn,” she said.

“I'm the Mire-cleaned-at-best. Now piss off.”

She sighed. “You saw the flame.”

“I see a lot of things. Once I saw a rat dance a jig ‘cause it ate too much saproot. Not prophetic, just poison.”

She stepped inside, uninvited. Skrag hissed like a startled newt.

“You’re the one foretold in the Fragment of Clauvor,” she said.

“Fragment of whobah?”

She pulled a scroll from her cloak, unrolling it with solemn grace. It was old parchment, frayed and lined with symbols that squirmed under the eye. Goblin glyphs. Ancient ones. Ones even Skrag didn’t know he knew—yet as he stared, his lips moved of their own accord.

“Green shall blaze and green shall bleed, from dirt shall rise the one not seen. Small in foot, sharp of wit, cursed with fire—world's last spit.”

His voice broke on the final word.

The woman stared. “You can read it.”

Skrag blinked. “Guess I can. Huh. That ain’t good.”

—

By dusk, they were traveling. Her name was Thalia, a Seer from the Highwind Monastery. She had dreams. Of a world ending in flame, of cities turned to salt, of skies cracking like boiled eggs.

“And every time, the dream ends with you,” she said. “You stand alone before the Maw, wielding the Green Flame.”

“Sounds like a stupid dream,” Skrag muttered.

They passed through Briarfang Glade, where the trees grew thorns thicker than a goblin’s wrist. Thalia moved with grace. Skrag hacked his way through with a rusted cleaver.

“So what's the Maw?” he asked, panting.

“It’s not a what. It’s a who.”

“Even worse.”

As they camped by a stream that glowed faintly blue, Thalia told him of the Cataclysm Cycle—the ancient rhythms of destruction and rebirth. Every seven thousand years, the world trembled. But this time, something had gone wrong. The cycle stalled. The world began to rot.

“And the only thing that can restart the cycle,” she said, staring into the fire, “is the Green Flame.”

Skrag picked at his toes. “You sure it’s not, say, a really big dragon or an army or something useful?”

Thalia gave him a sad smile. “You were born under the Miremoon. During the stillborn eclipse. You speak the Glyph-Tongue. And you were marked.”

She pointed at his chest. Skrag looked down. His tunic had torn during the walk, revealing a birthmark—a twisted spiral of green over his heart. He’d always assumed it was just a fungus stain that never scrubbed off.

“Great,” he groaned.

—

Chapter Two: The Hollow Road

Traveling with a human was hard. Thalia never once stopped to catch fireflies or forage for stinkroot. She insisted on ‘making camp’ like a proper person—no burrows or hollow logs, just tents and cold ground. Skrag missed his damp, smelly den more than he thought possible.

Worse, he started dreaming.

He saw cities of glass melting under green light. He saw himself, dressed in black, standing on a mountain of bones, holding a sword made of screaming metal. And once—just once—he dreamed he was a child again, playing in the swamp, before the world had asked anything of him.

They reached the Hollow Road on the seventh day. It was a ghost path, older than kingdoms, carved into the hills by a vanished people. The stones were etched with faded warnings: “DO NOT WALK THE ROAD AFTER DARK” and “THE SLEEPING STILL DREAM.”

Naturally, they walked it after dark.

“I don’t like this,” Skrag said.

“You don’t like anything,” Thalia replied.

“Not true. I like mushrooms. And naps.”

Something screamed in the distance. A low, chittering cry like glass grinding in a blender. Thalia drew her staff. It glowed faintly with runes.

“Keep close,” she said.

Skrag clutched his cleaver. “I’m regretting everything.”

The first Hollow came just past the fork. It wore the shape of a man but was too tall, and its face was all wrong—no features, just a black void.

It lunged.

Thalia chanted in Aetheric. Her staff flared, and the Hollow screamed as light tore through it. Skrag swung wildly, catching a second creature in the knee. It stumbled, shrieking.

They ran.

Through black forests and along ancient stones. Skrag stumbled, twisted his ankle, and nearly fell into a pit, but they made it out—barely.

Panting, bruised, bleeding from a shallow cut on his shoulder, Skrag collapsed by the roadside.

“This hero stuff is crap,” he wheezed.

Thalia sat beside him, brushing soot from her robe. “No argument here.”

They didn’t speak much that night. Skrag watched the stars. He didn’t know their names, but they seemed to know his. One of them blinked green.

—

Chapter Three: The Keep of Broken Names

The Keep was a ruin.

It rose from the ash wastes like a bone through blistered skin. Black stone, scorched banners, and doors too big for any living race. The wind here spoke in whistles and sighs.

“Why’re we here?” Skrag asked.

Thalia hesitated. “To find someone.”

“Who?”

“A ghost.”

They entered through a crack in the wall, climbing over rubble. Inside, the Keep whispered. Not metaphorically—actual whispers. Names. Thousands of them. A tide of lost identities.

“This place was once the Vault of Memory,” Thalia explained. “Every soul had its name written here, to keep it from fading.”

“So where’d they all go?”

Thalia didn’t answer.

In the heart of the Keep stood a dais, and upon it a shard of green crystal. It pulsed as Skrag approached.

“Don’t touch it,” Thalia warned.

“Why not?”

“It’s a soulfire shard. It’ll burn your mind.”

Skrag touched it.

Pain.

Light.

Memory.

Not his.

He saw a battle—the last defenders of the Keep, holding the line against a tide of shadows. A woman in silver armor shouting orders. A child with a spiral birthmark being carried away.

He stumbled back, eyes wide. “I was here. I was here before.”

Thalia nodded. “Or someone like you. The Flame chooses vessels through time. You’re the latest. Maybe the last.”

Skrag sat down hard. “I want to go home.”

“You can’t.”

He looked up. “Why me?”

Thalia looked tired. “Because you were born at the wrong time, in the wrong place, and that’s often how heroes are made.”

Skrag wanted to scream. Instead, he whispered: “Then let’s finish this.”

—

They journeyed for three more days before the mire gave way to firmer land. The air grew clearer, less thick with spores and gnats, but Skrag felt like he was leaving something important behind. Not comfort—there had never been much of that in Blightroot—but familiarity. In the mire, he knew every fungus by taste, every toad by name. Out here, the ground was dry, the wind sharp, and the silence full of invisible things.

Thalia walked like she knew exactly where they were going, though she barely looked at the path. Her gaze was often distant, locked on some vision only she could see. Skrag noticed how the grass bent slightly wherever she stepped, even when there was no breeze. He didn’t like that. It reminded him of the time he accidentally ate dreammoss and hallucinated a council of beetles arguing politics in his ears for a week.

On the fourth night, they camped beside an ancient stone carved with runes neither of them could read. The stone radiated a low hum, like a kettle just before it whistles. Thalia warned Skrag not to sleep too close to it, but of course, he did anyway. He liked the warmth it gave off, and it reminded him of his old nest where heat would bubble up from the bogwater. He curled near it, wrapping himself in a ratty blanket, and tried to sleep.

The dream was different this time. No fire, no collapsing towers. He saw a glade full of towering mushrooms, their caps glowing a pale, bioluminescent blue. At the center stood a creature—taller than any goblin, but with the same sharp features, same bent ears and greenish skin. Its eyes were white, pupil-less, ancient.

“You bear the seed,” the figure said in a voice like sloshing mud. “You are last of the line.”

Skrag frowned in his sleep. “What line?”

“Of fire. Of soil. Of the forgotten pact.”

When he woke, the stone was cold. Thalia was already packing up, her expression unreadable.

“You looked troubled,” she said without looking at him. “Dreams?”

“I dreamt of some goblin king or ghost or… something,” Skrag muttered. “Said I had a seed or a pact or—I dunno, it all sounded important. I hated it.”

Thalia’s eyes flicked to him for a moment. “You should remember it. Dreams from the Stones are rare. And never without meaning.”

“I prefer the ones with flying weasels and rivers of gravy,” he grumbled.

They traveled west now, toward the jagged outline of the Jagtooth Hills. Skrag had never been that far before. Goblins didn’t often leave the mire, and when they did, the world usually tried to bite them. But Thalia seemed unfazed by the rough paths, the steep ridges, the thickening forests. She walked with purpose, and Skrag followed because, deep down, he was more curious than afraid.

Two nights later, they passed through a burned-out village. Nothing remained but blackened frames and the charred bones of buildings. No corpses. Just absence. The wind made the wood groan like old men muttering secrets. Skrag poked through the wreckage, half-hoping to find something shiny.

“Who did this?” he asked.

Thalia knelt beside a scorched threshold, fingers brushing the soot. “Ash-born. They move ahead of the Maw.”

“Sounds unpleasant.”

“They are memories made flesh. Remnants of those consumed by the Flame, twisted and reborn as hunger.”

“You’ve got the worst bedtime stories.”

Skrag found a cracked teacup and put it in his satchel. Not useful, not valuable, but it felt wrong to leave it there, alone in the ashes.

They didn't speak much that night. Even the fire they lit seemed reluctant to burn. Skrag sat cross-legged, cleaning his cleaver with an old rag, while Thalia whispered into the night in a tongue he didn’t recognize. Her voice was soft but firm, like she was bargaining with something old.

When he finally lay down, he whispered to himself, “Maybe if I keep walking, I’ll wake up back in my burrow and this’ll all be a big swampdream.”

But he didn’t believe it. Not anymore.

—

By the time they reached the foot of the Jagtooth Hills, Skrag had begun to change.

He hadn’t noticed it at first. But his eyes had sharpened. His night vision, once useful only in dim muck, now pierced through fog like lanternlight. His ears picked up sounds farther away, and his dreams—those damn dreams—were becoming clearer. More consistent. More like memories than fantasy.

On the morning of the ascent, they met another traveler. A dwarf, broad-shouldered, with arms like tree trunks and a hammer slung across his back that looked big enough to crush a wagon wheel in one swing. His beard was braided in silver and bone, and his eyes were the color of dying coal.

He squinted down at Skrag. “Well I’ll be. A goblin and a witch, walking together like it’s a spring picnic. The world truly is ending.”

Thalia inclined her head slightly. “We mean no harm. We seek passage through the Kral Spine.”

The dwarf chuckled. “No one seeks passage through the Spine, lady. They endure it. Still, you don’t look like bandits, and he…” He gestured at Skrag, who was picking his nose with studied disinterest. “Well, he looks like a walking excuse.”

“I’m Skrag,” the goblin offered helpfully. “And you smell like cheese.”

The dwarf laughed, a great booming sound that startled birds from the cliffs. “Name’s Borun. Borun Ironsleeve. I was on my way back to the mines of Telharr when I caught sight of that green flame three nights ago. Figured something old was waking up.”

“It is,” Thalia said.

Borun looked between them. “Then you’ll need someone who knows the hills. These paths haven’t been safe since the quake, and the mountain’s been groaning louder every year.”

Skrag eyed him suspiciously. “You just offering help for free?”

Borun snorted. “You wound me, goblin. But aye, maybe I’m a little curious. Been a long time since something important happened around here. And I’ve got a feeling that stone of yours is at the heart of it.” He pointed to the spiral mark on Skrag’s chest, now faintly visible even through cloth.

They climbed together, the dwarf leading with surprising agility for his bulk. The path twisted through jagged rocks, past caves that breathed cold air and whispered echoes, and over cliffs so narrow Skrag felt his knees lock. Thalia walked silently, her robes billowing like ghosts.

Midway through the third day, they were ambushed.

It happened fast. A shriek overhead. Shapes dropping from the cliffs—pale things with stretched limbs and mouths full of too many teeth. Their eyes were crusted shut, yet they moved with unnatural precision.

“Hollowed!” Borun roared, swinging his hammer and sending one flying.

Thalia raised her staff and chanted, her voice cracking like thunder. A wave of white light erupted outward, staggering the creatures. Skrag, not for the first time, panicked. But something in his hand glowed green, and when he swung his cleaver, it bit deeper than it should have, slicing through one of the attackers as if the bone were butter.

He stared at the weapon. It steamed.

The battle ended quickly. The creatures fled or crumbled, and the trio stood panting amid broken stones and ichor that hissed where it touched the ground.

Borun eyed Skrag. “That was no ordinary blade-work.”

“I didn’t do nothing different,” Skrag muttered, wiping the blade on his sleeve.

“Your flame is waking,” Thalia said. “It reacts to threat. To instinct.”

Skrag looked at his hands. “I didn’t ask for this.”

“No one ever does,” she said. “But sometimes, the world doesn’t ask permission either.”

They climbed in silence the rest of the day. The peaks of the Kral Spine loomed above them, jagged and cruel. Somewhere beyond those peaks, the world waited to end. And for reasons Skrag still didn’t understand, it was waiting for him.

By nightfall, they reached a narrow plateau where Borun insisted they make camp.

The fire crackled low. Skrag sat away from the others, staring at the stars, wondering which one held the answers he didn’t want.

Behind him, Thalia’s voice rose in quiet song. A hymn in the old tongue, soft as moss.

Skrag whispered to himself, “I don’t want to be special. I just wanted to eat bugs and nap in peace.”

But in the wind, something answered him.

Too late for that.

Chapter Two: Ash in the Veins

The next morning brought a sky the color of tarnished copper. The sun struggled to rise, its light slanting through the clouds in dull streaks, casting the jagged rocks of the Kral Spine in shades of rust and shadow. Skrag awoke stiff, his blanket crusted with frost. The fire had long since died. He sat up with a grunt, his joints popping like twigs.

Borun was already up, hammer across his lap, sharpening the edge with a flat stone despite it being a blunt weapon. He claimed it was tradition, though Skrag suspected he just liked the noise. Thalia stood at the cliff’s edge, silent, watching the horizon with an intensity that made Skrag’s stomach turn.

He scuttled over, chewing on a strip of dried toad jerky. “You always that broody in the morning, or is today special?”

She didn’t look at him. “There’s smoke rising to the west. The village of Embralei, if the map is right. It shouldn’t be burning.”

Skrag squinted. The thin black coil spiraled into the sky like a finger pointing to doom. “Maybe they’re having a big stew?”

Thalia gave no answer, which told Skrag everything he needed to know. Borun rose with a grunt, his armor clinking. “If there’s trouble, we ought to move. Roads near Embralei run straight to the Black Stair. No good getting trapped.”

Skrag’s feet dragged with reluctance as they broke camp. The trail wound down from the plateau, past frost-bitten ferns and into a narrow pass where wind moaned through cracks in the stone. He noticed something unsettling about the wind now—there was a rhythm to it, almost a chant. Like the mountains were whispering warnings, just below the edge of understanding.

By midday, they reached the village.

Or what remained of it.

The wooden palisades had been shattered inward, not outward. A dozen huts smoldered, their rooftops caved in. Black ash covered everything. The smell—like burnt hair and sweet rot—clung to the nostrils. Skrag stepped over a half-melted cart, his fingers twitching toward his cleaver.

Borun crouched by a ruin, touching the scorched ground. “No fire marks. Just—consumption. Like the heat came from within.”

Thalia moved quietly among the buildings, her face grim. She paused by a well, placing her hand on the stone rim. “The Flame passed through here,” she said. “But not naturally. Someone drew it.”

Skrag looked around. “What do you mean drew it? Like a map? A spell? A summoning?”

She nodded once. “Not all fire is wild. Some is called.”

It was near the outskirts of the village that they found the first sign of life—a child, or what had once been one. The figure sat upright in the dust, untouched by the fire, eyes open but empty. Its skin had gone translucent, veins like rivers of soot beneath glass.

Skrag recoiled. “Is it dead?”

“No,” Thalia whispered. “It’s Hollowing. Becoming something else.”

Borun raised his hammer, but she stopped him with a word. “Too late for mercy. We must move.”

They left quickly after that. Skrag didn’t ask questions. He felt like something watched them even after they’d turned away, something from inside the child’s empty eyes. The wind grew harsher as they descended the hills, and though the sun still hung in the sky, the light grew darker, as if filtered through smoke none of them could see.

—

They camped that night in an old watchtower, long abandoned by whatever kingdom had once guarded the path to the Black Stair. Moss clung to the stones like a second skin. Thalia warded the place with runes that glowed briefly before sinking into the walls.

Skrag sat on a broken stool, sharpening his cleaver—not that he knew what he was doing. It just felt like the right thing to do. The blade, once dull and pocked, now shimmered faintly along the edge, like something inside it had awakened.

Borun watched him from the other side of the room. “You ever kill before this? I mean, proper killing. Not traps or rats.”

Skrag didn’t answer right away. He thought back to the Hollowed things on the road, the way their flesh tore too easily, the steam rising from his hands afterward. “I tried not to,” he said at last. “Even in the mire. There’s ways to scare something off without sticking it.”

Borun nodded. “Good instinct. But instinct gets drowned when you carry a fire like yours.”

Thalia spoke then, her voice low but clear. “The Flame is not only destruction. It is memory. A record of all things that burned before. It chooses its bearer not for strength, but for endurance.”

“Then it made a mistake,” Skrag muttered.

“No,” she said. “It rarely does.”

The tower creaked in the wind. They slept uneasy.

—

The next morning, the road led them through the Brine Folds, a region of jagged canyons and salt-choked crevices. The earth here wept brine, and nothing grew. Once, a great inland sea had covered this land. Now it was a corpse, and the air tasted like old tears.

They passed beneath stone arches carved with faded symbols. Skrag paused to examine one—an image of a creature coiled in flame, not unlike a dragon but with a goblin’s face.

“See?” he said, tapping it. “Even ancient folks knew goblins were important.”

Thalia frowned. “That’s not a goblin.”

“Looks like one.”

“It’s a fireling—a creature born of the first Emberstorm.”

Skrag’s ears drooped. “Still looked like a goblin to me.”

They pressed on.

That afternoon, they encountered a caravan—what was left of it. A trio of wagons, scorched and abandoned. Horses long gone. Signs of struggle, blood on the sand, but no bodies. Skrag crouched by a broken wheel, inspecting the char marks.

“These people didn’t run,” he said. “They were pulled away.”

Borun checked one of the wagons and grunted. “Empty. Not just the cargo—everything. Not a spoon left.”

“Looters?” Skrag asked.

“Too clean,” the dwarf replied. “More like a harvest.”

They moved on with heavier steps.

That night, they didn’t light a fire.

Thalia told them stories instead—quiet ones, like lullabies. Tales of old guardians who walked the sky, of the Whispering Root beneath the mountains, of the first Flamebringer who sealed the Maw with her own soul.

Skrag listened with wide eyes. “You ever meet her?”

“That was five thousand years ago,” she said gently.

“Well, you seem the type who’s seen a lot.”

Borun chuckled. “He’s not wrong.”

Thalia smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes.

—

By dawn, they could see the Black Stair.

It wasn’t a staircase in the traditional sense. It was a sheer cliff face marked by a jagged scar that spiraled upward—a path carved not by hands, but by force, by something tearing its way out of the earth. At the summit loomed a gate of obsidian, flanked by two great statues half-buried in rubble.

Skrag stopped walking.

His legs wouldn’t move.

Thalia turned to him. “We have to go up.”

He shook his head. “Nope. No more. This is the edge. I’m not climbing into whatever that is.”

“It’s the only way forward.”

“Then maybe forward ain’t the way.”

Borun approached, resting a heavy hand on his shoulder. “You’re scared. That’s fair. But the world doesn’t stop turning because we’re not ready.”

Skrag looked up at the Black Stair. The wind howled through it like a chorus of ghosts. His chest ached. That spiral mark on his skin itched like fire beneath a scab. Somewhere inside, a voice whispered.

Go.

He swallowed hard. “Fine. But I’m not carrying anyone if we fall.”

“No one’s asking you to,” Borun grinned.

They climbed.

Each step felt like a decision. The path was narrow, the drop sheer. Thalia led with steady grace. Borun followed, his hammer strapped tight. Skrag brought up the rear, muttering every curse he knew.

Halfway up, the world changed.

The air grew thick, like breathing through wool. The sky dimmed, though the sun still burned above. Shadows lengthened against logic. Time felt stretched. Skrag stumbled and nearly fell, catching himself on a jagged rock. He turned to look down—and saw a second Skrag staring back.

But it wasn’t him.

Its eyes burned green.

He looked away and kept climbing.

At the top, they stood before the gate.

It opened without touch or sound, stone sliding back into the mountain as if it had simply grown bored of being closed.

Beyond was darkness. Not the absence of light—but the presence of something deeper. Something old. Skrag’s fingers curled around his cleaver, though it trembled now.

Thalia stepped forward.

“Are you ready?” she asked.

“No,” Skrag said honestly.

But he walked through the gate.

Because the world was ending.

And he was the only one left to burn it back to life.

—


The gate swallowed them.

Inside was not a tunnel, not a hallway, but something between—a winding throat of black stone and sighing echoes, the walls slick and warm as if the mountain itself still pulsed with a buried heartbeat. The further they went, the more the light dimmed. Even the glow from Thalia’s staff seemed to flicker with hesitation, as though uncertain whether it ought to illuminate what lay ahead.

Skrag pressed his back against the wall whenever the path narrowed, his breath shallow. The air carried a metallic scent, dry and sharp, like blood on hot iron. In the silence, every scuff of his boots against the stone felt deafening.

“This place isn’t right,” he muttered, eyes darting.

Borun grunted behind him. “Nothing ancient ever is.”

They descended into a wide chamber, the floor made of hexagonal stone tiles, cracked and worn. The walls were etched with deep carvings, but they weren’t ornamental. They were names—thousands, maybe more—scratched in various scripts, some human, some dwarven, some neither.

Thalia ran her fingers across the nearest names. “These are the ones who entered the Stair before us.”

Skrag squinted. “They make everyone sign in?”

“No,” she said softly. “These were scratched on the way out. Not all who pass through this place are devoured. Some return—but they leave part of themselves behind.”

Borun leaned on his hammer. “So where do we go now?”

“The spiral path continues beyond this chamber,” Thalia answered. “It will take us to the Threshold, where the Flame tests its chosen.”

“Of course it does,” Skrag muttered. “Because nothing simple ever happens to me.”

They moved onward. The next passage grew narrower still. The walls began to pulse faintly with a greenish light, in rhythm with Skrag’s heartbeat. He noticed it first in his peripheral vision—small motes of brightness, dancing along the edges of the tunnel. They looked like fireflies, but when he turned to them directly, they vanished.

“Thalia,” he whispered. “Something’s watching us.”

She didn’t answer right away. Then, in a tight voice: “It’s not watching. It’s remembering.”

Skrag almost turned around then and there.

The path widened again suddenly, opening into a cavernous space unlike any they had seen. This was no ruin. It was pristine, preserved—an amphitheater carved into the bones of the world. In the center rose a platform of white stone, surrounded by tall pillars of obsidian. Hanging above the dais, suspended by nothing, floated a massive sphere of emerald fire. It turned slowly, like a thought spinning through an ancient mind.

Thalia knelt. Borun bowed his head.

Skrag stared.

It was beautiful in the way a storm over the swamp was beautiful—uncontrollable, dangerous, alive. His knees buckled.

“That’s it,” he whispered. “That’s the Flame?”

“It’s the heart of it,” Thalia said. “Not the whole, but the part that calls to you.”

Skrag stepped forward, unsteady, pulled like driftwood to a current. The fire flared in response. His mark burned against his chest, sending waves of heat through his ribs. His thoughts swam. His fingers trembled.

Borun grabbed his arm. “Don’t step on the dais without thinking. Once you touch it, you begin the Trial.”

“I don’t even know what that means.”

“No one does,” Thalia said. “Each Trial is different. It shows you yourself, twisted and true.”

“Lovely,” Skrag grumbled. “That’s just what I needed. More of me.”

But still he stepped forward.

The moment his foot touched the dais, the room changed.

There was no sound, no sensation of movement. One blink he was in the chamber. The next—he was elsewhere.

He stood in the mire again, yet it was wrong. The colors too vivid, the shapes too perfect. Frogs croaked in rhythm, and the mist hung like silk. The sky overhead was green, rippling like water.

And across from him stood another Skrag.

Taller. Straighter. His eyes burned with certainty, his armor sleek and unfamiliar. The sword he held pulsed with the same fire that floated in the chamber above.

“You’re not real,” Skrag said.

The other Skrag tilted his head. “Aren’t I? I’m the you you’d be if you weren’t afraid.”

“That’s a big if.”

The doppelgänger didn’t smile. “You think this is a mistake. That you were chosen by accident. You want to believe you’re unimportant so you can walk away clean.”

Skrag’s mouth opened, but no words came.

“But deep down,” the figure continued, “you know you were always more. Even hiding in that stinking den, collecting spoons, you knew. You saw too much. Heard too much. The Flame chose you not because you’re brave, but because you’re real. Unvarnished. You know what it means to crawl.”

Skrag narrowed his eyes. “If you’re me, why’re you talking like you ate a poetry book?”

The other Skrag stepped forward. “Because I already passed the Trial.”

“Then what’s the point of this?”

The figure drew his sword. “To see if you can.”

They fought.

It wasn’t like the brawls in the mire, all teeth and elbows. This was something deeper—every blow a memory, every strike a question. They traded jabs and curses. Skrag’s cleaver clanged against the sword, sparks dancing in the green-lit air. He bled. He fell. He rose again.

He saw the child in the village. Saw the Hollowed faces. Saw Thalia’s sorrow and Borun’s burden. He saw his burrow, empty now. He saw himself—not special, not powerful—but willing.

That was the difference.

He didn’t win the duel. He didn’t need to.

He dropped his cleaver, looked his other self in the eye, and said, “I don’t want to be you.”

The sword stopped inches from his throat.

The figure smiled, for the first time.

“Then you’re ready.”

—

He collapsed back into his body, gasping. Thalia was at his side, her hand on his forehead.

“You were gone for nearly an hour.”

Skrag sat up. “Felt like a week.”

Borun offered him water, which he drank greedily. The fire above the dais now burned brighter. Thalia rose and extended a wrapped bundle.

“This is for you.”

Inside was a gauntlet, made of metal and leather, stitched with runes. It pulsed with heat. Skrag slid it over his right hand, and it adjusted to his size with a hiss.

“It will let you wield the Flame,” she said. “Not command it. No one commands fire. But it will let you survive it.”

Skrag flexed his fingers. The metal glowed briefly.

Borun nodded. “You’re marked now. There’s no hiding anymore.”

Skrag stood, swaying. “There never was.”

They left the chamber by a different path—one that had not existed before. The walls shimmered, shifting behind them. The mountain closed its mouth.

They emerged into sunlight, though it felt like a different world. The wind smelled of ash and pine. Below them, to the south, sprawled a dark forest—dense, thick, ancient.

“Where to now?” Skrag asked.

Thalia pointed to the forest. “Through the Wyrdwood. Then into the Vale of Embers. The Maw waits beyond.”

Skrag sighed. “Lovely. More places that sound like death.”

But he followed them.

Because now the fire lived in him.

And the world had begun to burn.

Chapter Three: The Wyrdwood

The forest began without warning.

One moment, the trio was descending a rocky slope littered with scree and sun-bleached bones, and the next they stepped beneath an arch of twisted, barkless trees that bent toward each other like gossiping crones. The light changed instantly—cooler, green-tinted, as though filtered through water or memory. Birds did not sing. No insects buzzed. The silence in the Wyrdwood was not the absence of sound but the presence of listening.

Borun adjusted the grip on his hammer and muttered under his breath. Skrag, who usually welcomed silence—especially after too much of Thalia’s long-winded prophecy talk—found this quiet oppressive. The trees were too still. Their roots coiled above the ground like muscles, and their branches never moved, not even when wind gusted through the ravines behind them.

Thalia walked with purpose but slower now, her usual confidence weighted by something more cautious. “Stay on the path,” she said. “Even when it disappears.”

Skrag snorted. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“The Wyrdwood shifts,” she replied. “It doesn’t like strangers. It tests them.”

Borun grumbled. “I’d sooner test my beard in a firepit. Last time I was here, the trees tried to make me believe I was my own grandmother. Took me three days to shake the vision.”

Skrag blinked. “You look like someone’s grandmother.”

“Watch it, bograt.”

Still, they stayed together, following a faint path of flattened moss and faded stone slabs, half-swallowed by earth. Skrag noticed strange things—the way tree trunks flickered with images when he stared too long. He saw a vision of his old burrow, perfectly intact, even down to the chipped pot where he kept fermented mushrooms. Another tree showed a younger version of himself, sitting beside an older goblin with kind eyes he didn’t remember ever meeting.

“Don’t touch them,” Thalia warned, watching him.

“Didn’t plan on it,” he muttered. “Just… they keep showing me things.”

“They show what you want most,” she said, voice low. “Or what you fear. The Wyrdwood draws from you.”

They marched until the light began to dim further, though the sky was still barely visible above the dense canopy. Skrag wasn’t sure how long they had been walking—hours, maybe days. His stomach growled, but he didn’t feel hunger. His legs ached, but he didn’t tire.

Eventually, they reached a clearing. At its center stood a tree unlike the others—its bark glistened like obsidian, and its branches hung low, nearly touching the ground. From one branch dangled a rope with no end, fraying into smoke as it descended.

The three of them stopped, unsure.

“This wasn’t on any map,” Borun muttered.

“It wouldn’t be,” Thalia said.

Skrag tilted his head. “This a tree or a warning?”

Before anyone could answer, the rope stirred.

From the smoke coalesced a figure—tall, draped in tattered moss, a face hidden behind a mask of polished wood carved into a serene, expressionless smile. The mask tilted slightly, observing.

“Fire-bearer,” it said, voice as dry as cracking leaves. “Why do you come into the forgotten root?”

Thalia bowed slightly. “We seek passage through the Vale of Embers.”

The figure’s head turned. “And what does the flame want with ash?”

Skrag stepped forward, throat dry. “I didn’t ask it to want anything. It found me. I’m just trying not to die.”

A rustle passed through the clearing—leaves shivered though there was no wind. The figure stepped forward, and Skrag noticed its feet did not touch the ground.

“You carry the ember unborn,” it said. “That which remembers and yet has not lived.”

Borun narrowed his eyes. “Is that supposed to make sense to anyone but you?”

“Silence, stoneblood,” the figure intoned. “This forest remembers the first flame and the last. It knows what you do not.”

Thalia placed a hand on Skrag’s shoulder. “Let him speak. This is the Heart-Watcher.”

The name meant nothing to Skrag, but the weight of it pressed on his chest. The Heart-Watcher circled them once, trailing thin wisps of mist. When it stopped again, it faced Skrag directly.

“You seek the Maw. You seek the end.”

“I seek to stop it,” Skrag said.

“No,” the Watcher replied. “You seek to understand it. That is why you were chosen. Not to destroy, but to remember. To rekindle what was lost.”

Skrag shook his head. “I’m not a scholar. I’m not a hero. I lived in a hole and collected trash.”

“Even rot becomes soil,” the Watcher said. “Even refuse feeds the root.”

There was a pause, and then the branches of the tree above bent lower, nearly touching Skrag’s head.

“Will you drink?” the Watcher asked.

Skrag blinked. “What?”

Borun growled, “That sounds ominous.”

A hollow opened in the tree’s trunk, revealing a bowl of dark liquid, still as obsidian. The surface rippled with shifting shapes—faces, flames, and finally, a small green light.

“It is memory,” the Watcher said. “It will not lie, but it may wound. If you drink, the forest will let you pass.”

Skrag hesitated. Then, with a resigned sigh, stepped forward and scooped the liquid into his hands.

It tasted like smoke and sweetness, like tears and childhood. Then the world tilted.

—

He stood in a house.

Not his own. This was stone, with tapestries on the wall and a fire in the hearth. A goblin child sat at a table, drawing symbols in the dust. Across from him, a woman—older, regal in posture—spoke softly.

“You have the fire in you, my son,” she said. “Not yet, not for years. But when the time comes, you must remember who you are.”

The child looked up. “But I’m just Skrag. I’m not anything.”

“You are everything,” she replied.

The scene shattered.

He saw battles—hundreds of them. A line of goblin warriors, painted in soot and sap, facing down a tide of fire-walkers. He saw the same spiral mark, painted on every brow. He saw the flame passed from hand to hand, a gift and a burden.

He saw a throne of roots, and a crown of glowing fungus.

He saw himself—older, cloaked in black and green, standing before a council of beings he couldn’t name.

Then, silence.

When he opened his eyes, he was back in the clearing.

He gasped, falling to his knees. Borun caught him.

“What did you see?” Thalia asked gently.

“Too much,” Skrag croaked. “But also not enough.”

The Heart-Watcher nodded. “You remember now. You are of the Rootline. Descended from the Flamekeepers who first bound the Maw.”

“I didn’t ask to be part of any line,” Skrag muttered. “I just wanted peace.”

“Peace is the reward of those who endure the fire,” the Watcher replied. “You are not finished. But the forest will not stop you.”

The tree behind the figure split with a groaning sound, revealing a narrow path of stone, glowing faintly beneath a canopy of vines.

“Go,” the Watcher said. “The world waits.”

They passed through without further word. The path did not shift or mislead them now. The forest watched, but it did not test. Whatever it had wanted to know of Skrag, it had found.

As they emerged into the twilight of the outer wood, Skrag looked back once. The clearing was already gone.

He didn’t speak of what he saw for a long time.

Not until the Vale.

—

The landscape beyond the Wyrdwood was desolate.

The Vale of Embers stretched for miles—an expanse of cracked earth and crumbled ruins half-buried in ash. Columns of black stone jutted from the ground like shattered bones. Occasional bursts of fire erupted from vents in the earth, sending steam and cinders skyward.

“This was once a city,” Thalia said. “The capital of Calvoran.”

Skrag frowned. “Never heard of it.”

“It was buried before your kind had words,” she said. “A civilization that tried to hold the Flame. It broke them.”

They moved slowly, feet crunching over glassy debris. The heat rose in waves, not unbearable but constant, like a fever under the skin. Skrag’s gauntlet pulsed again, glowing gently as if feeding on the air itself.

As they passed a toppled tower, Borun paused.

“Something’s here.”

He was right. The ground trembled faintly. From beneath a pile of ash, a shape rose—tall, vaguely human, but wreathed in fire that flickered too slowly. Its face was a mask of fused metal. It raised an arm, and the Flame in Skrag’s gauntlet flared in answer.

“Ash-born,” Thalia said grimly. “Drawn to the Emberbearer.”

The creature lunged.

Borun met it head-on, hammer singing. Sparks flew. Thalia chanted, casting runes into the air that burst in waves of frost. Skrag stood frozen for a moment, heart pounding.

Then he raised his gauntlet.

The fire responded. Not wild, but clear—focused. A green flame erupted from his palm and struck the Ash-born square in the chest. It howled, a sound like a wind screaming through hollow bones. Then it burst into cinders and was gone.

Skrag stood panting, his arm smoking. Borun clapped him on the shoulder. “Now that was a proper hit.”

Thalia gave him a long look. “The Flame is waking in you faster than I expected.”

“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Skrag said.

“You don’t have to,” she replied. “Just don’t stop.”

The wind shifted.

Far across the Vale, beyond broken statues and melted gates, a mountain of black stone loomed.

At its heart, a mouth.

The Maw.

Skrag’s flame flickered.

And it whispered, Come home.

—

They made camp that night beneath the skeletal remains of a stone archway, one of the last standing structures before the true descent into the Vale. The broken ribcage of some ancient gate jutted from the earth like the knuckles of a buried titan. The fire was small, more for formality than warmth—here in the emberlands, heat needed no coaxing. The very rocks seemed to radiate a slow, simmering energy that settled in the bones and refused to leave.

Skrag sat with his back against a chunk of basalt, knees pulled to his chest, eyes fixed on the fire. It danced strangely—too slow, too steady, the green tinge from his gauntlet giving the flames an eerie sheen. He hadn't spoken much since the encounter with the Ash-born. Not out of fear or confusion, but something more elemental. That scream—the sound of something unraveling—had rung in his ears long after the cinders faded.

Thalia stirred a pot of broth over the flame, the steam thick with the scent of mountain herbs. She hummed under her breath, the same hymn she sang back in the watchtower. Borun sharpened his hammer again, not for effect this time, but as a ritual of calm. The steady scrape of whetstone on metal was almost soothing.

“I keep thinking about what it said,” Skrag finally muttered.

Borun looked up. “The Ash-born?”

Skrag nodded. “Didn’t have words, but I felt it. Like it knew me. Like it hated me, not because of what I did, but because of what I am.”

Thalia poured a portion of broth into a cracked cup and passed it to him. “The Ash-born were once people. Men. Women. Goblins. Dwarves. All taken by the Maw. It reshapes them, hollowing out what was true and filling it with fire.”

“Why?”

Thalia hesitated, then said, “Because that’s what the Maw is. It devours meaning. Turns memory to ash.”

Skrag sipped the broth and grimaced. “This tastes like boiled rope.”

Borun grunted. “It is boiled rope.”

They sat in silence a while longer, each staring into the fire. The quiet wasn't peaceful—just weary. The kind of quiet that wraps around you after a long day of carrying things that don't belong to you.

That night, Skrag dreamed again.

This time he stood not in the mire, nor in a battlefield of fire—but in a library. A massive one, stretching into impossible heights. Books lined every surface, some bound in wood, others in scales, others in translucent skins that shimmered with stored light. The air was thick with dust and song, and from the shadows came a voice.

“You carry the last story,” it said. “The last true one.”

Skrag turned. A figure sat at a table, quill in hand, its face hidden beneath a hood of green flame. “Your life is the closing chapter. And chapters are not always fair.”

“I don’t want to be a story,” Skrag said.

“No story does,” the figure replied. “Until it ends.”

He woke before dawn, heart pounding.

—

By midday they reached the edge of the Inner Vale.

It was a basin, a vast crater ringed with cliffs and crags, the air thick with rising smoke. The black mountain loomed at the center, impossibly tall, its peak lost in a crown of ever-burning cloud. Lava ran in rivers down its sides—not red, but green. Sickly and luminous, like the blood of something ancient.

At its base yawned the Maw.

It was not a mouth in the literal sense. No lips, no teeth. Just a vast, circular absence in the rock, as if something had swallowed the world inward. Fire belched from its core, but it wasn’t heat that made Skrag’s skin crawl—it was memory. Raw, unfiltered memory, screaming in echoes too vast to parse. It was like standing beside every funeral pyre ever lit.

“This is it,” Thalia said, her voice small against the scope of it all.

Borun shaded his eyes. “Can’t believe we came all this way to jump into a glorified cave.”

“It’s not a cave,” Thalia said. “It’s a wound. A place where the world broke itself open.”

Skrag didn’t answer. He stared at the flame and felt it stir within him, not violently, but like a beast long-chained, sensing the end of its leash. The gauntlet on his arm had turned hot, the sigils glowing brighter than ever.

They descended the final slope without speaking. The ash clung to their boots, soft as flour. The sky above them roared without thunder. And as they approached the rim of the Maw, a figure stepped from the shadows.

It was cloaked in black, its face hidden behind a mask of bone, smooth and featureless. It held no weapon, and yet the heat warped around it like a shield.

Thalia stepped forward. “Guardian,” she said.

The figure inclined its head. “Seer.”

Borun growled. “Another talky type. Figures.”

The figure turned to Skrag. “Flamebearer. We have waited.”

“I didn’t ask you to,” Skrag said.

“And yet you came.”

Skrag looked at the rim. “Do I have to fight you?”

“No. Your fight is within.”

The guardian stepped aside.

Thalia placed a hand on Skrag’s shoulder. “Once you enter, we cannot follow. The Maw tests all who touch its fire.”

Skrag took a deep breath. “You’ve said that before.”

Borun frowned. “And it’s never sounded good.”

Thalia looked into his eyes. “You can still turn back.”

Skrag shook his head. “No. I can’t. Not anymore.”

He stepped past them and crossed the threshold.

—

The world turned inside out.

There was no floor, no ceiling. Fire curled through nothingness, shaping images from his mind. He floated, then fell, then floated again. A thousand voices whispered his name. He saw the faces of every creature he’d encountered—Thalia, Borun, the Watcher, the child in the burned village, the other Skrag. All of them turned to ash.

He landed on something solid. A platform of memory. And in front of him stood his worst fear.

Himself.

But not twisted, not heroic.

Just… ordinary.

The mire-stained goblin who ran from his shadow and hoarded spoons.

“This is who you are,” the echo said. “And you’re not enough.”

Skrag stepped forward. “Maybe not.”

“You’re weak.”

“I was.”

“You’re alone.”

“I was.”

The figure trembled, and the fire in Skrag’s gauntlet surged. The flame wrapped around him—not burning, not searing, but holding. It became armor. Memory made real. He felt the power rise—not to destroy, but to endure.

He raised his hand.

The echo shattered.

The Maw screamed.

—

Above, on the edge of the crater, Thalia fell to her knees.

The flame erupted from the depths, a column of green fire taller than any mountain, silent and furious. It did not burn the land—it purified it. The ash peeled away. The sky cleared. For the first time in centuries, the sun touched the Vale.

When it faded, Skrag stood at the edge, breathing heavily.

Borun stared. “You came back.”

Skrag nodded. “Had to.”

Thalia looked at him. “Did you see it?”

“All of it,” he said. “It wasn’t about power. It was about remembering. About refusing to forget what matters.”

They stood together in silence.

The fire no longer raged.

And the world, finally, exhaled.

Chapter Four: Cinders and Crowns

The Vale healed slower than it burned.

In the days following Skrag’s descent into the Maw, the land seemed to sleep. No more eruptions scarred the earth, no more fire-born husks crawled from ash-heaps. The cracked plains cooled. Lava hardened to black glass, and steam stopped seeping from the broken ground. What remained of the ancient city of Calvoran emerged from beneath the soot like the bones of something long buried. No birds returned, no trees regrew, but the wind no longer screamed, and that alone was enough to stir unease.

Skrag stood alone on a ridge above the basin, overlooking the gaping wound that had, until recently, been the source of the world’s slow death. The Maw had not closed—it could not—but its hunger had abated. For the first time, the abyss did not reach for him.

He stared into its depths, gauntlet still smoking gently, and felt… nothing.

Not peace.

Not triumph.

Something else.

A tired sort of knowing.

Behind him, Borun coughed pointedly, scuffing one heavy boot in the gravel. “You gonna stand there all day looking poetic, or are we going to talk about what comes next?”

Skrag didn’t turn. “What does come next?”

Borun sighed. “Usually, when someone saves the world, there's a feast. Drums. Bad singing. You get a chair with a back on it and a title no one understands.”

“I don’t want any of that.”

Thalia approached from the other side of the ridge. She had changed since the Maw. Her eyes held the same weary focus, but the fear had gone. The flame no longer burned in her aura, and her staff no longer pulsed. Something about her felt finished.

“Whether you want it or not,” she said, “the world will come looking for its hero.”

“I’m not a hero,” Skrag mutte
