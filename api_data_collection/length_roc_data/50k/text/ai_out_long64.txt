Chapter One: The Crack in the Glass

Eleanor Sharpe had always trusted the night. It blanketed her town like an old, familiar quilt—patchy in places, but warm enough. The darkness came with the same rhythm each evening: porch lights flickering on, the whir of air conditioners quieting as temperatures dropped, dogs barking distantly, then silence. And yet, that Tuesday evening, something felt wrong.

It started with the window. The one in the hallway outside her bedroom.

She noticed it around 10:17 p.m., on her way back from brushing her teeth. The hallway was dim, lit only by the soft glow of a nightlight plugged in near the floor. She didn’t stop at first, not until she caught a sliver of movement—or the absence of it. A shadow that shouldn’t have shifted the way it did. She paused. Stepped back.

The window looked normal enough. Double-paned, a little dusty on the inside where she hadn’t cleaned in a few weeks. But there was a crack. Thin, almost invisible, like a silver thread sewn into the glass. She crouched, squinting. It hadn’t been there yesterday.

Eleanor pressed her finger lightly to the glass. Cold. She could feel the tiny ridge where the fracture began, trailing down like a vine. It wasn’t a stress crack. It was precise, deliberate, and curved oddly, like something had etched it with intent.

She stood, heart pacing faster than before. The house was old—1919, Victorian, inherited from her grandmother and full of quirks. She’d grown up in it, left for a few years, then moved back in after the accident. But never once in all those years had the glass cracked on its own.

The phone in her pocket buzzed. A message from Ethan.

    “You left the light on in the garage. Want me to swing by?”

She stared at the message for a moment. Ethan Grant, her former neighbor turned occasional companion. His texts always came like that—casual, like he was walking beside her, still holding on to the comfortable pretense that they were only friends.

    “Don’t bother,” she typed. “Just noticed something weird. I’ll check it out.”

    “Weird?”

She hesitated.

    “Window. Looks like someone touched it.”

    “Inside or outside?”

She didn’t answer right away. Instead, she walked to the front door, turned the deadbolt slowly, and stepped out onto the porch. The night air hit her like a slap—damp and heavy with the scent of wet earth. She circled the side of the house, her phone flashlight held low.

The grass was slick with dew, and her bare feet slipped once on the mossy edge of the pathway. She steadied herself on the side rail, then turned the light upward.

The window was five feet off the ground. And there—just beneath it—were two smudges on the white siding. Dark, crescent-shaped. Fingerprints.

Her breath caught.

    “Outside,” she finally typed.

Then, after a second:

    “Someone was here.”

The next morning, Eleanor sat across from Ethan at Cassidy’s Café, a place that pretended to be rustic but smelled too clean to be authentic. He stirred his coffee with the slow precision of someone avoiding eye contact.

“So... nothing else happened?”

“No,” Eleanor said. “But I didn’t sleep.”

“You check the locks?”

“All of them.”

Ethan looked up finally, his brows knit together. “You call the sheriff?”

“No.”

“Why the hell not?”

Eleanor sipped her tea. It had gone lukewarm. “Because there’s nothing to report. A cracked window and a few smudges? They’d write me off like everyone else.”

He frowned. “You mean—”

“I mean like my sister. Like Dr. Ramos. Like everyone who thought I imagined the voice in the basement.”

That shut him up.

The voice. Two years ago, after her return to the house, Eleanor had heard a low, droning hum beneath the floorboards. Late at night. Faint. Sometimes rising like music, sometimes clicking like bones. She’d recorded it, once. Played it for Ethan. But the sound never came through.

He’d tried to believe her.

He really had.

“I think it’s connected,” she said now, softly. “The crack. The prints. The sound before. I think someone’s watching me.”

“Why would they?”

She didn’t answer. Not directly. Instead, she glanced out the café window toward the hills that curved at the edge of town. St. Veil was a quiet place, tucked between two ridgelines, built around an old ironworks that had gone bust decades earlier. Half the homes were historical, the other half barely standing. Nothing happened here. Not since the Deacons disappeared.

Ethan followed her gaze. “You still thinking about them?”

“Their house is four blocks from mine.”

“They vanished ten years ago.”

“And their windows were cracked, too.”

He paused. Then said, quietly, “That’s a hell of a reach.”

“Maybe. But I’m going to find out.”

That afternoon, Eleanor visited the town archive—a cluttered back room in the municipal building that smelled like glue and mildew. Agnes O'Malley, the part-time librarian-slash-historian, raised an eyebrow as Eleanor entered.

“Back again?”

“I need files from 2015. The Deacon family. Police reports, if you’ve got them.”

Agnes pursed her lips. “You know most of that stuff’s gone.”

“Gone?”

“Sheriff Barnes had a flood in the evidence room. Or so he said. Funny how water damage only hits certain files.”

Eleanor didn’t smile. “Do you have anything left?”

Agnes stood and shuffled into the back. After a few minutes, she returned with a plastic binder, its spine torn.

“This is all I’ve got. Clippings. Notes from their neighbor. Old Mr. Cordell.”

“Thank you,” Eleanor said, already flipping through the pages.

The clippings were yellowed, the ink blurred in places. But one note caught her attention—a scribble in ballpoint pen, dated two days before the Deacons vanished.

    “Saw someone in their backyard again. Tall. Didn’t move right. Just stood there. Looking.”

Another note, undated:

    “Mira said her window cracked again. Always the same one.”

Eleanor’s stomach turned.

She took a photo of the page and closed the binder. On her way out, she stopped by the sheriff’s office. The clerk at the front desk, a girl named Jenny who looked barely twenty, didn’t even glance up.

“Can I speak with Sheriff Barnes?” Eleanor asked.

“He’s out.”

“Where?”

“Field call.”

“Does he still keep the damaged files?”

Jenny finally looked at her. “What files?”

“The ones from 2015. The Deacons.”

Jenny’s lips thinned. “You should go, Miss Sharpe.”

Eleanor left, but the unease followed her. By nightfall, the house felt colder. She locked every window, every door, but couldn’t shake the feeling that she’d missed something.

At 2:14 a.m., she woke to a sound.

A tap.

Then another.

She sat up, listening.

Tap.

Tap.

It came from the hallway.

She rose, heart thudding, and crept toward the door. The tapping stopped. She reached for the handle, pulled it open slowly.

Silence.

Then—

Crack.

She turned.

The window.

The glass had split again, a second line branching from the first like a jagged root.

And in the faint moonlight, pressed against the outside of the window, was a single eye.

Watching her.

Unblinking.

Eleanor stumbled backward, her heel catching on the rug as her shoulder slammed into the doorframe. The eye vanished. Just like that—gone, like a hallucination. She blinked several times, heart hammering in her chest, and staggered toward the window, not even realizing she’d picked up the old fireplace poker from beside her bedroom door. She pressed her face to the glass, squinting into the moonlit yard.

Nothing.

No movement. No footprints on the grass. No lingering shadow or silhouette. Just the garden, still and silver under the waning moon, and the dense row of hedges that lined the far end of the yard.

But she knew what she saw. That eye wasn’t a trick of the light. It had been pale—unusually pale—and too round. Almost lidless. And close, impossibly close, like it had been pressed flat against the glass without leaving any breath or fog.

Her skin prickled. She stood there for what must’ve been ten minutes, straining to hear something—anything—beyond the frantic thudding of her pulse. Nothing came. She finally exhaled and backed away from the window, never once turning her back to it.

Sleep was no longer an option.

The next morning arrived slow and grey, the sun caught behind clouds that threatened rain. Eleanor sat at the kitchen table with an untouched bowl of oatmeal in front of her and the poker still clutched in one hand. Her phone was on the table, the screen showing a half-finished message to Ethan. She’d tried to describe the eye. Deleted it. Tried again. Deleted that, too. There was no way to explain it without sounding completely mad.

The knock at the door startled her so badly she nearly dropped the poker. She stood and crossed the foyer cautiously. Through the peephole: Ethan.

He didn’t wait for an invitation. “You look like hell.”

“Thanks,” she muttered, stepping aside.

He took one look at the poker in her hand and raised an eyebrow. “Planning to joust someone?”

“I saw something last night.”

“You said that before.”

“No, Ethan. I saw someone. Or something. It was staring at me through the hallway window. The crack got worse. It looked... wrong. The eye. It wasn’t human.”

He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. “El, I want to believe you. You know I do. But you’re talking like this is a ghost story.”

“I know what I saw.”

He was quiet for a moment. Then: “Let me look at the crack.”

They walked down the hall together. Ethan crouched near the window, running his finger gently along the lines in the glass. The second crack branched out like a sharp 'Y', jagged and nearly symmetrical. “This is weird,” he murmured. “Too clean for pressure stress. You sure nothing hit it?”

“I’d have heard it.”

“You said the eye was right here?”

She nodded.

He looked outside, scanned the yard. “We should put up cameras. Just to be sure. I’ve got some spares at home. Motion-triggered. One for the back, one for the hall.”

“You think it’ll come back?”

“I think we shouldn’t wait to find out.”

By noon, they had two cameras installed. One perched on the porch roofline, angled toward the window and yard. The other fixed discreetly in the hallway corner, pointing toward the glass. Ethan checked the feeds from his phone, then gave her a short nod. “Good for now. They record to the cloud. If anything moves, we’ll know.”

Eleanor managed a half-smile. “Thanks.”

He hesitated in the doorway before leaving. “You’re not alone, okay? Even if this turns out to be... something else. I’m still around.”

She nodded, but the truth was, she felt more alone than ever. That night, she stayed in the living room with the TV on low volume and every lamp blazing. She watched old documentaries with the sound turned down, the flickering images washing the room in restless color. The window remained dark, but her eyes kept drifting back to it.

She must have dozed off at some point because the sound of her phone buzzing jarred her awake. It was 3:08 a.m.

Motion detected.

She sat up, heart already racing, and opened the camera feed on her phone. The hallway view was black. Nothing visible. Then the exterior feed loaded.

A shape stood at the edge of the frame.

It was tall. Not just tall—wrong. As though someone had taken the dimensions of a human and stretched them in strange ways. The limbs were long, too long, and the torso narrow. It didn’t move. Just stood there, half-hidden behind the edge of the hedge line.

Then, slowly, it turned its head.

No face.

Not blank, but... unfinished. Like a wax figure before the features are carved in. The pale flesh was uneven in tone, like it had never seen sunlight, and its head tilted as if it were listening to something inside the house.

Eleanor froze. She didn’t scream. Didn’t breathe.

The figure moved then, impossibly fast, darting from view in a blur that defied the limitations of the camera. The feed cut to static. A second later, the interior camera pinged.

She flipped to the hallway feed.

The window.

A third crack.

Jagged.

Wider.

There was no one in the hall.

But something had been there.

She backed slowly from the screen and locked herself in the bathroom, curling up in the tub, knees to chest, the poker across her lap. She didn’t sleep. When the morning came, she didn’t notice. The light was no longer comforting.

By Wednesday, Eleanor had stopped pretending it was in her head. She spent the day researching. The Deacons were just one of many families that had disappeared in St. Veil over the past fifty years. Most were written off as missing persons—runaways, domestic disputes gone wrong, transient workers. But a pattern emerged. Before each disappearance, neighbors reported strange noises. Lights flickering. Animals acting oddly. And almost always—cracks. In glass. In mirrors. Windows.

One name kept appearing in the margins of old reports and community bulletins: Margot Wren.

An amateur historian. Deceased. Lived in the hills just outside town. But her letters, dated as far back as the 1980s, spoke of a phenomenon she called the “Threadline.” A seam between places, drawn thin in areas of old trauma. Windows, she wrote, were the weakest points.

Not metaphorically.

Literally.

She believed something was trying to cross.

Not ghosts. Not demons.

Something else.

She called them the Hollow.

Entities without true form, seeking entry by echoing human presence. Imitating familiarity. Learning by watching. Mimicry, she claimed, was only the first stage.

Then they replaced.

Eleanor shut the laptop. Her reflection in the screen looked pale and distant. Not quite right. The air in the room felt heavier. Her ears popped slightly, like pressure had shifted.

That night, the dream came.

She was standing in front of the hallway window, but on the outside, in the garden. Her face pressed to the glass. Inside, someone moved—her own body, in her own clothes, holding the poker. But it wasn’t her. The figure turned to face the window. Smiled. The skin peeled from its cheeks in symmetrical strips, revealing teeth that didn’t end.

She woke screaming.

And this time, she wasn’t alone.

Footsteps creaked on the stairs.

Deliberate.

Slow.

Eleanor slipped from the bed and grabbed her phone, backing into the closet. Her fingers trembled as she typed.

    “Ethan. It’s here.”

Chapter Two: A Sound Like Bone

Ethan didn’t wait for further explanation. He arrived at Eleanor’s door just after four in the morning, a thin fog clinging to the street like smoke from an old fire. He was dressed in jeans, a sweatshirt, and boots with unlaced tops, and his face was pale beneath his scruffy beard. He had a crowbar in one hand and a flashlight in the other, both held low as if not to wake the sleeping houses nearby. The sky had not yet begun to lighten, and St. Veil felt suspended, as if the whole town were holding its breath.

Eleanor met him on the porch. Her expression was somewhere between relief and dread. Her hair was damp from sweat, her robe pulled tight over a tank top. She looked smaller than he remembered, not physically, but as though the edges of her confidence had been eaten away.

“I heard something,” she whispered as she let him in. “I was sure it was coming up the stairs. I hid in the closet. It stopped. But I swear, Ethan—whatever it is, it knows when I’m awake.”

He scanned the interior quickly, every light turned on, the hallway still bathed in a dim gold glow. The third crack in the window was longer now, and spiderwebbed into the lower right pane. The sight of it sent a shiver down his spine.

“I checked the cameras again just before I drove over,” he said, closing the front door behind him. “No alerts. No motion. But... the feed glitched.”

“Glitched how?”

“Like interference. Static. And for a second, I saw—” he stopped, hesitating, “—your hallway, but mirrored. Like the camera had flipped it. And then something moved across it. Fast. But it wasn’t shaped right.”

Eleanor leaned against the wall, suddenly feeling weak. “That’s how it started in the dream. Everything reversed. Like I was outside looking in.”

Ethan’s jaw clenched. He didn’t believe in much—ghosts, spirits, even God—but he believed in Eleanor. She wasn’t prone to fantasy. Whatever was happening here wasn’t ordinary, and it wasn’t going away.

“I think we need to talk to someone,” he said.

Eleanor shook her head. “The sheriff’s useless. The church—don’t even start. And I’m not letting some stranger come into this house and call me crazy.”

“I don’t mean any of them,” he said. “I mean someone who might’ve seen this before. That woman, Wren. Margot Wren.”

“She’s dead.”

“Yeah. But her nephew isn’t.”

Eleanor blinked. “She had family?”

“Isaac Wren. Lives out near Dry Hollow. Teaches folklore at the community college. Bit of a recluse. People say he’s off, but not dumb. I met him once. Did some work at his place a few years back. He collects... weird stuff. Books, old symbols. I didn’t understand half of what I saw, but he knew about things. Things nobody else talked about.”

She hesitated, then nodded slowly. “Take me to him.”

The road to Dry Hollow wound through the woods like a forgotten scar. Tall pines closed in overhead, turning the morning light to green-tinted shadow. Eleanor had brought only her bag, a notebook, and the poker. She didn’t speak much during the drive, just stared out the window, fingers tapping the armrest in an uneven rhythm.

Isaac Wren lived in a sagging farmhouse that looked like it might collapse in the next storm. Its shutters hung at odd angles, and windchimes made from deer bones rattled in the wind. A series of painted symbols—circles within circles, lines that broke apart at sharp angles—adorned the porch beams. They didn’t look decorative. They looked like warnings.

Isaac opened the door before they knocked. He was thin, older than either of them expected, with deep creases around his mouth and sharp, intelligent eyes. His sweater was moth-eaten and hung loose around his frame, and he smelled faintly of old paper and ash.

“Ethan,” he said, voice dry as bark. “You brought someone haunted.”

Eleanor stiffened.

Isaac turned his gaze to her, unblinking. “You’ve seen them.”

She nodded. “Through the window. At first, I thought... maybe I was imagining it. But now, I don’t think it’s just me.”

“It never is,” he said. “Come in.”

His house was full of artifacts—books stacked in towers, jars of yellowing herbs, wax-sealed scrolls. Animal skulls rested on high shelves, and a map of St. Veil, drawn by hand in red ink, hung over the fireplace. Strange black threads had been strung across it, connecting certain locations with pins—her house included.

“You’re on the seam,” he said, pointing to her street.

“The seam?”

Isaac sat, motioning for them to do the same. “A thin place. Where things bleed through. Sometimes it’s a house. Sometimes a mirror. But the window is always the first sign. The glass is weakest. They can’t come through yet—but they can look.”

Ethan leaned forward. “What are they?”

Isaac’s expression turned grim. “They don’t have a name. Not one we can say, anyway. Margot called them the Hollow. Empty shapes, drawn to repetition. They learn you. Study how you move, speak, sleep. And when they understand you well enough... they wear you.”

Eleanor’s voice was low. “Why me? Why now?”

Isaac reached behind him and pulled a leather-bound book from a high shelf. He opened it carefully, revealing sketches—rough charcoal drawings of tall, pale figures, eyes like mirrors, bodies stretched and broken.

“You’ve been marked,” he said. “They pick those who’ve already lost something. Grief hollows a person. Leaves space.”

Ethan shot a glance at her, but she didn’t look away. Her voice was calm. “My sister died two years ago. In that house.”

Isaac nodded. “Then you were always vulnerable.”

Silence fell. Outside, wind stirred the trees. The sky had darkened, thick clouds rolling in like bruises across the horizon.

Eleanor stood. “How do I stop them?”

“You don’t,” Isaac said. “But you can delay them. You have to confuse them. Break your patterns. Rearrange the house. Sleep in the day. Speak in riddles. And most of all—never look them in the eye again. If they know you see them, it accelerates the imitation. They get faster. Smarter.”

Ethan frowned. “We have cameras. They’ve already been seen.”

Isaac turned pale. “Then you have very little time.”

They drove back in silence, the storm beginning to rumble across the sky. Rain started as they pulled into Eleanor’s driveway, fat drops slapping the windshield in uneven rhythms. The windows of the house looked wrong, somehow—darker, heavier, as though the glass itself were warping under some unseen weight.

They entered cautiously. The house smelled different. Not bad—just... off. Like old metal and burned plastic. Eleanor’s chest tightened.

“Something’s changed,” she said.

Ethan checked the camera feeds. The recordings from the night before had corrupted. All that remained were flickering fragments—a brief flash of the hallway, then static, then a face. Not hers. Not anyone’s. Just something staring directly into the lens, its mouth stretched impossibly wide.

He didn’t show it to Eleanor.

That night, they rearranged the furniture. Moved the bed into the kitchen, covered the hallway mirror, turned every rug upside down. Eleanor started speaking aloud in riddles from an old book Isaac gave her. It felt foolish. But also strangely necessary.

At 2:43 a.m., the hallway lights flickered.

Eleanor held her breath.

The glass cracked again.

This time, the line ran straight down the center.

And on the floor, beneath the window, lay a single object.

A tooth. Human.

Still wet.

Ethan crouched beside the tooth without touching it. The thing glistened in the low light, too fresh to have been there long, too deliberate in its placement to be an accident. Eleanor stood a few feet behind him, arms crossed tightly over her chest, her face blank but her shoulders trembling. Neither of them spoke for a long while. The crack in the window groaned softly, like it was still splitting—just slower now, almost thoughtfully.

“It's a warning,” Ethan said finally, glancing up at her. “Or... maybe a message.”

“A message from what?” she asked, her voice hollow. “It doesn’t have a mouth.”

He shook his head. “No. But it wants one.”

Eleanor turned away abruptly and walked toward the kitchen, gripping the edge of the counter like it might stop her from shaking apart. “What happens when the glass gives way completely? Do they just walk in? Crawl in? What if it’s already in here?”

Ethan stood, his face tense with something between anger and helplessness. “We’re not going to let it get that far. Isaac said we could delay it. Disrupt its process. We just have to stay ahead of it, right?”

“I’m not sure I even know what time is anymore,” she murmured. “I haven’t slept properly in three nights. Every time I close my eyes, I’m back outside that window. Looking in. Watching myself.”

She turned, her face pale in the overhead light. “What if it already knows me too well?”

Ethan didn’t have an answer. He picked up the poker she kept leaning against the kitchen table and held it loosely, as if its weight anchored him to something real. “We need to go deeper. Find out more about what this thing is. Maybe there’s something Isaac missed.”

Eleanor hesitated. “I think I have something. My grandmother—she kept a journal. Back when she was dying. There were entries about dreams. Shadows. She lived in this house for sixty years, Ethan. What if it started before me?”

Together they ascended into the attic, a cramped triangular space with dust layered like sediment across everything. Cardboard boxes lined the back wall, and under a tarp was the heavy cedar chest Eleanor remembered from childhood. She hadn’t opened it since before her sister died. Her hands hesitated on the latch before snapping it open.

Inside were old letters, photographs, brittle sheets of yellowed newspaper. Beneath those, wrapped in a strip of linen, was a notebook.

Her grandmother’s handwriting was precise, slanted, and small. The ink had faded in some places but the entries remained legible.

March 3rd, 1977 – Heard it again. That awful humming. Like something speaking underwater. It comes from the hallway, always when I’m alone. Always when the moon is waning.

March 8th – Cracks in the glass. The left window, same one as before. I replaced it last fall. That makes the third pane in under two years.

March 15th – Saw Margaret’s face in the window. But Margaret’s been dead for five years. It looked at me like it wanted something.

Eleanor flipped pages rapidly. The entries grew more desperate.

April 2nd – It wears faces. Not well, but it tries. Last night it wore Henry’s. Stood in the garden and waved. Henry died in 1962. Buried with no teeth.

She stopped cold.

“Buried with no teeth,” she repeated aloud.

Ethan leaned over her shoulder. “The tooth.”

She nodded. “It’s trying to speak. Isaac said they wear people. But maybe they wear memories, too. Old grief. This thing—it’s been here longer than I ever guessed. Maybe it clings to sorrow like a vine.”

They carried the notebook downstairs. The house felt heavier now, like it resented the intrusion. The cracks in the windows weren’t just growing—they were branching. At each seam of glass, the lines had begun to intersect, forming crude spirals. Like something trying to mimic symbols it didn’t understand.

That night, they didn’t sleep at all.

They sat in the kitchen with a lantern between them, poring through every inch of the journal. Outside, the storm returned. Not thunder and lightning this time—just wind. Fierce and relentless, it rattled the windows until the house seemed to groan with exhaustion. And above the wind, from somewhere within the walls, they heard it again.

That hum.

Low. Inhuman. Neither vocal nor mechanical. A pressure, vibrating the air in an almost imperceptible way. Eleanor dropped the journal, her hands clutching her ears instinctively. “It’s in the walls.”

Ethan stood, lantern in hand, and walked to the hallway.

“No,” she hissed. “Don’t go near the window.”

He ignored her. The hallway was quiet. Too quiet. The hum was louder here, like it had gathered beneath the floorboards. And then, just as he reached the crack-riddled pane, he saw it again.

A face in the glass.

But not watching. This time, it was on the inside.

He reeled back. The reflection didn’t move. It stood exactly where he had been a moment before, mirroring his position. But the eyes—those weren’t his eyes. They were wide and too round, and behind them was nothing but grey fog.

“Eleanor,” he said, voice tight. “You need to see this.”

“No,” she whispered from the kitchen. “I can’t. I’m not supposed to. It learns faster when I do.”

“It already knows us.”

She approached slowly. Together, they stood in front of the window. The figure mirrored them both now, a twisted reflection—Eleanor with a mouth too small, Ethan with fingers too long. They stood in identical postures, only slightly distorted. Like a sketch redrawn too many times.

And then, the mirrored Ethan smiled.

Its teeth were all the same size. Every one a molar.

The glass pulsed outward. Not shattered. Not broke. It flexed, like skin.

Ethan raised the poker.

But the figure didn’t lunge. It didn’t break through. Instead, it pressed one pale finger to the inside of the window—its side—and drew slowly, deliberately, a symbol.

The same spiral.

But this one was perfect. Not scratched or crooked. It understood the shape now.

“I think it’s finished learning,” Eleanor said softly.

They spent the rest of the night barricading the hallway. Furniture stacked against the walls. The window covered in black plastic and duct tape. It was a pathetic gesture, but it made them feel better. The sun rose reluctantly, bleeding pale orange across the sky like an infected wound. Eleanor hadn’t felt real morning in days.

By nine a.m., Ethan was asleep on the couch, the poker across his lap. Eleanor stood at the sink, washing a cup with water that felt too cold, her hands moving automatically. Her reflection in the kitchen window looked dull and grey. She frowned and tilted her head.

The reflection didn’t.

She dropped the cup.

It shattered, and Ethan jolted awake. He looked up at her face, still twisted with confusion and fear.

“What is it?”

She pointed with a shaking finger.

“I think it’s inside now.”

Chapter Three: Through the Threshold

It was a strange thing, Eleanor thought, to feel the presence of something unseen take root in your house. Not enter it—no, that was too sudden a word, too clear-cut. This was subtler. A creeping, ambient shift in the atmosphere, like walking into a room and forgetting why you came. It didn’t make itself known with footsteps or broken locks or swinging doors. It simply was. And somehow, it had always been.

The reflection in the kitchen window lingered for less than five seconds after she pointed it out. It blinked—once, deliberately—and then it was gone. Not vanished. Not fled. Just... absorbed, as if it had never existed. Ethan stood beside her now, squinting at the glass, then checking their own faces in its faint sheen. Both looked normal, shaken but normal. No false smiles. No mirrored gestures. No spirals traced in the condensation.

“It’s not just mimicking anymore,” Eleanor said, voice brittle. “It’s choosing when to appear. When not to.”

Ethan looked grim. “Which means it knows when we’re watching. Maybe it always did.”

They packed bags that afternoon—not to flee, but to prepare. Eleanor retrieved the journal again and began cross-referencing the spiral symbols against what Isaac had shown them. Ethan drove into town to buy thick blackout curtains, thermal blankets, and a handheld EMF reader from a novelty shop that catered to amateur ghost hunters. He brought food, batteries, extra memory cards for the cameras.

They weren’t running.

They were settling in.

Back at the house, Eleanor dug deeper into the attic storage. Between old boxes of linens and a crate of VHS tapes, she found another journal. Not her grandmother’s. This one was older, covered in a scaly black leather that stuck slightly to the touch. Inside were hand-drawn illustrations—some in ink, others in what looked disturbingly like dried blood. It was in Latin, mostly. She didn’t read Latin. But between the glyphs and marginalia, there were occasional notes in English, perhaps added later.

They live behind the mirrors, under the floorboards, inside the glass. They wear you from the inside out. They use what you love against you. They only imitate until they understand the soul, and then they become.

She shivered.

Below that:
Break the pattern. Break the face. Disfigure the window. Fragment the reflection.

She read the line three times. Her heart raced, not with fear, but with a dangerous idea.

“What if,” she said when Ethan returned, “what if we can stop it by corrupting the space it uses to watch? If it’s coming through the window, maybe it’s not just an entry—it’s a mirror. A portal of sorts. If we distort that portal, maybe we distort its image of us.”

Ethan looked at the window, now layered in thick plastic and backed by a bookshelf. “You want to break it?”

“Not just break it,” she said. “Change it. Disfigure it. If it sees us wrong, maybe it can’t finish the process.”

He didn’t argue. They were well past reason now. Together, they tore down the makeshift barricade and peeled back the black plastic. The glass shimmered faintly in the morning light. The spiral symbol was still etched faintly in the lower pane. Eleanor fetched a hammer and a small chisel from the basement.

“What if it retaliates?” Ethan asked.

“It already is.”

She started with the edges, chipping away small shards in irregular lines. Then they cracked a corner and spiderwebbed it further. They scraped at the spiral, distorting its form until it was no longer recognizable. The pattern, once eerily symmetrical, now looked chaotic, frayed. As the cracks spread across the pane, the hum returned—but this time not from the walls.

It came from the glass.

The window vibrated with a low resonance, almost like a scream muffled by miles of stone.

Eleanor backed away. “That’s not feedback.”

Ethan grabbed her arm. “It’s pushing back.”

The window shuddered. A long fissure split the center. A gust of freezing air burst from it—not wind, not natural. It was colder than any air she’d felt, like it had never touched sun. Like it came from a place without time.

They stumbled backward as the window shattered.

But not outward.

Inward.

The glass did not fall, did not collapse—it inverted, as though sucked through an invisible membrane. And in its place was not a hole, nor a void, but a surface. Glossy. Perfect. A mirror. And their reflections were no longer their own.

The figures in the mirror did not move in sync. One tilted its head too slowly. The other blinked only one eye. Their skin had an uncanny pallor, faintly bruised and waxen.

Ethan raised the poker.

The mirror rippled.

His reflection opened its mouth.

The sound was unbearable—a wet, rattling series of clicks, followed by a long exhale that vibrated through their spines. It didn’t speak in language. It spoke in memory. Eleanor could feel it brushing against her mind, rifling through images, dreams, regrets. Her sister’s face. The moment of her death. The scream Eleanor never let out. The silence that followed.

“No,” she whispered. “That’s not yours.”

She stepped forward, lifted the chisel, and drew it slowly across her own cheek.

A shallow cut.

The pain was real.

The mirror recoiled.

Her reflection screamed—a grotesque distortion, mouth yawning far too wide, eyes rolling back in their sockets. The mirror pulsed again and cracked. Tiny fissures.

Ethan shouted. “It’s working!”

The room began to twist. Light bent unnaturally, shadows stretching into corners where they shouldn’t reach. The sound returned—a droning hum that shifted into what almost resembled words. A woman’s voice. Then a child’s. Then something that sounded like Eleanor, only... wrong.

“I am here now,” it said.

The mirror imploded.

Shards flew backward, dissolving before they hit the floor. The window was gone. In its place: nothing. Not a hole, but an absence. A perfectly smooth, black rectangle.

They stood in silence.

Neither moved.

Then, slowly, the rectangle faded into the wall like a dying ember.

And just like that, the pressure lifted.

The house exhaled.

The humming stopped.

The lights stabilized.

But neither of them spoke. Not yet. Not until Eleanor reached out and touched the wall where the mirror had been.

It was warm.

Too warm.

“Did we trap it?” she asked.

“I don’t think so,” Ethan replied, his voice barely audible. “I think it retreated.”

“To where?”

He looked at her, then at the surrounding room.

Eleanor turned toward the hallway mirror.

It was fogging.

From the inside.

The fog on the hallway mirror thickened until it obscured the glass entirely, a milky veil that moved slowly, like breath over ice. Eleanor approached it cautiously, heart pounding, unsure whether to cover it again or confront it. Her reflection didn’t appear. There was no outline, no shadow—just the pulsing, opaque mist, alive and shifting. She reached out but stopped short of touching it. After what had just happened with the window, she didn’t trust any surface in the house to behave normally.

Ethan moved up beside her, poker still in hand, his expression tense but resolute. “We need to get rid of it. Every mirror. Every pane of glass. We can’t give it another opening.”

“I don’t think that matters anymore,” she said quietly. “It’s in the house now. I can feel it.”

“We weakened it. We made it retreat.”

“Not defeated. Just slowed.”

He exhaled hard, running a hand through his hair. “Then we stay ahead. Keep Isaac’s rules. No patterns. No sleep where it expects. Nothing familiar. If we make it hard to find us in our own home, maybe it can’t latch back on.”

Eleanor nodded, even as doubt crept in. She turned away from the mirror and went room by room, locating every reflective surface—her phone screen, a silver spoon, the tiny mirror in her makeup drawer. She covered them with cloth, duct tape, old pages from her grandmother’s journal. When she was done, it felt as if the house had gone blind.

But the feeling didn’t last.

That night, the house moaned. Not like wood expanding in the cold or pipes shifting with heat. It was deeper, more mournful. The sound came from the walls again, this time with a rhythm that pulsed like a heartbeat. Eleanor lay on the kitchen floor beneath a blanket, her bag as a pillow and Isaac’s book clutched to her chest. She hadn’t slept, but exhaustion tugged at her like gravity. Her thoughts were fractured, jumping from idea to idea with little cohesion.

What if it didn’t need the mirrors? What if the mirrors were only the first way in, and once it had entered, it could use anything?

She thought of her sister.

Lily had died in that very house, two years ago, in the bathtub. An overdose, they said. But Eleanor had always wondered if it had been more than that. Lily had called her the night before, crying, saying she was scared. Said something was watching her from inside her dreams. Eleanor had dismissed it as the drugs. Now she wasn’t so sure.

She stared at the ceiling, trying not to think of her sister’s pale face. Trying not to remember the way her mouth had hung open. The way the bathroom mirror had shattered when Eleanor found her.

Had it started then?

Had the thing been waiting all this time?

At some point, she drifted off.

She dreamed.

She was back in the garden, barefoot on the damp grass. The windows of the house all glowed from within, like every room was lit by fire. Her reflection moved independently in every pane—sometimes waving, sometimes crying, sometimes clawing at the glass as if begging to be let out. And then, in the attic window, she saw Lily.

Lily was smiling.

Her eyes were wrong.

“I’m still here,” Lily said, voice too clear, too crisp. “I never left.”

Eleanor screamed herself awake.

Ethan was standing over her, eyes wide. “You said her name,” he whispered. “In your sleep. You kept saying it.”

She sat up, gasping. “She’s in the attic. I saw her.”

“Eleanor—”

“No, listen! I saw her. But it wasn’t her. It was wearing her.”

They stared at each other for a long moment, then stood in unison and climbed the stairs to the attic. The air grew colder with each step. At the top, the door creaked open on its own. Eleanor hesitated, then stepped inside.

The attic was dark, but not empty.

The far wall, where they’d found the journal, now held something new: a tall, narrow mirror they had never seen before. Ornate, with a golden frame and beveled edges, it stood upright against the wall like it had always belonged there. But neither of them had ever brought it up.

Eleanor’s voice trembled. “That wasn’t here before.”

Ethan nodded slowly, face pale. “It brought it. Or made it.”

The mirror shimmered. Faintly. Like the surface of water disturbed by breath. In the center was Lily’s face—clear, vivid, beautiful. Her skin flawless. Her eyes human. She smiled gently, like she used to when Eleanor was a child afraid of storms.

“Ellie,” she said, soft and mournful.

Eleanor stepped forward, her breath caught in her throat. “Lily?”

“I was lost,” the voice continued. “But I’ve been watching. You don’t have to be scared anymore. I’m here now.”

Behind her, Ethan said nothing.

Lily reached out, palm pressed to the inside of the glass.

Eleanor moved closer.

And then the smile twisted.

Just slightly. Not grotesque—subtle. Like a mask slipping.

“Let me out.”

Eleanor stopped.

“No.”

Lily’s face flickered.

“Let me out.”

It wasn’t a plea this time. It was a demand. A command.

The mirror vibrated. A thin crack slid across the glass.

Ethan grabbed her arm. “Back away. Now.”

Eleanor hesitated—but the illusion was gone. Her sister’s face melted into waxy nothing, then reshaped into a faceless form. The same pale imitation from the hallway. It screeched—a sound that pierced through bone—and pressed both hands to the inside of the mirror, pushing as if against elastic skin.

The attic windows shattered inward.

Wind roared.

They fled.

The following morning, Isaac Wren arrived at the house unannounced. He looked worse than before—his eyes bloodshot, his hands shaking. He walked straight to the kitchen, sat down, and spoke without preamble.

“I felt it. Last night. The mirror opened.”

Eleanor nodded slowly. “It showed me my sister.”

“It’ll use anything it can pull from your memory. You have to understand—it doesn’t create. It reflects. It echoes. But once it echoes clearly enough, it becomes.”

Ethan paced nearby. “We broke one of the windows. Altered it. It fought back, but it worked. Sort of.”

Isaac shook his head. “The glass is just a skin. You peeled it back, but the body’s still beneath. The only way to sever it is to find the source. The first reflection. The original image. The mirror it came through.”

Eleanor leaned forward. “The attic?”

“Maybe,” Isaac said. “But I think it’s older than that. I think it’s tied to the land itself. To the house. Maybe even deeper.”

“Like under the house?” Ethan asked.

Isaac nodded. “You ever check the crawlspace?”

“No,” Eleanor said. “Never been down there.”

“Then that’s where we go,” he said grimly. “Because if it’s hiding its heart, it’ll bury it deep.”

They spent the rest of the day preparing.

And when the sun dipped below the trees and the shadows stretched long across the floor, they opened the hatch under the pantry and descended into the dark.

The air beneath the house was thicker than it had any right to be—dense with moisture and a rot that didn’t smell quite like decay, but more like something long forgotten. The crawlspace extended deeper than Eleanor remembered from when she was a child, when she used to imagine monsters in the dark corners of the floorboards. Now, crouched under the beams with a flashlight in her hand, she realized she might not have been wrong.

The space had warped.

The ceiling dipped lower the farther they went, but the floor sloped down unnaturally, as if the earth had been hollowed out by invisible hands. The walls of dirt were damp and glistening, lined with roots that pulsed faintly as if drawing in unseen breath. The flashlight beams wobbled along the walls as the three of them—Eleanor, Ethan, and Isaac—made their way forward.

“No one’s ever dug this deep under the foundation,” Ethan whispered, ducking under a beam. “This isn’t part of the original house. It’s... carved.”

“Or grown,” Isaac muttered, brushing one of the pulsing roots. He withdrew his hand quickly, frowning.

Eleanor stopped at a sudden turn in the path. Ahead, the dirt curved into a wide basin—like a crater beneath the house. At its center stood something utterly out of place: a large, oval mirror, framed in blackened wood twisted into thorn-like points. It stood without support, rooted into the dirt, vibrating faintly in the torchlight. Around it, hundreds—maybe thousands—of teeth were scattered in perfect concentric circles, like offerings to a god.

Eleanor couldn’t breathe.

It was the same mirror from her dream. From Lily’s dream. From the attic—but older. More primal.

Isaac stepped forward, kneeling by the edge of the basin. “This is the origin. This is the reflection it started from. A mirror like this doesn’t belong to one home—it belongs to the place. The town. The line of memory stitched across blood and death. Your grandmother. Your sister. The Deacons. This is the mirror they all touched, one way or another.”

“Why is it under my house?” Eleanor asked, voice hoarse.

Isaac didn’t answer right away. He stood slowly, face drawn.

“Because something drew it here. Or something was left behind. Some echo that never faded.”

Ethan stepped toward the mirror. “So we destroy it.”

Isaac raised a hand. “Wait. You can’t just smash a mirror like this. It’s not glass anymore—it’s a door. And it’s open. You shatter it while it’s open, you might bring something through. Or worse—trap someone in.”

Eleanor’s heart began to race. “Then what do we do?”

“There’s a ritual,” Isaac said carefully, pulling a folded, brittle page from his jacket. “It’s not an exorcism. Not really. More like... severing a thread. You sever the reflection’s hold over this world. It needs blood. Salt. Fire. And most importantly—recognition. The thing needs to see itself as false.”

“Then we let it look,” Eleanor said. “We force it to see what it is.”

They began the preparations quickly. Isaac poured a circle of salt around the basin, murmuring old Latin phrases under his breath. Ethan gathered dry brush and old newspapers from the crawlspace’s edge, creating a ring of kindling near the mirror’s base. Eleanor stood silently in front of the mirror, watching the surface pulse and swirl like oil on water.

The reflections hadn’t appeared yet.

But she could feel them close. Waiting.

“Once we start,” Isaac warned, “you can’t look away from the mirror. No matter what it shows. You look away, it knows. And it wins.”

“I understand.”

Ethan held her hand tightly for a moment. Then the ritual began.

Isaac lit the fire.

The flames surged around the basin, brightening the dark with flickering orange. He began chanting the words on the old page, voice rising and falling like a dirge. Eleanor stared into the mirror.

The surface rippled.

Then it opened.

Faces emerged.

Dozens of them. Her mother, her grandmother, Lily—again and again. The Deacons, the children she’d passed in town, people she’d only seen in dreams. All their faces wore that same uncanny imitation. Mouths too stiff, smiles too rehearsed. The reflections stepped forward, reaching out through the glass, pushing against it as if the surface thinned with each breath.

One of them looked just like Eleanor.

It moved differently—elegant, practiced, with a slight delay, like an actor forgetting her cue. The fire flared around them, and Isaac’s voice intensified.

“Speak to it,” he shouted.

Eleanor stepped closer to the glass.

“You’re not me,” she said. “You never were.”

The imitation smiled. “I’m better.”

“No. You’re hollow. Empty. You wear memories like a coat, but you don’t feel them. You copy. You don’t become.”

The mirror cracked slightly.

The imitation frowned. “I remember Lily’s death.”

“You remember how it looked. But you didn’t hear her scream. You didn’t run down those stairs. You didn’t touch her body. You weren’t there when the world stopped turning.”

The reflection’s eyes grew darker.

“You’re nothing,” Eleanor said, stepping into the salt circle. “You’re a shadow. And I’m done carrying you.”

Isaac threw a vial of blood onto the flames.

The mirror screamed.

It wasn’t a sound—more like a pressure, a violent release of sorrow and fury. The surface imploded, folding inward like a collapsing lung. Shards of black glass sucked into themselves until nothing remained but a scorched impression in the dirt.

Then silence.

The air shifted again.

Warmth returned.

The roots stopped pulsing.

And just like that, it was gone.

Isaac slumped to the ground, exhausted. Ethan pulled Eleanor into his arms, shaking as hard as she was. They didn’t speak. There was nothing left to say.

They ascended the stairs an hour later. The house felt lighter. No hum. No crackling. No mirrored breath. Just quiet.

Peaceful.

As they reached the kitchen, Eleanor paused, turned, and looked at the covered hallway mirror.

She uncovered it.

Only her face stared back. Tired. Real.

And behind her, Ethan smiled—no extra teeth. No delay.

She nodded.

It was over.

At least, for now.

Chapter Four: The Shape of Silence

One week passed.

The cracks in the walls had stopped growing. The windows remained intact. The mirrors reflected only what they should. The house, once swollen with unseen weight, had exhaled at last, and Eleanor Sharpe could finally walk through her home without holding her breath.

She no longer slept in the kitchen. Her bed was back in the bedroom, the hallway window was boarded permanently, and the attic was locked with a bolt Isaac had installed himself. The mirror beneath the house was gone—or destroyed—or buried beneath something deeper than earth.

Isaac had vanished shortly after they’d returned aboveground. He said little, only that he needed to return to his maps and old texts. He left them both with one final warning: “It doesn’t die. It only forgets. You must, too. Or it finds a way back.”

Ethan stayed for another four days. They repaired the walls, patched up the damage in the attic, and replaced the window entirely with thick, frosted glass. The house became livable again—functional, familiar. But the familiar now had edges.

And Eleanor couldn’t forget.

Not yet.

She still heard it sometimes. Not the hum—that had stopped. But in the dead of night, when the wind dipped low and the trees outside swayed against the siding, she’d hear a breath. Not hers. Not Ethan’s. Just a hush, like something drawing air not to speak but to mimic the idea of it. It never stayed long. But it never fully left either.

On the eighth day, Ethan left.

He kissed her cheek at the door, lingered as though he wanted to say something more, then walked back to his car and drove off without looking back. She didn’t blame him. She didn’t stop him either. Whatever had happened under the house had changed them both, but it hadn’t made them more whole. It had carved something away.

That night, Eleanor took the journal back out.

Not her grandmother’s—the older one, bound in dried leather. She sat on the porch in the last light of day, reading through the faded Latin, the notations in red ink, and the ragged drawings of faces that had no eyes. She hadn’t noticed b
