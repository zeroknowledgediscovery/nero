CONSTABLE, Printers to Her Majesty     INTRODUCTION   PARTIAL collections of English poems, decided by a common subject or bounded by narrow dates and periods of literary history, are made at very short intervals, and the makers are safe from the reproach of proposing their own personal taste as a guide for the reading of others.  But a general Anthology gathered from the whole of English literature—the whole from Chaucer to Wordsworth—by a gatherer intent upon nothing except the quality of poetry, is a more rare enterprise.  It is hardly to be made without tempting the suspicion—nay, hardly without seeming to hazard the confession—of some measure of self-confidence.  Nor can even the desire to enter upon that labour be a frequent one—the desire of the heart of one for whom poetry is veritably ‘the complementary life’ to set up a pale for inclusion and exclusion, to add honours, to multiply homage, to cherish, to restore, to protest, to proclaim, to depose; and to gain the consent of a multitude of readers to all those acts.  Many years, then—some part of a century—may easily pass between the publication of one general anthology and the making of another.  The enterprise would be a sorry one if it were really arbitrary, and if an anthologist should give effect to passionate preferences without authority.  An anthology that shall have any value must be made on the responsibility of one but on the authority of many.  There is no caprice; the mind of the maker has been formed for decision by the wisdom of many instructors.  It is the very study of criticism, and the grateful and profitable study, that gives the justification to work done upon the strongest personal impulse, and done, finally, in the mental solitude that cannot be escaped at the last.  In another order, moral education would be best crowned if it proved to have quick and profound control over the first impulses; its finished work would be to set the soul in a state of law, delivered from the delays of self-distrust; not action only, but the desires would be in an old security, and a wish would come to light already justified.  This would be the second—if it were not the only—liberty.  Even so an intellectual education might assuredly confer freedom upon first and solitary thoughts, and confidence and composure upon the sallies of impetuous courage.  In a word, it should make a studious anthologist quite sure about genius.  And all who have bestowed, or helped in bestowing, the liberating education have given their student the authority to be free.  Personal and singular the choice in such a book must be, not without right.  Claiming and disclaiming so much, the gatherers may follow one another to harvest, and glean in the same fields in different seasons, for the repetition of the work can never be altogether a repetition.  The general consent of criticism does not stand still; and moreover, a mere accident has until now left a poet of genius of the past here and there to neglect or obscurity.  This is not very likely to befall again; the time has come when there is little or nothing left to discover or rediscover in the sixteenth century or the seventeenth; we know that there does not lurk another Crashaw contemned, or another Henry Vaughan disregarded, or another George Herbert misplaced.  There is now something like finality of knowledge at least; and therefore not a little error in the past is ready to be repaired.  This is the result of time.  Of the slow actions and reactions of critical taste there might be something to say, but nothing important.  No loyal anthologist perhaps will consent to acknowledge these tides; he will hardly do his work well unless he believe it to be stable and perfect; nor, by the way, will he judge worthily in the name of others unless he be resolved to judge intrepidly for himself.  Inasmuch as even the best of all poems are the best upon innumerable degrees, the size of most anthologies has gone far to decide what degrees are to be gathered in and what left without.  The best might make a very small volume, and be indeed the best, or a very large volume, and be still indeed the best.  But my labour has been to do somewhat differently—to gather nothing that did not overpass a certain boundary-line of genius.  Gray’s _Elegy_, for instance, would rightly be placed at the head of everything below that mark.  It is, in fact, so near to the work of genius as to be most directly, closely, and immediately rebuked by genius; it meets genius at close quarters and almost deserves that Shakespeare himself should defeat it.  Mediocrity said its own true word in the _Elegy_:     ‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,    And waste its sweetness on the desert air.’  But greatness had said its own word also in a sonnet:     ‘The summer flower is to the summer sweet    Though to itself it only live and die.’  The reproof here is too sure; not always does it touch so quick, but it is not seldom manifest, and it makes exclusion a simple task.  Inclusion, on the other hand, cannot be so completely fulfilled.  The impossibility of taking in poems of great length, however purely lyrical, is a mechanical barrier, even on the plan of the present volume; in the case of Spenser’s _Prothalamion_, the unmanageably autobiographical and local passage makes it inappropriate; some exquisite things of Landor’s are lyrics in blank verse, and the necessary rule against blank verse shuts them out.  No extracts have been made from any poem, but in a very few instances a stanza or a passage has been dropped out.  No poem has been put in for the sake of a single perfectly fine passage; it would be too much to say that no poem has been put in for the sake of two splendid passages or so.  The Scottish ballad poetry is represented by examples that are to my mind finer than anything left out; still, it is but represented; and as the song of this multitude of unknown poets overflows by its quantity a collection of lyrics of genius, so does severally the song of Wordsworth, Crashaw, and Shelley.  It has been necessary, in considering traditional songs of evidently mingled authorship, to reject some one invaluable stanza or burden—the original and ancient surviving matter of a spoilt song—because it was necessary to reject the sequel that has cumbered it since some sentimentalist took it for his own.  An example, which makes the heart ache, is that burden of keen and remote poetry:     ‘O the broom, the bonnie, bonnie broom,       The broom of Cowdenknowes!’  Perhaps some hand will gather all such precious fragments as these together one day, freed from what is alien in the work of the restorer. It is inexplicable that a generation resolved to forbid the restoration of ancient buildings should approve the eighteenth century restoration of ancient poems; nay, the architectural ‘restorer’ is immeasurably the more respectful.  In order to give us again the ancient fragments, it is happily not necessary to break up the composite songs which, since the time of Burns, have gained a national love.  Let them be, but let the old verses be also; and let them have, for those who desire it, the solitariness of their state of ruin.  Even in the cases—and they are not few—where Burns is proved to have given beauty and music to the ancient fragment itself, his work upon the old stanza is immeasurably finer than his work in his own new stanzas following, and it would be less than impiety to part the two.  I have obeyed a profound conviction which I have reason to hope will be more commended in the future than perhaps it can be now, in leaving aside a multitude of composite songs—anachronisms, and worse than mere anachronisms, as I think them to be, for they patch wild feeling with sentiment of the sentimentalist.  There are some exceptions.  The one fine stanza of a song which both Sir Walter Scott and Burns restored is given with the restorations of both, those restorations being severally beautiful; and the burden, ‘Hame, hame, hame,’ is printed with the Jacobite song that carries it; this song seems so mingled and various in date and origin that no apology is needed for placing it amongst the bundle of Scottish ballads of days before the Jacobites.  _Sir Patrick Spens_ is treated here as an ancient song.  It is to be noted that the modern, or comparatively modern, additions to old songs full of quantitative metre—‘Hame, hame, hame,’ is one of these—full of long notes, rests, and interlinear pauses, are almost always written in anapæsts.  The later writer has slipped away from the fine, various, and subtle metre of the older.  Assuredly the popularity of the metre which, for want of a term suiting the English rules of verse, must be called anapæstic, has done more than any other thing to vulgarise the national sense of rhythm and to silence the finer rhythms.  Anapæsts came quite suddenly into English poetry and brought coarseness, glibness, volubility, dapper and fatuous effects.  A master may use it well, but as a popular measure it has been disastrous.  I would be bound to find the modern stanzas in an old song by this very habit of anapæsts and this very misunderstanding of the long words and interlinear pauses of the older stanzas.  This, for instance, is the old metre:     ‘Hame, hame, hame!  O hame fain wad I be!’  and this the lamentable anapæstic line (from the same song):     ‘Yet the sun through the mirk seems to promise to me—.’  It has been difficult to refuse myself the delight of including _A Divine Love_ of Carew, but it seemed too bold to leave out four stanzas of a poem of seven, and the last four are of the poorest argument.  This passage at least shall speak for the first three:                 ‘Thou didst appear       A glorious mystery, so dark, so clear,             As Nature did intend    All should confess, but none might comprehend.’  From _Christ’s Victory in Heaven_ of Giles Fletcher (out of reach for its length) it is a happiness to extract here at least the passage upon ‘Justice,’ who looks ‘as the eagle              that hath so oft compared    Her eye with heaven’s’;  from Marlowe’s poem, also unmanageable, that in which Love ran to the priestess     ‘And laid his childish head upon her breast’;  with that which tells how Night,              ‘deep-drenched in misty Acheron,    Heaved up her head, and half the world upon    Breathed darkness forth’;  from Robert Greene two lines of a lovely passage:     ‘Cupid abroad was lated in the night,    His wings were wet with ranging in the rain’;  from Ben Jonson’s _Hue and Cry_ (not throughout fine) the stanza:     ‘Beauties, have ye seen a toy,    Called Love, a little boy,    Almost naked, wanton, blind;    Cruel now, and then as kind?    If he be amongst ye, say;    He is Venus’ run-away’;  from Francis Davison:     ‘Her angry eyes are great with tears’;  from George Wither:           ‘I can go rest          On her sweet breast    That is the pride of Cynthia’s train’;  from Cowley:     ‘Return, return, gay planet of mine east’!  The poems in which these are cannot make part of the volume, but the citation of the fragments is a relieving act of love.  At the very beginning, Skelton’s song to ‘Mistress Margery Wentworth’ had almost taken a place; but its charm is hardly fine enough.  If it is necessary to answer the inevitable question in regard to Byron, let me say that in another Anthology, a secondary Anthology, the one in which Gray’s _Elegy_ would have an honourable place, some more of Byron’s lyrics would certainly be found; and except this there is no apology.  If the last stanza of the ‘Dying Gladiator’ passage, or the last stanza on the cascade rainbow at Terni,     ‘Love watching madness with unalterable mien,’  had been separate poems instead of parts of _Childe Harold_, they would have been amongst the poems that are here collected in no spirit of arrogance, or of caprice, of diffidence or doubt.  The volume closes some time before the middle of the century and the death of Wordsworth.                                                                        A.

SIR WALTER RALEIGH 1552–1618   VERSES BEFORE DEATH      EVEN such is time, that takes in trust       Our youth, our joys, our all we have,    And pays us but with earth and dust;       Who, in the dark and silent grave,    When we have wandered all our ways,    Shuts up the story of our days;    But from this earth, this grave, this dust,    My God shall raise me up, I trust!     EDMUND SPENSER 1553–1599   EASTER      MOST glorious Lord of life! that on this day       Didst make thy triumph over death and sin;    And, having harrowed hell, didst bring away       Captivity then captive, us to win:    This glorious day, dear Lord, with joy begin,       And grant that we, for whom thou diddest die,    Being with thy dear blood clean washed from sin,       May live for ever in felicity!     And that thy love we weighing worthily,       May likewise love thee for the same again;    And for thy sake, that all like dear didst buy,       With love may one another entertain.    So let us love, dear Love, like as we ought;    Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.    FRESH SPRING      FRESH Spring, the herald of love’s mighty king,       In whose coat-armour richly are displayed    All sorts of flowers, the which on earth do spring       In goodly colours gloriously arrayed:    Go to my love, where she is careless laid,       Yet in her winter bower not well awake;    Tell her the joyous time will not be stayed,       Unless she do him by the forelock take;     Bid her therefore herself soon ready make,       To wait on Love amongst his lovely crew;    Where every one that misseth there her make       Shall be by him amerced with penance due.    Make haste therefore, sweet love, whilst it is prime,       For none can call again the passed time.    LIKE AS A SHIP      LIKE as a ship, that through the ocean wide,       By conduct of some star doth make her way,    When, as a storm hath dimmed her trusty guide,       Out of her course doth wander far astray!    So I, whose star, that wont with her bright ray       Me to direct, with clouds is overcast,    Do wander now, in darkness and dismay,       Through hidden perils round about me placed;     Yet hope I well that, when this storm is past,       My Helice, the loadstar of my life,    Will shine again, and look on me at last,       With lovely light to clear my cloudy grief:    Till then I wander, careful, comfortless,    In secret sorrow and sad pensiveness.    EPITHALAMION      YE learned sisters, which have oftentimes    Been to me aiding, others to adorn,    Whom ye thought worthy of your graceful rhymes,    That even the greatest did not greatly scorn    To hear their names sung in your simple lays,    But joyed in their praise;    And when ye list your own mishaps to mourn,    Which death, or love, or fortune’s wreck did raise,    Your string could soon to sadder tenor turn,    And teach the woods and waters to lament    Your doleful dreariment:    Now lay those sorrowful complaints aside;    And, having all your heads with garlands crowned,    Help me mine own love’s praises to resound;    Ne let the same of any be envied:    So Orpheus did for his own bride!    So I unto myself alone will sing;    The woods shall to me answer, and my echo ring.     Early, before the world’s light-giving lamp    His golden beam upon the hills doth spread,    Having dispersed the night’s uncheerful damp,    Do ye awake; and, with fresh lusty-head,    Go to the bower of my beloved love,    My truest turtle dove;    Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake,    And long since ready forth his mask to move,    With his bright tead that names with many a flake,    And many a bachelor to wait on him,    In their fresh garments trim.    Bid her awake therefore, and soon her dight,    For lo! the wished day is come at last,    That shall, for all the pains and sorrows past,    Pay to her usury of long delight:    And, whilst she doth her dight,    Do ye to her of joy and solace sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.     Bring with you all the Nymphs that you can hear    Both of the rivers and the forests green,    And of the sea that neighbours to her near:    All with gay garlands goodly well beseen.    And let them also with them bring in hand    Another gay garland,    For my fair love, of lilies and of roses,    Bound truelove wise, with a blue silk riband.    And let them make great store of bridal posies,    And let them eke bring store of other flowers,    To deck the bridal bowers.    And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread,    For fear the stones her tender foot should wrong,    Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along,    And diapred like the discoloured mead.    Which done, do at her chamber door await,    For she will waken straight;    The whiles do ye this song unto her sing,    The woods shall to you answer, and your echo ring.     Ye Nymphs of Mulla, which with careful heed    The silver scaly trouts do tend full well,    And greedy pikes which use therein to feed    (Those trouts and pikes all others do excel);    And ye likewise, which keep the rushy lake,    Where none do fishes take;    Bind up the locks the which hang scattered light,    And in his waters, which your mirror make,    Behold your faces as the crystal bright,    That when you come whereas my love doth lie,    No blemish she may spy.    And eke, ye lightfoot maids, which keep the door,    That on the hoary mountain used to tower;    And the wild wolves, which seek them to devour,    With your steel darts do chase from coming near;    Be also present here,    To help to deck her, and to help to sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.     Wake now, my love, awake! for it is time:    The Rosy Morn long since left Tithon’s bed,    All ready to her silver coach to climb;    And Phœbus ’gins to show his glorious head.    Hark! how the cheerful birds do chant their lays    And carol of love’s praise.    The merry Lark her matins sings aloft;    The Thrush replies; the Mavis descant plays:    The Ouzel shrills; the Ruddock warbles soft;    So goodly all agree, with sweet consent,    To this day’s merriment.    Ah! my dear love, why do ye sleep thus long,    When meeter were that ye should now awake,    T’ await the coming of your joyous make,    And hearken to the birds’ love-learned song,    The dewy leaves among?    For they of joy and pleasance to you sing,    That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring.     My love is now awake out of her dreams,    And her fair eyes, like stars that dimmed were    With darksome cloud, now show their goodly beams    More bright than Hesperus his head doth rear.    Come now, ye damsels, daughters of delight,    Help quickly her to dight!    But first come, ye fair hours, which were begot,    In Jove’s sweet paradise, of Day and Night;    Which do the seasons of the year allot,    And all, that ever in this world is fair,    Do make and still repair:    And ye three handmaids of the Cyprian Queen,    The which do still adorn her beauty’s pride,    Help to adorn my beautifullest bride:    And, as ye her array, still throw between    Some graces to be seen;    And, as ye use to Venus, to her sing,    The whiles the woods shall answer, and your echo ring.     Now is my love all ready forth to come:    Let all the virgins therefore well await:    And ye, fresh boys, that tend upon her groom,    Prepare yourselves, for he is coming straight.    Set all your things in seemly good array,    Fit for so joyful day:    The joyfullest day that ever Sun did see.    Fair Sun! show forth thy favourable ray,    And let thy life-full heat not fervent be,    For fear of burning her sunshiny face,    Her beauty to disgrace.    O fairest Phœbus! father of the Muse!    If ever I did honour thee aright,    Or sing the thing that mote thy mind delight,    Do not thy servant’s simple boon refuse;    But let this day, let this one day, be mine;    Let all the rest be thine.    Then I thy sovereign praises loud will sing,    That all the woods shall answer, and their echo ring.     Hark! how the minstrels ’gin to shrill aloud    Their merry Music that resounds from far,    The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling crowd,    That well agree withouten breach or jar.    But, most of all, the damsels do delight    When they their timbrels smite,    And thereunto do dance and carol sweet,    That all the senses they do ravish quite;    The whiles the boys run up and down the street,    Crying aloud with strong confused noise,    As if it were one voice,    Hymen! iö Hymen!  Hymen, they do shout;    That even to the heavens their shouting shrill    Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill;    To which the people standing all about,    As in approvance, do thereto applaud,    And loud advance her laud;    And evermore they Hymen, Hymen! sing,    That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring.     Lo! where she comes along with portly pace,    Like Phœbe, from her chamber of the East,    Arising forth to run her mighty race,    Clad all in white, that seems a virgin best.    So well it her beseems, that ye would ween    Some angel she had been.    Her long loose yellow locks like golden wire,    Sprinkled with pearl, and pearling flowers atween,    Do like a golden mantle her attire;    And, being crowned with a garland green,    Seem like some maiden Queen.    Her modest eyes, abashed to behold    So many gazers as on her do stare,    Upon the lowly ground affixed are;    Ne dare lift up her countenance too bold,    But blush to hear her praises sung so loud,    So far from being proud.    Nathless, do ye still loud her praises sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.     Tell me, ye merchants’ daughters, did ye see    So fair a creature in your town before;    So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,    Adorned with beauty’s grace and virtue’s store?    Her goodly eyes like sapphires shining bright,    Her forehead ivory white,    Her cheeks like apples which the sun hath ruddied,    Her lips like cherries charming men to bite,    Her breast like to a bowl of cream uncrudded,    Her paps like lilies budded,    Her snowy neck like to a marble tower;    And all her body like a palace fair,    Ascending up, with many a stately stair,    To honour’s seat and chastity’s sweet bower.    Why stand ye still, ye virgins, in amaze,    Upon her so to gaze,    Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,    To which the woods did answer, and your echo ring?     But if ye saw that which no eyes can see,    The inward beauty of her lively spright,    Garnished with heavenly gifts of high degree,    Much more then would ye wonder at that sight,    And stand astonished like to those which read    Medusa’s mazeful head.    There dwells sweet love, and constant chastity,    Unspotted faith, and comely womanhood,    Regard of honour, and mild modesty;    There virtue reigns as Queen in royal throne,    And giveth laws alone,    The which the base affections do obey,    And yield their services unto her will;    Ne thought of thing uncomely ever may    Thereto approach to tempt her mind to ill.    Had ye once seen these her celestial treasures    And unrevealed pleasures,    Then would ye wonder, and her praises sing,    That all the woods should answer, and your echo ring.     Open the temple gates unto my love,    Open them wide that she may enter in,    And all the posts adorn as doth behove,    And all the pillars deck with garlands trim,    For to receive this Saint with honour due,    That cometh in to you.    With trembling steps, and humble reverence,    She cometh in before th’ Almighty’s view;    Of her ye virgins learn obedience,    When so ye come into those holy places,    To humble your proud faces:    Bring her up to th’ high altar, that she may    The sacred ceremonies there partake,    The which do endless matrimony make;    And let the roaring organs loudly play    The praises of the Lord in lively notes;    The whiles, with hollow throats,    The choristers the joyous anthem sing,    That all the woods may answer, and their echo ring.     Behold, whiles she before the altar stands,    Hearing the holy priest that to her speaks,    And blesseth her with his two happy hands,    How the red roses flush up in her cheeks,    And the pure snow with goodly vermeil stain,    Lake crimson dyed in grain:    That even th’ Angels, which continually    About the sacred altar do remain,    Forget their service and about her fly,    Oft peeping in her face, that seems more fair,    The more they on it stare.    But her sad eyes, still fastened on the ground,    Are governed with goodly modesty,    That suffers not one look to glance awry,    Which may let in a little thought unsound.    Why blush ye, love, to give to me your hand,    The pledge of all our band?    Sing, ye sweet Angels, Alleluja sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.     Now all is done: bring home the Bride again;    Bring home the triumph of our victory:    Bring home with you the glory of her gain,    With joyance bring her and with jollity.    Never had man more joyful day than this,    Whom heaven would heap with bliss.    Make feast therefore now all this live-long day;    This day for ever to me holy is.    Pour out the wine without restraint or stay,    Pour not by cups, but by the bellyful!    Pour out to all that wull,    And sprinkle all the posts and walls with wine,    That they may sweat, and drunken be withal.    Crown ye God Bacchus with a coronal,    And Hymen also crown with wreaths of vine;    And let the Graces dance unto the rest,    For they can do it best:    The whiles the maidens do their carol sing,    To which the woods shall answer, and their echo ring.     Ring ye the bells, ye young men of the town,    And leave your wonted labours for this day:    This day is holy; do ye write it down,    That ye for ever it remember may.    This day the sun is in his chiefest height,    With Barnaby the bright,    From whence declining daily by degrees,    He somewhat loseth of his heat and light,    When once the Crab behind his back he sees.    But for this time it ill ordained was,    To choose the longest day in all the year,    And shortest night, when longest fitter were:    Yet never day so long, but late would pass.    Ring ye the bells, to make it wear away,    And bonfires make all day;    And dance about them, and about them sing,    That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring!     Ah! when will this long weary day have end,    And lend me leave to come unto my love?    How slowly do the hours their numbers spend;    How slowly does sad Time his feathers move!    Haste thee, O fairest Planet, to thy home,    Within the Western foam:    Thy tired steeds long since have need of rest.    Long though it be, at last I see it gloom,    And the bright evening-star with golden crest    Appear out of the East,    Fair child of beauty! glorious lamp of love!    That all the host of heaven in ranks dost lead,    And guidest lovers through the night’s sad dread,    How cheerfully thou lookest from above,    And seem’st to laugh atween thy twinkling light,    As joying in the sight    Of these glad many, which for joy do sing,    That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring!     Now cease, ye damsels, your delights forepast;    Enough it is that all the day was yours:    Now day is done, and night is nighing fast,    Now bring the Bride into the bridal bowers.    The night is come; now soon her disarray,    And in her bed her lay;    Lay her in lilies and in violets,    And silken curtains over her display,    And odoured sheets, and arras coverlets.    Behold how goodly my fair love does lie,    In proud humility!    Like unto Maia, when as Jove her took    In Tempe, lying on the flowery grass,    ’Twixt sleep and wake, after she weary was,    With bathing in the Acidalian brook.    Now it is night, ye damsels may be gone,    And leave my love alone,    And leave likewise your former lay to sing:    The woods no more shall answer, nor your echo ring.     Now welcome, night! thou night so long expected,    That long day’s labour dost at last defray,    And all my cares, which cruel Love collected,    Hast summed in one, and cancelled for aye:    Spread thy broad wing over my love and me,    That no man may us see;    And in thy sable mantle us enwrap,    From fear of peril and foul horror free.    Let no false treason seek us to entrap,    Nor any dread disquiet once annoy    The safety of our joy;    But let the night be calm, and quietsome,    Without tempestuous storms or sad affray:    Like as when Jove with fair Alcmena lay,    When he begot the great Tirynthian groom:    Or like as when he with thy self did lie    And begot Majesty.    And let the maids and young men cease to sing;    Ne let the woods them answer, nor their echo ring.     Let no lamenting cries nor doleful tears    Be heard
