The Thistlebone Legacy
Chapter One: A House on Wither Hill

They came at dusk, as if the dark itself had beckoned them home. The Grale family—what remained of it—had been gone from Wither Hill for almost twenty years. But on a night thick with mist and the distant growl of thunder, the black Rolls-Royce came purring up the gravel path, headlights bleeding pale through the hanging fog, and stopped at the gate of the old Thistlebone House.

Cassara Grale, the eldest daughter, stepped out first. She wore a dark green coat belted at the waist, gloves too elegant for the mud-caked ground, and her hair in a tight bun that gave nothing away. Behind her, Jules Grale, her younger brother, emerged with a cigarette in his mouth and an expression of vague distaste. The third passenger remained in the backseat for a long moment. When he finally stepped out, even the crows on the fenceposts seemed to hush.

Roman Grale.

Their father.

His face was pale as bone, his eyes sunken but watchful, always watching. As if the trees whispered secrets only he could hear. He stood before the gate of Thistlebone and said nothing, just stared at the rusting emblem of a thistle and a snake twined together, carved into iron. A family crest that no one dared speak of in the village anymore.

"Still here," Cassara murmured, brushing her glove across the gate's surface. “Like rot beneath a floorboard.”

Jules chuckled dryly. “You always did have a way with metaphors, Cass.”

The gate creaked open with a groan that felt like a warning.

They stepped into the past.

The village of Barrow's Dell remembered the Grales all too well. They had been the ruling name here once—not by law, but by fear. Even now, decades since the scandal, older villagers kept their heads down when they heard the name. Shopkeepers who had been boys during the Trial crossed themselves when they passed Thistlebone's overgrown boundary wall.

“Thought they’d burned that place to ash,” muttered Ewan, the blacksmith, as he watched the car disappear up the lane.

His apprentice, a wiry youth named Lew, looked up with a frown. “Who are they, really?”

Ewan spat into the fire. “Ghosts. Rich, well-dressed ghosts with secrets stitched into their coats.”

Inside Thistlebone, the air was stale, like breath held too long. The furniture was covered in white sheets, yellowed at the edges, and the chandeliers hung like skeletal hands from the high ceilings. A single painting still dominated the drawing room—a portrait of Alaric Grale, Roman’s grandfather, eyes burning like coals above a faint smile. The man who built the family’s fortune. The man who vanished in 1913 without a trace.

Cassara pulled the cloth from a nearby chair and sat, dust pluming into the air like a curse. “I assume you have a reason for dragging us back, Father.”

Roman stood by the fireplace, his long fingers brushing across the stone mantel. He stared into the empty hearth as if it held visions.

“It’s time,” he said. “The blood oath was made. And the debt... must be paid.”

Jules scoffed. “Oh come on, are we still clinging to those old stories? Blood oaths and secret chambers and cursed lineages? You want us to play house in this mausoleum until some imaginary debt is cleared?”

Roman turned, slowly. “Not imaginary. Buried. Like everything else in this house.”

There was silence.

Then Cassara spoke. “We need to know everything. All of it.”

The truth began, like most sins, with a body.

In 1892, Alaric Grale found something beneath the hill. A relic of sorts. The villagers called it the Thistle Idol, a carved object that predated the church and the town and perhaps even language itself. The records were burned in the fire of 1899, but the whispers endured. Alaric’s rise to power had been meteoric. Factories. Land. Men who bent the knee with their mouths smiling and eyes terrified.

But there was a cost.

The family kept the idol in a vault under the house. And each generation, it was said, owed a tithe—an offering of blood, either symbolic or real. When the tithes went unpaid… strange things happened.

Roman’s voice broke as he explained it, staring not at his children but at something behind them.

“They took your mother,” he said. “The night I refused. I thought it was a dream. But I heard her—under the floorboards. For weeks. Until she stopped.”

Neither Cassara nor Jules said anything for a long time.

Later that night, Cassara explored the east wing. The power had long since been shut off, so she carried an oil lantern, its golden glow casting eerie shadows along the hallway. She stopped before the nursery door. It was ajar, creaking slightly as if moved by breath alone.

Inside, dust lay thick on the floorboards. The crib remained in one corner, broken at one side. Strange symbols were carved into the wood. Not letters—just looping, coiling shapes like vines or intestines. Cassara knelt and ran her fingers along them.

She didn’t remember this. And yet it felt familiar.

A sudden chill swept the room. She stood quickly and turned.

A child stood in the hallway.

Not moving. Just watching.

Eyes black as pitch.

Then it was gone.

In the morning, Jules walked the grounds. The garden was a ruin of bramble and thistle, weeds grown up through shattered flagstone paths. He kicked a rusted birdbath and lit another cigarette, squinting at the treeline. There was something wrong with the birds here—too quiet. Or perhaps too many of them watching.

He nearly stepped on the half-buried skull before he saw it.

Small. Animal? Maybe. But the jaw was human.

He didn’t scream.

He didn’t even look surprised.

He just muttered, “Well, shit. I guess the rumors weren’t so exaggerated after all.”

They spent the week going through the house, cataloguing old records, journals, and hidden compartments. Roman, despite his age, seemed to grow more lucid by the day, as if being close to the source gave him clarity. On the third night, he showed them the vault.

It was hidden behind the wine cellar, sealed by a puzzle lock carved in the same twisting shapes Cassara had seen in the nursery. Roman pressed his palm to the center, muttered something in a language that seemed wrong in the mouth, and the stone slid aside.

The vault was deep.

At its heart stood a pedestal. And on it, the Idol.

It was no bigger than a human head, carved from dark wood that shimmered like wet stone, pulsing faintly with its own light. The face was twisted, not quite human, with antlers and too many teeth.

Cassara whispered, “It’s alive.”

Jules turned away, muttering, “We’re all bloody insane.”

Roman knelt before it and said, “We must ask for forgiveness. We must offer something.”

Cassara felt something move beneath her skin.

Something waking up.

Back in the village, animals began disappearing. A farmer found his entire flock arranged in a circle, entrails spiraled outward like a symbol. Children spoke of dreams—of the man with black eyes and horns who came to them at night and whispered their names.

The police from Dunwick came once. Then never again.

The Grales stayed in the house. Studying. Preparing.

Jules began to change. His dreams became violent. He took to carrying a knife, though he claimed it was for “practical” reasons. Once, Cassara found him standing in the hallway outside her room, staring at the wall. When she asked what he was doing, he just said, “Listening.”

The house creaked and groaned at all hours, its foundations whispering old stories.

Cassara discovered a journal—her mother’s. Pages torn, water-stained, but enough remained.

“I saw it in Jules when he was three. He watched the idol and it blinked. I tried to burn it once. It bled.”

On the seventh night, Roman went missing.

They found his coat in the garden, torn and wet. No sign of a struggle. No footprints. Only the word PAID carved into the frost of the stone bench.

Cassara took charge.

They would finish this.

Burn the idol. Destroy the vault. End the bloodline if they had to.

But Thistlebone House was not finished with them yet.

Not by a long shot.

That night, the rain came.

It came hard, angry, as if the sky itself resented what the Grales had awakened. Thunder rolled over Wither Hill like the grinding of ancient stones, and the windows of Thistlebone shuddered in their panes. The storm lashed against the house, not like weather, but like a siege. Cassara stood at the window in her father’s study, arms folded tightly, watching the trees sway like dancers in convulsions. The old elms groaned under the weight of the wind, and she could swear they leaned closer than before.

Behind her, the fire burned low. She had piled Roman’s papers on the desk—old ledgers, handwritten records from generations past, pieces of the puzzle they were still trying to assemble. She had expected land deeds, business transactions, maybe some half-buried affairs. Instead, she found scrawled invocations, blood-signed contracts, and diagrams that felt wrong even to look at. One sketch kept reappearing—some kind of circle with symbols around it, always with a crude eye at the center. The words "Dominus Silvarum" were scribbled beneath it more than once.

The Lord of the Woods.

A myth, supposedly. Cassara had read something about it in the old village almanacs—an entity from pre-Christian Barrow's Dell, worshipped in groves and feared in storms. The villagers had buried that past in soil and salt, but the roots had grown back.

She closed the book and stepped away from the desk. She needed air, or at least space from the suffocating layers of secrets that hung in every corner of the house. She found Jules in the drawing room, sprawled in an armchair with a bottle of red wine and a look that could sour milk.

“You’re not sleeping,” she said, not a question.

He looked at her, eyes dull, and took a long pull from the bottle. “Neither are you.”

She sat opposite him, rubbing her temples. “He’s not coming back, is he?”

Jules didn’t answer right away. He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “I don’t think he left. I think he’s still here. I think this house swallowed him.”

“You mean the vault?”

He shook his head. “No. I mean the house. It’s watching us. It knows we don’t belong here anymore.”

Cassara wanted to argue. She wanted to dismiss it all—the idol, the symbols, the eyes she kept seeing in mirrors that weren’t her own. But she couldn’t. The logical scaffolding she had lived her life upon was cracked, splintering with each new day inside these rotting walls.

“I’ve been dreaming,” she said, quietly. “Of a woman in white. She stands at the edge of the garden, watching. She never moves. But every night she’s closer.”

Jules didn’t look surprised. “Last night, I saw her too. She whispered something in my ear.”

“What did she say?”

He finished the bottle and leaned back. “She said I was already dead.”

In the attic, a door they had never noticed before had appeared.

Not that it had been invisible. No, it had simply not been there. They had scoured the house top to bottom, and this door—a small one, no more than four feet tall, with a brass handle that looked freshly polished—was new.

Cassara stared at it for nearly five minutes before touching it. Her fingers tingled when they brushed the knob. Behind her, Jules stood with an oil lamp.

“I don’t think we should go in,” he said.

“We don’t have a choice,” she replied.

The door creaked open with unnatural slowness. The passage beyond descended at a sharp angle, the walls narrowing as they went down. It felt like going into the earth, though they were still in the attic. The smell was thick—wet earth, old stone, and something metallic, like rust or blood.

The corridor ended in a room lined with mirrors.

There were thirteen of them. Each a different shape and size, none facing the same direction. They were mismatched, cracked in places, and all of them showed reflections that weren’t quite right. In one, Cassara saw herself smiling though her face was still. In another, Jules walked backward as he stood still. One mirror was pitch black, its surface like tar.

In the center of the room was a small table, and on it sat a photograph.

It was their mother.

Taken in the very room they now stood in.

Only... she had died twenty years ago.

Cassara picked up the photograph. Her hands trembled. In the corner, written in ink so faded it was almost illegible, were the words:

“The price was never paid. He will come for the heirs.”

The mirrors began to hum.

A low, grating vibration that rattled their teeth.

They ran.

Downstairs, the house was changing.

Walls where there were none before. Doors that wouldn’t open. Paintings rearranged themselves, subjects glaring out from the canvas with contempt. The chandelier in the foyer had rotted mid-air and lay shattered across the marble tiles, as if gravity itself had shifted.

Cassara grabbed the journal from the study and threw it into her bag. Jules was already in the hallway, packing food and matches into a duffel. They didn’t say a word—they didn’t need to. The house wanted them there. Which meant they had to leave.

They made it as far as the garden wall.

Then the fog came.

It was instant and absolute. A choking curtain of white so dense they couldn’t see more than a foot in front of them. Cassara reached out for Jules’ hand and found nothing. She turned, called his name—but her voice felt swallowed, dampened like sound underwater.

Then she heard a whisper in her ear.

It wasn’t Jules.

It wasn’t human.

She turned and ran, not sure where she was going, only knowing that she had to move. Roots snatched at her feet. Branches reached down like fingers. The garden was wrong. It wasn’t a garden anymore. It was a maze. And it had no exit.

When she came to, she was in her childhood bedroom.

The wallpaper was faded. The ceiling had a crack in the shape of a crooked smile. Outside the window, the storm was gone. A pale blue sky stretched out above the trees.

But something was wrong.

Too quiet. Too still.

She sat up slowly, then noticed the note on the bedside table. It was written in her mother’s handwriting.

“You must finish what he started. Only blood can seal the wound.”

Below that, in a different hand—sharper, more angular—were the words:

“He is not dead. He is waiting.”

She stood, clutching the note, and opened the door.

Down the hallway, she saw Jules. Standing in the nursery doorway.

He turned to her and smiled, but his eyes were wrong.

Too black.

Too wide.

“Cass,” he said. “It’s better if we don’t fight it. We belong to the house now.”

She slammed the door.

And locked it.

And cried.

Not because she believed him.

But because some part of her already did.

Chapter Two: Roots Beneath the Skin

Morning came like a reluctant apology. Thin, gray light seeped through the stained curtains, casting wan shadows on the hallway floors. Cassara sat upright in the bed, legs pulled up beneath her, a carving knife gripped in one hand, the note from her mother clenched in the other. Her breath fogged in the cold air. The heat had long since given out, and with it, the sense of time itself had begun to unravel.

She hadn’t heard from Jules since the night before, when his eyes had changed. She told herself it hadn’t been real, that exhaustion or the house’s poison had gotten into her. She told herself a great many things in those hours between midnight and dawn. But none of it mattered now. The note was real. The photograph was real. The vault, the idol, the eyes in the mirrors—real. Thistlebone wasn’t just a haunted house. It was a wound in the earth. And they were the scabs being picked clean.

Cassara stood slowly, stretching joints that ached from both cold and tension. She moved quietly, knife still in hand, listening for any noise that might betray movement outside her room. The hallway was empty. The air was still.

But the mirrors—she realized—had all been removed.

The one at the end of the hall, the oval-shaped one framed in bronze ivy, was gone. As was the square mirror beside the linen closet. In their place were dark spots on the wallpaper, as if the house itself had sweat them away. She moved cautiously, checking each room. Jules’ door was open. The bed unslept in. His pack still in the corner, untouched.

Downstairs, the front door stood wide open.

The air outside was wet, heavy with fog again. She stepped through cautiously, expecting the maze-like garden from the night before—but instead, she found herself back in the old hedgeway. It was wild, overgrown, but the paths were straight. She could see the old greenhouse from the steps. The glass was broken, but intact enough to still glimmer. It looked almost peaceful in the still morning haze.

And then she saw him.

Jules.

He stood in the center of the garden, arms at his sides, staring at the greenhouse. He hadn’t noticed her yet. She could see from the way his body swayed slightly that he was in some kind of trance. She moved quickly, silently, knife tucked into her coat sleeve.

“Jules,” she said quietly.

He didn’t move.

She stepped closer. “Jules.”

He turned his head just slightly, enough that she could see one eye. It was bloodshot, the iris almost gold in the light. His mouth opened slowly, like he was remembering how to use it.

“I saw her,” he whispered. “Our mother. She’s still here.”

Cassara hesitated. “You mean—?”

“She’s in the walls,” he said. “In the trees. She never left. They took her and fed her to the roots.”

Cassara reached for his arm. “We need to go. We need to burn the idol. End this.”

Jules didn’t pull away, but his gaze shifted toward her hand. “You can’t burn it. That’s not how this ends.”

“Then how?” she snapped.

He looked at her, full on now. “It wants one of us.”

She stepped back, her grip tightening on the knife. “No. No, we are not sacrificing anyone. That’s what they did. That’s what Roman did.”

“He didn’t have a choice,” Jules murmured. “He tried to fight it. But the house doesn’t forget. The idol... it remembers every broken promise.”

Cassara shook her head. “You’re not thinking straight. You’ve been in this place too long.”

“So have you.”

He smiled, but it wasn’t his smile.

Cassara turned and ran.

The cellar door was locked again. She didn’t remember doing that. She didn’t remember the vault entrance being resealed either, but when she reached it—pushing through the dust and broken shelves of the wine storage—it was sealed shut with fresh mortar.

The stone was still wet.

A handprint was pressed into it.

She stared at it. It was smaller than hers. A child’s.

Cassara stumbled back. The air down here felt thicker than upstairs, the cold more personal, like a mouth breathing down her neck. She gripped the knife tighter, then turned quickly and went back up the stairs.

In the kitchen, the clock ticked for the first time in days. She hadn’t noticed it until it stopped—somewhere in the middle of their first night back. Now it ticked again, loudly, each second falling like a hammer on glass. She searched the drawers, looking for anything useful. Salt. Matches. An old hammer. She found a box of nails and some coarse rope. She packed it all into a satchel.

She knew what needed to be done.

If she couldn’t burn the idol, she would bury it. Bury the house if she had to. And if Jules was lost, she would drag him back.

Or put him down.

The thought sent a spike of guilt through her, but she couldn’t let that fester. Not here. Not now. She needed to move before the house remembered she was still alive.

Back in the village, Barrow’s Dell had changed.

The streets were too clean. The houses too quiet. A woman passed Cassara without blinking, without even glancing. Her face was blank, her eyes empty. She walked like a wind-up doll. Cassara entered the post office to try and call for help, but the man behind the counter was speaking in a tongue that didn’t belong in any human throat. His lips moved, but the sounds came out like wind rustling dry leaves. When she demanded he stop, he simply tilted his head and smiled.

She ran.

Even the church was closed. Its windows boarded from the inside. The priest—Father Greaves, if she remembered correctly—was nailed to the door. Still alive, eyes wild, a wreath of dried thistle shoved into his mouth like a gag.

Someone—or something—had taken the village.

Or maybe the village had never truly been free.

Back at Thistlebone, she found Jules in the nursery. He was humming a lullaby. A broken one. Just five notes, repeated endlessly. He sat in the old rocking chair, the one that had belonged to their mother, and cradled something wrapped in cloth.

She stepped in slowly.

“What is that?” she asked.

He didn’t look up. “Our inheritance.”

Cassara approached. The cloth moved.

She pulled it aside.

It was the idol.

But it had changed.

Its face now looked unmistakably human.

And it was hers.

Her own face, staring back up at her from carved wood, eyes blinking slowly, mouth twitching in a silent scream.

She dropped it with a cry, but Jules didn’t flinch.

“It knows us now,” he said. “It’s learning. Every day we stay here, it becomes more real. And soon it will take a form.”

Cassara stared at him. “You’re helping it.”

“I’m obeying it.”

He stood, carefully placing the idol back into the crib.

“You can’t run from blood,” he said. “You can only spill it.”

She backed out of the room, heart pounding. She had to find the furnace. The basement. Anywhere she could destroy the thing, even if it killed her.

The house shifted again.

Hallways lengthened. Doors locked. Paintings whispered.

Somewhere, the child was crying again.

And Thistlebone was smiling.

Cassara moved through the twisting corridors of Thistlebone with the practiced silence of prey that knows the predator is near. Every stair creaked differently now, the tones shifting like notes in a sick melody. The paintings that hadn’t moved before now seemed to breathe. One—a portrait of a red-haired woman in a mourning dress—was weeping oil. Another had black mold spreading from the corners, forming shapes too deliberate to be natural. She kept her gaze forward, refusing to meet the eyes in the frames. She didn’t want to see herself there. Not again.

The furnace was deep in the lower sub-basement, a space once used for storage during the First World War when the house served briefly as a convalescent retreat. Roman had mentioned it in passing during one of his lucid moments—"The old fire beneath the house, where Alaric burned his sins." It hadn’t seemed important then. Now it felt like the only place that might still have the heat to undo what the family had worshipped.

She passed the threshold into the older wing of the manor. The door here was warped and stuck, and she had to shoulder it open, splinters catching in her coat. The air beyond was damp and coppery, like old pennies soaked in rot. The walls were no longer plaster and wood. They were stone—cold, slick, and sweating. The light from her lantern flickered.

At the bottom of the winding steps, the furnace room opened like a gaping mouth. The iron door to the kiln was rusted but intact, its hinges crying when she pulled it open. Inside, black soot and something pale—a bone? No, several—rested in the ash like forgotten offerings. She dropped to her knees, carefully removing the bag from her shoulder.

She had taken the idol while Jules was upstairs, distracted by his whispering lullaby. He hadn’t noticed her enter the room again. Or maybe he had and simply didn’t care anymore. He wasn’t fully Jules anymore. Whatever was in the house had begun stitching itself into his mind, thread by thread, and soon he would be no more than a voice the idol wore when it needed to speak.

The thing was still wrapped in the cloth. She hadn’t looked at it since. She couldn’t bear to see her own face carved into something so wrong. She shoved it into the kiln and began piling kindling around it—old furniture bits she’d collected from broken chairs, curtain rods, a splintered bedframe. She poured lamp oil across it all and struck a match.

For a moment, the fire hesitated.

Then it caught.

The room filled with smoke as the flames licked around the idol, the wood blackening, blistering. Cassara backed away, coughing into her sleeve, her eyes watering. The heat was immense.

But the idol didn’t burn.

Even blackened, it stayed intact. Its mouth moved.

It began to scream.

Cassara fell against the far wall, covering her ears. The sound wasn’t made for human hearing. It pierced her skull, crawled into her sinuses and twisted behind her eyes. She felt blood trickling from her nose, her ears. The furnace roared like a living thing, shadows writhing on the walls.

And then the flames died.

Snuffed out like breath on glass.

The idol sat amidst the ashes. Smiling.

Cassara curled against the wall, breathing in shallow gasps. The air smelled like burnt hair and something worse. Her vision swam, the room spinning as if gravity itself had warped. She tried to rise, stumbled, and vomited into the corner. A hand touched her shoulder. She flinched and swung blindly with the knife—but it was Jules.

Or what used to be Jules.

His eyes were darker now, his skin pale and stretched. He looked down at her with something close to pity.

“It has chosen,” he said softly. “And it chose you.”

Cassara struck again, this time with purpose, the blade cutting across his arm. He didn’t bleed. He didn’t even wince. He just stepped back.

“Fighting it won’t stop what’s coming,” he said. “You should understand by now. You’re part of the cycle.”

She scrambled to her feet and bolted, shoulder slamming into the doorframe. Jules didn’t follow. She could hear him laughing as she ran—low, guttural, not entirely his own.

The house was alive now.

More than before. It pulsed, walls subtly shifting as she passed. She found herself in unfamiliar rooms—rooms that couldn’t exist given the architecture. A library full of blank books, every page whispering as it turned. A nursery that smelled of milk and blood. A ballroom with a floor slick as flesh.

She ran through them all.

One room contained a spiral staircase that descended into blackness. Another held a dining table where versions of her family sat, unmoving, waxy-eyed, their mouths sewn shut with gold thread. Roman at the head, his head cocked, as if awaiting grace.

She passed through her own memories, now made into rooms: her childhood bed, the cracked porcelain doll she’d thrown at the wall during her ninth birthday tantrum, her mother’s perfume bottle empty and humming.

At some point, she found herself in the chapel.

She hadn’t realized Thistlebone had a chapel.

It was small, circular, and built from pale stone. The pews were covered in mildew. At the altar stood a statue—towering, monstrous, antlered. The Lord of the Woods. Its eyes had been gouged out centuries ago, but the gouges wept.

Behind it, an iron gate.

She knew without knowing why that the gate led back to the vault.

The real vault.

She pushed through it.

The stairs beyond were slick with moss. Each step she took echoed with a second, phantom footfall behind her, always a beat too slow. At the bottom, the vault opened—not into the chamber with the pedestal as before, but into something vast and impossible. An underground forest. The roots of the house ran like veins through the ceiling, dripping sap that glowed faintly. Trees grew from the stone floor, twisted and pale. The air smelled of ancient incense and decay.

In the center of it all stood the idol.

Or perhaps not an idol at all anymore.

It had grown.

It stood six feet tall now, humanoid in shape, with branches for limbs and a hollow where the face should be. Within the hollow, something moved—Cassara’s reflection, faint, flickering, like a candle behind glass.

It raised one arm, and she couldn’t move.

Her limbs locked in place.

She wanted to scream, but her mouth would not obey.

And then she heard it. The voice. Not aloud, but in her blood.

"You are the gate. You are the wound. Let me in."

Cassara’s heart pounded. She tried to resist. She thought of her mother, of Roman, of the generations before who had fed this thing, this false god, this parasite.

She reached into her coat, found the rope she had packed, and pulled it free.

She wound it around her arm and bit down.

Pain cleared the fog.

She dropped to one knee and muttered words she hadn’t known she knew.

The thing hissed.

It recoiled.

Branches shattered.

And above, the house groaned.

She had hurt it.

She had hurt the house.

And the house screamed in return.

She woke in the nursery again.

Jules was gone.

The idol was gone.

The sun shone through the window.

But nothing was right.

Because now, when she looked in the mirror across the room, the reflection did not move with her.

It smiled.

It opened its mouth.

And whispered: “You let me in.”

Cassara sat on the nursery floor for what felt like hours, staring at the mirror that no longer reflected her. Her knees were drawn up to her chest, arms locked tightly around them, every muscle in her body strung tight as wire. The whisper had stopped, but its echo clung to the walls of her mind. You let me in. The words carried an accusation, but also something far worse—satisfaction.

The room was brighter now, bathed in late morning light, yet nothing felt warm. The walls of Thistlebone had become slick again, the air humid and sweet with the scent of decay. Her breath fogged the mirror even though the glass was cold. She wanted to smash it. She wanted to burn the whole room. But she knew now—violence alone wouldn't destroy this thing. It fed on violence. On fear. On family.

Pushing herself to her feet, she paced slowly. Her head ached, the dull throb of it matching her heartbeat. She needed to make sense of what had happened in the vault—if it had even been real. The underground forest, the reflection, the words etched not into walls but into her blood. What was it the voice had said? You are the gate. You are the wound.

She thought of the others—of Roman, of Jules, of her mother. Pieces began to click into place like stained glass shards reforming an image. The family hadn’t just worshipped the thing beneath the house. They had hosted it. Not just in stone vaults or secret chambers, but in themselves. The bloodline wasn’t just metaphorical. They had been chosen.

She needed answers. Real ones. Not the scraps Roman had dropped or the cryptic pages left behind. Something deeper. And she knew where to look next: the forbidden study.

It was one of the only rooms in the house that had always been locked—padlocked with iron, the door reinforced with thick boards and leather-bound seals that bore ancient marks. As children, she and Jules had once tried to peek through the keyhole. All they saw was darkness, and all they heard was something breathing.

She went there now, barefoot, careful not to make noise, though she wasn’t sure it mattered anymore. If the house was alive, if it knew, then silence wouldn’t keep it from her.

The door was open.

The padlock hung snapped, its metal twisted as if melted.

Inside, the air was cold and dry, unlike the rest of the house. The walls were lined with books—hundreds of them, stacked from floor to ceiling, many bound in strange materials. Some were labeled in Latin, others in symbols she couldn’t place. The writing on one book shimmered and shifted when she tried to read it, changing shape like ink dropped in water. She looked away.

In the center of the room was a heavy oak desk. Its surface was scarred, burned in places, but the drawers were intact. She opened them one by one, rifling through brittle papers, crumbling photographs, yellowed charts of constellations drawn in patterns that didn’t match the night sky.

Then she found the journal.

It was small, leather-bound, with a cracked clasp and the initials E.G. pressed into the corner. Ewan Grale—her great-grandfather. The one who, according to village lore, had "gone into the earth" after accusing the clergy of hiding ancient truths. Roman had never spoken of him.

She opened the journal and flipped through, skimming until a passage stopped her cold.

“The idol is not a god. It is a wound. A tear in the veil between things. The Grale line has kept the tear open, fed it, loved it, feared it. We call it the Lord of the Woods, but it has no name, no shape. Only need. Need is its body. And what it needs now is more than blood. It wants inheritance. It wants to be born.”

Cassara closed her eyes. A chill spread through her bones. She turned the page.

“It can be sealed. I have seen the ritual. I have found the words. But the price is high. Not one death. All of us. The whole line. No heir, no gate. Without the gate, the wound closes. But none of them would agree. Roman was just a boy. I could not ask him to die.”

Her hands trembled.

She understood now what Jules meant when he said she was chosen. Not as a sacrifice—but as a vessel. And the only way to seal the gate, to close the tear, was to end the line.

All of them.

Including her.

She found Jules in the old parlor. He was sitting beneath the portrait of Alaric Grale, carving symbols into the floorboards with the point of a fire poker. The shapes pulsed faintly with orange light, like embers under skin.

“I know what we have to do,” she said.

He didn’t look up. “It’s already too late.”

“No. Not if we end it now.”

“End what?”

“Us.”

That made him pause. He looked at her. For a moment, something flickered in his eyes—recognition, pain, maybe even fear.

“We were born into this,” he said. “We didn’t ask for any of it.”

“And that’s exactly why we’re the ones who have to stop it.”

He shook his head. “You don’t get it. You’re already part of it. You let it in. You are the gate.”

She walked closer, pulling the journal from her coat.

“It doesn’t have to live through us. It doesn’t get to win.”

He stood slowly. “And what, you think killing me will fix that?”

She didn’t answer. She just stepped closer.

“I’m not afraid of dying,” he said. “I’m afraid of what comes after.”

“You won’t be there,” she whispered.

The house groaned.

The symbols on the floor flared.

And then Jules rushed her.

They crashed into the parlor table, shattering it. Her knife skittered across the room. He was stronger than he looked—driven by something inhuman. She fought dirty, kicking, biting, gouging at his eyes. One of them gave with a wet pop, but he didn’t scream. He just laughed, thick and gurgling.

She reached for the poker, still glowing faintly, and drove it into his chest.

He froze. Shuddered.

Then collapsed.

The laughter didn’t stop.

It just moved—to the walls, to the floor, to the air around her.

The house was angry.

But it was also wounded.

She dragged his body to the furnace. It took all her strength. She didn’t let herself cry. She didn’t let herself feel anything. Just motion, breath, one step after another. She whispered the words from the journal—words she didn’t understand, syllables that tasted like metal and fire.

She placed his body in the ashes where the idol had sat.

Then she climbed in after him.

She laid beside her brother and closed her eyes.

And spoke the final phrase.

The world ignited.

She woke in a field.

Bright sky overhead. Birds singing. Wind on her face.

Barrow’s Dell stood in the distance, quiet, smoke rising from chimneys. The windows gleamed. The fog was gone.

And Thistlebone was no longer on the hill.

Only grass and stone remained.

Cassara stood slowly, uncertain. Her limbs felt real. Her mind clear. She walked down into the village. People smiled at her. One old man tipped his hat.

She found her way to the post office.

“Can I help you, miss?” the clerk asked, his voice warm and utterly human.

“Yes,” she said. “Can you tell me... what happened to the Grale house?”

The man looked confused. “The what?”

“The manor. Thistlebone. The old estate on the hill.”

He frowned. “There’s never been a house on Wither Hill. Not since I was a boy.”

Cassara nodded slowly.

The wound was closed.

And no one remembered the scar.

Chapter Three: Echoes in the Hollow

The silence was the most unnatural part.

It followed Cassara everywhere, more than just the absence of noise—it was a blankness, a space where something ought to be but wasn’t. No creaking floorboards, no whisper of wind through rafters, no rustle of roots beneath the soil. In the village, everything moved with normalcy, yet she felt like a ghost in reverse: real among the unreal, out of sync with a place that had moved on without her.

She had stayed in Barrow’s Dell for three days after the house disappeared. Or, as far as the villagers were concerned, after nothing at all happened. She asked subtle questions—about the Grales, about Wither Hill, about Roman or Jules—and was met with polite confusion or concerned glances. One older woman, Miss Draycott, who ran the bakery, had smiled kindly when Cassara asked about Thistlebone and said, “There’s never been a manor up there, dear. Just wild hills and bad weather. You’re not from around here, are you?”

The words sank like stone.

Cassara was from here.

She was the last Grale.

And yet, in this version of Barrow’s Dell, there had never been a Grale family. No scandals. No whispered stories. No sealed vault beneath a house built on a wound in the world.

The line had ended.

And with it, the memory.

But not for her.

On the fourth morning, she left the village.

There was nothing more for her there—no one to talk to, no gravestone to mourn over, no trace that her family had ever existed at all. Her reflection was still hers, her voice still her own, but a part of her feared that if she stayed too long, that too would vanish, overwritten by the clean, forgetful world that had sealed itself like skin over a scar.

She took a train to the city, wrapped in layers and silence, watching the green hills fade behind her. At the station, she wandered until dusk, unsure of where she was meant to go. There was no one left to call. She had no friends outside the brittle circles of academia and estranged cousins who had long distanced themselves from the Grale name. Her father’s accounts were locked, her mother’s estate long gone. She had nothing but a single leather journal—Ewan’s—and a story no one believed.

She checked into a boarding house under a false name.

At night, she read the journal by candlelight, as if it contained some overlooked key, something she had missed. Some nights she imagined a passage would change, or the ink would bleed into new words, revealing secrets buried too deeply before. But the text remained the same. A confession. A warning. A ritual.

A sacrifice.

Cassara dreamed of the vault. Not the one beneath the house, but deeper, more ancient. A stone circle in a forest of white trees, where the moon never moved and the stars blinked with hunger. In the dreams, she stood at the center of that circle, her chest open like a door, and through it passed something vast and sorrowful, whispering her name in reverse.

She awoke sweating, eyes wet, breath shallow.

Each time, the silence afterward grew longer.

Weeks passed. Then months.

The city never stopped moving, never paused to notice the woman who drifted through its alleys and underground libraries like a shadow. She took a job shelving books at a private archive, paid in cash and questions. Her hands grew rough, her nails brittle. Her voice grew quieter. But her mind sharpened. She began to study.

Not just folklore, but the archaeology of places that had never existed.

She traced the name Dominus Silvarum across old manuscripts, followed its transformation through oral traditions in Eastern Europe, traced similar idols—always root-bound, always horned—across Celtic, pre-Roman, and Basque cultures. It was always the same pattern: an object mistaken for a god, fed offerings, which eventually turned on its worshippers. There were always vaults. Always sacrifices. And always—always—a family at the center. Chosen not by virtue, but by blood.

She found an old map once, tucked into the back of an untranslated monograph from the 1700s, detailing a ruin somewhere in northern France. The ink was faint, but the words Maison Vide stood out—"The Empty House." Something inside her twisted when she read it. She tore the page from the book and kept it.

A year passed.

Then a letter arrived.

There was no return address, only a wax seal—an unadorned circle with a single thorn etched into its surface. Her heart stopped.

Inside was a single sheet of parchment, thick and soft, with only four words:

You were not enough.

Her hands shook as she held the page. It smelled of mildew and iron. There was no doubt in her mind—it had come from Thistlebone. Or from something that remembered it.

The wound had not closed.

She had not sealed the gate.

And something still bled beneath the earth.

She left the next morning.

Traveled alone across the sea, through rural France and into the Alps, until she found the ruin the map had hinted at. Maison Vide—The Empty House—stood at the edge of a forest choked with pine and silence. It wasn’t a house at all, not anymore. Just two crumbling stone walls, overgrown with moss, and a foundation littered with bone-white rocks.

She camped there for three nights.

Nothing happened.

But each night she dreamed of eyes. Not human, not even mammal—something deeper, cold-blooded and ancient. A watcher beneath the soil. On the third morning, she unearthed something near what had once been a hearth: a stone idol, half-rotted with lichen, but unmistakably familiar.

She left it there.

She no longer believed in destroying idols.

They returned.

They always did.

Instead, she did what Ewan had done.

She wrote.

Pages upon pages, in ink and in blood, recording everything. The lineage. The curse. The ritual. The truth behind the silence of forgotten houses and the myths that no one dares to write down. She copied Ewan’s journal word for word. Then added her own.

Her voice.

Her warning.

She wrapped it all in cloth and sealed it in wax, then buried it at the heart of Maison Vide beneath a stone marked with a spiral.

She did not expect anyone to find it.

But someday, someone might.

And if they were like her, if they were chosen—not by name, but by blood—then perhaps they would have time to choose differently.

To fight, before the house found them.

Cassara returned to England a different woman.

Older, quieter, carrying something behind her eyes no one else could see.

The silence followed her.

But now she listened.

Because within that silence, sometimes, if the night was still and the wind passed a certain way, she could hear something underneath.

Not the house.

Not the idol.

But breathing.

Faint, steady.

Like something waiting to be born.

And she was no longer afraid.

She was ready.

The city changed in small, almost imperceptible ways.

Cassara noticed first in the eyes of strangers—people who, only weeks before, had seemed utterly unaware of her presence. Now, some paused mid-stride, glanced over their shoulders after passing her, or gave her too much space on the sidewalk. At first, she told herself it was paranoia. Cities were full of strange glances and shifting tides of attention. But she began to keep track: where it happened, how often, what time of day. The pattern was clear. It was always near alleyways. Always in colder weather. Always when she hadn’t slept.

They were not the same people, but something behind their eyes was.

One evening, on her way home from the archive, she took a longer route through a cobbled lane lined with antique bookstores and shuttered tea shops. Fog had rolled in off the river, laying low and thick against the ground. The smell of stone and something fouler rose with it. She passed a man standing beside a shuttered window. He wore a brown coat and a scarf wrapped tightly around his face, but his posture was wrong—too still, too centered. As she passed him, he turned his head slightly. Not fast enough for a reflex, not slow enough to be natural.

“Cassara Grale,” he said in a voice too quiet for human ears.

She did not stop. She did not look back.

But the hairs on her arms rose like frost-touched wheat.

She didn’t tell anyone. Who would she tell? The police? A doctor? A friend? They would all ask the same question—what proof do you have? But she had learned that proof did not matter. Only knowing. Only preparing.

That night, she removed the mirror from her room. It hadn’t shown her anything unusual, not yet. But she had begun to notice the delay. A fraction of a second between movement and response. Enough to suggest something else was watching through it. It was not the idol—it had burned, or tried to—but the force behind it had not died. It had simply changed.

The idol was only a symbol, a mask. The thing it represented had no shape. And now, freed from the bonds of ritual and the constraints of the Grale bloodline, it was loosed. Searching.

And it knew her name.

She dreamed again—this time not of the vault or the woods, but of a city submerged in roots.

Skyscrapers wrapped in vines thicker than train rails, streets covered in moss. Every building was bowed, sinking into soil that had once been asphalt. And through the empty avenues walked people—hundreds of them—with bark growing from their skin, their eyes filled with sap. They didn’t speak. They listened. Always listening.

At the center of the dream was a tree. Gigantic. Endless. Its branches spread across the sky, and at its base sat a door made of bone.

It opened.

And behind it was Cassara.

But not her.

The version that opened the door was smiling. Her hair longer, face pale as milk, eyes black with gold flecks. The twin held out her hand. In it was a seed. Small. Black. Pulsing faintly like a heartbeat.

“Take it,” the dream-Cassara whispered. “Grow it in your chest.”

She woke choking.

She vomited bile and a single black beetle onto the sheets.

It twitched once, then died.

Cassara stopped going to the archive. She no longer needed the books—she had memorized them, absorbed the patterns. She understood now that the knowledge wasn’t just academic. The rituals weren’t metaphors. The lineages weren’t curiosities.

They were blueprints.

The gate wasn’t closed.

She had delayed it.

The price she paid—her brother’s death, her own attempted sacrifice—had not sealed the wound. It had simply put the hunger to sleep. And now it stirred again, weaker, more cautious, but present.

She needed allies.

The name came to her while reading the marginalia of a forgotten volume on pagan thresholds: Solomon Delance. A folklorist turned recluse, once a renowned scholar of liminal theology and ancestral possession, now an obscure figure with no online presence and no recent publications. But buried in the references was a hint: an address in Dorset, scrawled beside an underlined phrase—“The living house is not unique.”

That was enough.

She traveled by train again, under another name, bringing with her nothing but the journal, the map from Maison Vide, and a small vial of salt.

Dorset was grey and unremarkable, the sort of countryside that had been old long before England existed. She found the address: a two-story cottage overgrown with ivy, the gate rusted through. The door was answered by a man whose face was lined with age but whose eyes burned with clarity.

“You shouldn’t have come,” he said at once.

“I know,” Cassara replied. “But I had to.”

He looked at her for a long time, then stepped aside.

Inside, the cottage was filled with books. Not just on shelves, but stacked in corners, on chairs, across windowsills. Candles burned in copper sconces, and bundles of dried herbs hung from the rafters. It smelled of cedar and ink.

Solomon Delance did not ask her story.

He knew it.

Or rather, he had seen versions of it before.

“You found the house,” he said that night, seated across from her at a table cluttered with manuscripts.

“It found me,” she replied.

He nodded.

“They always do.”

Cassara laid out the journal, the map, the letter with the wax seal. Solomon examined each with trembling fingers, nodding, murmuring to himself in Latin or something close to it. Finally, he leaned back.

“It’s still alive,” he said. “Of course it is. The ritual wasn’t enough.”

“I know. But I don’t understand what it wants now. The family line is broken.”

“No,” Solomon said, pointing to her. “You’re still breathing.”

She stared at him.

“You mean I have to—”

“No,” he said. “It doesn’t want your death. It wants your acceptance.”

Cassara’s mouth went dry. “To become the gate.”

He nodded. “And that’s the trap. If you accept, you become its vessel. If you resist, it finds another. There are always cracks in the world.”

“Then what do I do?”

Solomon looked at her, a sadness behind his eyes she hadn’t seen before.

“You teach others how to keep the cracks sealed. That’s all we can do.”

Cassara stayed for a month.

She learned more than she had in all her years of research. About the Hollow Ones, the Deep Seed, the forgotten cults that predated every major faith. She learned to mark thresholds, to bind memory into objects, to salt the eyes of the dead. She did not ask what Solomon had sacrificed to know these things.

On her last night, he gave her a box.

Inside was a mirror.

But the glass was black.

“This one only reflects what follows,” he said. “Use it wisely.”

She carried it with her, wrapped in velvet.

She did not return to the city.

Instead, she wandered.

Village to village, ruin to ruin, charting places where the air felt thin, where dreams left bruises, where silence had weight.

She left warnings.

She left journals.

She left seeds—her own kind—not of growth, but of remembrance.

Because forgetting, she understood now, was the first gift the gate offered.

And the last curse it left behind.
