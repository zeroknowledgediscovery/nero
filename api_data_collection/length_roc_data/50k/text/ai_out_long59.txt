Chapter One: The Red Letter Days

Rain needled the thin roof of the apartment like it wanted in. Each drip from the warped corner by the kitchen sink thudded into the dented pot below, the sound steady as a ticking clock—though perhaps more ominous. Jordan Keller sat cross-legged on the sagging couch, one hand tangled in his dark, unkempt curls, the other thumbing through a stack of envelopes. Most were unopened. All were bad news.

"Final Notice," screamed one. "Immediate Action Required," whispered another. A third had the red stripe of doom—overdue electricity bill.

It wasn’t just the bills. It was the way the apartment always felt a few degrees too cold. The way the fridge groaned when it cycled on, like even it didn’t want to keep going. The echo of silence where his partner’s voice used to be, before she’d packed her bags last May and left for Chicago, for something “more stable.”

Jordan exhaled, long and slow. “How the hell did I get here?”

Outside, the city continued its indifferent shuffle. San Amaro was never really quiet. Even at 2 a.m., car alarms, drunk laughter, and the occasional yell kept the air thick with life. But inside apartment 3B on 119 Garrison Street, it was just him and the debt.

He picked up his phone. No new messages. His inbox was a graveyard of unread rejections: “Thank you for your interest, but…” “At this time, we have decided…” “We’ll keep your résumé on file.”

He didn’t even remember what he'd applied for anymore. Coding gigs. Freelance writing. Pet-sitting. Anything.

He stood and padded barefoot across the cracked tile to the kitchenette. Half a loaf of bread. A jar of peanut butter that required serious commitment to scrape anything from. He made a sandwich with a dull butter knife and sat back down, chewing like it was a chore.

That’s when his phone buzzed.

Unknown number. He answered without thinking.

“Jordan Keller?”

“Yeah.”

“This is Lyle Roman. You don’t know me, but I knew your father.”

Jordan blinked. “My father died when I was ten.”

“I know. That’s why I’ve been looking for you.”

Jordan swallowed. “Who the hell are you?”

“I need to talk to you,” the voice said, clipped, urgent. “In person. Tomorrow, if you’re available.”

“I’m not,” Jordan said, almost out of reflex. “I mean—what is this about?”

A pause.

“Your father left something behind. Something people have killed for. And they might come looking for you next.”

The line went dead.

Jordan stared at the phone for a full thirty seconds, waiting for a punchline, another ring, something. When none came, he stood, phone in hand, and walked to the window.

Rain had slowed. Streetlights glared down like disapproving gods. A figure in a black coat stood across the street, unmoving, umbrella tilted just enough to obscure the face.

Jordan dropped the curtain.

The next morning, the coffee tasted like rust. He'd found a half-used tin at the back of the cupboard, next to a jar of something unlabelled and sticky. The streets below his apartment were steaming from the early heat. San Amaro did this—poured rain like regret and then burned the pavement dry like it wanted everyone to forget.

He didn’t forget.

The man on the phone—Lyle—had texted him an address: “10 a.m. Second floor. Ask for Rook.”

That was it.

Jordan had a strong sense this was the kind of message that ended with someone waking up in a tub of ice missing a kidney, but then again, he didn’t exactly have a lot of options.

The building was in the old district. Red brick, crumbling corners. A faded sign read “Peregrine & Sons—Antiques and Curios.” A bell tinkled as he stepped inside. The air smelled like dust and camphor.

A woman with half her hair shaved looked up from behind the counter. “You Jordan?”

He nodded.

“Upstairs. Door on the right.”

The stairs creaked. The hallway upstairs was lined with faded photographs: a man in uniform, a child with a kite, a family in front of a rusted train.

He knocked.

The door opened immediately. The man behind it looked like someone who had once been in shape and then spent a decade living off whiskey and regret. Eyes sharp. Shirt wrinkled. Lyle Roman.

“Come in,” he said. “Quickly.”

The room beyond was small, filled with shelves of books and dusty old relics—a globe with jagged lines scratched into it, a violin with no strings, a box filled with rusted keys.

Jordan sat.

“I’ll get to the point,” Lyle said. “Your father, Thomas Keller, wasn’t who you think he was. He worked with me. Not in finance like your mother told you. He was… let’s say, an independent historian. A retriever of things best left buried.”

Jordan almost laughed. “Are you telling me my dad was Indiana Jones?”

“Indiana Jones didn’t have half a dozen death warrants on his head,” Lyle said. “Listen. In 1997, your father stole something. Something powerful. He hid it. Then he died.”

“What kind of powerful?” Jordan asked.

“The kind people start wars over. The kind you don’t put in a museum.”

Lyle handed him a photograph. It showed a stone about the size of a grapefruit, dark, almost black, etched with spiraling runes that hurt to look at.

“That’s the Obsidian Dial,” Lyle said. “And we think your father left clues to its location. We think you’re the key.”

Jordan blinked. “I work at a grocery store when they call me in. I can’t pay my rent. I don’t have any... key.”

Lyle smiled, a tight, humorless thing. “You’ve got his blood. And that’s enough.”

By afternoon, Jordan was back in his apartment, staring at the photograph. The spiral pattern on the Dial made his stomach twist.

The first clue had been in a journal. Lyle had let him borrow it. His father’s handwriting—tight, aggressive—sprawled across the pages.

“Under the tower where the city forgets,” one note read. “Seek the mouth of silence.”

Beneath it, a sketched map. San Amaro's skyline, but drawn in reverse—mirrored.

Something buzzed in his mind. A memory.

A park he hadn’t been to in years. A crumbling old watchtower left over from the 1800s. People called it “the tower of forgetfulness” because no one knew why it was built, or by whom.

That night, Jordan walked there.

The tower loomed, rusted and skeletal. Vines strangled its base. The air was still.

He found the mouth.

An old iron grate half-buried in mud behind the tower. He lifted it.

Beneath was a tunnel.

And in the tunnel, footprints.

Fresh ones.

Jordan swallowed. “Guess I’m going in.”

And he did.

Not knowing the world was already watching.

Not knowing some of them wanted him dead.

Not knowing this was only the first chapter of the life his father died to keep hidden.

The tunnel swallowed light like a black mouth. Jordan’s phone flashlight flickered as he stepped down into the dark, the weak beam bouncing off walls of stone slick with condensation. The air grew colder, damp, heavy with the smell of rust and mildew. Each step down sounded too loud, like a challenge to the silence.

The tunnel was narrow, only wide enough for one person to walk comfortably. Roots clawed through the stone above like crooked fingers, reaching down as if curious. Jordan moved slowly, dragging his hand along the wall for balance. After about thirty feet, the tunnel widened into a chamber—circular, with walls lined in brickwork that looked older than the city itself. A rusted lantern hung from the ceiling, swinging ever so slightly, as if disturbed moments before he arrived.

Someone had been here.

There were footprints in the dirt, just as he’d seen from above. Two sets. One small, one much larger. He crouched and studied them. The smaller set veered toward the far wall where a series of ancient etchings had been carved into the stone. The larger prints circled the room, then disappeared toward a second tunnel, half-collapsed, with rubble scattered in front of it.

Jordan's heart thudded against his ribs. Every part of him screamed to turn back, to leave the mysterious messages and secret tunnels to people with less to lose. But that was the thing—he didn’t have anything left to lose. If this led to something real, something his father had died to protect, he couldn’t walk away now.

He approached the wall with the etchings. At first glance, they looked like gibberish. Swirls, circles, harsh jagged lines that intersected like broken compass needles. Then he noticed something: one of the symbols matched a drawing in his father's journal. The spiral. The same one that had been etched into the Obsidian Dial.

He pressed his fingers against it.

A grinding sound echoed through the chamber, loud and deep. The wall trembled. Dust rained down. Jordan stumbled back as a section of the brickwork receded and slid aside, revealing a hidden alcove about three feet deep. Inside was a wooden box wrapped in rotting cloth, bound with iron latches rusted shut.

He hesitated only a second before reaching in.

The box was heavier than it looked. As he lifted it out, the air in the room seemed to change—denser, colder. Like something ancient had stirred.

He didn’t open it.

Instead, he turned and retraced his steps, back through the tunnel, the box held tight against his chest. He emerged into the night, the rain just beginning again, soft and cold. The city hadn’t noticed his absence. The streetlamps still hummed. A taxi rolled by, indifferent.

Jordan got back to his apartment without incident, locked the door behind him, and placed the box on the kitchen table like it was a bomb. He sat across from it, breathing heavily, watching it like it might move on its own.

He didn’t know what he expected to find inside. Money, maybe. A map. Proof his father hadn’t gone mad in his final years. Something—anything—that made the last twenty-four hours make sense.

He fetched a screwdriver from the junk drawer and pried the latches open one at a time. The lid resisted. Then, with a reluctant groan, it opened.

Inside were several layers of oilcloth, brittle and yellowed. He peeled them back, revealing a notebook bound in dark leather and what looked like a small metal medallion shaped like a coin, but with the same impossible spiral pattern pressed into its surface.

He picked up the notebook. The leather was stiff, cold, and had initials burned into the corner—T.K. He opened it. The handwriting was dense, cramped, more symbols than words. Scrawled in the margins were phrases like “they know,” and “never show it to the wrong eyes,” and “the gate can’t be opened.”

Jordan leaned back, blinking at the strange fever-dream of it all. There were coordinates. Dates. Sketches of symbols, diagrams of machines he didn’t recognize. It was the ramblings of a genius—or a madman.

His father had written, “The Dial bends light. But not just light. Time. Memory. It feeds on attention.”

Jordan felt his stomach turn.

A knock rattled the door.

Not a gentle knock. A hammering, urgent sound.

He froze.

The knock came again. Then a voice. Male. “Jordan Keller, this is Detective Mara Quinlan, San Amaro PD. Open the door.”

Jordan's mouth went dry. He quickly shut the notebook, shoved it and the medallion back into the box, and covered it with a towel.

He opened the door, slowly.

The woman standing there did have a badge. Black slacks, leather coat. Shoulder holster. Early forties, maybe, with tired eyes and a jaw that looked like it had broken once and never healed right.

“Mr. Keller,” she said. “We need to talk.”

“About what?”

“There was a break-in at a historical preservation site near the old watchtower. Surveillance cameras caught someone entering a sealed area. That someone looks a lot like you.”

Jordan exhaled through his nose. “That place has been abandoned for years.”

“That may be. But the person who went in didn’t come out alone. He came out carrying something.”

He didn’t answer.

“Mind if I come in?” she asked, already stepping past him.

He followed her gaze as it swept the apartment. She took in the peeling wallpaper, the towers of unpaid bills, the towel on the kitchen table. She didn’t ask about it. Not yet.

“You live alone?” she asked.

“Yeah.”

“You work?”

“Temp stuff. Whatever I can get.”

“And why were you at the tower?”

He hesitated. “My dad used to take me there. I was thinking about him. Just walked by.”

Quinlan gave a little smirk that didn’t reach her eyes. “You’re telling me you broke into a city-sealed site because you were feeling nostalgic?”

Jordan didn’t reply.

She walked to the window, glanced out. Then her tone changed.

“Listen. I’m not here to arrest you. Not unless you give me a reason. But the thing is—someone else was at that site earlier this week. They didn’t leave a box. They left blood. A lot of it.”

Jordan felt the blood drain from his face.

She nodded slowly. “Whoever you’re mixed up with? They’re dangerous. Maybe not to you yet. But that changes fast.” She paused, then added, “If you find anything your father left behind… you need to turn it in. Not hide it. Not play games.”

He nodded, slowly, but he could tell she didn’t believe him.

After she left, he watched from the window until her car drove away.

Then he pulled the towel off the box, opened it again, and stared down at the spiral.

He’d just stepped into something deep and old and lethal. And somehow, he knew—whatever this Dial was, whatever secrets it held—people were already dying to find it.

And he wasn’t ready to be next.

Jordan didn't sleep that night. He sat with the box on his lap, the journal beside him, turning over page after page even as his vision blurred and his head pulsed from exhaustion. The symbols in the margins—circles within circles, teeth-like angles, constellations he didn’t recognize—seemed to move when he blinked, like they shifted while he wasn’t looking. One phrase recurred again and again, in different handwritings, sometimes scribbled in what looked like charcoal, sometimes ink: “Not all doors are meant to open. Some are meant to hold things in.”

The medallion sat between his hands, heavy and ice-cold. It pulsed faintly, not with light, but with something he couldn’t name. A hum beneath his skin. A memory he didn’t have.

At 5 a.m., unable to take the pressure behind his eyes anymore, he stumbled into the shower and stood beneath freezing water for fifteen minutes. By the time he got out, the sky was turning gray, and he made a decision. He wasn’t going to wait for someone to show up at his door with a gun or a badge or a half-truth. He was going to find out what his father had started.

The notebook had one legible entry that sounded less like code and more like instructions:

“North of the river, beneath the roots of the sleeping god. It begins there. Speak the name he carved and the passage opens.”

Jordan didn’t know what any of it meant. But “north of the river” he could work with. He tore that page out, folded it into his back pocket, slipped the medallion into a pouch on his keychain, and left the apartment. He took the long way to the river, watching for tails, his breath fogging in the early morning chill.

The river that cut San Amaro in half was brown and wide and usually smelled like algae and wet metal. But there were places upriver—places the city didn’t touch anymore. Nature had reclaimed those bends. Old walking trails, once manicured by the city council, now lay overgrown and forgotten, winding through tall grass and trees bent with age.

It took him two hours to reach the edge of the park reserve. Another hour to find the place that made his skin itch.

A grove of cedar trees loomed on a rise above the bank, dense and unusually quiet. No birds. No wind. Just a kind of pressure, like walking into a room and realizing someone else had just left. Jordan moved through the trees slowly, his footsteps muffled by fallen needles. At the center of the grove, surrounded by broken stones and roots twisted like veins, was a massive boulder, half-swallowed by the earth.

It looked like nothing special—just another relic of erosion. But as he circled it, he noticed strange markings carved deep into the stone face, nearly invisible under the moss: a spiraled symbol, half-obscured, identical to the one on the medallion.

He pulled the metal disk from his pocket, held it up to the symbol, then whispered, unsure of himself, “What name did he carve?”

Nothing happened. He stepped closer. The words from the journal floated up again: Speak the name he carved.

He knelt and cleared away more moss. Underneath, chiseled in angular script, was a name. Eironach.

He tried again. “Eironach.”

This time, the ground trembled.

The stone pulsed beneath his hand like it had a heartbeat. A long, jagged crack split across the center of the boulder. From it spilled not dust, but mist—cold and colorless. And behind the mist, a dark hole yawning down into the earth.

Jordan stared, breathing shallow.

He had a choice.

He could walk away. Pretend none of this had happened. Leave the box, the journal, the medallion behind and try to claw his life back one side gig at a time.

Or he could find out why his father had spent the last years of his life chasing something he shouldn’t have.

He stepped into the dark.

The air changed immediately, like he’d passed through a curtain. It smelled of ancient earth and something else—ozone, like the air after lightning. The passage narrowed, forced him to crouch. After several minutes, it opened into a vast underground chamber lit faintly by phosphorescent moss and the reflection of trickling water.

Stone pillars rose from floor to ceiling, inscribed with runes that pulsed faintly when he walked past. In the center of the room stood a pedestal, and on it, a stone basin filled with black liquid so still it looked solid.

He approached, drawn to it without knowing why.

As he neared the basin, his pocket grew hot. He pulled out the medallion. It throbbed with light—dim, but insistent. He held it over the liquid.

And the room changed.

The air thickened. The moss light flared. A voice echoed—not from the air, but from inside his skull.

“The Gate remembers. The Blood returns.”

Jordan staggered back. His breath came in gasps. He dropped the medallion. It clattered against the stone and skidded across the floor, coming to rest at the foot of a figure he hadn’t seen before.

The man was tall, rail-thin, dressed in an antiquated black coat with a high collar. His skin was paper-pale, his eyes an unnatural gray. He smiled, slow and cold.

“Thomas’s boy,” the figure said. “At last.”

Jordan’s voice failed him.

“You don’t know what you carry,” the man continued. “But you will. And when you do… you’ll wish you hadn’t.”

“Who are you?” Jordan managed.

“A shadow,” the man replied. “A whisper behind a locked door. But you may call me Krane.”

Krane stepped forward. Jordan backed away, fumbling for the medallion.

Krane didn’t chase. He merely tilted his head, as if amused by a child’s tantrum. “The Dial is not a toy. It is a fracture in the world. A truth carved into stone by those who walked before memory. And you are now part of it.”

“I didn’t ask to be,” Jordan spat.

“No,” Krane said. “But your father did.”

Then Krane raised a hand. The air screamed. Jordan flew backward into one of the pillars, the impact cracking something in his shoulder. Pain roared through him.

He scrambled to his feet, grabbed the medallion, and ran.

He didn’t look back.

He didn’t have to.

The scream of the air followed him all the way out of the earth.

It was nearly sunset when he emerged from the grove, scratched and bleeding and half-certain he was losing his mind. The city hadn’t changed. But Jordan had. The moment he crossed the threshold of that hidden place, something inside him had shifted. The medallion pulsed against his skin, and the symbols from the journal burned behind his eyes.

He went home.

Every instinct told him to hide, to sleep, to pretend he’d never seen that room or that pale man. But instincts didn’t matter anymore.

The Dial existed. It wasn’t a metaphor or a myth. And someone like Krane wanted it.

He pulled out his father’s notebook again.

The last page had been blank that morning.

Now it had writing on it.

Scrawled in the center, in fresh ink: “Three seek it. One holds the map. The blood is the key. Run or follow.”

Jordan stared at the page.

Somewhere, something laughed.

And he didn’t know whether it was coming from the hallway—

—or inside his own head.

Chapter Two: The Map Beneath the Skin

Jordan didn’t go outside for two days.

He kept the curtains drawn, the medallion hidden in a zippered jacket pocket, and the notebook locked inside an old cigar box wedged under the floorboard beneath his bed. Sleep came in fragments, twenty-minute snatches punctuated by jarring visions: a spiral that never ended, Krane’s eyes burning through him, the sound of stone grinding shut. Each time he woke, his throat was dry, his heart racing.

On the morning of the third day, a sharp knock at the door jolted him upright. He froze, listening. No second knock. He crept to the peephole and held his breath.

Empty hallway.

But on the floor in front of the door, a package.

No name. No label. Just a plain brown envelope the size of a record sleeve, sealed with red wax. A symbol stamped into the wax—concentric circles, like ripples radiating from a stone dropped in water.

He took it inside and laid it flat on the kitchen counter, staring at it like it might explode. His hands hovered, unsure, until curiosity won. He broke the seal, pulled out a thin sheet of parchment, and unfolded it.

A map.

Drawn by hand in black ink, with intricate lines and tiny glyphs that looked familiar—many mirrored symbols from his father’s notebook. San Amaro was there, stylized and distorted, the grid of streets bent like glass under pressure. The river twisted into a perfect spiral at the top right corner, and across the center, in faded red, was a jagged trail marked with a single word: “Cradle.”

He ran his fingers along the paper. The map was old. Not printed. Not copied. Hand-drawn, possibly decades ago. He flipped it over—another message scrawled in the same dark ink:

“One step leads to another. But beware the Spiral Choir.”

That last phrase chilled him.

He’d seen it before. Scrawled in the margins of a letter his father had written to someone named E.M.—a letter that hadn’t made sense at the time. He found the page in the journal again and reread it with fresh eyes:

“If they reach the Choir, it’s already over. The Dial doesn’t just show what was—it shows what might be. What must not.”

He sat back, the weight of the words pressing into his chest like a stone.

Someone had left this map for him. Someone who knew about the Dial, knew what his father had tried to bury. And they were trying to tell him where to go next.

The word “Cradle” looped in his head like a hook in a song. He pulled out his phone and searched for anything matching that name near San Amaro—parks, towns, ruins, even businesses.

Nothing obvious.

But one result caught his eye: an archived article from a local paper, dated 1986. It mentioned an archaeological dig halted after “unusual structural anomalies” were found beneath a collapsed mission site north of the city. The area was referred to by old Spanish records as El Nido. The Cradle.

Bingo.

Jordan traced the map’s route and cross-referenced it with a digital map. It aligned roughly with Route 27 northbound. That meant it would take him through the old oilfields—now mostly abandoned. The perfect place to hide something.

By nightfall, he had packed a backpack with the essentials: flashlight, knife, the medallion, and a copy of the notebook’s most critical pages. He left the original hidden, just in case. Then he stole his neighbor’s bicycle—one with flat tires and squeaky gears—and headed north.

The city faded behind him slowly, replaced by long stretches of cracked road, telephone poles with leaning silhouettes, and distant hills blackened by time and neglect. The further he rode, the quieter the world became. It was like stepping out of time.

At the outskirts of the dig site, the land sloped downward into a narrow valley. Trees ringed it like sentries. The remnants of old machinery rusted under tarps and debris. A fence circled the area with a gate that had long since fallen open.

He dropped the bike behind a shed and moved on foot, picking his way toward a squat concrete structure marked “ADMIN” in peeling white letters. Inside, everything was covered in dust. Clipboards, file boxes, a filing cabinet with drawers warped from water damage.

He rifled through them anyway.

In the bottom drawer he found a blueprint. It showed tunnels beneath the mission—catacombs, maybe. Storage, possibly. But one chamber was circled in red, with the word “sealed” and an annotation: "Do not disturb. Signs of instability and non-structural integrity."

Right.

Jordan folded the blueprint and headed outside, using it to orient himself. Half an hour later, he found the entrance—half-buried, sealed with a metal door chained shut. The lock had rusted through. He pried it loose with a rock.

Inside was darkness.

Not the kind you could wave away with a flashlight. This darkness ate light, muted it. The narrow tunnel stretched straight ahead, the walls dripping with moisture, lined with cobwebs that clung to his clothes and face. He pushed forward, heart thudding.

As he descended, a sound rose behind him—distant, echoing. Not footsteps.

Whispers.

Indistinct. Like a crowd murmuring through glass.

He stopped, pressed his back against the wall, held his breath.

The whispers faded.

He kept moving.

Eventually, he entered a chamber shaped like a dome, with carvings across the walls—more spirals, eyes, symbols that made his head ache. In the center was a raised platform, and atop it, a stone disk nearly identical to the Dial from the photograph.

Except this one was shattered.

Cracks split it into seven jagged pieces, like a broken puzzle. One piece was missing entirely.

He stepped closer.

Symbols on the stone shifted as he moved, sliding beneath the surface like fish beneath ice. He reached out, fingers grazing the cold surface.

The chamber pulsed.

Then something moved behind him.

He spun.

A figure stepped from the shadows—a woman, tall, wrapped in a dark leather coat and scarf, goggles perched on her forehead. She carried a staff tipped with a hooked blade and walked like someone used to danger.

“I was wondering when you’d show up,” she said.

“Who are you?” Jordan asked, heart pounding.

“Your father called me Ashra,” she said. “But I don’t think he ever knew my real name.”

Jordan took a step back. “Are you with Krane?”

Her expression soured. “If I was, you’d be bleeding already.”

She approached the platform and touched the broken Dial. “He found this place years ago. Before your father. But he couldn’t unlock it. The real Dial—the one that functions—is still out there. And Krane believes you’re the map to it.”

“I’m not,” Jordan said. “I’m just trying to survive.”

She glanced at him. “Survival’s the only real myth left. The rest of us are just choosing how we die.”

Jordan stared at her, confused.

Ashra turned and tossed him something—an old coin, scarred, stamped with a symbol he'd never seen before.

“Keep that close,” she said. “You’ll need it when the Choir comes.”

Jordan caught the coin, frowned. “What the hell is the Spiral Choir?”

Ashra didn’t smile. “They were the first to hear the Dial’s true sound. And they haven’t stopped screaming since.”

She moved past him and vanished into the tunnel.

Jordan stood alone in the silence, holding a coin that burned cold in his palm, beside a broken stone whispering truths he wasn’t ready to understand.

And above them, something in the earth began to wake.

The wind shifted as Jordan emerged from the ruins. It came low and cold through the valley, dragging leaves and dust with it, as if warning him to turn back. The air smelled metallic now, the sharp edge of ozone laced with something fouler—mildew and something older, like rot beneath stone. He paused at the top of the hill and looked down at the entrance to the sealed chamber, trying to decide whether what had happened was real. The coin in his hand argued it had been.

Ashra. The name lingered in his mind like smoke. He didn’t know what to make of her. She’d appeared out of nowhere, told him a handful of cryptic things, and disappeared just as quickly. There was no way she wasn’t watching him still, from somewhere in the trees or behind the rusted skeletons of the old dig. But even if she was, he had bigger concerns.

The Dial was broken.

That changed everything.

He’d come to the dig site thinking he’d find answers. Maybe even the object itself. Instead, he found a fractured relic and a stranger talking about death like it was already a certainty. Worse, he couldn’t shake what she’d said: that Krane believed he was the map. Not had it. Was it. He thought about the notebook’s last message—“Run or follow.”

Running felt increasingly useless.

He biked back to the city before dawn, his thighs burning, his head pounding with every bump in the road. The map was folded in his pocket. The coin rested beside the medallion, the two objects seemingly inert but, together, radiating a kind of pressure—psychological or not, he didn’t know. All he did know was that he was being watched.

The feeling never left. Even as he locked the apartment door behind him, pulled the shades, and tried to convince himself he was safe. He could feel someone just beyond his vision, studying him, waiting for him to move the wrong way.

At 2 a.m., the phone rang.

This time, it wasn’t an unknown number. The screen said Quinlan.

He hesitated, then answered.

“Jordan Keller.”

“Detective,” he replied, rubbing at his eyes.

“I need you to listen carefully. I’ve been pulled off your case.”

“What? Why?”

“I stepped on the wrong toes. You’ve got watchers now, Keller. Not police. Not local. And not friendly.”

“Are you saying someone’s coming after me?”

“I’m saying someone already has.”

Her voice was tight. Controlled, but strained.

“There’s something else,” she added. “The name Krane—he’s real. But he doesn’t officially exist. There are no records. No photographs. Nothing recent. But he’s been linked to six disappearances across two continents over the last fifteen years. All of them involved anomalous historical finds. One survivor said he spoke in riddles. Said he touched something and it screamed.”

Jordan swallowed. “Yeah. That sounds about right.”

She paused. “Whatever you’re involved in, it’s older than you think. And more dangerous. Stay low. And if anyone comes to you talking about the Choir—don’t listen. Just run.”

“I met someone else,” he said, unsure if he should even share it. “Ashra. She knew my father. Said the Dial’s real, and Krane’s after it.”

“She’s trouble,” Quinlan said, without missing a beat.

“You know her?”

“I’ve heard the name. There’s no record of her either. But word travels. Ashra’s been tracking Krane for a long time. She doesn’t work with anyone. If she helped you, even briefly, that’s rare. Which means she sees something in you. Or she needs something.”

The line clicked once. Then silence.

“Detective?” Jordan asked.

Nothing.

Then a sharp static hiss. A whisper, barely audible.

“The spiral is waking.”

He threw the phone across the room.

It hit the wall and broke in two.

The room fell silent again, but the echo of that voice followed him into the shower, into bed, and through the narrow, sweaty corridors of a dream that made no sense.

A voice with no mouth. A spiral that turned forever. A girl crying inside a mirror that wasn’t a mirror.

He woke tangled in sweat-soaked sheets and lay there for a long time, listening to the hum of the refrigerator, the whir of distant traffic, and the throb of his heart.

That morning, he knew where he had to go next.

The map hadn’t just shown the dig site. There were other marks—one deep in the old city, at the edge of the original settlement built long before San Amaro became a city at all. An area of condemned buildings now fenced off and forgotten, marked only by faded signs: “NO TRESPASSING — STRUCTURAL HAZARD”.

He dressed, strapped a small crowbar to his belt, and packed water, a flashlight, and both coins. The journal came too, now riding in a canvas messenger bag slung across his shoulder.

The old city ruins were a strange ghost. Blocks of crumbling buildings surrounded by plywood walls and sagging fences, barely watched by a single security camera that hadn’t worked in years. He found a gap in the fence, squeezed through, and emerged into what looked like the remains of a burnt-out plaza.

The buildings here weren’t just old—they were abandoned like a memory that hurt to remember. He passed shuttered storefronts with broken signs, windows like blind eyes, streets overgrown with weeds that clawed through the concrete like the earth was trying to take the place back.

According to the map, he was close.

He turned a corner and stopped.

There it was—a door. Wide, arched, made of bronze. It shouldn’t have been there. No building stood around it. No wall. Just a freestanding doorframe in the center of a cobbled courtyard, the bronze door set into it like it belonged.

No hinges. No handle. Just a keyhole shaped like a spiral.

He reached into his jacket and pulled out the medallion.

It fit the hole perfectly.

As he pressed it in, the air shimmered. The wind stopped. The world seemed to hold its breath.

The door opened inward.

Beyond it was not another ruined structure, but a staircase spiraling down into the earth. He stepped inside, and the door swung shut behind him with the quiet finality of a sealed tomb.

The stairs descended farther than they should have. At least four stories. The walls here were carved with frescoes older than anything he’d ever seen—scenes of stars, of men kneeling before a towering spiral, of cities being pulled apart by light.

And voices.

Not loud. Not even words.

But he could feel them.

Something deep in the bones of the place—memories that hadn’t died yet.

The chamber at the bottom was circular, wider than he expected, and completely dark until he stepped into it.

Then torches flared to life along the walls, one after another, revealing a circle of seven stone thrones—empty—and behind them, a mural that made his blood freeze.

It showed him.

Or someone who looked like him.

Standing in the center of the spiral, surrounded by broken pieces of the Dial. Blood on his hands.

A symbol carved into his chest.

Below it, the inscription: “He who hears the Dial shall become it.”

Jordan staggered backward.

The mural didn’t make sense.

Unless…

Unless the map wasn’t a location at all.

It was a person.

Him.

He turned to leave, but the spiral in the center of the chamber flared—bright white light, blinding—and a voice that was not sound whispered inside his skull again.

“The Choir sees. The Choir waits. The Choir sings.”

Then the light vanished.

And someone clapped slowly from the darkness beyond the torches.

Krane.

Not a hallucination. Not a projection.

Real.

More real than ever, his pale face sharp in the firelight.

“Well done,” Krane said, stepping forward. “Most people die before they get this far.”

Jordan raised the crowbar, even though he knew it would do nothing.

Krane tilted his head. “Still pretending you’re not part of it? You should’ve stayed in debt, Keller. Life’s easier when you don’t matter.”

“What is this place?”

Krane looked around with something close to reverence. “A listening chamber. One of the last. The Dial doesn’t just measure—it transmits. It’s an echo of the first sound. Before language. Before memory.”

He stepped closer.

“You were born marked, Jordan. Your father saw it. Tried to stop it. But it’s in you. You’re the map because the Dial remembers.”

“I’m not helping you,” Jordan said, gripping the crowbar tighter.

Krane smiled. “You already have.”

Then the chamber began to vibrate.

The torches dimmed.

The spiral on the floor began to turn.

And the Choir began to sing.

It wasn’t sound, not really. It was vibration. A hum in the blood. A scream between cells. It pulled at his mind, scraped behind his eyes, made his thoughts go thin and loose.

He fell to his knees.

Krane walked toward him, calm as gravity.

And in that moment, Jordan understood:

This wasn’t just about the Dial.

It was about him.

And the only way out—

was through.

Chapter Three: Through the Spiral

The spiral spun beneath Jordan like a vortex of light and memory, each slow revolution dragging something deeper out of him—names he didn’t know, places he’d never been, voices that sounded like his own screaming from elsewhere. He gritted his teeth, his nails digging into the stone floor, but the pull wasn’t physical. It was psychic, like the gravity of a dream you couldn't wake from.

Krane stood over him, still and calm, like a priest at the mouth of a storm.

“Fight it, if you must,” Krane said. “But you’re not fighting me. You’re resisting yourself.”

The spiral flared, and Jordan saw flashes—images flickering like a film reel burning too hot. A tower in a desert older than language. A woman standing atop black water, eyes full of stars. A mask of bone. Then his father, not as Jordan remembered him—frail and tired—but younger, angry, shouting words Jordan couldn’t hear, holding the medallion above his head like a weapon.

Jordan screamed. The images vanished.

The chamber steadied.

Krane crouched beside him. “You think I want the Dial to control it?” he asked softly. “I want it to finish what it started. This world’s already broken. The Dial can reset it. Refract it into something better. Something clean.”

Jordan gasped through gritted teeth, sweat rolling down his neck. “That’s not your call.”

Krane smiled, faint. “Isn’t it? Who do you think made the last call, Keller? You think history just happens? That time flows on its own?”

He reached out, placed a single pale finger on Jordan’s chest. “We shape it. You and I. Bloodlines like ours—descendants of those who heard the first tone.”

Jordan batted his hand away and forced himself to his feet. The humming had dulled, for now, as if the spiral had spent itself.

“You’re insane,” he spat.

Krane tilted his head. “You’ll see.”

Jordan didn’t wait to hear more. He turned and ran, stumbling through the tunnel, away from the singing, away from Krane. He climbed the spiral stairs two at a time, every breath searing his lungs. The door at the top wasn’t just closed—it was gone. In its place, bare concrete, smooth and unbroken.

Trapped.

He pounded his fists against it. “No—no, no, no—”

The wall didn’t budge. The torchlight behind him flickered again.

A voice echoed from below. Not Krane’s.

A woman’s.

Ashra.

“You’re not meant to stay here, Keller,” she called. “But you can’t leave empty-handed.”

He turned.

She stood halfway down the stairs, breathing hard, her face streaked with soot. “He tried to force it. The Choir doesn’t open to force.”

“What the hell are they?” Jordan demanded.

Ashra moved closer, eyes scanning him like she was trying to see what he’d brought back with him. “They’re not people. Not anymore. Not since the first time they heard the Dial. They exist in between. That’s why they sing. It’s all they can do to stay coherent.”

Jordan shook his head, dazed. “He said I was the map.”

Ashra’s gaze narrowed. “You are.”

She climbed past him and touched the blank wall. “But you’re also the door.”

She took something from her coat—a long iron key with a spiral worked into its teeth—and handed it to him.

“This won’t work for me. It’ll only respond to your blood.”

Jordan hesitated. Then took it.

The moment he held it, warmth flooded his arm. Not just warmth—recognition. Like something ancient nodding at him from the past. He pressed the key against the concrete.

No sound. No movement.

Then the wall cracked, split down the center, and swung open into moonlight.

Fresh air hit his face like water.

He turned to Ashra. “What now?”

She stepped into the opening, looking grim. “Now we find the last piece.”

Jordan blinked. “Of the Dial?”

Ashra didn’t answer right away. She stared up at the night sky, her voice low.

“Of you.”

They walked through the sleeping city in silence.

Ashra led the way, moving like someone who had memorized every alley and side street decades ago. She didn’t speak again until they reached the waterfront—old piers warped with time, rusted cranes frozen in place, the scent of salt and oil thick in the air.

“There’s something I didn’t tell you,” she said, stopping at the edge of a dock.

Jordan leaned on a piling, too exhausted to care. “Shocking.”

Ashra didn’t smile. “Your father didn’t just find the Dial. He used it.”

He turned sharply. “What?”

“Once. Maybe twice. We’re not sure. But it left marks. On him. On the world. He spent the rest of his life trying to bury it. But he couldn’t erase the resonance. That’s what you are. A living echo.”

Jordan sat down on the edge of the dock, feeling the rough wood beneath him. “That’s why Krane wants me.”

Ashra nodded. “He doesn’t need the Dial if he has someone who can be it.”

Jordan was silent a long time. The wind off the water tugged at his hair, brought goosebumps to his skin. Somewhere across the water, a foghorn moaned.

“So how do we stop him?” he asked finally.

Ashra crouched beside him. “We find the Choir’s cradle. That’s where it began. And where it must end.”

He frowned. “The place from the map?”

“No,” she said. “The real map.”

She reached into her coat and pulled out a thin sheet of obsidian, carved with almost imperceptible lines.

“This is what your father died protecting. It shows the Choir’s birthsite. The first place the Dial was ever heard.”

Jordan touched the stone, and the lines flared white-hot under his fingers. A memory unfurled—not his own—a desert at dusk, a circle of black stones, a voice from beneath the sand singing a single note for a thousand years.

He pulled back, breath caught in his throat. “Where is it?”

Ashra looked west. “Where no cities rise. No satellites pass. A place carved out of time.”

He nodded, slowly. “Let’s go.”

But before they could move, the sky above them split.

A hum rose across the water, and from the clouds descended figures—barely visible, cloaked in robes that shimmered like oil slicks. Their faces were hidden, but the sound that accompanied them—a sustained chord that bypassed hearing and rattled bone—left no doubt.

The Spiral Choir had found him.

Ashra grabbed his arm. “Run.”

They bolted down the dock, the air behind them vibrating, the wood planks warping with each step the Choir took. Lights flickered across the bay as boats began to sway violently, some tipping, others groaning against their moorings. One burst into flame without warning.

Jordan glanced back.

The Choir moved in slow, terrible rhythm, their steps syncing with the hum. The world twisted around them—angles bent, shadows moved against the light, and the night itself shivered.

Ashra pulled him into an alley. “They won’t follow far. Not without collapsing the space around them. They can’t hold form for long.”

“What do they want?” Jordan gasped.

“To merge,” she said, eyes bright with fear. “To become whole again. You’re the final chord.”

They stopped running when they reached an underground garage, long since abandoned. Ashra pushed aside a steel grate and led him down into darkness. Only when they were hidden by concrete and rusted machines did she let him collapse.

Jordan fell to his knees, gasping. “They’re inside me. I can feel them.”

Ashra nodded. “That’s the danger. They don’t have to take you. Just convince you.”

He leaned back against a pillar, his thoughts spiraling.

The Dial. The Choir. His father’s voice. The mural in the chamber.

He wasn’t just a key. He was the lock.

And somewhere ahead, Krane was waiting.

Not to destroy the world.

But to restart it.

Chapter Four: The Echo Vault

Jordan dreamt of sand and stars.

Not the soft golden sand of a postcard beach but cracked, desiccated earth that seemed to breathe underfoot. Above him, the sky wheeled in unnatural constellations—stars arranged in spirals and broken circles, blinking in and out like faulty lights. A tower rose in the distance, impossibly tall, built of black stone and bone, and from within it came the sound he could no longer call music: a hum, low and continuous, a throb of pressure that touched every cell in his body.

When he woke, he was still underground.

The stale air of the shelter clung to his skin, damp and cold. Pipes groaned above. The floor vibrated faintly, like the Choir’s presence still echoed through the streets above.

Ashra was sitting nearby, arms crossed, staring into space like she hadn’t slept. Her coat was draped over a rusted machine, the obsidian map resting on her knee.

Jordan pushed himself up, body aching. “How long was I out?”

She didn’t look at him. “Ten hours. Thought you might never wake up.”

“I saw the tower again,” he said. “Same one I saw in the spiral chamber.”

Ashra’s expression tightened. “It’s real.”

He rubbed his face. “Where is it?”

She placed the obsidian map between them. “In the Echo Vault. That’s what your father called it. It’s not on any map you know. Not because it’s hidden—because it’s folded.”

Jordan blinked. “Folded?”

“Reality bends around the Vault. Not naturally. Someone—or something—designed it that way. When your father accessed the Dial, the Vault stirred. Krane’s been trying to find it ever since.”

“And now he’s found me,” Jordan muttered.

Ashra nodded. “Which means the Vault’s doors will open soon. Because you’re carrying the resonance.”

Jordan leaned back against the concrete, his mind whirring. “My father didn’t tell anyone about this?”

“He told me,” she said quietly. “Not because he trusted me. Because he was afraid of dying without unburdening it. The Vault is the root, Keller. Everything else—the Dial, the Choir, Krane—they’re just branches.”

Jordan stood. “So how do we get there?”

Ashra traced her finger over the obsidian, which now shimmered faintly in the dark. “We follow the fracture lines. Places in the world where the laws don’t quite hold. Temporal glitches. Memory holes. There’s one north of here. An abandoned station. Used to be a Cold War listening post. Now it listens to other things.”

Jordan exhaled slowly. “Lead the way.”

The station was hidden in the hills—rusted metal bones of towers that had once bristled with antennas and sensors now stripped bare by weather and time. Ashra led them through a fence overgrown with ivy and wild briars. The wind keened through the skeletal structures like a warning.

Inside the largest building, desks and consoles lay in pieces, covered in mouse droppings and shattered glass. Paint peeled in long, curling strips from the walls. A map of the world, pinned and torn, fluttered in the draft that came from an unseen crack.

Ashra moved with purpose, finding a ladder behind a dislodged panel. “The core’s underground,” she said. “Still shielded. We’ll be safe inside—for a while.”

Jordan followed her down into darkness, clutching the cold iron rungs.

At the bottom, the corridor smelled of mold and electricity. They passed sealed rooms lined with cabinets of paper reels and magnetic tapes. Every sound echoed too loudly. Jordan kept glancing over his shoulder, half-expecting the Choir to coalesce behind them.

Finally, they reached a reinforced door labeled COMM ARRAY 3 – DO NOT ENTER. Ashra ignored the warning and keyed a rusted switch.

The door creaked open.

Inside was something unlike any other room in the compound.

No dust. No decay.

The space was warm, humming with a strange light that had no clear source. The walls were smooth metal, the color of old bronze, etched with hundreds of thin concentric circles—spirals, again—some so fine they shimmered like grooves in a record.

Jordan stepped inside, mouth dry. “What is this?”

Ashra placed the obsidian map into a groove on the floor. The walls pulsed in response, as though recognizing a long-lost frequency. The spirals began to turn.

“This is a Gate Engine,” she said. “Built to stabilize the fracture. Your father thought it was a prototype left by the ones who heard the Dial first. The map acts as a key. But it needs something else.”

She looked at him, solemn.

“It needs you.”

Jordan swallowed. “What do I have to do?”

Ashra stepped back. “Stand in the center. When the engine engages, it’ll tune to your signature. Your blood, your memories. That’s how we’ll locate the Vault.”

He walked slowly to the center of the room, the spirals gleaming underfoot like pressure plates. The humming grew louder. The air thickened.

Then pain.

It came suddenly, brutally—white-hot and total, like his skull was being peeled open. He screamed, staggered, tried to run—but the floor held him in place. Images crashed into his mind: cities reversed in time, rivers flowing upward, people speaking in languages that weren’t sounds but shapes.

He saw the Vault.

Dark and vast. Built into the bones of the earth. Surrounded by what looked like statues—stone figures standing in a ring, heads bowed, hands raised. But they weren’t statues.

They moved.

They sang.

And in the Vault’s center: the full Dial, whole, its spirals rotating like a celestial machine.

Jordan collapsed.

When he woke, Ashra was at his side. “You saw it,” she said, voice soft.

He nodded weakly. “Where?”

“Utah desert. Near where they tested atomic fire. Nobody goes there now. The Vault is sealed beneath the waste.”

Jordan sat up, wiped the blood from his nose. “What now?”

“We get there first,” Ashra said. “Before Krane. Before the Choir finds its song.”

Jordan stared at the humming walls. “And then what?”

Ashra hesitated. “We decide whether the Dial should ever sing again.”

Outside, the wind howled through the ruins of the station.

And far
