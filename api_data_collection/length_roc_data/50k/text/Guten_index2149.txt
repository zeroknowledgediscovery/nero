GORDON PYM  INTRODUCTORY NOTE        Upon my return to the United States a few months ago, after the       extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and       elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages,       accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in       Richmond, Va., who felt deep interest in all matters relating to       the regions I had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon       me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the public. I had several       reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of which were of a       nature altogether private, and concern no person but myself;       others not so much so. One consideration which deterred me was       that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time       in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write,       from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have       the _appearance_of that truth it would really possess, barring       only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us       are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence       in exciting the imaginative faculties. Another reason was, that       the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively       marvellous that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be       (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a       half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family,       and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put       faith in my veracity—the probability being that the public at       large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent       and ingenious fiction. A distrust in my own abilities as a writer       was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented me       from complying with the suggestions of my advisers.        Among those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest       interest in my statement, more particularly in regard to that       portion of it which related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe,       lately editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” a monthly       magazine, published by Mr. Thomas W. White, in the city of       Richmond. He strongly advised me, among others, to prepare at       once a full account of what I had seen and undergone, and trust       to the shrewdness and common-sense of the public—insisting, with       great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere       authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if       there were any, would give it all the better chance of being       received as truth.        Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to       do as he suggested. He afterward proposed (finding that I would       not stir in the matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in       his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my       adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the       “Southern Messenger” _under the garb of fiction. _To this,       perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating only that my       real name should be retained. Two numbers of the pretended       fiction appeared, consequently, in the “Messenger” for January       and February (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be       regarded as fiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the       articles in the table of contents of the magazine.        The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at       length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the       adventures in question; for I found that, in spite of the air of       fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of       my statement which appeared in the “Messenger” (without altering       or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all       disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to       Mr. P.’s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the       contrary. I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would       prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence       of their own authenticity, and that I had consequently little to       fear on the score of popular incredulity.        This _exposé_being made, it will be seen at once how much of what       follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be       understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages       which were written by Mr. Poe. Even to those readers who have not       seen the “Messenger,” it will be unnecessary to point out where       his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of       style will be readily perceived.  A. G. PYM.     CHAPTER 1         My name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader       in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal       grandfather was an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in       every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of       the Edgarton New Bank, as it was formerly called. By these and       other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money. He       was more attached to myself, I believe, than to any other person       in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his property       at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of       old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric       manners—he is well known to almost every person who has visited       New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I       left him for Mr. E. Ronald’s academy on the hill. Here I became       intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who       generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh—Mr.       Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many       relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. His son was named Augustus,       and he was nearly two years older than myself. He had been on a       whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and was       always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific       Ocean. I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day,       and sometimes all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would       be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories       of the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had       visited in his travels. At last I could not help being interested       in what he said, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go       to sea. I owned a sailboat called the Ariel, and worth about       seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or cuddy, and was       rigged sloop-fashion—I forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten       persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the habit       of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I       now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am       alive to-day.        I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a       longer and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party       at Mr. Barnard’s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little       intoxicated toward the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I       took part of his bed in preference to going home. He went to       sleep, as I thought, very quietly (it being near one when the       party broke up), and without saying a word on his favorite topic.       It might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in       bed, and I was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly       started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go       to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was so       glorious a breeze from the southwest. I never was so astonished       in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the       wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside       himself. He proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he       knew that I supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more       sober in his life. He was only tired, he added, of lying in bed       on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and       dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat. I can hardly tell       what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth       than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and       thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most       reasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost a gale, and       the weather was very cold—it being late in October. I sprang out       of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was       quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying       in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as       any Augustus Barnard in Nantucket.        We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to       the boat. She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the       lumber-yard of Pankey & Co., and almost thumping her side out       against the rough logs. Augustus got into her and bailed her, for       she was nearly half full of water. This being done, we hoisted       jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea.        The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The       night was very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I       stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew       along at a great rate—neither of us having said a word since       casting loose from the wharf. I now asked my companion what       course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable       we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said       crustily: “_I_ am going to sea—_you_ may go home if you think       proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in       spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated. I       could see him distinctly by the light of the moon—his face was       paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he       could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something       had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I       knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending       entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had       suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the       land—still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for       almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I could stand       it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety       of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he made       answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. “By-and-by,” said he       at length—“time enough—home by-and-by.” I had expected a similar       reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which       filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked       at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and       his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely       able to stand. “For God’s sake, Augustus,” I screamed, now       heartily frightened, “what ails you?—what is the matter?—what       _are_ you going to do?” “Matter!” he stammered, in the greatest       apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and       falling forward into the bottom of the boat—“matter—why, nothing       is the—matter—going home—d—d—don’t you see?” The whole truth now       flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised him up. He was       drunk—beastly drunk—he could no longer either stand, speak, or       see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the       extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the       bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that,       during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and       that his conduct in bed had been the result of a       highly-concentrated state of intoxication—a state which, like       madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward       demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The       coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect—the       mental energy began to yield before its influence—and the       confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous       situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now       thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would       be otherwise for many hours.        It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The       fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly       timid and irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of       managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide       were hurrying us to destruction. A storm was evidently gathering       behind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was       clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of       sight of land before daybreak. These thoughts, with a crowd of       others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a       bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond       the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going       through the water at a terrible rate—full before the wind—no reef       in either jib or mainsail—running her bows completely under the       foam. It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to—Augustus       having let go the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much       agitated to think of taking it myself. By good luck, however, she       kept steady, and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of       mind. Still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we       rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our       counter, and deluged us with water. I was so utterly benumbed,       too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. At       length I summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to       the mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been expected,       it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried       away the mast short off by the board. This latter accident alone       saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I now       boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally       over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate       death. I took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I       found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape.       Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as       there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly       a foot deep just where he fell), I contrived to raise him       partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a       rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of       the cuddy. Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could in       my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God,       and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the       fortitude in my power.        Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and       long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons,       seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat.       Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I       experienced at that moment. My hair stood erect on my head—I felt       the blood congealing in my veins—my heart ceased utterly to beat,       and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my       alarm, I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my       fallen companion.        I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large       whaling-ship (the Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons       were standing over me, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily       occupied in chafing my hands. Upon seeing me open my eyes, his       exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and       tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. The       mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. We had       been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled,       beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set,       and consequently running almost at right angles to our own       course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not       perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming       in contact—their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so       terribly alarmed me. The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately       over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have       passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible       impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from the deck of       the victim—there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling       with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was       swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her       destroyer—but this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be       remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless,       the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for       proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about       the matter. Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore       positively to having seen some person at our helm, and       represented the possibility of yet saving him. A discussion       ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it       was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells;       that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if       there was a man run down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he       might drown and be dammed” or some language to that effect.       Henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly       indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew, at a speech evincing       so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He spoke plainly, seeing       himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a       fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders       if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. He       strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)       on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm       voice, Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went       cleverly about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it       was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that       any individual could be saved—allowing any to have been on board       the boat. Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and myself       were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought       about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune       which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special       interference of Providence.        While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat       and jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke       up as having seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of       the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long       and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment,       starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. He       would say nothing else—repeating his cry impatiently, back water!       back water! The men put back as speedily as possible, but by this       time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway,       although all hands on board were making great exertions to take       in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung       to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another       huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of       water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety       was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be       affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining       bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and       beating violently against it with every movement of the hull.       After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the       ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally       disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board—for the       body proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the       timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the       copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship,       and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The       head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green       baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck,       forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right       ear. I was immediately put to bed—although life seemed to be       totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain,       however, treated me with every attention—to make amends, I       presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in       the previous portion of the adventure.        In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship,       although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not       been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our       boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that       he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring       of the tempest. This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in       their search for more than half an hour, although repeated       signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although       every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them       with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is nearly       impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could       have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built,       however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since       had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some       life-boats used on the coast of Wales.        After searching in vain for about the period of time just       mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. They had       scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark       object that floated rapidly by. They pursued and soon overtook       it. It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel’s cuddy.       Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies.       Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a       rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I       had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt,       for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so       doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving       his life. The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down       her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as       might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water       rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with       other fragments, no doubt) to the surface—Augustus was buoyed up       with it, and thus escaped a terrible death.        It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin       before he could give any account of himself, or be made to       comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our       boat. At length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of       his sensations while in the water. Upon his first attaining any       degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface,       whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a       rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. In an       instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his       head striking violently against a hard substance, he again       relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in       fuller possession of his reason—this was still, however, in the       greatest degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some       accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his       mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some       freedom. Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly       before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his       back. Of course, as long as he could have retained this position,       it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned.       Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this       post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help.       Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been       obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into       the sea, had given himself up for lost. During the whole period       of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the       Ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his       disaster. A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire       possession of his faculties. When he was finally picked up, every       power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was       nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he       became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself—I was       resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and       after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours       and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot       oil—a proceeding suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck,       although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real       consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects.        The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning,       after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off       Nantucket. Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr.       Barnard’s in time for breakfast—which, luckily, was somewhat       late, owing to the party over night. I suppose all at the table       were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded       appearance—of course, it would not have borne a very rigid       scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way       of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in       Nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story       told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at       sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference       either to the Ariel, my companion, or myself. We two have since       very frequently talked the matter over—but never without a       shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly confessed       to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so       excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat       he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt       himself sinking beneath its influence.     CHAPTER 2         In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce       inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data.       It might be supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just       related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for       the sea. On the contrary, I never experienced a more ardent       longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a       navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance.       This short period proved amply long enough to erase from my       memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the       pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of       the late perilous accident. My conversations with Augustus grew       daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. He had a       manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half       of which I now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well       adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament       and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. It is strange,       too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the       life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of       suffering and despair. For the bright side of the painting I had       a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of       death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged       out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an       ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires—for       they amounted to desires—are common, I have since been assured,       to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men—at the       time of which I speak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses       of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil.       Augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind. It is       probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a       partial interchange of character.        About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster,       the firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some       manner with the Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were       engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig Grampus for a       whaling voyage. She was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when       all was done to her that could be done. I hardly know why she was       chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same       owners—but so it was. Mr. Barnard was appointed to command her,       and Augustus was going with him. While the brig was getting       ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the       opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He       found me by no means an unwilling listener—yet the matter could       not be so easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition;       but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the       design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom I expected       much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if I should ever broach       the subject to him again. These difficulties, however, so far       from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame. I       determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my       intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it       might be accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any       of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself       ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had       abandoned the design. I have since frequently examined my conduct       on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of       surprise. The intense hypocrisy I made use of for the furtherance       of my project—an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my       life for so long a period of time—could only have been rendered       tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with       which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished       visions of travel.        In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged       to leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for       the greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to       some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At       night, however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over       our hopes. After nearly a month passed in this manner, without       our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told       me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary. I       had a relation living in New Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house       I was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at       a time. The brig was to sail about the middle of June (June,       1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to       sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from Mr. Ross,       asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert and       Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the inditing of       this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as supposed,       for New Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who       would contrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This       hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently       comfortable for a residence of many days, during which I was not       to make my appearance. When the brig had proceeded so far on her       course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, I       should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts       of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily       at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter       might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.        The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been       matured. The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday       morning I left the house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed.       I went, however, straight to Augustus, who was waiting for me at       the corner of a street. It had been our original plan that I       should keep out of the way until dark, and then slip on board the       brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favor, it was       agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the way to       the wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a       thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my       person might not be easily recognized. Just as we turned the       second corner, after passing Mr. Edmund’s well, who should       appear, standing right in front of me, and looking me full in the       face, but old Mr. Peterson, my grandfather. “Why, bless my soul,       Gordon,” said he, after a long pause, “why, why,—whose dirty       cloak is that you have on?” “Sir!” I replied, assuming, as well       as I could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended       surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable       tones—“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken—my name, in the first       place, bee’nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I’d want you for to       know better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty       one.” For my life I could hardly refrain from screaming with       laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received       this handsome rebuke. He started back two or three steps, turned       first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles,       then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella       uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his career, as if struck       with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled       off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and       muttering between his teeth: “Won’t do—new glasses—thought it was       Gordon—d—d good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”        After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and       arrived at our point of destination in safety. There were only       one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward,       doing something to the forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we       knew very well, was engaged at Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would       remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to       apprehend on his account. Augustus went first up the vessel’s       side, and in a short while I followed him, without being noticed       by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin, and       found no person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable       style—a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were       four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths.       There was also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably       thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin       and staterooms. The ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in       short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature       than I had anticipated. Augustus, however, would allow me but       little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my       concealing myself as soon as possible. He led the way into his       own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and       next to the bulkheads. Upon entering, he closed the door and       bolted it. I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than       the one in which I now found myself. It was about ten feet long,       and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide and       convenient. In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads       there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a       chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books       of voyages and travels. There were many other little comforts in       the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of safe or       refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of       delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.        He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the       carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know       that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had       been neatly cut out and again adjusted. As he pressed, this       portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of       his finger beneath. In this manner he raised the mouth of the       trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I       found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a small taper       by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark       lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me       follow. I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by       means of a nail driven into the under side—the carpet, of course,       resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and       all traces of the aperture being concealed.        The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest       difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of       lumber among which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my       eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less       trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. He brought       me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable       narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes       for packing fine earthenware. It was nearly four feet high, and       full six long, but very narrow. Two large empty oil-casks lay on       the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw       matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. In every       other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up       to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of       ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates,       hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less       than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the       box. I afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the       stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough       concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man       not going out in the brig.        My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could       be removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the       interior, at which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one       of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it       contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be       crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time,       sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting       position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were       some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full       of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna       sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a       dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately       to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings       of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever       experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now pointed out       to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then,       holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark       whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my       hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the       lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold,       immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. By       means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way       out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident       should render such a step necessary. He now took his departure,       leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of       tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often       as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on       the seventeenth of June.        I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in       my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice       for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between       two crates just opposite the opening. During the whole period I       saw nothing of Augustus; but this occasioned me little       uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected to put to sea every       hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of       coming down to me. At length I heard the trap open and shut, and       presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and       if there was any thing I wanted. “Nothing,” I replied; “I am as       comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be       under weigh in less than half an hour,” he answered. “I came to       let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I       shall not have a chance of coming down again for some       time—perhaps for three or four days more. All is going on right       aboveboard. After I go up and close the trap, do you creep along       by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. You will find my       watch there—it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to       keep time by. I suppose you can’t tell how long you have been       buried—only three days—this is the twentieth. I would bring the       watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he       went up.        In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in       motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly       commenced a voyage. Satisfied with this idea, I determined to       make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events       until I should be permitted to exchange the box for the more       roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the       cabin. My first care was to get the watch. Leaving the taper       burning, I groped along in the dark, following the cord through       windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered that, after       toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or two       of a former position. At length I reached the nail, and securing       the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. I now       looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided,       and selected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of       the Columbia. With this I amused myself for some time, when,       growing sleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and       soon fell into a sound slumber.        Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time       elapsed before I could bring to recollection all the various       circumstances of my situation. By degrees, however, I remembered       all. Striking a light, I looked at the watch; but it was run       down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how       long I slept. My limbs were greatly cramped, and I was forced to       relieve them by standing between the crates. Presently feeling an       almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the cold mutton,       some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and found       excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a       state of absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me       great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I       experienced upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have       slept for an inordinately long period of time. The close       atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this,       and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results.       My head ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath       with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude       of gloomy feelings. Still I could not venture to make any       disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound       up the watch, contented myself as well as possible.        Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no       person came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus       of the grossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that       the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was       suffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna       sausages after the loss of my mutton. I became very uneasy, and       could no longer take any interest in my books. I was overpowered,       too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of       indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence,       like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold.       In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in       the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears       as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was       blowing. I could not imagine a reason for the absence of       Augustus. We were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to       allow of my going up. Some accident might have happened to       him—but I could think of none which would account for his       suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his       having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea I       could not dwell with any degree of patience. It was possible that       we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near       vicinity of Nantucket. This notion, however, I was forced to       abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently       gone about; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual       inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along       with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter. Besides, granting       that we were still in the neighborhood of the island, why should       not Augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance?       Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and       cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another twenty-four       hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way to       the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend,       or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a       further supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with       this thought, however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the       contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My       dreams were of the most terrific description. Every species of       calamity and horror befell me. Among other miseries I was       smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most       ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me in their       embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully       shining eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn       and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me.       Immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in       endless succession as far as the eye could reach. Their roots       were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay       intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. And the       strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and waving to       and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for
