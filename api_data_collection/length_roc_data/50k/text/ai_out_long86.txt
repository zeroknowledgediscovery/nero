Chapter One: The Empty Driveway

It was 4:32 in the morning when Jonathan Markham stepped out onto the dewed front porch, keys in hand, suitcase in the other. The fog still hung low over the lawn, curling around the tires of his old Ford Explorer like it wanted him to stay. He didn’t. Not anymore. The air felt heavier than it should’ve, a strange mixture of betrayal and finality that stuck to the roof of his mouth like bitter coffee grounds.

He didn’t slam the door behind him. That would’ve been theatrical. And he hated theatrics. Instead, he shut it with a soft pull, the way you’d close a book you’d rather forget ever reading. Inside, his wife—soon to be ex-wife—still slept, tangled in bedsheets that once held meaning. But now? Now they were just cotton and deception.

Her name was Rachel. Sixteen years, one dog, no kids. Not by choice. That fact had carved a canyon between them over the past decade. A canyon that she’d apparently tried to fill with someone else.

He’d found the emails two weeks ago. Not even hidden. A thread called “Wednesday Thoughts,” from a guy named Nick. Something about the title had been innocuous, laughable even. But the contents—they burned.

    “I miss your voice in the morning. You make the world make sense.”

    “Does he still sleep on the right side?”

    “I think I love you. I know I shouldn’t, but I do.”

Jonathan didn’t scream. Didn’t throw a lamp or start an argument. He didn’t even cry. He just read them, every last message, all the way back to their origin: July 13th. Their anniversary.

He booked the motel that same night.

Now, two weeks later, he was leaving. Not for the motel—he’d only lasted there a night. No, he was heading west. There was a town in Utah—Pine Wells. Population just under a thousand. He didn’t know anyone there. And that was the point.

As he turned onto the empty street, headlights off, something inside cracked. Not broke. Just... shifted. The kind of crack you don’t hear but feel. Like ice underfoot just before it gives.

Chapter Two: Pine Wells

The first thing he noticed about Pine Wells was that it didn’t smell like anywhere he’d ever lived. Not salt, not smog, not freshly cut lawns or burning garbage. It smelled like distance. The kind of distance you can’t measure in miles.

Main Street was half pavement, half dust. An old man in a Broncos hat waved to him outside a shop called Maureen’s. A faded sign underneath read “books + pie.” He nodded back, unsure if it was politeness or protocol.

He found a rental cabin just past the edge of town, nestled among juniper and pinion pine. It had a wraparound porch and a screen door that snapped like a whip every time you opened it. The landlord, a hunched woman named Evie, didn’t ask questions. Just handed him the keys and said, “You break it, you pay for it. You bleed on it, clean it up.”

Three days in, Jonathan started walking to Maureen’s every morning. The coffee was awful, the pie acceptable, but the quiet—that was golden. Maureen herself was dead, but her granddaughter Elise ran the place now. Thirty-something, loud laugh, hair like wildfire. She called him “Suitcase,” and never once asked what he was running from.

“People don’t come to Pine Wells unless they’re hiding,” she said once, sliding him a cinnamon apple slice with a smirk. “Town’s like a magnet for regrets.”

He didn’t deny it.

Chapter Three: Elise

Elise was magnetic in a way that didn’t demand attention but drew it anyway. She wore denim like armor and had a habit of talking with her hands. She’d been born in Pine Wells, left for college in Portland, then came back when her mom got sick. Never left again.

“You ever been thrown out of a moving car?” she asked him one afternoon while restocking a shelf of secondhand mysteries. “That’s how I found out about Chris Murphy’s temper.”

He blinked. “You’re not serious.”

“Oh, I’m dead serious. Wasn’t moving fast. Just enough to make it dramatic.”

They laughed. It felt like the first real laugh he’d had in months. Maybe longer.

He didn’t tell her about Rachel. Not then. Not yet. But there was something in Elise’s eyes—like she already knew. Or maybe she just didn’t need to know the specifics. Maybe the ache of betrayal had a universal shape.

Chapter Four: Rachel’s Call

It came at night. His phone lit up with her name: Rachel M. He let it ring. Five times. Voicemail. Then again, two minutes later.

He answered.

“Jon,” her voice cracked. “Where are you?”

“Alive.”

“That’s not—” she exhaled, shaky and shallow. “You just left.”

“No. You left,” he said, cold as glass. “I just took longer to walk away.”

Silence.

“I made a mistake.”

He closed his eyes. He could still picture her, hair messy, sitting in their kitchen at 2am eating cereal. The realness of that image made him flinch.

“So did I,” he said. “I married you.”

“Please,” she whispered. “Come back. We can fix this.”

“I’m already somewhere else.”

He ended the call.

Chapter Five: The Horse in the Yard

On the morning of his eighth week in Pine Wells, he woke to a horse standing in his front yard.

It wasn’t tied. Just there. Brown, with a white blaze down its face. Watching him like it expected something.

“Elise,” he muttered.

She showed up twenty minutes later, laughing so hard she was nearly crying.

“That’s Bandit,” she explained. “He gets out sometimes. Likes new people. Sorry about the, uh, early visit.”

Bandit snorted like he was offended.

Jonathan scratched the horse’s neck. “Not the worst guest I’ve had.”

“He’s partial to apples.”

They stood there, silent except for the rustle of dry wind, the creak of pine.

“You gonna stay?” she asked suddenly.

“Here?”

She nodded.

“I don’t know.”

“You should. You look less dead than when you got here.”

He smiled.

Chapter Six: Letters Never Sent

He began writing again. Not books—he hadn’t done that in years—but letters. None mailed. Just stacks of yellow legal pads tucked under the floorboard.

One to Rachel. One to Nick. Several to the version of himself that used to believe marriage was permanent and people didn’t lie.

He wrote one to Elise, too. Then burned it.

The words were weight. And weight had to go somewhere.

Chapter Seven: The Barn Fire

It happened during the county fair. A sudden blaze at the north edge of town. Someone said lightning. Someone else whispered arson. Jonathan didn’t care about the why—only the flicker of danger, the pull of chaos.

He helped haul water buckets until his arms ached. Elise found him afterward, soot in her hair.

“You could’ve let it burn,” she said.

“Didn’t want it to win.”

They kissed. It wasn’t romantic. It wasn’t even right. But it was real.

Chapter Eight: Letters Finally Sent

On a Tuesday, Jonathan mailed three letters.

One to Rachel.

    I don’t hate you. But I don’t trust you. And that’s enough.

One to himself.

    You survived.

And one to Elise.

    If you ask, I’ll stay.

He walked back to the cabin, Bandit waiting by the porch.

He waited.

She came.

Jonathan reached the edge of the neighborhood just as the sun began to pull itself over the horizon. A syrupy band of orange spread low across the distant mountains, and for a moment he thought about stopping to take a picture. But what for? There was no one left to send it to, and he didn’t want the memory preserved. Beauty didn’t mean much when you were running from the person who shared your bed for sixteen years but had secretly shared her soul with someone else.

The Explorer rattled as it rolled past the familiar intersections. Willow Lane. Hayes Drive. Somerset Circle. Each street sign a reminder of barbecues, awkward neighbors, PTA meetings, and the slow decay of intimacy disguised as routine. He passed the little school where they used to imagine dropping off a child they never had, a child who remained theoretical through fertility treatments and disappointment and then, silence. That silence had stretched longer than either of them acknowledged, until eventually, it became a wall. She scaled it first, apparently. He just stood on his side, pretending it wasn’t there.

His foot pressed a little harder on the gas pedal. Somewhere past the edge of the city, between dirt and sky, was a place where no one knew his name. Not “Jon and Rachel,” not “Mr. Markham,” not “the guy who used to coach Little League before he stopped returning calls.” Just him. Just a man with crow’s feet and a duffel bag full of wrinkled clothes and a bank account sliced neatly down the middle by impending divorce.

The miles peeled by. Concrete gave way to gravel, and gravel surrendered to long, lean stretches of highway bordered by rusted barbed wire and yellowing grass. His phone buzzed once. Then again. He didn’t look. Didn’t need to. It was either Rachel or their lawyer. Both voices he didn’t want to hear, not yet, maybe not ever. Instead, he clicked on an old playlist he hadn’t touched in years. Music from when they were happy. Or at least good at pretending.

Tom Petty crooned about free fallin’. Jonathan barked a dry laugh and turned the volume down.

He stopped for gas at a roadside station where the lights flickered even in daylight. A teenage girl behind the counter didn’t even look up from her phone as he paid cash. The bathroom key was attached to a hubcap. Inside, the mirror was cracked, but it didn’t hide his reflection enough to matter. He looked older than he remembered. Not just in the sag of his eyes or the deepening lines on his forehead, but in something quieter—like the dimming of a pilot light.

Back in the car, he sat for a minute, engine idling, hand resting lightly on the gearshift. He wondered what Rachel was doing at that moment. Maybe crying. Maybe already back in bed. Maybe curled up next to Nick. The thought sent a white-hot spike through his ribs, not quite pain but something meaner, something tangled up in ego and history.

He shook it off. Turned the car back onto the road.

Three hours later, he passed a sign that read “Welcome to Colorado.” A line he hadn’t crossed since he was twenty-five and still full of ideas about how life would turn out. Rachel had been in the passenger seat that time, humming along to whatever was on the radio, her feet up on the dash, scribbling in that leather-bound journal she never let him read. He used to think it was poetry. Now, he wasn’t so sure.

There was a rest stop a few miles ahead, nestled against a ridge. He pulled in, parked at the far end, and stepped out. The air was thinner, cleaner, like someone had washed the world in bleach and mountain wind. He climbed the little overlook trail, boots crunching on gravel, lungs protesting the incline. At the top, the land stretched out before him like a faded painting—gray hills, pale skies, the promise of something new just out of reach.

He sat on a bench someone had carved initials into—D+M 1997—and let the silence soak into his skin. He tried to think about nothing. Not Rachel. Not Nick. Not the echo of a life that had become more habit than love. Just the breeze. Just the way the horizon curved like a question he didn’t yet know how to answer.

It wasn’t peace. But it was close enough.

He stayed there for an hour, maybe two. Long enough for the shadows to shift and his coffee to cool in the thermos. He scrolled through his contacts, thumb hovering over a name he didn’t want to see. Then he hit delete. Not just her. All of them. Everyone tied to that old life. Coworkers. Neighbors. Even his sister, who’d stopped calling three Thanksgivings ago after Rachel had snapped at her over politics.

He deleted them all.

He didn’t feel lighter afterward. Just clean.

Back in the driver’s seat, he mapped a route to Pine Wells. It wasn’t the shortest path west, not by a long shot. But it was out of the way, tucked into a crease between nowhere and forgotten. That felt right. The cabin rental was still available. He’d seen it on a website during one of his motel nights. Wood panels, a porch, no Wi-Fi. The thought of no connection used to terrify him. Now it felt like freedom.

The next leg of the journey was quieter. No more music. Just the sound of the tires eating road and the occasional chirp of his turn signal. He passed towns with names like Whisper Creek and Dove Junction. All of them had churches, a gas station, and at least one shop that sold homemade fudge. America had a formula. He just never realized how sad it could feel when you weren’t part of it anymore.

He reached Pine Wells just after sunset. It was smaller than he expected, more dirt than pavement, more old trucks than sedans. The kind of town where people measured time in crop cycles and gossip. A place where someone like Rachel would suffocate in less than a week.

That thought gave him comfort.

He found the cabin at the end of a gravel road framed by crooked trees and scattered elk signs. It smelled like woodsmoke and rain. The door creaked, the lock stuck slightly, and there were cobwebs in the corners of every window. But it was his, for now. No one had left him a note, a list of chores, or a schedule. Just a key under the mat and a receipt in his email.

He dropped the suitcase near the door and sat down on the edge of the unmade bed. There was a moment of stillness, right before the tears came, when he could feel everything stretch. Like a rubber band pulled to its limits. Then it snapped.

He cried. Not in loud sobs or dramatic gasps. Just quietly. The kind of cry that happens when something final sinks in and there's nothing left to say.

Afterward, he wiped his face on the sleeve of his jacket and stood up. He unpacked his bag. Folded clothes he hadn’t bothered to fold before. Put his toothbrush in a ceramic cup on the bathroom sink. Opened the fridge to find it empty, except for a jug of spring water someone had left behind. It was like the place had been waiting for someone to start over.

That night, he stood on the porch with a blanket around his shoulders and looked up at the stars. They were so bright it hurt his eyes.

For the first time in years, he didn’t feel married. He didn’t feel like a husband. He didn’t feel like anything, really.

But maybe that was the beginning.

Chapter Two: The Stranger's Welcome

The next morning arrived with a pale, watery sunlight seeping through the blinds, casting dusty lines across the cabin’s hardwood floor. Jonathan woke up to the chirp of unseen birds and the creak of trees shifting in the breeze. For a few seconds, he didn’t remember where he was. Then the quiet struck him like a slap—no hum of an air purifier, no dog scratching at the bedroom door, no low murmur of Rachel’s early-morning news radio. Just stillness. And that stillness held its own strange kind of noise.

He made instant coffee, the kind that came in individual packets like powdered regret. It tasted like cardboard, but it did the job. He sat on the back steps and watched the world breathe. The pines swayed like old men stretching. Somewhere in the distance, a truck engine coughed to life, followed by the faint whine of tires over gravel. It was a town already up and moving, even if it had nowhere urgent to go.

Around ten, he decided to explore. He hadn’t brought much—just jeans, two pairs of boots, a couple of jackets, and an old flannel that smelled faintly of cedar. The drive into the center of Pine Wells took less than ten minutes. No stoplights, just a couple of faded stop signs and a curious cat lounging on the white line in the road like it owned the place. Most of the buildings were old, with paint peeling in layers that told a story of sun and wind more than neglect. There were businesses, but not many—enough to suggest survival, not prosperity.

The sign above the cafe read “Maureen’s: Books + Pie”, a combination Jonathan found too strange to ignore. He parked out front and stepped inside, greeted instantly by the scent of cinnamon, paper, and warm sugar. A small bell jingled above the door, and a woman behind the counter looked up from a battered copy of Slaughterhouse-Five.

She was around thirty, maybe a little older, with dark red hair pulled back in a messy bun and freckles scattered across her cheeks like someone had splattered her with rust-colored paint. Her eyes were sharp, the color of wet bark, and they didn’t blink when they landed on him.

“Let me guess,” she said. “Not from around here.”

Jonathan offered a half-smile. “That obvious?”

“You’re wearing a jacket that cost more than my car and looking at the pie case like it’s written in Sanskrit. So yeah.”

He glanced down at himself, suddenly aware of how out of place he looked. “I’ll take whatever you recommend. Coffee too.”

She grabbed a plate from behind the counter and sliced into a pie with practiced grace. “Cinnamon peach. Only thing Maureen taught me to bake before she died.”

“I’m sorry,” he said automatically.

“Don’t be. She was ninety-two and meaner than a hornet with hemorrhoids. But she made a damn fine crust.”

The woman slid the plate toward him and poured the coffee. She didn’t ask for his name. Didn’t give hers either. Just went back to her book and left him to his breakfast. The pie was surprisingly good—flaky, not too sweet, with a bite of tartness that stuck to the back of his tongue. The coffee was garbage, but it was hot and plentiful.

He ate slowly, watching the people drift in and out. Everyone seemed to know each other. Names were exchanged, stories updated in shorthand, small laughter breaking out like little thunderclaps of familiarity. Nobody looked twice at him—just a stranger with sad eyes and a city car.

After a while, the redhead returned with a dishcloth in one hand. “You renting the Coen cabin?”

Jonathan nodded. “For a while.”

“Evie still got the porch full of wind chimes?”

“Yeah. Sounds like a wind orchestra.”

“She thinks it keeps away evil spirits.” The woman smirked. “Personally, I think she just likes noise.”

He leaned back in his chair. “Doesn’t seem like a town with a lot of spirits. Evil or otherwise.”

“You’d be surprised,” she said. “This place eats secrets for breakfast.”

He wasn’t sure what to make of that. “What’s your name?”

“Elise.” She wiped down the counter without looking at him. “And you’re Suitcase.”

He frowned. “Excuse me?”

“That’s what I’m calling you. You look like a guy who walked out with a suitcase and didn’t look back.”

He couldn’t help it—he laughed. It felt foreign, like shaking off a shell he didn’t realize he was wearing. “Fair enough.”

She flashed him a grin that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Don’t worry. No one here cares what you’re running from, long as you don’t bring the trouble with you.”

By his fourth day in Pine Wells, Jonathan had learned the names of three dogs, five locals, and zero rules. That seemed to be the way things operated—everyone knew everything, but no one asked questions. Not the kind that mattered. There was a rhythm to the town, and it moved slow, like syrup over cold pancakes.

He started each morning with a walk along the creek that ran behind the cabin, a little trail lined with dry grass and the occasional beer can. At night, he’d light a fire in the stove and read whatever book he’d grabbed from Maureen’s. Elise had given him a stack of paperbacks with a shrug. “These ones don’t suck,” she said.

He wasn’t sure if she meant the books or the characters inside them.

Some evenings, he returned to the cafe just before closing. Elise never rushed him out. Sometimes she joined him, leaning on the counter, telling stories about the town—how the water tower once froze over in ‘92, how a guy named Rufus tried to start a goat yoga business last summer, how her uncle had been sheriff until he fell in love with a blackjack dealer in Reno and left without saying goodbye.

“You’re good at telling stories,” he said once.

“I come from a long line of bullshitters,” she replied with a wink. “It’s practically a birthright.”

But beneath the humor, there was a flicker of something else. She never talked about her father. Skipped over any mention of a partner. Didn’t wear a ring, but that didn’t mean anything. Jonathan found himself cataloging these absences like puzzle pieces.

One night, as they watched the last embers of sunset drain from the windows, Elise finally asked, “You ever gonna tell me what brought you here?”

He didn’t answer right away. Just took a sip of his coffee and stared out at the street, quiet and amber under the hanging bulbs. A breeze kicked up, swaying the old banners still left from last year’s Founders Day.

“Do you ever miss the version of yourself that believed things would work out?” he asked softly.

Elise didn’t flinch. “Every goddamn day.”

He nodded. That was enough. They didn’t speak again for a long time, but something shifted between them that night. Not friendship exactly. Not yet. But the beginnings of something that lived in the space between shared silence and quiet understanding.

By the end of his second week, people began to recognize him. Not by name. Still just “Suitcase” to most. But they smiled, nodded. A man at the hardware store called him “buddy.” Someone at the feed shop asked if he needed help finding chicken wire. He said no, but thanked them anyway.

One afternoon, as he loaded groceries into the back of his SUV, an old man approached, slow and deliberate. He wore a faded baseball cap and had a voice like gravel dragged across pavement.

“You’re the one in Evie’s place.”

“That’s me.”

The old man nodded like he’d solved a mystery. “You planning to stay?”

Jonathan shrugged. “Don’t know yet.”

“Well,” the man said, “this town’s got a way of finding out who you really are, whether you like it or not.”

Jonathan watched him walk away, wondering if it was a warning or a welcome.

Maybe both.

Jonathan began to learn the soft edges of Pine Wells in the same way someone learns a song they didn’t mean to memorize. The town revealed itself slowly, in fragments—a glance from across a diner booth, the smell of burning mesquite drifting through alleyways, the way everyone waved from their cars even if they didn’t know your name. Especially if they didn’t know your name.

The days unfolded in soft, muted colors. Morning walks turned into routines. He discovered a little gas station that made breakfast burritos in tinfoil wrappers, the kind you had to hold with both hands because they’d fall apart otherwise. He found a trail on the south ridge that offered a view of the whole valley, and he’d sit there with a thermos of tea, watching clouds shift across the wide, empty sky. Sometimes Elise would join him, but most of the time she didn’t. She had a business to run, pies to bake, books to shelve, and a community that leaned on her like a porch rail about to give out.

One Saturday, she showed up at his cabin unannounced, arms full of rhubarb and flour, hair tied up in a scarf that looked like it had once been a curtain. “You’re going to learn how to make a proper pie crust,” she said without even waiting for an invitation inside. “You look like a man who thinks food happens by magic.”

He blinked at her from the doorway. “I’m not exactly the domestic type.”

“Don’t care.” She brushed past him. “You’ve got a rolling pin, right?”

He didn’t, but she’d brought one. Along with a metal mixing bowl, two wooden spoons, and the kind of enthusiasm that couldn’t be argued with. An hour later, his kitchen looked like a bag of flour had exploded and then been trampled by a herd of over-caffeinated goats. But the pie was in the oven, the dishes were stacked in the sink, and he hadn’t thought about Rachel in nearly forty minutes. That alone felt like a small miracle.

“Why are you really here?” she asked as she perched on the edge of the counter, licking sugar off her thumb.

He considered pretending not to understand the question, but Elise didn’t ask things lightly. She didn’t fill silence with noise just to keep it from echoing.

“My wife cheated on me,” he said eventually. “I found out, packed a bag, and left.”

Elise didn’t look surprised. “How long were you married?”

“Sixteen years. Met her in college. Married a year after graduation.”

“And you just... walked out?”

He stirred the last of the tea leaves into his cup. “Not just. It took me a long time. Too long. I should’ve left before she found someone else.”

Elise didn’t say anything for a moment. Then, “That’s the part people don’t talk about. How long you stay after the cracks show. You keep thinking the glue will hold.”

He glanced at her. “Did you?”

“Me?” She laughed without joy. “I didn’t even see the cracks until I fell through them.”

That night, after she’d gone, he found himself sitting on the porch with the leftover pie, watching moths flit toward the porch light. Her words lingered in his head like the taste of burnt sugar—bitter and hard to forget.

Pine Wells began to breathe him in like he was something familiar. Not one of them, not yet, but not completely outside the boundaries either. The locals had started to include him in the town’s unofficial network of traded favors and unspoken rules. The mechanic, Denny, offered to check his brakes for free. Ruth from the general store slipped him a jar of pickled green beans “on account of him needing something with snap.” Even Old Lyle, who apparently hadn’t spoken more than ten words to anyone in years, gave him a gruff nod after watching him help a stranded tourist push their car out of a ditch.

Jonathan didn’t resist it. He didn’t have the energy to fight what felt like belonging, even if it was shallow and fleeting. He began writing again—not anything serious, just scribbled paragraphs in a leather notebook Elise had given him. Observations. Fragments of dialogue. Half-formed characters that looked suspiciously like people in town.

On paper, he was starting to become someone else. Someone who maybe wasn’t broken.

He was at Maureen’s one afternoon, sorting through a box of donated books, when a man stepped through the door and brought a gust of old memory with him. Tall, gray-haired, with a limp that added a half-beat to his walk, he scanned the cafe like a detective in a film noir.

“Is Elise around?” he asked the teenager behind the counter.

“She’s in the back,” the kid said. “You want me to get her?”

The man shook his head. “Tell her Cal stopped by.”

Jonathan turned back to his pile, pretending not to listen. But Elise came out from the kitchen a moment later anyway, wiping her hands on a dishtowel.

“Cal,” she said, her voice unreadable.

“Elise.”

They stood there for a long second, two statues shaped by shared history.

“You look good,” he said.

“You don’t.”

He chuckled. “Fair.”

Cal glanced at Jonathan then. “This one of your projects?”

Elise narrowed her eyes. “No. He’s a friend.”

The man gave Jonathan a nod, the kind that felt more like an evaluation than a greeting. “You a writer?”

“Used to be.”

Cal studied him a moment longer. “Used to be’s got a certain ring to it.”

Then he turned and left, the bell over the door jingling behind him like the end of a sentence.

Later, Jonathan found Elise restocking the napkin holders with a furrowed brow.

“Who was that?” he asked.

“My father,” she said.

He didn’t push. Didn’t need to.

The first snowfall came early. Light and silent, it blanketed Pine Wells in a hush that made everything feel momentarily holy. Jonathan woke up to find the world softened and silvered. The trees behind the cabin bowed under the weight of fresh powder, and animal tracks crisscrossed the porch like hieroglyphs.

He walked into town bundled in layers he hadn’t worn since Vermont, his breath clouding in front of him. Everyone seemed to walk slower in the snow, their boots crunching through the fresh drifts like they were afraid to disturb it too quickly. Kids had built a crooked snowman outside the post office, its mouth made of jelly beans and a can of root beer balanced on its head like a crown.

At Maureen’s, Elise was already serving cider instead of coffee, claiming it was “more appropriate to the season and less offensive to taste buds.” Jonathan took a mug and settled into his usual corner. The heat from the space heater was patchy, but the quiet inside was warm enough.

He watched the snow gather against the window. “It’s beautiful.”

Elise sat across from him with her own mug. “It won’t last. It never does.”

He nodded, not in disagreement but in understanding. “Maybe it doesn’t need to.”

For the first time since arriving, he realized he didn’t know how long he planned to stay. At first, it was just an escape. A place to hide. But now? Pine Wells was something else. Not a solution, maybe, but a pause. A place that held him without asking for more than he could give.

Outside, the snow continued to fall. Inside, Elise reached over and stole the last bite of his scone without asking.

He let her.

Chapter Three: Fires to Tend

The cold deepened as December pressed in with quiet persistence. Each morning, Jonathan woke to a frost that etched delicate patterns across the windows of the cabin like the hands of some meticulous ghost. The world outside turned to white and gray, the trees skeletal, the creek behind the cabin frozen into a serpentine ribbon of cracked glass. Inside, he layered sweaters over flannels, built fires with thick logs Evie had stacked under the lean-to, and grew familiar with the sounds of his own solitude.

He had not spoken to Rachel since that night she called, her voice thin with desperation. The call had come from a place of panic, not love. That much he could see clearly now. Maybe she'd thought he would orbit her forever, tethered by guilt or nostalgia or some loyalty to the idea of permanence. But whatever bound them had snapped, and every day that passed in Pine Wells stretched the distance between them a little further until it felt like another life altogether.

Elise remained his closest thread to the town, the one fixed point in a constellation he was still learning to read. She stopped by the cabin more often now, bringing things—soup in mismatched thermoses, puzzles missing a few pieces, a jar of mulled cider that she swore could kill a cold in a single gulp. They talked more too. Real talk. Not just banter or surface-level familiarity, but slow, meandering conversations about regret, family, the odd decisions that slowly construct a life.

“You know what I hate about winter?” she asked one evening, wrapped in a thick plaid blanket on his porch swing.

“What?”

“It hides things. You look around and everything seems still, peaceful. But underneath all that snow, the rot’s still there. The dead leaves, the cracked roots. It just looks cleaner for a while.”

Jonathan blew into his tea, the steam curling up and vanishing. “So it’s dishonest.”

“No, not dishonest. Just quiet. Winter doesn’t lie. It just makes you do the lying for it.”

He thought about that for a while. He’d told himself for years that he and Rachel were okay, that what they had was simply what long-term love looked like—routine, comfort, partnership. He’d lied with a smile, with Sunday pancakes and anniversary cards. But winter had come early in their marriage, and instead of acknowledging the rot, he’d built around it.

That night, after Elise left, he pulled one of the legal pads from beneath the floorboard and began to write a letter to himself. Not about Rachel. Not about Pine Wells. Just about who he’d become when he wasn’t looking.

    You stopped noticing the sky, it began.
    You blamed her, but it was you. You turned the lights off first.

He didn’t finish it, just folded the page and tucked it into the back of the notebook. It was enough to say it, even if no one ever read it.

A few days before Christmas, Elise invited him to the town bonfire. “It’s tradition,” she said. “And you can’t hide out in your pine-scented man cave forever.”

He agreed, partly out of curiosity, partly because the thought of a small-town Christmas celebration seemed surreal enough to break through the crust of his solitude.

The bonfire was held in the field behind the high school, where the track met the edge of a grove of bare cottonwoods. By the time he arrived, the townspeople had already gathered, bundled in layers, passing thermoses and laughter. The fire itself roared, a towering pillar of orange and gold that cracked and hissed as logs gave way to flame.

Children chased each other around the edge of the firelight, their faces lit like flickering candle wicks. An elderly man played fiddle from a folding chair, the tune old and sweet and a little out of tune. It was the kind of moment that would’ve made Jonathan scoff a year ago, something too sentimental for his cynical tastes. But now, it felt like balm.

Elise stood near the fire, her cheeks flushed from the cold, her scarf unraveling slightly at the ends. She waved him over without ceremony and handed him a paper cup filled with something spiced and strong.

“You look startled,” she said.

“It’s... warm,” he replied, not sure what he meant.

She chuckled. “You expected torches and pitchforks?”

“No, I just... forgot this kind of thing existed. People being people.”

Elise glanced toward the fire, her expression softening. “Yeah, it’s easy to forget. Especially when life has been gutting you for a while.”

He didn’t reply, just watched the sparks lift into the sky like fireflies trying to find their way home.

Later, as the crowd thinned and the fire burned lower, he and Elise walked back toward her truck. The snow had begun to fall again, gentle flakes drifting like ash.

“Did you ever think about leaving?” he asked her.

“I did leave,” she replied. “For college. Thought I’d stay gone. But then Maureen got sick, and the town felt smaller than I remembered. I figured I owed it something.”

Jonathan nodded. “Do you regret it?”

“Sometimes. But then I remember who I was before I came back, and I think maybe I was worse off then.”

They stood at her truck for a minute, neither moving. The wind had a bite now, but neither seemed to notice.

“Elise,” he began, then stopped.

“What?”

He searched her face for something—permission, maybe. A sign. But all he saw was the same defiant softness he’d come to rely on.

“Nothing,” he said. “Thanks for tonight.”

She leaned in and kissed his cheek. Not romantic, not exactly. More like a tether, a way to say You’re still here. I see you. Then she climbed into the truck and was gone, her taillights vanishing into the snowfall.

Christmas day was quiet. No phone calls. No presents. He made himself scrambled eggs and toast, read a dog-eared copy of The Crossing, and let the fire die out sometime after noon. The silence didn’t ache like he expected. It was just space.

He walked into town around dusk. Maureen’s was closed, but he noticed a flicker of light inside. Curiosity tugged at him, and he knocked lightly. Elise opened the door wearing mismatched socks and holding a tray of cooling cranberry bars.

“I knew you’d show up,” she said, stepping aside.

“I didn’t want to spend the whole day alone.”

She raised an eyebrow. “You do realize I have, like, ten cats at my house?”

“That explains the sweater,” he replied, motioning to the knitted monstrosity emblazoned with an orange tabby tangled in tinsel.

“Touch this sweater again and I’ll stab you with a candy cane,” she said, handing him a bar.

They sat on the floor in the back, eating in silence, surrounded by boxes of unsorted books and the fading glow of string lights. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the windows gently.

“Do you think people always start over alone?” he asked.

“I don’t know,” she said. “But I think the ones who start over and stay started usually do it alone first.”

He considered that. “I don’t know who I’m trying to be yet.”

“Good. That means you’re not rushing it.”

They didn’t talk much after that. The wind carried on its quiet moan, and Elise leaned her head on his shoulder. They sat there for a long time, two people in the middle of nowhere, each holding something broken and not quite ready to let it go.

The days after Christmas passed like melting wax, slow and quiet and inevitable. The holiday decorations in Pine Wells lingered longer than they should have, faded ribbons fluttering from porch railings, wreaths turned brown at the edges, plastic Santas leaning sideways in front yards like they'd had too much to drink. The town didn’t move fast, and it didn’t let go fast either. Jonathan found himself sinking into that rhythm, not because he wanted to forget but because it was easier to remember things slowly.

He started chopping his own wood. Not out of necessity—Evie still delivered bundles when she felt like it—but because the act grounded him. There was something ancient and honest in the swing of the axe, the crack of log against stump. It required no thinking, no memory. Just the repetition of effort. It made his muscles ache in a way that felt good, like something was being rebuilt, even if he didn’t know what.

He saw Elise almost daily now. She would stop by with leftovers, or books she swore he had to read, or just to sit on the porch and listen to the wind. They never defined what was happening between them. There was no kiss, no official shift, just a slow layering of comfort. A shared silence. A laugh that came easier. Sometimes they argued about music, or books, or whether or not you could trust someone who ate black licorice voluntarily. Sometimes they didn’t talk at all.

One morning, in early January, he woke to find tire tracks in the snow leading up to the edge of the cabin. No knock. No note. Just the tracks and the faint scent of cigarette smoke on the porch. He stood staring at them for longer than he wanted to admit, something twitching under his ribs.

Rachel didn’t smoke. But Nick did.

Jonathan knelt by the tire marks, ran his fingers across the compressed snow. It was fresh—less than a few hours old. He hadn’t heard the engine, hadn’t heard anything at all. Which meant someone had parked quietly. Watched. Then left.

He went back inside and locked the door.

He didn’t tell Elise. Not right away. He told himself it was because there was no proof, no real danger. Maybe it was someone lost, someone looking for a shortcut. But Pine Wells didn’t have shortcuts. It had dead ends and switchbacks and roads that curled back into themselves like secrets. If someone came all the way to the edge of his cabin, they were looking for him.

That night, he slept with the fire poker beside the bed.

The next day, he took the Explorer into town and parked behind Maureen’s. The cafe was busier than usual, a few tourists in ski gear sipping cider and taking pictures of the mismatched chairs. He found Elise behind the counter, sleeves rolled up, hair escaping her braid in curls of defiance.

“You look like you’ve seen something,” she said as he approached.

“Maybe I have.”

She studied him for a beat. “Want to tell me about it?”

“Not yet.”

“Then come help me stack chairs in the back.”

They worked in companionable silence for a while, shifting furniture, restocking sugar packets, sweeping crumbs into a dustpan. It wasn’t until she handed him a box of expired cocoa mix and said, “Throw this out unless you want to be violently ill,” that he finally said, “I think someone came to the cabin last night.”

She straightened. “What do you mean?”

“Tire tracks. Cigarette smell. No knock. No headlights.”

“Did you recognize the tracks?”

“No. But I’ve got a feeling.”

Elise walked to the door and locked it even though the place was still open. She turned back to him, all sharp angles and quiet tension. “Do you think it was her?”

“Not her. Him.”

Her mouth flattened into a line. “The other guy.”

He nodded.

“Jesus,” she whispered. Then louder: “Okay. So what do you want to do?”

“I don’t know. Could be nothing. Could just be me seeing ghosts.”

Elise walked over and touched his arm. Not tender, not romantic—just a grounding touch. “Even if it is ghosts, they’re still yours. We deal with them either way.”

Later that week, a package arrived at the general store addressed to Jonathan Markham, c/o Evie Coen. No return address. It was wrapped in brown paper and tied with a length of twine, neat and almost formal. Jonathan turned it over in his hands several times before opening it. Inside was a photo—an old one, maybe eight or ten years back. It was him and Rachel, sitting at a restaurant table somewhere coastal, probably Oregon. They both looked younger, happier. His hand rested on hers.

Written across the bottom in red ink was a single line:

    "You forget where you came from too easily."

There was no signature.

He burned the photo in the fire that night. Watched it curl and blacken and vanish into orange. Elise was there, sitting in the corner with a blanket over her knees. She didn’t ask questions. She just handed him a cup of tea and said, “Looks like you need to punch something. We should chop wood tomorrow.”

The strange tension continued through January. Jonathan started noticing little things: unfamiliar footprints on the trail, a jacket sleeve glimpsed through the trees, the lingering sense of being watched. Nothing overt. Nothing enough to call the sheriff about. But enough to keep him glancing over his shoulder more often than he liked.

Elise, meanwhile, seemed to shift in ways that had nothing to do with Nick or Rachel. She grew more guarded, more distracted. Some nights she closed the café early. Once he found her crying in the stockroom, her back against a stack of milk crates, her face hidden in her hands. She waved him off when he tried to speak, saying only, “I’m just tired. Don’t make it something else.”

But it was something else.

Eventually, she told him.

“My mother’s been sick for a while,” she said. “I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to—God, I don’t know. I didn’t want you to look at me like another problem.”

“You’re not a problem,” he said.

“She’s in a care home in Casper. I visit every other week. I don’t tell people here because they’ll make casseroles and pretend it’s support.”

Jonathan reached for her hand across the counter. “You’re allowed to be cared for, Elise.”

She looked at him then, really looked. “So are you.”

The first week of February brought a break in the snow, and with it, the tracks returned. This time, he caught the car in the act—a black sedan parked just beyond the ridge trail, engine running. By the time he made it outside, it was gone. But he saw the plates. Colorado tags. Denver County.

That night, he called Rachel.

“I need to know if he’s looking for me,” he said without preamble.

She didn’t say hello. Didn’t ask how he was.

“He’s angry,” she said after a pause. “He thought I was going to leave you for him. When I didn’t, he... took it personally.”

“You tell him where I was?”

“Of course not.”

“Rachel.”

“I didn’t. I swear.”

The line was silent for a long time.

“I never meant to hurt you,” she said finally.

Jonathan felt something loosen inside him. Not forgiveness. Not yet. But exhaustion.

“I know,” he said. “But you did anyway.”

Then he hung up.

That weekend, Elise and Jonathan drove to Casper together. They didn’t plan it. She showed up at the cabin, eyes red, jacket zipped too high.

“I can’t do it alone this time.”

He didn’t hesitate.

The drive was long, gray highways stretching under a pale sky. They didn’t speak much. She played music—low, mournful folk songs that sounded like confessionals—and he stared out at the passing landscape.

Her mother was thin, small in a way that made Jonathan think of crumpled letters. She didn’t speak much, just smiled vaguely, as if recognizing Elise in pieces. Jonathan kept to the background, letting Elise take the lead. He didn’t know what to say, so he said nothing, but stayed close.

On the way back, she reached for his hand. He didn’t let go.

By the end of February, the snow had begun to recede. Pine Wells looked muddy, patches of ice clinging to shaded corners, the trees still brittle and bare. But there was a softness returning to the air. Something almost like spring.

Jonathan stood on the ridge trail one morning and looked down at the town—at the crooked rooftops, the sleepy stores, the ribbon of road leading out and away.

He could still leave.

But for the first time, he wasn’t sure he wanted to.

Chapter Four: Unearthing

March arrived with thawing earth and the first trembling hints of green pushing through the frostbitten soil. It came quietly, with the smell of damp pine and the creak of roofs shedding their snow. The cabin groaned differently now in the early morning, less brittle, more like something waking after a long sleep. Jonathan rose each day with the sun and brewed coffee that had stopped tasting bitter. His hands were rougher, his beard a little fuller, and his eyes no longer carried that constant red-edged weariness.

The tension that had hung over Pine Wells during the winter began to dissolve, but not all of it. Nick hadn’t returned—at least not that Jonathan could tell—but that didn’t mean the sense of being watched had vanished. It had simply quieted, like something sinking beneath the surface of a frozen lake.

He didn’t bring it up with Elise again. She had enough to carry. Her mother had taken a downturn, her memory patchier now, time slipping like sand between her fingers. Elise drove to Casper twice a week, returning more tired each time. Yet she still opened the café every morning, still argued with teenagers about the right way to shelve books, still teased Jonathan when he said things like “urban infrastructure” or “emotional clarity.” The woman carried grief like it was just another layer under her denim jacket.

One evening, she stopped by the cabin with two cups of something iced and vaguely citrusy. She didn’t speak at first, just curled her legs under her on the porch swing and handed him the drink.

“She called me by her sister’s name today,” Elise said after a while. “She asked where Maureen was. I told her she passed years ago, and she cried like it was the first time hearing it.”

Jonathan didn’t respond right away. He’d learned that most moments didn’t need fixing. They just needed room.

“I don’t know how to lose her twice,” she said. “Once to the disease, once to time.”

“You’re not losing her,” he said gently. “You’re walking her home.”

That broke something. She cried without theatrics—quietly, stubbornly, wiping at her face like it was offensive to let the sadness show. He reached out, not to hold her but just to be near, and she leaned into his shoulder. They sat like that for a long time, until the drink in her cup had melted into water and the stars came out to fill the silence.

In town, the gossip about Jonathan had shifted from curiosity to familiarity. He was no longer “that man in the Coen place.” He was just “Jon,” the guy who helped re-shingle the library annex, who carried bags for old Mrs. Hill at the general store, who sometimes stood too long by the window at Maureen’s like he was waiting for a ghost that never came.

He took small jobs, unofficial things. Chopping wood. Repairing fences. Helping Denny change out the heating coils at the post office. The money didn’t matter; it was the rhythm he needed. The work. The conversations. People didn’t ask about his past anymore. They saw who he was becoming and decided that was enough.

He and Elise began spending more time together away from the café. Hikes through still-dormant woods, drives into nowhere with no music playing, dinners at the cabin where they cooked together and didn’t always get it right. She made him laugh. He made her rest. And somewhere in the quiet between those moments, something unspoken began to build. Not fast. Not loud. But solid. A foundation laid without fanfare.

Still, Jonathan found himself haunted—not by Rachel, not anymore, but by the version of himself that had stayed too long, that had lost his voice in someone else’s story. He wrote often now, late at night by the fire. Not fiction. Not letters. Just observations. Feelings he didn’t have names for. Guilt and grief and gratitude, all tangled together.

He never reread them.

Then, in mid-March, the quiet broke.

It began with a phone call.

Elise answered at the café, her voice soft and tired. But her face changed as she listened. She stood perfectly still, then said, “I’ll be there by tomorrow,” and hung up without another word.

That evening, she appeared at Jonathan’s door with a suitcase and a trembling in her jaw.

“I need to go to Casper,” she said. “And I don’t want to do it alone.”

He didn’t hesitate. Packed his own bag while she sat in silence at the kitchen table. They drove through the night, headlights carving through fog and sleet, the air tense with everything unsaid. At the hospital, they found her mother still alive, but barely. The nurses called it “terminal rest,” a final calm before the last breath.

Elise sat beside the bed for hours, whispering stories. Childhood memories. Nonsense poems. Things she needed her mother to hear, even if no one could say for certain whether she still could. Jonathan stayed in the hall. He didn’t belong in that room—not yet, not really—but he was there. That was enough.

When her mother passed just after dawn, Elise didn’t cry right away. She just sat still, her hand still resting on the blanket. Then she turned to Jonathan and said, “I feel like the floor’s gone.”

“You’re still standing,” he said, and he held her until the sun came up.

The funeral was small. Pine Wells did what small towns did—casseroles and awkward hugs, stories told over weak coffee and the smell of lilies. Elise didn’t speak during the service, but Jonathan did. Not because he was close to her mother, but because Elise had asked him to. She didn’t say why, and he didn’t ask.

He kept it simple. Spoke about memory, and the shape people leave behind, and how grief isn’t something you overcome—it’s something you carry, like a ph
