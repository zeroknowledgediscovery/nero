The dates of their writing are far apart, their       origins are various. None of them are connected directly with personal       experiences. In all of them the facts are inherently true, by which I mean       that they are not only possible but that they have actually happened. For       instance, the last story in the volume, the one I call Pathetic, whose       first title is Il Conde (misspelt by-the-by) is an almost verbatim       transcript of the tale told me by a very charming old gentleman whom I met       in Italy. I don&rsquo;t mean to say it is only that. Anybody can see that it is       something more than a verbatim report, but where he left off and where I       began must be left to the acute discrimination of the reader who may be       interested in the problem. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that the problem is worth       the trouble. What I am certain of, however, is that it is not to be       solved, for I am not at all clear about it myself by this time. All I can       say is that the personality of the narrator was extremely suggestive quite       apart from the story he was telling me. I heard a few years ago that he       had died far away from his beloved Naples where that &ldquo;abominable       adventure&rdquo; did really happen to him.     </p>     <p>       Thus the genealogy of Il Conde is simple. It is not the case with the       other stories. Various strains contributed to their composition, and the       nature of many of those I have forgotten, not having the habit of making       notes either before or after the fact. I mean the fact of writing a story.       What I remember best about Gaspar Ruiz is that it was written, or at any       rate begun, within a month of finishing Nostromo; but apart from the       locality, and that a pretty wide one (all the South American Continent),       the novel and the story have nothing in common, neither mood, nor       intention and, certainly, not the style. The manner for the most part is       that of General Santierra, and that old warrior, I note with satisfaction,       is very true to himself all through. Looking now dispassionately at the       various ways in which this story could have been presented I can&rsquo;t       honestly think the General superfluous. It is he, an old man talking of       the days of his youth, who characterizes the whole narrative and gives it       an air of actuality which I doubt whether I could have achieved without       his help. In the mere writing his existence of course was of no help at       all, because the whole thing had to be carefully kept within the frame of       his simple mind. But all this is but a laborious searching of memories. My       present feeling is that the story could not have been told otherwise. The       hint for Gaspar Ruiz the man I found in a book by Captain Basil Hall,       R.N., who was for some time, between the years 1824 and 1828, senior       officer of a small British Squadron on the West Coast of South America.       His book published in the thirties obtained a certain celebrity and I       suppose is to be found still in some libraries. The curious who may be       mistrusting my imagination are referred to that printed document, Vol. II,       I forget the page, but it is somewhere not far from the end. Another       document connected with this story is a letter of a biting and ironic kind       from a friend then in Burma, passing certain strictures upon &ldquo;the       gentleman with the gun on his back&rdquo; which I do not intend to make       accessible to the public. Yet the gun episode did really happen, or at       least I am bound to believe it because I remember it, described in an       extremely matter-of-fact tone, in some book I read in my boyhood; and I am       not going to discard the beliefs of my boyhood for anybody on earth.     </p>     <p>       The Brute, which is the only sea-story in the volume, is, like Il Conde,       associated with a direct narrative and based on a suggestion gathered on       warm human lips. I will not disclose the real name of the criminal ship       but the first I heard of her homicidal habits was from the late Captain       Blake, commanding a London ship in which I served in 1884 as Second       Officer. Captain Blake was, of all my commanders, the one I remember with       the greatest affection. I have sketched in his personality, without       however mentioning his name, in the first paper of The Mirror of the Sea.       In his young days he had had a personal experience of the brute and it is       perhaps for that reason that I have put the story into the mouth of a       young man and made of it what the reader will see. The existence of the       brute was a fact. The end of the brute as related in the story is also a       fact, well-known at the time though it really happened to another ship, of       great beauty of form and of blameless character, which certainly deserved       a better fate. I have unscrupulously adapted it to the needs of my story       thinking that I had there something in the nature of poetical justice. I       hope that little villainy will not cast a shadow upon the general honesty       of my proceedings as a writer of tales.     </p>     <p>       Of The Informer and An Anarchist I will say next to nothing. The pedigree       of these tales is hopelessly complicated and not worth disentangling at       this distance of time. I found them and here they are. The discriminating       reader will guess that I have found them within my mind; but how they or       their elements came in there I have forgotten for the most part; and for       the rest I really don&rsquo;t see why I should give myself away more than I have       done already.     </p>     <p>       It remains for me only now to mention The Duel, the longest story in the       book. That story attained the dignity of publication all by itself in a       small illustrated volume, under the title, &ldquo;The Point of Honour.&rdquo; That was       many years ago. It has been since reinstated in its proper place, which is       the place it occupies in this volume, in all the subsequent editions of my       work. Its pedigree is extremely simple. It springs from a ten-line       paragraph in a small provincial paper published in the South of France.       That paragraph, occasioned by a duel with a fatal ending between two       well-known Parisian personalities, referred for some reason or other to       the &ldquo;well-known fact&rdquo; of two officers in Napoleon&rsquo;s Grand Army having       fought a series of duels in the midst of great wars and on some futile       pretext. The pretext was never disclosed. I had therefore to invent it;       and I think that, given the character of the two officers which I had to       invent, too, I have made it sufficiently convincing by the mere force of       its absurdity. The truth is that in my mind the story is nothing but a       serious and even earnest attempt at a bit of historical fiction. I had       heard in my boyhood a good deal of the great Napoleonic legend. I had a       genuine feeling that I would find myself at home in it, and The Duel is       the result of that feeling, or, if the reader prefers, of that       presumption. Personally I have no qualms of conscience about this piece of       work. The story might have been better told of course. All one&rsquo;s work       might have been better done; but this is the sort of reflection a worker       must put aside courageously if he doesn&rsquo;t mean every one of his       conceptions to remain for ever a private vision, an evanescent reverie.       How many of those visions have I seen vanish in my time! This one,       however, has remained, a testimony, if you like, to my courage or a proof       of my rashness. What I care to remember best is the testimony of some       French readers who volunteered the opinion that in those hundred pages or       so I had managed to render &ldquo;wonderfully&rdquo; the spirit of the whole epoch.       Exaggeration of kindness no doubt; but even so I hug it still to my       breast, because in truth that is exactly what I was trying to capture in       my small net: the Spirit of the Epoch&mdash;never purely militarist in the       long clash of arms, youthful, almost childlike in its exaltation of       sentiment&mdash;naively heroic in its faith.     </p>     <p>       1920.

The names of a few leaders       alone survive the end of armed strife and are further preserved in       history; so that, vanishing from men&rsquo;s active memories, they still exist       in books.     </p>     <p>       The name of General Santierra attained that cold paper-and-ink       immortality. He was a South American of good family, and the books       published in his lifetime numbered him amongst the liberators of that       continent from the oppressive rule of Spain.     </p>     <p>       That long contest, waged for independence on one side and for dominion on       the other, developed in the course of years and the vicissitudes of       changing fortune the fierceness and inhumanity of a struggle for life. All       feelings of pity and compassion disappeared in the growth of political       hatred. And, as is usual in war, the mass of the people, who had the least       to gain by the issue, suffered most in their obscure persons and their       humble fortunes.     </p>     <p>       General Santierra began his service as lieutenant in the patriot army       raised and commanded by the famous San Martin, afterwards conqueror of       Lima and liberator of Peru. A great battle had just been fought on the       banks of the river Bio-Bio. Amongst the prisoners made upon the routed       Royalist troops there was a soldier called Gaspar Ruiz. His powerful build       and his big head rendered him remarkable amongst his fellow-captives. The       personality of the man was unmistakable. Some months before he had been       missed from the ranks of Republican troops after one of the many       skirmishes which preceded the great battle. And now, having been captured       arms in hand amongst Royalists, he could expect no other fate but to be       shot as a deserter.     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz, however, was not a deserter; his mind was hardly active       enough to take a discriminating view of the advantages or perils of       treachery. Why should he change sides? He had really been made a prisoner,       had suffered ill-usage and many privations. Neither side showed tenderness       to its adversaries. There came a day when he was ordered, together with       some other captured rebels, to march in the front rank of the Royal       troops. A musket had been thrust into his hands. He had taken it. He had       marched. He did not want to be killed with circumstances of peculiar       atrocity for refusing to march. He did not understand heroism but it was       his intention to throw his musket away at the first opportunity. Meantime       he had gone on loading and firing, from fear of having his brains blown       out at the first sign of unwillingness, by some non-commissioned officer       of the King of Spain. He tried to set forth these elementary       considerations before the sergeant of the guard set over him and some       twenty other such deserters, who had been condemned summarily to be shot.     </p>     <p>       It was in the quadrangle of the fort at the back of the batteries which       command the roadstead of Valparaiso. The officer who had identified him       had gone on without listening to his protestations. His doom was sealed;       his hands were tied very tightly together behind his back; his body was       sore all over from the many blows with sticks and butts of muskets which       had hurried him along on the painful road from the place of his capture to       the gate of the fort. This was the only kind of systematic attention the       prisoners had received from their escort during a four days&rsquo; journey       across a scantily watered tract of country. At the crossings of rare       streams they were permitted to quench their thirst by lapping hurriedly       like dogs. In the evening a few scraps of meat were thrown amongst them as       they dropped down dead-beat upon the stony ground of the halting-place.     </p>     <p>       As he stood in the courtyard of the castle in the early morning, after       having been driven hard all night, Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s throat was parched, and       his tongue felt very large and dry in his mouth.     </p>     <p>       And Gaspar Ruiz, besides being very thirsty, was stirred by a feeling of       sluggish anger, which he could not very well express, as though the vigour       of his spirit were by no means equal to the strength of his body.     </p>     <p>       The other prisoners in the batch of the condemned hung their heads,       looking obstinately on the ground. But Gaspar Ruiz kept on repeating:       &ldquo;What should I desert for to the Royalists? Why should I desert? Tell me,       Estaban!&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       He addressed himself to the sergeant, who happened to belong to the same       part of the country as himself. But the sergeant, after shrugging his       meagre shoulders once, paid no further attention to the deep murmuring       voice at his back. It was indeed strange that Gaspar Ruiz should desert.       His people were in too humble a station to feel much the disadvantages of       any form of government. There was no reason why Gaspar Ruiz should wish to       uphold in his own person the rule of the King of Spain. Neither had he       been anxious to exert himself for its subversion. He had joined the side       of Independence in an extremely reasonable and natural manner. A band of       patriots appeared one morning early, surrounding his father&rsquo;s ranche,       spearing the watch-dogs and ham-stringing a fat cow all in the twinkling       of an eye, to the cries of &ldquo;Viva la Libertad!&rdquo; Their officer discoursed of       Liberty with enthusiasm and eloquence after a long and refreshing sleep.       When they left in the evening, taking with them some of Ruiz, the       father&rsquo;s, best horses to replace their own lamed animals, Gaspar Ruiz went       away with them, having been invited pressingly to do so by the eloquent       officer.     </p>     <p>       Shortly afterwards a detachment of Royalist troops coming to pacify the       district, burnt the ranche, carried off the remaining horses and cattle,       and having thus deprived the old people of all their worldly possessions,       left them sitting under a bush in the enjoyment of the inestimable boon of       life.     </p>     <p>       II     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz, condemned to death as a deserter, was not thinking either of       his native place or of his parents, to whom he had been a good son on       account of the mildness of his character and the great strength of his       limbs. The practical advantage of this last was made still more valuable       to his father by his obedient disposition. Gaspar Ruiz had an acquiescent       soul.     </p>     <p>       But it was stirred now to a sort of dim revolt by his dislike to die the       death of a traitor. He was not a traitor. He said again to the sergeant:       &ldquo;You know I did not desert, Estaban. You know I remained behind amongst       the trees with three others to keep the enemy back while the detachment       was running away!&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       Lieutenant Santierra, little more than a boy at the time, and unused as       yet to the sanguinary imbecilities of a state of war, had lingered near       by, as if fascinated by the sight of these men who were to be shot       presently&mdash;&ldquo;for an example&rdquo;&mdash;as the Commandante had said.     </p>     <p>       The sergeant, without deigning to look at the prisoner, addressed himself       to the young officer with a superior smile.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Ten men would not have been enough to make him a prisoner, mi teniente.       Moreover, the other three rejoined the detachment after dark. Why should       he, unwounded and the strongest of them all, have failed to do so?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;My strength is as nothing against a mounted man with a lasso,&rdquo; Gaspar       Ruiz protested, eagerly. &ldquo;He dragged me behind his horse for half a mile.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       At this excellent reason the sergeant only laughed contemptuously. The       young officer hurried away after the Commandante.     </p>     <p>       Presently the adjutant of the castle came by. He was a truculent,       raw-boned man in a ragged uniform. His spluttering voice issued out of a       flat yellow face. The sergeant learned from him that the condemned men       would not be shot till sunset. He begged then to know what he was to do       with them meantime.     </p>     <p>       The adjutant looked savagely round the courtyard and, pointing to the door       of a small dungeon-like guardroom, receiving light and air through one       heavily barred window, said: &ldquo;Drive the scoundrels in there.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The sergeant, tightening his grip upon the stick he carried in virtue of       his rank, executed this order with alacrity and zeal. He hit Gaspar Ruiz,       whose movements were slow, over his head and shoulders. Gaspar Ruiz stood       still for a moment under the shower of blows, biting his lip thoughtfully       as if absorbed by a perplexing mental process&mdash;then followed the       others without haste. The door was locked, and the adjutant carried off       the key.     </p>     <p>       By noon the heat of that vaulted place crammed to suffocation had become       unbearable. The prisoners crowded towards the window, begging their guards       for a drop of water; but the soldiers remained lying in indolent attitudes       wherever there was a little shade under a wall, while the sentry sat with       his back against the door smoking a cigarette, and raising his eyebrows       philosophically from time to time. Gaspar Ruiz had pushed his way to the       window with irresistible force. His capacious chest needed more air than       the others; his big face, resting with its chin on the ledge, pressed       close to the bars, seemed to support the other faces crowding up for       breath. From moaned entreaties they had passed to desperate cries, and the       tumultuous howling of those thirsty men obliged a young officer who was       just then crossing the courtyard to shout in order to make himself heard.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give some water to these prisoners?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The sergeant, with an air of surprised innocence, excused himself by the       remark that all those men were condemned to die in a very few hours.     </p>     <p>       Lieutenant Santierra stamped his foot. &ldquo;They are condemned to death, not       to torture,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Give them some water at once.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       Impressed by this appearance of anger, the soldiers bestirred themselves,       and the sentry, snatching up his musket, stood to attention.     </p>     <p>       But when a couple of buckets were found and filled from the well, it was       discovered that they could not be passed through the bars, which were set       too close. At the prospect of quenching their thirst, the shrieks of those       trampled down in the struggle to get near the opening became very       heartrending. But when the soldiers who had lifted the buckets towards the       window put them to the ground again helplessly, the yell of disappointment       was still more terrible.     </p>     <p>       The soldiers of the army of Independence were not equipped with canteens.       A small tin cup was found, but its approach to the opening caused such a       commotion, such yells of rage and pain in the vague mass of limbs behind       the straining faces at the window, that Lieutenant Santierra cried out       hurriedly, &ldquo;No, no&mdash;you must open the door, sergeant.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The sergeant, shrugging his shoulders, explained that he had no right to       open the door even if he had had the key. But he had not the key. The       adjutant of the garrison kept the key. Those men were giving much       unnecessary trouble, since they had to die at sunset in any case. Why they       had not been shot at once early in the morning he could not understand.     </p>     <p>       Lieutenant Santierra kept his back studiously to the window. It was at his       earnest solicitations that the Commandante had delayed the execution. This       favour had been granted to him in consideration of his distinguished       family and of his father&rsquo;s high position amongst the chiefs of the       Republican party. Lieutenant Santierra believed that the General       commanding would visit the fort some time in the afternoon, and he       ingenuously hoped that his naive intercession would induce that severe man       to pardon some, at least, of those criminals. In the revulsion of his       feeling his interference stood revealed now as guilty and futile meddling.       It appeared to him obvious that the general would never even consent to       listen to his petition. He could never save those men, and he had only       made himself responsible for the sufferings added to the cruelty of their       fate.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Then go at once and get the key from the adjutant,&rdquo; said Lieutenant       Santierra.     </p>     <p>       The sergeant shook his head with a sort of bashful smile, while his eyes       glanced sideways at Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s face, motionless and silent, staring       through the bars at the bottom of a heap of other haggard, distorted,       yelling faces.     </p>     <p>       His worship the adjutant de Plaza, the sergeant murmured, was having his       siesta; and supposing that he, the sergeant, would be allowed access to       him, the only result he expected would be to have his soul flogged out of       his body for presuming to disturb his worship&rsquo;s repose. He made a       deprecatory movement with his hands, and stood stock-still, looking down       modestly upon his brown toes.     </p>     <p>       Lieutenant Santierra glared with indignation, but hesitated. His handsome       oval face, as smooth as a girl&rsquo;s, flushed with the shame of his       perplexity. Its nature humiliated his spirit. His hairless upper lip       trembled; he seemed on the point of either bursting into a fit of rage or       into tears of dismay.     </p>     <p>       Fifty years later, General Santierra, the venerable relic of revolutionary       times, was well able to remember the feelings of the young lieutenant.       Since he had given up riding altogether, and found it difficult to walk       beyond the limits of his garden, the general&rsquo;s greatest delight was to       entertain in his house the officers of the foreign men-of-war visiting the       harbour. For Englishmen he had a preference, as for old companions in       arms. English naval men of all ranks accepted his hospitality with       curiosity, because he had known Lord Cochrane and had taken part, on board       the patriot squadron commanded by that marvellous seaman, in the cutting       out and blockading operations before Callao&mdash;an episode of unalloyed       glory in the wars of Independence and of endless honour in the fighting       tradition of Englishmen. He was a fair linguist, this ancient survivor of       the Liberating armies. A trick of smoothing his long white beard whenever       he was short of a word in French or English imparted an air of leisurely       dignity to the tone of his reminiscences.     </p>     <p>       III     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Yes, my friends,&rdquo; he used to say to his guests, &ldquo;what would you have? A       youth of seventeen summers, without worldly experience, and owing my rank       only to the glorious patriotism of my father, may God rest his soul. I       suffered immense humiliation, not so much from the disobedience of that       subordinate, who, after all, was responsible for those prisoners; but I       suffered because, like the boy I was, I myself dreaded going to the       adjutant for the key. I had felt, before, his rough and cutting tongue.       Being quite a common fellow, with no merit except his savage valour, he       made me feel his contempt and dislike from the first day I joined my       battalion in garrison at the fort. It was only a fortnight before! I would       have confronted him sword in hand, but I shrank from the mocking brutality       of his sneers.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember having been so miserable in my life before or since. The       torment of my sensibility was so great that I wished the sergeant to fall       dead at my feet, and the stupid soldiers who stared at me to turn into       corpses; and even those wretches for whom my entreaties had procured a       reprieve I wished dead also, because I could not face them without shame.       A mephitic heat like a whiff of air from hell came out of that dark place       in which they were confined. Those at the window who had heard what was       going on jeered at me in very desperation: one of these fellows, gone mad       no doubt, kept on urging me volubly to order the soldiers to fire through       the window. His insane loquacity made my heart turn faint. And my feet       were like lead. There was no higher officer to whom I could appeal. I had       not even the firmness of spirit to simply go away.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Benumbed by my remorse, I stood with my back to the window. You must not       suppose that all this lasted a long time. How long could it have been? A       minute? If you measured by mental suffering it was like a hundred years; a       longer time than all my life has been since. No, certainly, it was not so       much as a minute. The hoarse screaming of those miserable wretches died       out in their dry throats, and then suddenly a voice spoke, a deep voice       muttering calmly. It called upon me to turn round.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;That voice, senores, proceeded from the head of Gaspar Ruiz. Of his body       I could see nothing. Some of his fellow-captives had clambered upon his       back. He was holding them up. His eyes blinked without looking at me. That       and the moving of his lips was all he seemed able to manage in his       overloaded state. And when I turned round, this head, that seemed more       than human size resting on its chin under a multitude of other heads,       asked me whether I really desired to quench the thirst of the captives.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; eagerly, and came up quite close to the window. I was       like a child, and did not know what would happen. I was anxious to be       comforted in my helplessness and remorse.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Have you the authority, Senor teniente, to release my wrists from their       bonds?&rsquo; Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s head asked me.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;His features expressed no anxiety, no hope; his heavy eyelids blinked       upon his eyes that looked past me straight into the courtyard.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;As if in an ugly dream, I spoke, stammering: &lsquo;What do you mean? And how       can I reach the bonds on your wrists?&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;I will try what I can do,&rsquo; he said; and then that large staring head       moved at last, and all the wild faces piled up in that window disappeared,       tumbling down. He had shaken his load off with one movement, so strong he       was.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;And he had not only shaken it off, but he got free of the crush and       vanished from my sight. For a moment there was no one at all to be seen at       the window. He had swung about, butting and shouldering, clearing a space       for himself in the only way he could do it with his hands tied behind his       back.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Finally, backing to the opening, he pushed out to me between the bars his       wrists, lashed with many turns of rope. His hands, very swollen, with       knotted veins, looked enormous and unwieldy. I saw his bent back. It was       very broad. His voice was like the muttering of a bull.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Cut, Senor teniente. Cut!&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I drew my sword, my new unblunted sword that had seen no service as yet,       and severed the many turns of the hide rope. I did this without knowing       the why and the wherefore of my action, but as it were compelled by my       faith in that man. The sergeant made as if to cry out, but astonishment       deprived him of his voice, and he remained standing with his mouth open as       if overtaken by sudden imbecility.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I sheathed my sword and faced the soldiers. An air of awestruck       expectation had replaced their usual listless apathy. I heard the voice of       Gaspar Ruiz shouting inside, but the words I could not make out plainly. I       suppose that to see him with his arms free augmented the influence of his       strength: I mean by this, the spiritual influence that with ignorant       people attaches to an exceptional degree of bodily vigour. In fact, he was       no more to be feared than before, on account of the numbness of his arms       and hands, which lasted for some time.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;The sergeant had recovered his power of speech. &lsquo;By all the saints!&rsquo; he       cried, &lsquo;we shall have to get a cavalry man with a lasso to secure him       again, if he is to be led to the place of execution. Nothing less than a       good enlazador on a good horse can subdue him. Your worship was pleased to       perform a very mad thing.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I had nothing to say. I was surprised myself, and I felt a childish       curiosity to see what would happen next. But the sergeant was thinking of       the difficulty of controlling Gaspar Ruiz when the time for making an       example would come.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Or perhaps,&rsquo; the sergeant pursued, vexedly, &lsquo;we shall be obliged to       shoot him down as he dashes out when the door is opened.&rsquo; He was going to       give further vent to his anxieties as to the proper carrying out of the       sentence; but he interrupted himself with a sudden exclamation, snatched a       musket from a soldier, and stood watchful with his eyes fixed on the       window.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       IV     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Gaspar Ruiz had clambered up on the sill, and sat down there with his       feet against the thickness of the wall and his knees slightly bent. The       window was not quite broad enough for the length of his legs. It appeared       to my crestfallen perception that he meant to keep the window all to       himself. He seemed to be taking up a comfortable position. Nobody inside       dared to approach him now he could strike with his hands.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;Por Dios!&rsquo; I heard the sergeant muttering at my elbow, &lsquo;I shall shoot       him through the head now, and get rid of that trouble. He is a condemned       man.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;At that I looked at him angrily. &lsquo;The general has not confirmed the       sentence,&rsquo; I said&mdash;though I knew well in my heart that these were but       vain words. The sentence required no confirmation. &lsquo;You have no right to       shoot him unless he tries to escape,&rsquo; I added, firmly.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;&lsquo;But sangre de Dios!&rsquo; the sergeant yelled out, bringing his musket up to       the shoulder, &lsquo;he is escaping now. Look!&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;But I, as if that Gaspar Ruiz had cast a spell upon me, struck the musket       upward, and the bullet flew over the roofs somewhere. The sergeant dashed       his arm to the ground and stared. He might have commanded the soldiers to       fire, but he did not. And if he had he would not have been obeyed, I       think, just then.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;With his feet against the thickness of the wall and his hairy hands       grasping the iron bar, Gaspar sat still. It was an attitude. Nothing       happened for a time. And suddenly it dawned upon us that he was       straightening his bowed back and contracting his arms. His lips were       twisted into a snarl. Next thing we perceived was that the bar of forged       iron was being bent slowly by the mightiness of his pull. The sun was       beating full upon his cramped, unquivering figure. A shower of sweat-drops       burst out of his forehead. Watching the bar grow crooked, I saw a little       blood ooze from under his finger-nails. Then he let go. For a moment he       remained all huddled up, with a hanging head, looking drowsily into the       upturned palms of his mighty hands. Indeed he seemed to have dozed off.       Suddenly he flung himself backwards on the sill, and setting the soles of       his bare feet against the other middle bar, he bent that one, too, but in       the opposite direction from the first.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Such was his strength, which in this case relieved my painful feelings.       And the man seemed to have done nothing. Except for the change of position       in order to use his feet, which made us all start by its swiftness, my       recollection is that of immobility. But he had bent the bars wide apart.       And now he could get out if he liked; but he dropped his legs inwards, and       looking over his shoulder beckoned to the soldiers. &lsquo;Hand up the water,&rsquo;        he said. &lsquo;I will give them all a drink.&rsquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He was obeyed. For a moment I expected man and bucket to disappear,       overwhelmed by the rush of eagerness; I thought they would pull him down       with their teeth. There was a rush, but holding the bucket on his lap he       repulsed the assault of those wretches by the mere swinging of his feet.       They flew backwards at every kick, yelling with pain; and the soldiers       laughed, gazing at the window.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;They all laughed, holding their sides, except the sergeant, who was       gloomy and morose. He was afraid the prisoners would rise and break out&mdash;which       would have been a bad example. But there was no fear of that, and I stood       myself before the window with my drawn sword. When sufficiently tamed by       the strength of Gaspar Ruiz they came up one by one, stretching their       necks and presenting their lips to the edge of the bucket which the strong       man tilted towards them from his knees with an extraordinary air of       charity, gentleness, and compassion. That benevolent appearance was of       course the effect of his care in not spilling the water and of his       attitude as he sat on the sill; for, if a man lingered with his lips glued       to the rim of the bucket after Gaspar Ruiz had said &lsquo;You have had enough,&rsquo;        there would be no tenderness or mercy in the shove of the foot which would       send him groaning and doubled up far into the interior of the prison,       where he would knock down two or three others before he fell himself. They       came up to him again and again; it looked as if they meant to drink the       well dry before going to their death; but the soldiers were so amused by       Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s systematic proceedings that they carried the water up to the       window cheerfully.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;When the adjutant came out after his siesta there was some trouble over       this affair, I can assure you. And the worst of it was that the general       whom we expected never came to the castle that day.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       The guests of General Santierra unanimously expressed their regret that       the man of such strength and patience had not been saved.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;He was not saved by my interference,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;The prisoners       were led to execution half an hour before sunset. Gaspar Ruiz, contrary to       the sergeant&rsquo;s apprehensions, gave no trouble. There was no necessity to       get a cavalry man with a lasso in order to subdue him, as if he were a       wild bull of the campo. I believe he marched out with his arms free       amongst the others who were bound. I did not see. I was not there. I had       been put under arrest for interfering with the prisoner&rsquo;s guard. About       dusk, sitting dismally in my quarters, I heard three volleys fired, and       thought that I should never hear of Gaspar Ruiz again. He fell with the       others. But we were to hear of him nevertheless, though the sergeant       boasted that as he lay on his face expiring or dead in the heap of the       slain, he had slashed his neck with a sword. He had done this, he said, to       make sure of ridding the world of a dangerous traitor.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I confess to you, senores, that I thought of that strong man with a sort       of gratitude, and with some admiration. He had used his strength       honourably. There dwelt, then, in his soul no fierceness corresponding to       the vigour of his body.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       V     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz, who could with ease bend apart the heavy iron bars of the       prison, was led out with others to summary execution. &ldquo;Every bullet has       its billet,&rdquo; runs the proverb. All the merit of proverbs consists in the       concise and picturesque expression. In the surprise of our minds is found       their persuasiveness. In other words, we are struck and convinced by the       shock.     </p>     <p>       What surprises us is the form, not the substance. Proverbs are art&mdash;cheap       art. As a general rule they are not true; unless indeed they happen to be       mere platitudes, as for instance the proverb, &ldquo;Half a loaf is better than       no bread,&rdquo; or &ldquo;A miss is as good as a mile.&rdquo; Some proverbs are simply       imbecile, others are immoral. That one evolved out of the naive heart of       the great Russian people, &ldquo;Man discharges the piece, but God carries the       bullet,&rdquo; is piously atrocious, and at bitter variance with the accepted       conception of a compassionate God. It would indeed be an inconsistent       occupation for the Guardian of the poor, the innocent, and the helpless,       to carry the bullet, for instance, into the heart of a father.     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz was childless, he had no wife, he had never been in love. He       had hardly ever spoken to a woman, beyond his mother and the ancient       negress of the household, whose wrinkled skin was the colour of cinders,       and whose lean body was bent double from age. If some bullets from those       muskets fired off at fifteen paces were specifically destined for the       heart of Gaspar Ruiz, they all missed their billet. One, however, carried       away a small piece of his ear, and another a fragment of flesh from his       shoulder.     </p>     <p>       A red and unclouded sun setting into a purple ocean looked with a fiery       stare upon the enormous wall of the Cordilleras, worthy witnesses of his       glorious extinction. But it is inconceivable that it should have seen the       ant-like men busy with their absurd and insignificant trials of killing       and dying for reasons that, apart from being generally childish, were also       imperfectly understood. It did light up, however, the backs of the firing       party and the faces of the condemned men. Some of them had fallen on their       knees, others remained standing, a few averted their heads from the       levelled barrels of muskets. Gaspar Ruiz, upright, the burliest of them       all, hung his big shock head. The low sun dazzled him a little, and he       counted himself a dead man already.     </p>     <p>       He fell at the first discharge. He fell because he thought he was a dead       man. He struck the ground heavily. The jar of the fall surprised him. &ldquo;I       am not dead apparently,&rdquo; he thought to himself, when he heard the       execution platoon reloading its arms at the word of command. It was then       that the hope of escape dawned upon him for the first time. He remained       lying stretched out with rigid limbs under the weight of two bodies       collapsed crosswise upon his back.     </p>     <p>       By the time the soldiers had fired a third volley into the slightly       stirring heaps of the slain, the sun had gone out of sight, and almost       immediately with the darkening of the ocean dusk fell upon the coasts of       the young Republic. Above the gloom of the lowlands the snowy peaks of the       Cordilleras remained luminous and crimson for a long time. The soldiers       before marching back to the fort sat down to smoke.     </p>     <p>       The sergeant with a naked sword in his hand strolled away by himself along       the heap of the dead. He was a humane man, and watched for any stir or       twitch of limb in the merciful idea of plunging the point of his blade       into any body giving the slightest sign of life. But none of the bodies       afforded him an opportunity for the display of this charitable intention.       Not a muscle twitched amongst them, not even the powerful muscles of       Gaspar Ruiz, who, deluged with the blood of his neighbours and shamming       death, strove to appear more lifeless than the others.     </p>     <p>       He was lying face down. The sergeant recognized him by his stature, and       being himself a very small man, looked with envy and contempt at the       prostration of so much strength. He had always disliked that particular       soldier. Moved by an obscure animosity, he inflicted a long gash across       the neck of Gaspar Ruiz, with some vague notion of making sure of that       strong man&rsquo;s death, as if a powerful physique were more able to resist the       bullets. For the sergeant had no doubt that Gaspar Ruiz had been shot       through in many places. Then he passed on, and shortly afterwards marched       off with his men, leaving the bodies to the care of crows and vultures.     </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz had restrained a cry, though it had seemed to him that his       head was cut off at a blow; and when darkness came, shaking off the dead,       whose weight had oppressed him, he crawled away over the plain on his       hands and knees. After drinking deeply, like a wounded beast, at a shallow       stream, he assumed an upright posture, and staggered on light-headed and       aimless, as if lost amongst the stars of the clear night. A small house       seemed to rise out of the ground before him. He stumbled into the porch       and struck at the door with his fist. There was not a gleam of light.       Gaspar Ruiz might have thought that the inhabitants had fled from it, as       from many others in the neighbourhood, had it not been for the shouts of       abuse that answered his thumping. In his feverish and enfeebled state the       angry screaming seemed to him part of a hallucination belonging to the       weird, dreamlike feeling of his unexpected condemnation to death, of the       thirst suffered, of the volleys fired at him within fifteen paces, of his       head being cut off at a blow. &ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Open in the name       of God!&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       An infuriated voice from within jeered at him: &ldquo;Come in, come in. This       house belongs to you. All this land belongs to you. Come and take it.&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       &ldquo;For the love of God,&rdquo; Gaspar Ruiz murmured.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;Does not all the land belong to you patriots?&rdquo; the voice on the other       side of the door screamed on. &ldquo;Are you not a patriot?&rdquo;      </p>     <p>       Gaspar Ruiz did not know. &ldquo;I am a wounded man,&rdquo; he said, apathetically.     </p>     <p>       All became still inside. Gaspar Ruiz lost the hope of being admitted, and       lay down under the porch just outside the door. He was utterly careless of       what was going to happen to him. All his consciousness seemed to be       concentrated in his neck, where he felt a severe pain. His indifference as       to his fate was genuine. The day was breaking when he awoke from a       feverish doze; the door at which he had knocked in the dark stood wide       open now, and a girl, steadying herself with her outspread arms, leaned       over the threshold. Lying on his back, he stared up at her. Her face was       pale and her eyes were very dark; her hair hung down black as ebony       against her white cheeks; her lips were full and red. Beyond her he saw       another head with long grey hair, and a thin old face with a pair of       anxiously clasped hands under the chin.     </p>     <p>       VI     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;I knew those people by sight,&rdquo; General Santierra would tell his guests at       the dining-table. &ldquo;I mean the people with whom Gaspar Ruiz found shelter.       The father was an old Spaniard, a man of property ruined by the       revolution. His estates, his house in town, his money, everything he had       in the world had been confiscated by proclamation, for he was a bitter foe       of our independence. From a position of great dignity and influence on the       Viceroy&rsquo;s Council he became of less importance than his own negro slaves       made free by our glorious revolution. He had not even the means to flee       the country, as other Spaniards had managed to do. It may be that,       wandering ruined and houseless, and burdened with nothing but his life,       which was left to him by the clemency of the Provisional Government, he       had simply walked under that broken roof of old tiles. It was a lonely       spot. There did not seem to be even a dog belonging to the place. But       though the roof had holes, as if a cannon-ball or two had dropped through       it, the wooden shutters were thick and tight-closed all the time.     </p>     <p>       &ldquo;My way took me frequently along the path in front of that miserable       rancho. I rode from the fort to the town almost every evening, to sigh at       the window of a lady I was in love with, then. When one is young, you       understand. . . . She was a good patriot, you may believe. Caballeros,       credit me or not, political feeling ran so high in those days that I do       not believe I could have been fascinated by the charms of a woman of       Royalist opini
