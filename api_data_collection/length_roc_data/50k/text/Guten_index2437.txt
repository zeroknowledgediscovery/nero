CHAPTER I   “IT is not a large house,” I said.  “We don’t want a large house.  Two spare bedrooms, and the little three-cornered place you see marked there on the plan, next to the bathroom, and which will just do for a bachelor, will be all we shall require—at all events, for the present.  Later on, if I ever get rich, we can throw out a wing.  The kitchen I shall have to break to your mother gently.  Whatever the original architect could have been thinking of—”  “Never mind the kitchen,” said Dick: “what about the billiard-room?”  The way children nowadays will interrupt a parent is nothing short of a national disgrace.  I also wish Dick would not sit on the table, swinging his legs.  It is not respectful.  “Why, when I was a boy,” as I said to him, “I should as soon have thought of sitting on a table, interrupting my father—”  “What’s this thing in the middle of the hall, that looks like a grating?” demanded Robina.  “She means the stairs,” explained Dick.  “Then why don’t they look like stairs?” commented Robina.  “They do,” replied Dick, “to people with sense.”  “They don’t,” persisted Robina, “they look like a grating.”  Robina, with the plan spread out across her knee, was sitting balanced on the arm of an easy-chair.  Really, I hardly see the use of buying chairs for these people.  Nobody seems to know what they are for—except it be one or another of the dogs.  Perches are all they want.  “If we threw the drawing-room into the hall and could do away with the stairs,” thought Robina, “we should be able to give a dance now and then.”  “Perhaps,” I suggested, “you would like to clear out the house altogether, leaving nothing but the four bare walls.  That would give us still more room, that would.  For just living in, we could fix up a shed in the garden; or—”  “I’m talking seriously,” said Robina: “what’s the good of a drawing-room? One only wants it to show the sort of people into that one wishes hadn’t come.  They’d sit about, looking miserable, just as well anywhere else. If we could only get rid of the stairs—”  “Oh, of course! we could get rid of the stairs,” I agreed.  “It would be a bit awkward at first, when we wanted to go to bed.  But I daresay we should get used to it.  We could have a ladder and climb up to our rooms through the windows.  Or we might adopt the Norwegian method and have the stairs outside.”  “I wish you would be sensible,” said Robin.  “I am trying to be,” I explained; “and I am also trying to put a little sense into you.  At present you are crazy about dancing.  If you had your way, you would turn the house into a dancing-saloon with primitive sleeping-accommodation attached.  It will last six months, your dancing craze.  Then you will want the house transformed into a swimming-bath, or a skating-rink, or cleared out for hockey.  My idea may be conventional. I don’t expect you to sympathise with it.  My notion is just an ordinary Christian house, not a gymnasium.  There are going to be bedrooms in this house, and there’s going to be a staircase leading to them.  It may strike you as sordid, but there is also going to be a kitchen: though why when building the house they should have put the kitchen—  “Don’t forget the billiard-room,” said Dick.  “If you thought more of your future career and less about billiards,” Robin pointed out to him, “perhaps you’d get through your Little-go in the course of the next few years.  If Pa only had sense—I mean if he wasn’t so absurdly indulgent wherever you are concerned, he would not have a billiard-table in the house.”  “You talk like that,” retorted Dick, “merely because you can’t play.”  “I can beat you, anyhow,” retorted Robin.  “Once,” admitted Dick—“once in six weeks.”  “Twice,” corrected Robin.  “You don’t play,” Dick explained to her; “you just whack round and trust to Providence.”  “I don’t whack round,” said Robin; “I always aim at something.  When you try and it doesn’t come off, you say it’s ‘hard luck;’ and when I try and it does come off, you say it’s fluking.  So like a man.”  “You both of you,” I said, “attach too much importance to the score. When you try for a cannon off the white and hit it on the wrong side and send it into a pocket, and your own ball travels on and makes a losing hazard off the red, instead of being vexed with yourselves—”  “If you get a really good table, governor,” said Dick, “I’ll teach you billiards.”  I do believe Dick really thinks he can play.  It is the same with golf. Beginners are invariably lucky.  “I think I shall like it,” they tell you; “I seem to have the game in me, if you understand.”  ‘There is a friend of mine, an old sea-captain.  He is the sort of man that when the three balls are lying in a straight line, tucked up under the cushion, looks pleased; because then he knows he can make a cannon and leave the red just where he wants it.  An Irish youngster named Malooney, a college chum of Dick’s, was staying with us; and the afternoon being wet, the Captain said he would explain it to Malooney, how a young man might practise billiards without any danger of cutting the cloth.  He taught him how to hold the cue, and he told him how to make a bridge.  Malooney was grateful, and worked for about an hour.  He did not show much promise.  He is a powerfully built young man, and he didn’t seem able to get it into his head that he wasn’t playing cricket. Whenever he hit a little low the result was generally lost ball.  To save time—and damage to furniture—Dick and I fielded for him.  Dick stood at long-stop, and I was short slip.  It was dangerous work, however, and when Dick had caught him out twice running, we agreed that we had won, and took him in to tea.  In the evening—none of the rest of us being keen to try our luck a second time—the Captain said, that just for the joke of the thing he would give Malooney eighty-five and play him a hundred up. To confess the truth, I find no particular fun myself in playing billiards with the Captain.  The game consists, as far as I am concerned, in walking round the table, throwing him back the balls, and saying “Good!”  By the time my turn comes I don’t seem to care what happens: everything seems against me.  He is a kind old gentleman and he means well, but the tone in which he says “Hard lines!” whenever I miss an easy stroke irritates me.  I feel I’d like to throw the balls at his head and fling the table out of window.  I suppose it is that I am in a fretful state of mind, but the mere way in which he chalks his cue aggravates me. He carries his own chalk in his waistcoat pocket—as if our chalk wasn’t good enough for him—and when he has finished chalking, he smooths the tip round with his finger and thumb and taps the cue against the table.  “Oh! go on with the game,” I want to say to him; “don’t be so full of tricks.”                                  * * * * *  The Captain led off with a miss in baulk.  Malooney gripped his cue, drew in a deep breath, and let fly.  The result was ten: a cannon and all three balls in the same pocket.  As a matter of fact he made the cannon twice; but the second time, as we explained to him, of course did not count.  “Good beginning!” said the Captain.  Malooney seemed pleased with himself, and took off his coat.  Malooney’s ball missed the red on its first journey up the table by about a foot, but found it later on and sent it into a pocket.  “Ninety-nine plays nothing,” said Dick, who was marking.  “Better make it a hundred and fifty, hadn’t we, Captain?”  “Well, I’d like to get in a shot,” said the Captain, “before the game is over.  Perhaps we had better make it a hundred and fifty, if Mr. Malooney has no objection.”  “Whatever you think right, sir,” said Rory Malooney.  Malooney finished his break for twenty-two, leaving himself hanging over the middle pocket and the red tucked up in baulk.  “Nothing plays a hundred and eight,” said Dick.  “When I want the score,” said the Captain, “I’ll ask for it.”  “Beg pardon, sir,” said Dick.  “I hate a noisy game,” said the Captain.  The Captain, making up his mind without much waste of time, sent his ball under the cushion, six inches outside baulk.  “What will I do here?” asked Malooney.  “I don’t know what you will do,” said the Captain; “I’m waiting to see.”  Owing to the position of the ball, Malooney was unable to employ his whole strength.  All he did that turn was to pocket the Captain’s ball and leave himself under the bottom cushion, four inches from the red. The Captain said a nautical word, and gave another miss.  Malooney squared up to the balls for the third time.  They flew before him, panic-stricken.  They banged against one another, came back and hit one another again for no reason whatever.  The red, in particular, Malooney had succeeded apparently in frightening out of its wits.  It is a stupid ball, generally speaking, our red—its one idea to get under a cushion and watch the game.  With Malooney it soon found it was safe nowhere on the table.  Its only hope was pockets.  I may have been mistaken, my eye may have been deceived by the rapidity of the play, but it seemed to me that the red never waited to be hit.  When it saw Malooney’s ball coming for it at the rate of forty miles an hour, it just made for the nearest pocket.  It rushed round the table looking for pockets.  If in its excitement, it passed an empty pocket, it turned back and crawled in. There were times when in its terror it jumped the table and took shelter under the sofa or behind the sideboard.  One began to feel sorry for the red.  The Captain had scored a legitimate thirty-eight, and Malooney had given him twenty-four, when it really seemed as if the Captain’s chance had come.  I could have scored myself as the balls were then.  “Sixty-two plays one hundred and twenty-eight.  Now then, Captain, game in your hands,” said Dick.  We gathered round.  The children left their play.  It was a pretty picture: the bright young faces, eager with expectation, the old worn veteran squinting down his cue, as if afraid that watching Malooney’s play might have given it the squirms.  “Now follow this,” I whispered to Malooney.  “Don’t notice merely what he does, but try and understand why he does it.  Any fool—after a little practice, that is—can hit a ball.  But why do you hit it?  What happens after you’ve hit it?  What—”  “Hush,” said Dick.  The Captain drew his cue back and gently pushed it forward.  “Pretty stroke,” I whispered to Malooney; “now, that’s the sort—”  I offer, by way of explanation, that the Captain by this time was probably too full of bottled-up language to be master of his nerves.  The ball travelled slowly past the red.  Dick said afterwards that you couldn’t have put so much as a sheet of paper between them.  It comforts a man, sometimes, when you tell him this; and at other times it only makes him madder.  It travelled on and passed the white—you could have put quite a lot of paper between it and the white—and dropped with a contented thud into the top left-hand pocket.  “Why does he do that?” Malooney whispered.  Malooney has a singularly hearty whisper.  Dick and I got the women and children out of the room as quickly as we could, but of course Veronica managed to tumble over something on the way—Veronica would find something to tumble over in the desert of Sahara; and a few days later I overheard expressions, scorching their way through the nursery door, that made my hair rise up.  I entered, and found Veronica standing on the table.  Jumbo was sitting upon the music-stool. The poor dog himself was looking scared, though he must have heard a bit of language in his time, one way and another.  “Veronica,” I said, “are you not ashamed of yourself?  You wicked child, how dare you—”  “It’s all right,” said Veronica.  “I don’t really mean any harm.  He’s a sailor, and I have to talk to him like that, else he don’t know he’s being talked to.”  I pay hard-working, conscientious ladies to teach this child things right and proper for her to know.  They tell her clever things that Julius Cæsar said; observations made by Marcus Aurelius that, pondered over, might help her to become a beautiful character.  She complains that it produces a strange buzzy feeling in her head; and her mother argues that perhaps her brain is of the creative order, not intended to remember much—thinks that perhaps she is going to be something.  A good round-dozen oaths the Captain must have let fly before Dick and I succeeded in rolling her out of the room.  She had only heard them once, yet, so far as I could judge, she had got them letter perfect.  The Captain, now no longer under the necessity of employing all his energies to suppress his natural instincts, gradually recovered form, and eventually the game stood at one hundred and forty-nine all, Malooney to play.  The Captain had left the balls in a position that would have disheartened any other opponent than Malooney.  To any other opponent than Malooney the Captain would have offered irritating sympathy. “Afraid the balls are not rolling well for you to-night,” the Captain would have said; or, “Sorry, sir, I don’t seem to have left you very much.”  To-night the Captain wasn’t feeling playful.  “Well, if he scores off that!” said Dick.  “Short of locking up the balls and turning out the lights, I don’t myself see how one is going to stop him,” sighed the Captain.  The Captain’s ball was in hand.  Malooney went for the red and hit—perhaps it would be more correct to say, frightened—it into a pocket. Malooney’s ball, with the table to itself, then gave a solo performance, and ended up by breaking a window.  It was what the lawyers call a nice point.  What was the effect upon the score?  Malooney argued that, seeing he had pocketed the red before his own ball left the table, his three should be counted first, and that therefore he had won.  Dick maintained that a ball that had ended up in a flower-bed couldn’t be deemed to have scored anything.  The Captain declined to assist.  He said that, although he had been playing billiards for upwards of forty years, the incident was new to him.  My own feeling was that of thankfulness that we had got through the game without anybody being really injured.  We agreed that the person to decide the point would be the editor of _The Field_.  It remains still undecided.  The Captain came into my study the next morning.  He said: “If you haven’t written that letter to _The Field_, don’t mention my name.  They know me on _The Field_.  I would rather it did not get about that I have been playing with a man who cannot keep his ball within the four walls of a billiard-room.”  “Well,” I answered, “I know most of the fellows on _The Field_ myself. They don’t often get hold of anything novel in the way of a story.  When they do, they are apt to harp upon it.  My idea was to keep my own name out of it altogether.”  “It is not a point likely to crop up often,” said the Captain.  “I’d let it rest if I were you.”  I should like to have had it settled.  In the end, I wrote the editor a careful letter, in a disguised hand, giving a false name and address. But if any answer ever appeared I must have missed it.  Myself I have a sort of consciousness that somewhere inside me there is quite a good player, if only I could persuade him to come out.  He is shy, that is all.  He does not seem able to play when people are looking on.  The shots he misses when people are looking on would give you a wrong idea of him.  When nobody is about, a prettier game you do not often see.  If some folks who fancy themselves could see me when there is nobody about, it might take the conceit out of them.  Only once I played up to what I feel is my real form, and then it led to argument.  I was staying at an hotel in Switzerland, and the second evening a pleasant-spoken young fellow, who said he had read all my books—later, he appeared surprised on learning I had written more than two—asked me if I would care to play a hundred up.  We played even, and I paid for the table.  The next evening he said he thought it would make a better game if he gave me forty and I broke.  It was a fairly close finish, and afterwards he suggested that I should put down my name for the handicap they were arranging.  “I am afraid,” I answered, “that I hardly play well enough.  Just a quiet game with you is one thing; but in a handicap with a crowd looking on—”  “I should not let that trouble you,” he said; “there are some here who play worse than you—just one or two.  It passes the evening.”  It was merely a friendly affair.  I paid my twenty marks, and was given plus a hundred.  I drew for my first game a chatty type of man, who started minus twenty.  We neither of us did much for the first five minutes, and then I made a break of forty-four.  There was not a fluke in it from beginning to end.  I was never more astonished in my life.  It seemed to me it was the cue was doing it.  Minus Twenty was even more astonished.  I heard him as I passed:  “Who handicapped this man?” he asked.  “I did,” said the pleasant-spoken youngster.  “Oh,” said Minus Twenty—“friend of yours, I presume?”  There are evenings that seem to belong to you.  We finished that two hundred and fifty under the three-quarters of an hour.  I explained to Minus Twenty—he was plus sixty-three at the end—that my play that night had been exceptional.  He said that he had heard of cases similar.  I left him talking volubly to the committee.  He was not a nice man at all.  After that I did not care to win; and that of course was fatal.  The less I tried, the more impossible it seemed for me to do wrong.  I was left in at the last with a man from another hotel.  But for that I am convinced I should have carried off the handicap.  Our hotel didn’t, anyhow, want the other hotel to win.  So they gathered round me, and offered me sound advice, and begged me to be careful; with the natural result that I went back to my usual form quite suddenly.  Never before or since have I played as I played that week.  But it showed me what I could do.  I shall get a new table, with proper pockets this time.  There is something wrong about our pockets.  The balls go into them and then come out again.  You would think they had seen something there to frighten them.  They come out trembling and hold on to the cushion.  I shall also get a new red ball.  I fancy it must be a very old ball, our red.  It seems to me to be always tired.  “The billiard-room,” I said to Dick, “I see my way to easily enough. Adding another ten feet to what is now the dairy will give us twenty-eight by twenty.  I am hopeful that will be sufficient even for your friend Malooney.  The drawing-room is too small to be of any use.  I may decide—as Robina has suggested—to ‘throw it into the hall.’  But the stairs will remain.  For dancing, private theatricals—things to keep you children out of mischief—I have an idea I will explain to you later on. The kitchen—”  “Can I have a room to myself?” asked Veronica.  Veronica was sitting on the floor, staring into the fire, her chin supported by her hand.  Veronica, in those rare moments when she is resting from her troubles, wears a holy, far-away expression apt to mislead the stranger.  Governesses, new to her, have their doubts whether on these occasions they are justified in dragging her back to discuss mere dates and tables.  Poets who are friends of mine, coming unexpectedly upon Veronica standing by the window, gazing upward at the evening star, have thought it was a vision, until they got closer and found that she was sucking peppermints.  “I should so like to have a room all to myself,” added Veronica.  “It would be a room!” commented Robin.  “It wouldn’t have your hairpins sticking up all over the bed, anyhow,” murmured Veronica dreamily.  “I like that!” said Robin; “why—”  “You’re harder than I am,” said Veronica.  “I should wish you to have a room, Veronica,” I said.  “My fear is that in place of one untidy bedroom in the house—a room that makes me shudder every time I see it through the open door; and the door, in spite of all I can say, generally is wide open—”  “I’m not untidy,” said Robin, “not really.  I know where everything is in the dark—if people would only leave them alone.”  “You are.  You’re about the most untidy girl I know,” said Dick.  “I’m not,” said Robin; “you don’t see other girls’ rooms.  Look at yours at Cambridge.  Malooney told us you’d had a fire, and we all believed him at first.”  “When a man’s working—” said Dick.  “He must have an orderly place to work in,” suggested Robin.  Dick sighed.  “It’s never any good talking to you,” said Dick.  “You don’t even see your own faults.”  “I can,” said Robin; “I see them more than anyone.  All I claim is justice.”  “Show me, Veronica,” I said, “that you are worthy to possess a room.  At present you appear to regard the whole house as your room.  I find your gaiters on the croquet lawn.  A portion of your costume—an article that anyone possessed of the true feelings of a lady would desire to keep hidden from the world—is discovered waving from the staircase window.”  “I put it out to be mended,” explained Veronica.  “You opened the door and flung it out.  I told you of it at the time,” said Robin.  “You do the same with your boots.”  “You are too high-spirited for your size,” explained Dick to her.  “Try to be less dashing.”  “I could also wish, Veronica,” I continued, “that you shed your back comb less easily, or at least that you knew when you had shed it.  As for your gloves—well, hunting your gloves has come to be our leading winter sport.”  “People look in such funny places for them,” said Veronica.  “Granted.  But be just, Veronica,” I pleaded.  “Admit that it is in funny places we occasionally find them.  When looking for your things one learns, Veronica, never to despair.  So long as there remains a corner unexplored inside or outside the house, within the half-mile radius, hope need not be abandoned.”  Veronica was still gazing dreamily into the fire.  “I suppose,” said Veronica, “it’s reditty.”  “It’s what?” I said.  “She means heredity,” suggested Dick—“cheeky young beggar!  I wonder you let her talk to you the way she does.”  “Besides,” added Robin, “as I am always explaining to you, Pa is a literary man.  With him it is part of his temperament.”  “It’s hard on us children,” said Veronica.  We were all agreed—with the exception of Veronica—that it was time Veronica went to bed.  As chairman I took it upon myself to closure the debate.     CHAPTER II   “DO you mean, Governor, that you have actually bought the house?” demanded Dick, “or are we only talking about it?”  “This time, Dick,” I answered, “I have done it.”  Dick looked serious.  “Is it what you wanted?” he asked.  “No, Dick,” I replied, “it is not what I wanted.  I wanted an old-fashioned, picturesque, rambling sort of a place, all gables and ivy and oriel windows.”  “You are mixing things up,” Dick interrupted, “gables and oriel windows don’t go together.”  “I beg your pardon, Dick,” I corrected him, “in the house I wanted, they do.  It is the style of house you find in the Christmas number.  I have never seen it anywhere else, but I took a fancy to it from the first.  It is not too far from the church, and it lights up well at night.  ‘One of these days,’ I used to say to myself when a boy, ‘I’ll be a clever man and live in a house just like that.’  It was my dream.”  “And what is this place like?” demanded Robin, “this place you have bought.”  “The agent,” I explained, “claims for it that it is capable of improvement.  I asked him to what school of architecture he would say it belonged; he said he thought that it must have been a local school, and pointed out—what seems to be the truth—that nowadays they do not build such houses.”  “Near to the river?” demanded Dick.  “Well, by the road,” I answered, “I daresay it may be a couple of miles.”  “And by the shortest way?” questioned Dick.  “That is the shortest way,” I explained; “there’s a prettier way through the woods, but that is about three miles and a half.”  “But we had decided it was to be near the river,” said Robin.  “We also decided,” I replied, “that it was to be on sandy soil, with a south-west aspect.  Only one thing in this house has a south-west aspect, and that’s the back door.  I asked the agent about the sand.  He advised me, if I wanted it in any quantity, to get an estimate from the Railway Company.  I wanted it on a hill.  It is on a hill, with a bigger hill in front of it.  I didn’t want that other hill.  I wanted an uninterrupted view of the southern half of England.  I wanted to take people out on the step, and cram them with stories about our being able on clear days to see the Bristol Channel.  They might not have believed me, but without that hill I could have stuck to it, and they could not have been certain—not dead certain—I was lying.  “Personally, I should have liked a house where something had happened.  I should have liked, myself, a blood-stain—not a fussy blood-stain, a neat unobtrusive blood-stain that would have been content, most of its time, to remain hidden under the mat, shown only occasionally as a treat to visitors.  I had hopes even of a ghost.  I don’t mean one of those noisy ghosts that doesn’t seem to know it is dead.  A lady ghost would have been my fancy, a gentle ghost with quiet, pretty ways.  This house—well, it is such a sensible-looking house, that is my chief objection to it. It has got an echo.  If you go to the end of the garden and shout at it very loudly, it answers you back.  This is the only bit of fun you can have with it.  Even then it answers you in such a tone you feel it thinks the whole thing silly—is doing it merely to humour you.  It is one of those houses that always seems to be thinking of its rates and taxes.”  “Any reason at all for your having bought it?” asked Dick.  “Yes, Dick,” I answered.  “We are all of us tired of this suburb.  We want to live in the country and be good.  To live in the country with any comfort it is necessary to have a house there.  This being admitted, it follows we must either build a house or buy one.  I would rather not build a house.  Talboys built himself a house.  You know Talboys.  When I first met him, before he started building, he was a cheerful soul with a kindly word for everyone.  The builder assures him that in another twenty years, when the colour has had time to tone down, his house will be a picture.  At present it makes him bilious, the mere sight of it.  Year by year, they tell him, as the dampness wears itself away, he will suffer less and less from rheumatism, ague, and lumbago.  He has a hedge round the garden; it is eighteen inches high.  To keep the boys out he has put up barbed-wire fencing.  But wire fencing affords no real privacy.  When the Talboys are taking coffee on the lawn, there is generally a crowd from the village watching them.  There are trees in the garden; you know they are trees—there is a label tied to each one telling you what sort of tree it is.  For the moment there is a similarity about them.  Thirty years hence, Talboys estimates, they will afford him shade and comfort; but by that time he hopes to be dead.  I want a house that has got over all its troubles; I don’t want to spend the rest of my life bringing up a young and inexperienced house.”  “But why this particular house?” urged Robin, “if, as you say, it is not the house you wanted.”  “Because, my dear girl,” I answered, “it is less unlike the house I wanted than other houses I have seen.  When we are young we make up our minds to try and get what we want; when we have arrived at years of discretion we decide to try and want what we can get.  It saves time. During the last two years I have seen about sixty houses, and out of the lot there was only one that was really the house I wanted.  Hitherto I have kept the story to myself.  Even now, thinking about it irritates me. It was not an agent who told me of it.  I met a man by chance in a railway carriage.  He had a black eye.  If ever I meet him again I’ll give him another.  He accounted for it by explaining that he had had trouble with a golf ball, and at the time I believed him.  I mentioned to him in conversation I was looking for a house.  He described this place to me, and it seemed to me hours before the train stopped at a station. When it did I got out and took the next train back.  I did not even wait for lunch.  I had my bicycle with me, and I went straight there.  It was—well, it was the house I wanted.  If it had vanished suddenly, and I had found myself in bed, the whole thing would have seemed more reasonable.  The proprietor opened the door to me himself.  He had the bearing of a retired military man.  It was afterwards I learnt he was the proprietor.  “I said, ‘Good afternoon; if it is not troubling you, I would like to look over the house.’  We were standing in the oak-panelled hall.  I noticed the carved staircase about which the man in the train had told me, also the Tudor fireplaces.  That is all I had time to notice.  The next moment I was lying on my back in the middle of the gravel with the door shut.  I looked up.  I saw the old maniac’s head sticking out of a little window.  It was an evil face.  He had a gun in his hand.  “‘I’m going to count twenty,’ he said.  ‘If you are not the other side of the gate by then, I shoot.’  “I ran over the figures myself on my way to the gate.  I made it eighteen.  “I had an hour to wait for the train.  I talked the matter over with the station-master.  “‘Yes,’ he said, ‘there’ll be trouble up there one of these days.’  “I said, ‘It seems to me to have begun.’  “He said, ‘It’s the Indian sun.  It gets into their heads.  We have one or two in the neighbourhood.  They are quiet enough till something happens.’  “‘If I’d been two seconds longer,’ I said, ‘I believe he’d have done it.’  “‘It’s a taking house,’ said the station-master; ‘not too big and not too little.  It’s the sort of house people seem to be looking for.’  “‘I don’t envy,’ I said, ‘the next person that finds it.’  “‘He settled himself down here,’ said the station-master, ‘about ten years ago.  Since then, if one person has offered to take the house off his hands, I suppose a thousand have.  At first he would laugh at them good-temperedly—explain to them that his idea was to live there himself, in peace and quietness, till he died.  Two out of every three of them would express their willingness to wait for that, and suggest some arrangement by which they might enter into possession, say, a week after the funeral.  The last few months it has been worse than ever.  I reckon you’re about the eighth that has been up there this week, and to-day only Thursday.  There’s something to be said, you know, for the old man.’”  “And did he,” asked Dick—“did he shoot the next party that came along?”  “Don’t be so silly, Dick,” said Robin; “it’s a story.  Tell us another, Pa.”  “I don’t know what you mean, Robina, by a story,” I said.  “If you mean to imply—”  Robina said she didn’t; but I know quite well she did.  Because I am an author, and have to tell stories for my living, people think I don’t know any truth.  It is vexing enough to be doubted when one is exaggerating; to have sneers flung at one by one’s own kith and kin when one is struggling to confine oneself to bald, bare narrative—well, where is the inducement to be truthful?  There are times when I almost say to myself that I will never tell the truth again.  “As it happens,” I said, “the story is true, in many places.  I pass over your indifference to the risk I ran; though a nice girl at the point where the gun was mentioned would have expressed alarm.  Anyhow, at the end you might have said something more sympathetic than merely, ‘Tell us another.’  He did not shoot the next party that arrived, for the reason that the very next day his wife, alarmed at what had happened, went up to London and consulted an expert—none too soon, as it turned out.  The poor old fellow died six months later in a private lunatic asylum; I had it from the station-master on passing through the junction again this spring.  The house fell into the possession of his nephew, who is living in it now.  He is a youngish man with a large family, and people have learnt that the place is not for sale.  It seems to me rather a sad story.  The Indian sun, as the station-master thinks, may have started the trouble; but the end was undoubtedly hastened by the annoyance to which the unfortunate gentleman had been subjected; and I myself might have been shot.  The only thing that comforts me is thinking of that fool’s black eye—the fool that sent me there.”  “And none of the other houses,” suggested Dick, “were any good at all?”  “There were drawbacks, Dick,” I explained.  “There was a house in Essex; it was one of the first your mother and I inspected.  I nearly shed tears of joy when I read the advertisement.  It had once been a priory.  Queen Elizabeth had slept there on her way to Greenwich.  A photograph of the house accompanied the advertisement.  I should not have believed the thing had it been a picture.  It was under twelve miles from Charing Cross.  The owner, it was stated, was open to offers.”  “All humbug, I suppose,” suggested Dick.  “The advertisement, if anything,” I replied, “had under-estimated the attractiveness of that house.  All I blame the advertisement for is that it did not mention other things.  It did not mention, for instance, that since Queen Elizabeth’s time the neighbourhood had changed.  It did not mention that the entrance was between a public-house one side of the gate and a fried-fish shop on the other; that the Great Eastern Railway-Company had established a goods depot at the bottom of the garden; that the drawing-room windows looked out on extensive chemical works, and the dining-room windows, which were round the corner, on a stonemason’s yard.  The house itself was a dream.”  “But what is the sense of it?” demanded Dick.  “What do house agents think is the good of it?  Do they think people likely to take a house after reading the advertisement without ever going to see it?”  “I asked an agent once that very question,” I replied.  “He said they did it first and foremost to keep up the spirits of the owner—the man who wanted to sell the house.  He said that when a man was trying to part with a house he had to listen to so much abuse of it from people who came to see it that if somebody did not stick up for the house—say all that could be said for it, and gloss over its defects—he would end by becoming so ashamed of it he would want to give it away, or blow it up with dynamite.  He said that reading the advertisement in the agent’s catalogue was the only thing that reconciled him to being the owner of the house.  He said one client of his had been trying to sell his house for years—until one day in the office he read by chance the agent’s description of it.  Upon which he went straight home, took down the board, and has lived there contentedly ever since.  From that point of view there is reason in the system; but for the house-hunter it works badly.  “One agent sent me a day’s journey to see a house standing in the middle of a brickfield, with a view of the Grand Junction Canal.  I asked him where was the river he had mentioned.  He explained it was the other side of the canal, but on a lower level; that was the only reason why from the house you couldn’t see it.  I asked him for his picturesque scenery.  He explained it was farther on, round the bend.  He seemed to think me unreasonable, expecting to find everything I wanted just outside the front-door.  He suggested my shutting out the brickfield—if I didn’t like the brickfield—with trees.  He suggested the eucalyptus-tree.  He said it was a rapid grower.  He also told me that it yielded gum.  “Another house I travelled down into Dorsetshire to see.  It contained, according to the advertisement, ‘perhaps the most perfect specimen of Norman arch extant in Southern England.’  It was to be found mentioned in Dugdale, and dated from the thirteenth century.  I don’t quite know what I expected.  I argued to myself that there must have been ruffians of only moderate means even in those days.  Here and there some robber baron who had struck a poor line of country would have had to be content with a homely little castle.  A few such, hidden away in unfrequented districts, had escaped destruction.  More civilised descendants had adapted them to later requirements.  I had in my mind, before the train reached Dorchester, something between a miniature Tower of London and a mediæval edition of Ann Hathaway’s cottage at Stratford.  I pictured dungeons and a drawbridge, perhaps a secret passage.  Lamchick has a secret passage, leading from behind a sort of portrait in the dining-room to the back of the kitchen chimney.  They use it for a linen closet.  It seems to me a pity.  Of course originally it went on farther.  The vicar, who is a bit of an antiquarian, believes it comes out somewhere in the churchyard.  I tell Lamchick he ought to have it opened up, but his wife doesn’t want it touched.  She seems to think it just right as it is.  I have always had a fancy for a secret passage.  I decided I would have the drawbridge repaired and made practicable.  Flanked on each side with flowers in tubs, it would have been a novel and picturesque approach.”  “Was there a drawbridge?” asked Dick.  “There was no drawbridge,” I explained.  “The entrance to the house was through what the caretaker called the conservatory.  It was not the sort of house that goes with a drawbridge.”  “Then what about the Norman arches?” argued Dick.  “Not arches,” I corrected him; “Arch.  The Norman arch was downstairs in the kitchen.  It was the kitchen, that had been built in the thirteenth century—and had not had much done to it since, apparently.  Originally, I should say, it had been the torture chamber; it gave you that idea.  I think your mother would have raised objections to the kitchen—anyhow, when she came to think of the cook.  It would have been necessary to put it to the woman before engaging her:—  “‘You don’t mind cooking in a dungeon in the dark, do you?’  “Some cooks would.  The rest of the house was what I should describe as present-day mixed style.  The last tenant but one had thrown out a bathroom in corrugated iron.”  “Then there was a house in Berkshire that I took your mother to see, with a trout stream running through the grounds.  I imagined myself going out after lunch, catching trout for dinner; inviting swagger friends down to ‘my little place in Berkshire’ for a few days’ trout-fishing.  There is a man I once knew who is now a baronet.  He used to be keen on fishing.  I thought maybe I’d get him.  It would have looked well in the Literary Gossip column: ‘Among the other distinguished guests’—you know the sort of thing.  I had the paragraph already in my mind.  The wonder is I didn’t buy a rod.”  “Wasn’t there any trout stream?” questioned Robin.  “There was a stream,” I answered; “if anything, too much stream.  The stream was the first thing your mother noticed.  She noticed it a quarter of an hour before we came to it—before we knew it was the stream.  We drove back to the town, and she bought a smelling-bottle, the larger size.  “It gave your mother a headache, that stream, and made me mad.  The agent’s office was opposite the station.  I allowed myself half an hour on my way back to tell him what I thought of him, and then I missed the train.  I could have got it in if he had let me talk all the time, but he would interrupt.  He said it was the people at the paper-mill—that he had spoken to them about it more than once; he seemed to think sympathy was all I wanted.  He assured me, on his word as a house-agent, that it had once been a trout stream.  The fact was historical.  Isaac Walton had fished there—that was prior to the paper-mill.  He thought a collection of trout, male and female, might be bought and placed in it; preference being given to some hardy breed of trout, accustomed to roughing it.  I told him I wasn’t looking for a place where I could play at being Noah; and left him, as I explained to him, with the intention of going straight to my solicitors and instituting proceedings against him for talking like a fool; and he put on his hat and went across to his solicitors to commence proceedings against me for libel.  “I suppose that, with myself, he thought better of it in the end.  But I’m tired of having my life turned into one perpetual first of April. This house that I have bought is not my heart’s desire, but about it there are possibilities.  We will put in lattice windows, and fuss-up the chimneys.  Maybe we will let in a tablet over the front-door, with a date—always looks well: it is a picturesque figure, the old-fashioned five.  By the time we have done with it—for all practical purposes—it will be a Tudor manor-house.  I have always wanted an old Tudor manor-house.  There is no reason, so far as I can see, why there should not be stories connected with this house.  Why should not we have a room in which Somebody once slept?  We won’t have Queen Elizabeth.  I’m tired of Queen Elizabeth.  Besides, I don’t believe she’d have been nice.  Why not Queen Anne?  A quiet, gentle old lady, from all accounts, who would not have given trouble.  Or, better still, Shakespeare.  He was constantly to and fro between London and Stratford.  It would not have been so very much out of his way.  ‘The room where Shakespeare slept!’ Why, it’s a new idea.  Nobody ever seems to have thought of Shakespeare. There is the four-post bedstead.  Your mother never liked it.  She will insist, it harbours things.  We might hang the wall with scenes from his plays, and have a bust of the old gentleman himself over the door.  If I’m left alone and not worried, I’ll probably end by believing that he really did sleep there.”  “What about cupboards?” suggested Dick.  “The Little Mother will clamour for cupboards.”  It is unexplainable, the average woman’s passion for cupboards.  In heaven, her first request, I am sure, is always, “Can I have a cupboard?” She would keep her husband and children in cupboards if she had her way: that would be her idea of the perfect home, everybody wrapped up with a piece of camphor in his or her own proper cupboard.  I knew a woman once who was happy—for a woman.  She lived in a house with twenty-nine cupboards: I think it must have been built by a woman.  They were spacious cupboards, many of them, with doors in no way different from other doors.  Visitors would wish each other good-night and disappear with their candles into cupboards, staggering out backwards the next moment, looking scared.  One poor gentleman, this woman’s husband told me, having to go downstairs again for something he had forgotten, and unable on his return to strike anything else but cupboards, lost heart and finished up the night in a cupboard.  At breakfast-time guests would hurry down, and burst open cupboard doors with a cheery “Good-morning.” When that woman was out, nobody in that house ever knew where anything was; and when she came home she herself only knew where it ought to have been.  Yet once, when one of those twenty-nine cupboards had to be cleared out temporarily for repairs, she never smiled, her husband told me, for more than three weeks—not till the workmen were out of the house, and that cupboard in working order again.  She said it was so confusing, having nowhere to put her things.  The average woman does not want a house, in the ordinary sense of the word.  What she wants is something made by a genii.  You have found, as you think, the ideal house.  You show her the Adams fireplace in the drawing-room.  You tap the wainscoting of the hall with your umbrella: “Oak,” you impress upon her, “all oak.”  You draw her attention to the view: you tell her the local legend.  By fixing her head against the window-pane she can see the tree on which the man was hanged.  You dwell upon the sundial; you mention for a second time the Adams fireplace.  “It’s all very nice,” she answers, “but where are the children going to sleep?”  It is so disheartening.  If it isn’t the children, it’s the water.  She wants water—wants to know where it comes from.  You show her where it comes from.  “What, out of that nasty place!” she exclaims.  She is equally dissatisfied whether it be drawn from a well, or whether it be water that has fallen from heaven and been stored in tanks.  She has no faith in Nature’s water.  A woman never believes that water can be good that does not come from a water-works.  Her idea appears to be that the Company makes it fresh every morning from some old family recipe.  If you do succeed in reconciling her to the water, then she feels sure that the chimneys smoke; they look as if they smoked.  Why—as you tell her—the chimneys are the best part of the house.  You take her outside and make her look at them.  They are genuine sixteenth-century chimneys, with carving on them.  They couldn’t smoke.  They wouldn’t do anything so inartistic.  She says she only hopes you are right, and suggests cowls, if they do.  After that she wants to see the kitchen—where’s the kitchen?  You don’t know where it is.  You didn’t bother about the kitchen.  There must be a kitchen, of course.  You proceed to search for the kitchen.  When you find it she is worried because it is the opposite end of the house to the dining-room.  You point out to her the advantage of being away from the smell of the cooking.  At that she gets personal: tells you that you are the first to grumble when the dinner is cold; and in her madness accuses the whole male sex of being impractical.  The mere sight of an empty house makes a woman fretful.  Of course the stove is wrong.  The kitchen stove always is wrong.  You promise she shall have a new one.  Six months later she will want the old one back again: but it would be cruel to tell her this.  The promise of that new stove comforts her.  The woman never loses hope that one day it will come—the all-satisfying kitchen stove, the stove of her girlish dreams.  The question of the stove settled, you imagine you have silenced all opposition.  At once she begins to talk about things that nobody but a woman or a sanitary inspector can talk about without blushing.  It calls for tact, getting a woman into a new house.  She is nervous, suspicious.  “I am glad, my dear Dick,” I answered; “that you have mentioned cupboards.  It is with cupboards that I am hoping to lure your mother. The cupboards, from her point of view, will be the one bright spot; there are fourteen of them.  I am trusting to cupboards to tide me over many things.  I shall want you to come with me, Dick.  Whenever your mother begins a sentence with: ‘But now to be practical, dear,’ I want you to murmur something about cupboards—not irritatingly as if it had been prearranged: have a little gumption.”  “Will there be room for a tennis court?” demanded Dick.  “An excellent tennis court already exists,” I informed him.  “I have also purchased the adjoining paddock.  We shall be able to keep our own cow. Maybe we’ll breed horses.”  “We might have a croquet lawn,” suggested Robin.  “We might easily have a croquet lawn,” I agreed.  “On a full-sized lawn I believe Veronica might be taught to play.  There are natures that demand space.  On a full-sized lawn, protected by a stout iron border, less time might be wasted exploring the surrounding scenery for Veronica’s lost ball.”  “No chance of a golf links anywhere in the neighbourhood?” feared Dick.  “I am not so sure,” I answered.  “Barely a mile away there is a pretty piece of gorse land that appears to be no good to anyone.  I daresay for a reasonable offer—”  “I say, when will this show be ready?” interrupted Dick.  “I propose beginning the alterations at once,” I explained.  “By luck there happens to be a gamekeeper’s cottage vacant and within distance. The agent is going to get me the use of it for a year—a primitive little place, but charmingly situate on the edge of a wood.  I shall furnish a couple of rooms; and for part of every week I shall make a point of being down there, superintending.  I have always been considered good at superintending.  My poor father used to say it was the only work I seemed to take an interest in.  By being on the spot to hurry everybody on I hope to have the ‘show,’ as you term it, ready by the spring.”  “I shall never marry,” said Robin.  “Don’t be so easily discouraged,” advised Dick; “you are still young.”  “I don’t ever want to get married,” continued Robin.  “I should only quarrel with my husband, if I did.  And Dick will never do anything—not with his head.”  “Forgive me if I am dull,” I pleaded, “but what is the connection between this house, your quarrels with your husband if you ever get one, and Dick’s head?”  By way of explanation, Robin sprang to the ground, and before he could stop her had flung her arms around Dick’s neck.  “We can’t help it, Dick dear,” she told him.  “Clever parents always have duffing children.  But we’ll be of some use in the
