HILDEGARD, _a noble Lombard maiden_.                                SCENE, VERONA.                               _Time_, June 573     ACT I.          _A hall in the Palace_: _a curtain drawn midway across it_.                       _Enter_ ALBOVINE _and_ NARSETES.                                  ALBOVINE.     This is no matter of the wars: in war    Thy king, old friend, is less than king of thine,    And comrade less than follower.  Hast thou loved    Ever—loved woman, not as chance may love,    But as thou hast loved thy sword or friend—or me?    Thou hast shewn me love more stout of heart than death.    Death quailed before thee when thou gav’st me life,    Borne down in battle.                                  NARSETES.     Woman?  As I love    Flowers in their season.  A rose is but a rose.                                  ALBOVINE.     Dost thou know rose from thistle or bindweed?  Man,    Speak as our north wind speaks, if harsh and hard—    Truth.                                  NARSETES.     White I know from red, and dark from bright,    And milk from blood in hawthorn-flowers: but not    Woman from woman.                                  ALBOVINE.     How should God our Lord,    Except his eye see further than his world?    For women ever make themselves anew,    Meseems, to match and mock the maker.  Friend,    If ever I were friend of thine in fight,    Speak, and I bid thee not speak truth: I know    Thy tongue knows nought but truth or silence.                                  NARSETES.     Is it    A king’s or friend’s part, king, to bid his friend    Speak what he knows not?  Speak then thou, that I    May find thy will and answer it.                                  ALBOVINE.     I am fain    And loth to tell thee how it wrings my heart    That now this hard-eyed heavy southern sun    Hath wrought its will upon us all a year    And yet I know not if my wife be mine.                                  NARSETES.     Thy meanest man at arms had known ere dawn    Blinked on his bridal birthday.                                  ALBOVINE.     Did I bid thee    Mock, and forget me for thy friend—I say not,    King?  Is thy heart so light and lean a thing,    So loose in faith and faint in love?  I bade thee    Stand to me, help me, hold my hand in thine    And give my heart back answer.  This it is,    Old friend and fool, that gnaws my life in twain—    The worm that writhes and feeds about my heart—    The devil and God are crying in either ear    One murderous word for ever, night and day,    Dark day and deadly night and deadly day,    Can she love thee who slewest her father?  I    Love her.                                  NARSETES.     Thy wife should love thee as thy sire’s    Loved him.  Thou art worth a woman—heart for heart.                                  ALBOVINE.     My sire’s wife loved him?  Hers he had not slain.    Would God I might but die and burn in hell    And know my love had loved me!                                  NARSETES.     Is thy name    Babe?  Sweet are babes as flowers that wed the sun,    But man may be not born a babe again,    And less than man may woman.  Rosamund    Stands radiant now in royal pride of place    As wife of thine and queen of Lombards—not    Cunimund’s daughter.  Hadst thou slain her sire    Shamefully, shame were thine to have sought her hand    And shame were hers to love thee: but he died    Manfully, by thy mightier hand than his    Manfully mastered.  War, born blind as fire,    Fed not as fire upon her: many a maid    As royal dies disrobed of all but shame    And even to death burnt up for shame’s sake: she    Lives, by thy grace, imperial.                                  ALBOVINE.     He or I,    Her lord or sire, which hath most part in her,    This hour shall try between us.                              _Enter_ ROSAMUND.                                  ROSAMUND.     Royal lord,    Thy wedded handmaid craves of thee a grace.                                  ALBOVINE.     My sovereign bids her bondman what she will.                                  ROSAMUND.     I bid thee mock me not: I may ask thee    Aught, and be heard of any save my lord.                                  ALBOVINE.     Go, friend.                                                          [_Exit_ NARSETES.]     Speak now.  Say first what ails thee?                                  ROSAMUND.     Me?                                  ALBOVINE.     Thy voice was honey-hearted music, sweet    As wine and glad as clarions: not in battle    Might man have more of joy than I to hear it    And feel delight dance in my heart and laugh    Too loud for hearing save its own.  Thou rose,    Why did God give thee more than all thy kin    Whose pride is perfume only and colour, this?    Music?  No rose but mine sings, and the birds    Hush all their hearts to hearken.  Dost thou hear not    How heavy sounds her note now?                                  ROSAMUND.     Sire, not I.    But sire I should not call thee.                                  ALBOVINE.     Surely, no.    I bade thee speak: I did not bid thee sing:    Thou canst not speak and sing not.                                  ROSAMUND.     Albovine,    I had at heart a simple thing to crave    And thought not on thy flatteries—as I think not    Now.  Knowest thou not my handmaid Hildegard    Free-born, a noble maiden?                                  ALBOVINE.     And a fair    As ever shone like sundawn on the snows.                                  ROSAMUND.     I had at heart to plead for her with thee.                                  ALBOVINE.     Plead? hast thou found her noble maidenhood    Ignobly turned unmaidenlike?  I may not    Lightly believe it.                                  ROSAMUND.     Believe it not at all.    Wouldst thou think shame of me—lightly?  She loves    As might a maid whose kin were northern gods    The fairest-faced of warriors Lombard born,    Thine Almachildes.                                  ALBOVINE.     If he loves not her,    More fool is he than warrior even, though war    Have wakened laughter in his eyes, and left    His golden hair fresh gilded, when his hand    Had won the crown that clasps a boy’s brows close    With first-born sign of battle.                                  ROSAMUND.     No such fool    May live in such a warrior; if he love not    Some loveliness not hers.  No face as bright    Crowned with so fair a Mayflower crown of praise    Lacked ever yet love, if its eyes were set    With all their soul to loveward.                                  ALBOVINE.     Ay?                                  ROSAMUND.     I know not    A man so fair of face.  I like him well.    And well he hath served and loves thee.                                  ALBOVINE.     Ay?  The boy    Seems winsome then with women.                                  ROSAMUND.     Hildegard    Hath hearkened when he spake of love—it may be,    Lightly.                                  ALBOVINE.     To her shall no man lightly speak.    Thy maiden and our natural kin is she.    Wilt thou speak with him—lightly?                                  ROSAMUND.     If thou wilt,    Gladly.                                  ALBOVINE.     The boy shall wait upon thy will.                                                                    [_Exit_.                                  ROSAMUND.     My heart is heavier than this heat that weighs    With all the weight of June on us.  I know not    Why.  And the feast is close on us.  I would    This night were now to-morrow morn.  I know not    Why.                             _Enter_ ALMACHILDES.     Ah!  What would you?                                 ALMACHILDES.     Queen, our lord the king    Bade me before thee hither.                                  ROSAMUND.     Truth: I know it.    Thou art loved and honoured of our lord the king.    Dost thou, whom honour loves before thy time,    Love?                                 ALMACHILDES.     Ay: thy noble handmaid, Hildegard.    I know not if she love me.                                  ROSAMUND.     Thou shalt know.    But this thou knowest: I may not give thee her.                                 ALMACHILDES.     I would not take her from the Lord God’s hand    If hers were given against her will to mine.                                  ROSAMUND.     A man said that: a manfuller than men    Who grip the loveless hands of prisoners.  Well    It must be with the bride whose happier hand    Lies fond and fast in thine.  Our Hildegard,    Being free and noble as Albovine and we,    Born one with us in race and blood, and thence    Our equal in our sole nobility,    Must well be won by noble works, and love    Whose light is one with honour’s.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Queen, may I    Perchance not win it?  I know not.                                  ROSAMUND.     Nay, nor I.    Soon may we know; they are entering toward the feast.  [_The curtain drawn discovers a banquet_, _with guests assembled_: _among them_ NARSETES _and_ HILDEGARD.                             _Re-enter_ ALBOVINE.                                  ALBOVINE.     Thine hand: I hold the whitest in the world.    Sit thou, boy, there, beside sweet Hildegard.                                                                [_They sit_.     Bring me the cup.  Queen, thou shalt pledge with me    A health to all this kingdom and its weal    Even from the bowl that here to hold in hand    Assures me lord of Lombardy and thine    By right and might of battle and of God—    The skull that was thy father’s: so shalt thou    Drink to me with thy father.                                  ROSAMUND.     Sire, my lord,    The life my sire, who gave thee up his life,    Gave me, and fostered till thou hadst given him death,    Is all now thine.  Thy will be done.  I drink    To thee, who art all this kingdom and its weal,    All health and honour that of right should be,    With all good things I wish thee.                                                                  [_Drinks_.                                  ALBOVINE.     Wish me well,    And God must give me what thou wilt.  Good friends,    My warriors and my brethren, hath not he    Given me to wife the best one born of man    And loveliest, and most loving?  Silent, sirs?    Wherefore?                                  ROSAMUND.     Thou shouldst not ask it.  Bid the cup    Go blithely round.                                  ALBOVINE.     By Christ and Thor, it shall.    What ails the boy there?  Almachildes!                                 ALMACHILDES.     King,    Nought ails me.                                  ALBOVINE.     Nor thy maiden?                                 ALMACHILDES.     King, nor her.                                  ALBOVINE.     Fall then to feasting.  Bear the cup away.    Some savour of the dust of death comes from it.    Sweet, be not wroth nor sad.                                  ROSAMUND.     I am blithe and fain,    Sire; and I loved thee never more than now.                                  ALBOVINE.     Nor ever I thee.  Now I find thee mine,    And now no daughter of mine enemy’s.                                  ROSAMUND.     No.    Thou hast no enemy left on earth alive—    No soul unslain that hates thee.                                  ALBOVINE.     That were much.    What man may say it? and least of all may kings.                                  ROSAMUND.     What hast thou done that man should hate thee—man    Or woman?                                  ALBOVINE.     Which of us may answer, Nought?                                  ROSAMUND.     Thou might’st have made me—me, my father’s child—    Harlot and slave: thou hast made me wife and queen.                                  ALBOVINE.     Thee have I loved; ay, and myself in thee,    Who hast made me more than king and lord, being thine.                                  ROSAMUND.     Courtesy sets on kings a goldener crown    That sits upon them seemlier.                                  ALBOVINE.     Courtesy!    Truth.  Hark thee, boy, and let thy Hildegard    Hearken.  Is she, thy queen, a peer of mine?                                 ALMACHILDES.     She wears no crown but heaven’s about her head—    No gold that was not born upon her brows    Transfigures or disfigures them.  She is not    A peer of thine.                                  ROSAMUND.     He answers well.                                  ALBOVINE.     He answers    Ill—as the spirit of shamelessness might speak.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Shameless are they that lie.  I lie not.                                  ALBOVINE.     Boy,    Tempt not the rod.                                 ALMACHILDES.     The rod that man may wield    No man may fear: the slave who fears it is not    Man.                                  ALBOVINE.     Art thou crazed with wine?                                 ALMACHILDES.     Am I thy king?                                  ALBOVINE.     My thrall thou knowest thou art not, or thy tongue    Durst challenge not mine anger.                                  ROSAMUND.     Thrall and free,    Woman and man, yea, queen and king, are born    More wide apart than earth or hell and heaven.    Sirs, let no wrangling breath distune the peace    That shines and glows about us, and discerns    A banquet from a battle.  Thou, my lord,    Hast bidden away the dust of death which fell    Between us at thy bidding, and is now    Nothing—a dream blown out at waking.  Thou,    My lord’s young chosen of warriors, be not wroth,    Albeit thy wrath be noble, though my lord    See fit to try my love as gold is tried    By fire: it burns not thee.  Strike hand in hand:    Ye have done so after battle.                                  ALBOVINE.     Drink again.    I pledge thee, boy.                                 ALMACHILDES.     I pledge thee, king.                                  ROSAMUND.     My lord,    I am weary at heart, and fain would sleep.  Forgive me    That I can sit no more.                                  ALBOVINE.     What ails thee?                                  ROSAMUND.     Nought.    The hot and heavy time of year has bound    About my brows a band of iron.  Sire,    Thou wouldst not see me sink aswoon, and mar    The raptures of thy revel.                                  ALBOVINE.     Get thee hence.    Go.  God be with thee.                                  ROSAMUND.     God abide with thee.                                                    [_Exit with attendants_.                                  ALBOVINE.     This is no feast: I will no more of it.  Boy,    Take note, and tempt not so thy bride, albeit    She tempt thee to the trial.                                 ALMACHILDES.     I shall not, king,                                  ALBOVINE.     She will not.  Sirs, good night—if night may be    Good.  Hardly may the day be, here.  And yet    For you it may be—Hildegard and thee.    God give you joy.                                 ALMACHILDES.     God give thee comfort, king.                                                                  [_Exeunt_.     ACT II.                      _A room in the Queen’s apartments_.                              _Enter_ ROSAMUND.                                  ROSAMUND.     I am yet alive to question if I live    And wonder what may ever bid me die.    But live I will, being yet not dead with thee,    Father.  Thou knowest in Paradise my heart.    I feel thy kisses breathing on my lips,    Whereto the dead cold relic of thy face    Was pressed at bidding of thy slayer last night,    And yet they were not withered: nay, they are red    As blood is—blood but newly spilt—not thine.    How good thou wast and sweet of spirit—how dear,    Father!  None lives that knew thee now save one,    And none loves me but thou nor thee but I,    That was till yesternight thy daughter: now    That very name is tainted, and my tongue    Tastes poison as I speak it.  There is nought    Left in the range and record of the world    For me that is not poisoned: even my heart    Is all envenomed in me.  Death is life,    Or priesthood lies that swears it: then I give    The man my husband and thy homicide    Life, if I slay him—the life he gave thee.                              _Enter_ HILDEGARD.     Girl,    I sent for thee, I think: stand near me.  Child,    Thou art fairer than thou knowest, I doubt: thou art fair    As the awless maidenhood of morning: truth    Should live upon thy lips, though truth were dead    On all men’s tongues and women’s born save thine.    Dawn lies not when it laughs on us.  Thy queen    I am not now: thy friend I would be.  Tell    Thy friend if love sleep or awake in thee    Toward any man.  Thou art silent.  Tell me this,    Dost thou not think, where thought scarce knows itself—    Think in the subtle sense too deep for thought—    That Almachildes loves thee?                                  HILDEGARD.     More than I    Love Almachildes.                                  ROSAMUND.     Thus a maid should speak.    Dost thou love me?                                  HILDEGARD.     Thou knowest it, queen.                                  ROSAMUND.     It lies    Now in thy power to show me more of love    Than ever yet hath man or woman.  Swear,    If thou dost love me, thou wilt show it.                                  HILDEGARD.     I swear.                                  ROSAMUND.     By all our fathers’ great forsaken gods    Who smiled on all their battles, and by him    Who clomb or crept or leapt upon their throne    And signed us Christian, swear it, then.                                  HILDEGARD.     I swear.                                  ROSAMUND.     What if I bid thee give thyself to shame—    Yield up thy soul and body—play such parts    As shameless fame records of women crowned    Imperial in the tale of lust and Rome?                                  HILDEGARD.     Thou couldst not bid me do it.                                  ROSAMUND.     Thou hast sworn.                                  HILDEGARD.     I have sworn.    Queen, I would do it, and die.                                  ROSAMUND.     Thou shalt not.  Yet    This must thou do, and live.  Thou shalt not be    Shamed.  Thou shalt bid thine Almachildes come    And speak with thee by nightfall.  Say, the queen    Will give not up the maiden so beloved    —And truth it is, I love thee—willingly    To the arms of one her husband loves: but were it    Shame, utter shame, that he should wed not her,    The shamefast queen could choose not.  Then shall he    Plead.  Then shalt thou turn gentler than the snow    That softens at the strong sun’s kiss, and yield.    But needs must night be close about your love    And darkness whet your kisses.  Light were death.    Hast thou no heart to guess now?  Fear not then.    Not thou but I must put on shame.  I lack    A hand for mine to grasp and strike with.  His    I have chosen.                                  HILDEGARD.     I see but as by lightning.  Queen,    What should I do but warn the king—or him?                                  ROSAMUND.     Thou hast sworn.  I hold thee by thy word.                                  HILDEGARD.     My Christ,    Help me!                                  ROSAMUND.     No God can break thine oath in twain    And leave thee less than perjured.  Thou must bid him    Make thee to-night his bride.                                  HILDEGARD.     I could not say it.                                  ROSAMUND.     Thou shalt, or God shall smite thee down to hell.    What, art thou godless?                                  HILDEGARD.     Art not thou?                                  ROSAMUND.     Not I.    I find him just and gracious, girl: he gives me    My right by might set fast on thine and thee.                                  HILDEGARD.     For love of mercy, queen—for honour’s sake,    Bid me not shame myself before a man—    The man I love—who gives me back at least    Honour, if love he gives not.                                  ROSAMUND.     Ay, my maid?    And yet he loves thee, or thy maiden thought    Errs with no gracious error, more than thou    Him?                                  HILDEGARD.     Art thou woman born, to cast me back    My maiden shame for shame upon my face?    I would not say I loved him more than man    Loved ever woman since the light of love    Lit them alive together.  Let us be.                                  ROSAMUND.     I will not.  Mine are both by God’s own gift.    I will not cast it from me.  Ye may live    Hereafter happy: never now shall I.                                  HILDEGARD.     Have mercy.  Nay, I cannot do it.  And thou,    Albeit thine heart be hot with hate as hell,    Couldst say not, nor fold round with fairer speech,    Those foul three words the Egyptian woman said    Who tempted and could tempt not Joseph.                                  ROSAMUND.     No.    He would not hearken.  Joseph loved not her    More than thine Almachildes me.  But thou    Shalt.  Now no more may I debate with thee.    Go.                                  HILDEGARD.     God requite thee!                                  ROSAMUND.     That shall he and I,    Not thou, make proof of.  If I plead with him,    I crave of God but wrong’s requital.  Go.                                                          [_Exit_ HILDEGARD.     And yet, God help me!  Can I do it?  God’s will    May no man thwart, or leave his righteousness    Baffled.  I would not say, ‘My will be done,’    Were God’s will not for righteousness as mine,    If right be righteous, wrong be wrong, must be.    How else may God work wrong’s requital?  I    Must be or none may be his minister.    And yet what righteousness is his to cast    Athwart my way toward right this wrong to me,    A sin against the soul and honour?  Why    Must this vile word of _yet_ cross all my thought    Always, a drifting doom or doubt that still    Strikes up and floats against my purpose?  God,    Help me to know it!  This weapon chosen of me,    This Almachildes, were his face not fair,    Were not his fame bright—were his aspect foul,    His name dishonourable, his line through life    A loathing and a spitting-stock for scorn,    Could I do this?  Am I then even as they    Who queened it once in Rome’s abhorrent face    An empress each, and each by right of sin    Prostitute?  All the life I have lived or loved    Hath been, if snows or seas or wellsprings be,    Pure as the spirit of love toward heaven is—chaste    As children’s eyes or mothers’.  Though I sinned    As yet my soul hath sinned not, Albovine    Must bear, if God abhor unrighteousness,    The weight of penance heaviest laid on sin,    Shame.  Not on me may shame be set, though hell    Take hold upon me dying.  I would the deed    Were done, the wreak of wrath were wroken, and I    Dead.                              _Enter_ ALBOVINE.                                  ALBOVINE.     Art thou sick at heart to see me?                                  ROSAMUND.     No.                                  ALBOVINE.     Thou art sweet and wise as ever God hath made    Woman.  I would not turn thine heart from me    Or set thy spirit against the sense of mine    For more than Rome’s old empire.                                  ROSAMUND.     That, albeit    Thou wouldst, be sure thou canst not.  God nor man    Could wake within me toward my lord the king    A new strange love or loathing.  Fear not this.                                  ALBOVINE.     From thee can I fear nothing.  Now I know    How high thy heart is, and how true to me.                                  ROSAMUND.     Thou knowest it now.                                  ALBOVINE.     I know not if I should    Repent me, or repent not, that I tried    A heart so high so sorely—proved so true.                                  ROSAMUND.     Do not repent.  I would not have thee now    Repent.                                  ALBOVINE.     By Christ, if God forbade it not,    I would have said within mine own fool’s heart,    Of all vile things that fool the soul of man    The vilest and the priestliest hath to name    Repentance.  Could it blot one hour’s work out,    A wise thing and a manful thing it were,    And profit were it none for priests to preach.    This will I tell thee: what last night befell    Rejoices not but irks me.                                  ROSAMUND.     Let it not    Rejoice nor irk thee.  Vex thou not thy soul    With any thought thereon, if none may bid thee    Rejoice: and that were harsh and hard of heart.                                  ALBOVINE.     I will not.  Queen and wife, hell durst not say    I do not love thee.                                  ROSAMUND.     Heaven has heard—and I.                                  ALBOVINE.     Forget then all this foolishness, and pray    God may forget it.                                  ROSAMUND.     God forgets as I.                                                           [_Exit_ ALBOVINE.     And had repentance helped him?  Shall I think    It might have molten in my burning heart    The thrice-retempered iron of resolve?    Yet well it is to know that penitence    Lies further from that frozen heart of his    Than mercy from the tiger’s.  Ay, God knows,    I had scorned him too had penitence bowed him down    Before me: now I do but hate.  I am not    Abased as wholly, so supremely shamed,    As though I had wedded one as hard as he    Who yet might think to soften down with words    What hardly might be cleansed with tears of blood,    The monumental memory graven on steel    That burns the naked spirit of sense within me    Like the ardent sting of keen-edged ice, which makes    The naked flesh feel fire upon it.                             _Enter_ ALMACHILDES.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Queen,    I come to crave a word of thee.                                  ROSAMUND.     I hear.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Thou knowest I love thy noble Hildegard:    And rather would I give my soul to burn    Than wrong in thought her flawless maidenhood.    And now she hath told me what I dare not think    Truth.  And I dare not think her lips may lie.                                  ROSAMUND.     I have heard.  And what is this to me?  She hath not    Said—hath not told thee, nor wouldst thou believe—    That I have breathed a lie upon her lips    Or taught them shamelessness by lesson?                                 ALMACHILDES.     No.    But she came forth from thee to me—from thee—    And spake with quivering mouth and quailing eyes    And face whose fire turned ashen, and again    Rekindling from that ashen agony    Flamed, what no heart could think to hear her speak,    Mine least of all, who love her.                                  ROSAMUND.     Ay?                                 ALMACHILDES.     Not she,    I know it as sure as night is known from day    And surelier than I know mine own soul’s truth,    Spake what she spake in broken bursts of breath    Out of her own heart and its love for me.                                  ROSAMUND.     Didst thou so answer her?                                 ALMACHILDES.     I might not well    Answer at all.                                  ROSAMUND.     Poor maid, she hath loved amiss.    Belike she thought to find in thee a man’s    Love.                                 ALMACHILDES.     That she hath found; nought meaner than a man’s;    No wolfish lust of ravenous insolence    To soil and spoil her of her noblest name.                                  ROSAMUND.     I do not ask thee what she said.  I know.                                 ALMACHILDES.     I knew thou didst.                                  ROSAMUND.     To make your bridal sure    She bade thee make thy bride of her to-night.                                 ALMACHILDES.     She bade me as a slave might bid the scourge    Fall.                                  ROSAMUND.     Such a scourge no slave might shrink from; nay,    No free-born woman, Almachildes.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Queen,    I crave thy queenly mercy though I say    My maid, my bride that will be, shrank, and showed    In all the rosebright anguish of her face    A shuddering shame that wrung my heart.  And thou    Hast surely set thereon that seal of shame.    I know it as thou dost.                                  ROSAMUND.     Ay, and more she said,    Surely: she said I would not yield her up    To the arms of one my husband loves and holds    Honoured at heart—I hate my husband so,    She told thee—were the need avoidable    Save by her sacrifice to shame.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Thou knowest    All, as I knew, and lacked not from thy lips    Confession.                                  ROSAMUND.     Warrior though thou be, and boy    Though my lord call thee, brainless art thou not—    No sword with man’s face carven on the heft    For mockery more than truth or help in fight.    I do not and I durst not play with thee.    Thy bride spake truth: I knew not she might need    So much of truth to tempt thee toward her.  Now    Thou knowest, and I know.  If this imminent night    Make not thy darkling bride of her, by day    Thy bride she may be never.  She hath sworn.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Why wouldst thou shame her?                                  ROSAMUND.     Shamed she cannot be    If thou be found not shameless.  Plead no more    Against thine own love’s surety.  Doubt thou not    I wish thee well, and love her.  Make not thou    Out of her shamefast maidenhood and fear    A sword to cleave your happiness in twain.    What if some oath constrain me, sworn in haste,    Infrangible for shame’s sake, sealed in heaven    Inevitable?  Ask now no more of me.    Nightfall is here upon us.  Nought on earth    May set the season of your bridal back    If thou be true as she must.  Wait awhile    Here till a sign be sent thee—till a bell    Strike softly from this chamber here at hand.    I have sworn to her she shall not see thy face,    So sore she prayed she might not: and for thee    I swore that ere the darkling air grew grey    Thou shouldst arise and leave her, and behold    Thy midnight bride but when thou art bidden again    To meet her here to-morrow.  Strange it were,    More strange than aught of all, that thou shouldst prove    Dishonourable: and except thou be, these things    Must all be wrought in this wise, lest her oath    And mine, at peril of her soul and life,    By passionate forgetfulness of thine    Disloyally be broken.  Swear to us now    Thou wilt not break our oath and thine, or think    To look to-night upon thy bride.                                 ALMACHILDES.     I swear.                                  ROSAMUND.     I take thine oath.  I bid not thee take heed    That I or thou or each of us at once,    Couldst thou play false, may die: I bid thee think    Thy bride will die, shamed.  Swear me not again    She shall not: all our trust is set on thee.    What eyes and ears are keen about us here    Thou knowest not.  Love, my love and thine for her,    Shall deafen and shall blind them.  Be but thou    A bridegroom blind and dumb—speak soft as love,    And ask not answer louder than a sigh—    And when to-morrow sets thy bride and thee    Here face to face again, thy soul shall stand    Amazed: thy joy shall turn to wonder.  This    Thy queen, whose power may seal her promise fast,    Swears for thine oath again to thee.  Good night.                                                                    [_Exit_.                                 ALMACHILDES.     I cannot think I live.  Our Sigurd loved not    Brynhild as I love her, and even this hour    Shall make us great as they.  No spell to break,    No fire to pass, divides us.  Blind and dumb,    Love knows, would I be ever while I live    For love’s sake rather than forego the joy    That makes one godlike power of spirit and sense,    One godhead born of manhood.  God requite    The queen who loves my love and cares for me    Thus!  How may man or God requite her?  Ah!                                          [_Bell rings softly from without_.     There sounds the note that opens heaven on me,    And how should man dare heaven?  But love may dare.                                                                    [_Exit_.     ACT III.                       _An eastward room in the Palace_.                              _Enter_ ALBOVINE.                                  ALBOVINE.     This sun—no sun like ours—burns out my soul.    I would, when June takes hold on us like fire,    The wind could waft and whirl us northward: here    The splendour and the sweetness of the world    Eat out all joy of life or manhood.  Earth    Is here too hard on heaven—the Italian air    Too bright to breathe, as fire, its next of kin,    Too keen to handle.  God, whoe’er God be,    Keep us from withering as the lords of Rome—    Slackening and sickening toward the imperious end    That wiped them out of empire!  Yea, he shall.                              _Enter_ HILDEGARD.                                  HILDEGARD.     The queen would wait upon your majesty.                                  ALBOVINE.     Bid her come in.  And tell her ere she come    I wait upon her will.                                                         [_Exit_ HILDEGARD.]     What would she now?                              _Enter_ ROSAMUND.     By Christ, how fair thou art!  I never saw thee    So like the sun in heaven: no rose on earth    Might think to match thee.                                  ROSAMUND.     All I am is thine.                                  ALBOVINE.     Mine?  God might come from heaven to worship thee.    Thine eyes outlighten all the stars: thy face    Leaves earth no flower to worship.                                  ROSAMUND.     How should earth    Worship her children?  Nought it is in me,    My lord’s dear love it is, that makes me seem    Fair.                                  ALBOVINE.     How thou liest thou knowest not.  Rosamund,    What hast thou done to be so beautiful?                                  ROSAMUND.     The sun has left thine eyes half blind.                                  ALBOVINE.     I dare not    Kiss thee, or stare straight-eyed against the sun.                                  ROSAMUND.     Kiss me.  Who knows how long the lord of life    May spare us time for kissing?  Life and love    Are less than change and death.                                  ALBOVINE.     What ghosts are they?    So sweet thou never wast to me before.    The woman that is God—the God that is    Woman—the sovereign of the soul of man,    Our fathers’ Freia, Venus crowned in Rome,    Has lent my love her girdle; but her lips    Have robbed the red rose of its heart, and left    No glory for the flower beyond all flowers    To bid the spring be glad of.                                  ROSAMUND.     Summer and spring    May cleanse and heal the heart of man no more    Than winter may, or withering autumn.  Sire,    Husband and lord, I have a woful word    To speak against a man beloved of thee,    A man well worth all glory man may give—    Against thine Almachildes.                                  ALBOVINE.     Has the boy    Transgressed again in awless heat of speech    And kindled wrath in thee against him—thee,    Who stood’st between my wrath and him?                                  ROSAMUND.     I would    His were no more transgression than of speech.    He hath wronged—I bid thee ask of me no more—    A noble maiden.  Till her shame be healed,    Her name is dead upon my lips and his,    Who is yet not all ignoble.                                  ALBOVINE.     He shall die    Except he wed her, and she will to wed.                                  ROSAMUND.     That surely will she.                                  ALBOVINE.     Bid him hither.                                  ROSAMUND.     See,    There strides he through the sunshine toward the shade.    How light and high he steps!  He sees thee.  Bid him—    Beckon him in.                                  ALBOVINE.     He knows mine eye.  He comes.                                  ROSAMUND.     Obedient as a hound is.                                  ALBOVINE.     As a man    That knows the law of loyal manhood.                                  ROSAMUND.     Ay?    God send it be so.                             _Enter_ ALMACHILDES.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Queen and king, I am here.    What would you?                                  ALBOVINE.     Truth.  Hast thou not borne thyself    Toward any soul on earth disloyally    Ever?                                 ALMACHILDES.     Never.                                  ALBOVINE.     I would not say thou liest.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Do not: the lie should burn thy lips up, king.                                  ALBOVINE.     Thou hast wrought no wrong toward man or woman?                                 ALMACHILDES.     None.                                  ALBOVINE.     Speak thou: thou hast heard him answer me.                                  ROSAMUND.     I have heard.    No wrong it may be with the serfs of hell    To cast upon a woman for a curse    Shame: to defile the spirit and shrine of love,    Put out the sunlike eyes of maidenhood    And leave the soul dismantled.  Has not he    So sinned?—Hast thou wrought no such work as this?    The king has heard thy silence.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Queen and king,    I have done no wrong, but right.  I have chosen my bride,    And made her mine by gentle grace of hers    Lest wrong should come between us.  Now no man    May think to unwed us: king nor queen may cross    This wedded love of ours: no thwart or stay    May sunder us till heaven and earth turn hell.                                  ALBOVINE.     I deemed not thee dishonourable: and thy queen    Now knows thee true as I did.  Rosamund,    Forgive and give him back his bride.                                  ROSAMUND.     I will,    King.                                  ALBOVINE.     Boy, thy queen hath shown thee grace; be thou    Thankful.  I leave thee here to yield her thanks.                                                                    [_Exit_.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Queen, I would die to serve and thank thee.                                  ROSAMUND.     Die?    So young and glad and glorious?  Thou shalt not    Die.  Was thy bride’s face bright to look upon    When last night’s moon and stars illumined it?                                 ALMACHILDES.     Thou knowest I might not look upon it.                                  ROSAMUND.     No.    Thou hast never loved before?                                 ALMACHILDES.     I have loathed, not loved,    The loveless harlots clasped of all the camp:    I have followed wars and visions all my days    Even till my love’s eyes lit and stung to life    The soul within my body.  Till I loved,    I knew not woman.                                  ROSAMUND.     Now thou knowest.  This love    Is no good lord—no gentle god—no soft    Saviour.  Thou knowest perchance thy bride’s name—hers    Whose body and soul were one but now with thine?                                 ALMACHILDES.     How should not I?  What darkling light is this    That burns and broods and lightens in thine eyes,    Queen?                                  ROSAMUND.     Hildegard it was not.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Art not thou—    Or am not I—sun-smitten through the brain    By this mad might of midsummer?  Who was it    That slept or slept not with me while the night    Was more than noon and more than heaven?  What name    Was hers who made me godlike?                                  ROSAMUND.     Rosamund.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Thine? was it thou?  It was not.                                  ROSAMUND.     It was I.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Does the sun stand in heaven?  Or stands it fast    As when God bade it halt on high?  My life    Is broken in me.                                  ROSAMUND.     Nay, fair sir, not yet.    Thy life is now mine—as the ring I wear    That seals my hand a wife’s.  Die thou shalt not,    But slay, and live.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Slay whom?                                  ROSAMUND.     Thy lord and mine.                                 ALMACHILDES.     I had rather go down quick to hell.                                  ROSAMUND.     I know it.    I leave thee not the choice.  Keep thou thy hand    Bloodless, and Hildegard, whom yet I love,    Dies, and in fire, the harlot’s death of shame.    Last night she lured thee hither.  Hate of me,    Because of late I smote her, being in wrath    Forgetful of her noble maidenhood,    Stung her for shame’s sake to take hands with shame.    This if I swear, may she unswear it?  Thou    Canst not but say she bade thee seek her.  She    Lives while I will, as Albovine and thou    Live by my grace and mercy.  Live, or die.    But live thou shalt not longer than her death,    Her death by burning, if thou slay not him.    I see my death shine in thine eyes: I see    My present death inflame them.  That were not    Her surety, Almachildes.  Thou shouldst know me    Now.  Though thou slay me, this may save not her.    My lines are laid about her life, and may not    By breach of mine be broken.                                 ALMACHILDES.     God must be    Dead.  Such a thing as thou could never else    Live.                                  ROSAMUND.     That concerns not thee nor me.  Be thou    Sure that my will and power to serve it live.    Lift now thine eyes to look upon thy lord.                             _Re-enter_ ALBOVINE.                                  ALBOVINE.     By this time hath he thanked thee not enough?                                  ROSAMUND.     More hath he given than thanks.                                  ALBOVINE.     What more may be?                                  ROSAMUND.     His plighted faith to heal the wrong he wrought    Faithfully.                                  ALBOVINE.     Boy, strike then thy hand in mine.    Thou art loyal as I knew thee.                                 ALMACHILDES.     King, I may not    Touch hands with thee.                                  ALBOVINE.     Thou art false, then, ha?  Thou hast lied?                                 ALMACHILDES.     King, till the wrong I have wrought be wreaked or healed    I clasp not hands with honour.  Nay, and then    Perchance I may not.                                  ALBOVINE.     Boy I called thee: child    I call thee now.  But, boy, the child thou art    Is noble as our sires.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Would God it were!                                                                    [_Exit_.                                  ALBOVINE.     What ails him?                                  ROSAMUND.     Love and shame.                                  ALBOVINE.     No more than these?                                  ROSAMUND.     Enough are they to darken death and life.                                  ALBOVINE.     Thou art less than gentle towards his love and him.                                  ROSAMUND.     I would not speak ungently.  Her I love,    Poor child, and him I hate not.                                  ALBOVINE.     Thou shalt live    To love him too.                                  ROSAMUND.     This heaviness of heat    Kills love and hate and life in me.  I know not    Aught lovesome save the sweet brief death of sleep.                                  ALBOVINE.     I am weary as thou.  Good night we may not say—    Good noon I bid thee.  Sleep shall heal us.                                  ROSAMUND.     Ay;    No healing and no help for life on earth    Hath God or man found out save death and sleep.                                                                  [_Exeunt_.     ACT IV.                               _The same Scene_.                     _Enter_ ALMACHILDES _and_ HILDEGARD.                                  HILDEGARD.     Hast thou forgiven me?                                 ALMACHILDES.     I have not forgiven    God.                                  HILDEGARD.     Wilt thou slay thy soul and mine?                                 ALMACHILDES.     Wilt thou    Madden me?  God hath given us up to her    Who is deadlier than the fiery fang of death—    Us, innocent and loyal.                                  HILDEGARD.     Nay, if I    Forgive her love of thee—though this be hard,    Canst thou forgive not?                                 ALMACHILDES.     Sweet, for thee and me    Remains no rescue save by death or flight    From worse than flight or death is.                                  HILDEGARD.     Worse is nought    But shame: and how may shame take hold on us,    On us who have sinned not?  Me she bound to play thee    False, and betray thee to her arms: I might not    Choose, though my heart should rend itself in twain    And cleave with ravenous anguish: yet I live.    Vex not thy soul too sorely: me, not her,    Thy spirit embraced, thine arms and lips made thine    Me, not my darkling wraith, my changeling foe,    My thief of love, our traitress.  This I bid thee,    Forget thy fear and shame to have wronged me: night    Breeds treacherous dreams that can but poison day    If thought be found so base a fool as dares    Fear.  Did I doubt thy love of me, I durst not    Live or look back upon thee.                                 ALMACHILDES.     Wilt thou then    Fly?                                  HILDEGARD.     Dost thou know what flight means—thou?    It means    Fear.  And is fear a new-born friend of thine?                                 ALMACHILDES.     God help us! if he live, and hate not man—    If Satan be not God.  We will not fly.                       _Enter_ ALBOVINE _and_ ROSAMUND.                                  ALBOVINE.     Fly?  What should love at height of happiness    Or youth at height of honour fear and fly?    Would ye take wing for heaven? take shame on earth    To wed in peace and honour?                                 ALMACHILDES.     No, my king.    No, surely.                                  ROSAMUND.     Weep not, maiden.  Dost not thou,    Man, that we thought her bridegroom sealed of love,    Love her?                                 ALMACHILDES.     No saint loved ever God as I    Her.                                  ROSAMUND.     And betray her to shame thou wouldst not?    See,    My lord, the silent answer flash aloud    From cheek and eye a goodly witness.  Thou,    My maiden, dost thou love not him?  Nay, speak.                                  HILDEGARD.     I cannot say it—I cannot strive to say.                                  ROSAMUND.     Thou shalt.  Are all we not fast bound in love—    My lord and thine, my maiden and her queen,    A fourfold chain of faith twice linked of love?    Speak: let not shame find place where shame is none.                                  HILDEGARD.     I will not.  King and queen and God shall hear.    I love him as our songs of old time say    Men have been loved of women akin to gods    By blood as they by spirit, albeit in me    Nought lives that woman or man or God could say    Were worth his love, if mine by grace of love    Be found not all unworthy.  Mine am I    No more: mine own in no wise now, but his    To save or slay, to cherish or cast out,    Crown and discrown, abase and comfort.  Shame    Were more to me than honour if his will    It were that shame should clothe me round, and life    Were the only death left fearful if he bade me    Die.  Could his love be turned from me, and set    On one less loving but more fair than I,    A thrall more base than treason or a queen    Too high for shame to brand her shameful, even    Though sin had stamped and signed her foul as fraud    And loathsome as a masked adulterous lie,    Hers would I make him if I might, and yield    To her the hatefullest of hell-born things    The man found lovelier by my love than heaven.                                  ROSAMUND.     Great love is this to brag of: great and strange.                                  HILDEGARD.     Love is no braggart: lust and fraud and hate    Vaunt their vile strength when shame unveils them: love    Vaunts not itself.  I spake not uncompelled,    And blushed not out the avowal.                                  ALBOVINE.     Boy, I he
