Secretarie him selfe, Syr _William Peter_, Syr _J. Mason_,     D. _Wotton_, Syr _Richard Sackuille_ Treasurer of the Exchecker,     Syr _Walter Mildmaye_ Chauncellor of the Exchecker, M.     _Haddon_ Master of Requestes, M. _John Astely_ Master of the     Iewell house, M. _Bernard Hampton_, M. _Nicasius_, and _J_.     Of which number, the most part were of hir Maiesties most     honourable priuie Counsell, and the reast seruing hir in verie     good place.  I was glad than, and do reioice yet to remember,     that my chance was so happie, to be there that day, in the     companie of so manie wise & good men togither, as hardly     than could haue beene piked out againe, out of all England     beside.          M. Secretarie hath this accustomed maner, though his head     be neuer so full of most weightie affaires of the Realme, yet, at     diner time he doth seeme to lay them alwaies aside: and findeth     euer fitte occasion to taulke pleasantlie of other matters,     but most gladlie of some matter of learning: wherein, he will     curteslie heare the minde of the meanest at his Table.          Not long after our sitting doune, I haue strange newes     brought me, sayth M. Secretarie, this morning, that diuerse     Scholers of Eaton, be runne awaie from the     Schole, for feare of beating. Whereupon, M.   //M. _Secreta-_     Secretarie tooke occasion, to wishe, that some     //_rie._       176        _A Præface to the Reader._      more discretion were in many Scholemasters, in vsing correction,     than commonlie there is. Who many times, punishe rather,     the weakenes of nature, than the fault of the Scholer. Whereby,     many Scholers, that might else proue well, be driuen to hate     learning, before they knowe, what learning meaneth: and so,     are made willing to forsake their booke, and be glad to be put     to any other kinde of liuing.          M. _Peter_, as one somewhat seuere of nature, said plainlie,     M. _Peter._ // that the Rodde onelie, was the sworde, that must     keepe, the Schole in obedience, and the Scholer     M. _Wotton._ // in good order. M. _Wotton_, á man milde of nature,     with soft voice, and fewe wordes, inclined to M. Secretaries     iudgement, and said, in mine opinion, the Schole-     Ludus li- // house should be in deede, as it is called by name,     terarum. // the house of playe and pleasure, and not of feare     _Plato_ de // and bondage: and as I do remember, so saith     Rep. 7. // _Socrates_ in one place of _Plato_. And therefore,     if a Rodde carie the feare of à Sworde, it is no maruell, if those     that be fearefull of nature, chose rather to forsake the Plaie,     than to stand alwaies within the feare of a Sworde in a fonde     mans handling. M. _Mason_, after his maner, was     M. _Mason._ // verie merie with both parties, pleasantlie playing,     both, with the shrewde touches of many courste boyes, and with     the small discretion of many leude Scholemasters. M. _Haddon_     was fullie of M. _Peters_ opinion, and said, that     M. _Haddon._ // the best scholemaster of our time, was the     greatest beater, and named the Person. Though, quoth I, it     was his good fortune, to send from his Schole,     The Author of // vnto the Vniuersitie, one of the best Scholers in     this booke. // deede of all our time, yet wise men do thinke,     that that came so to passe, rather, by the great towardnes of the     Scholer, than by the great beating of the Master: and whether     this be true or no, you your selfe are best witnes. I said     somewhat farder in the matter, how, and whie, yong children,     were soner allured by loue, than driuen by beating, to atteyne     good learning: wherein I was the bolder to say my minde,     bicause M. Secretarie curteslie prouoked me thereunto: or else,     in such à companie, and namelie in his præsence, my wonte is,     to be more willing, to vse mine eares, than to occupie my     tonge.       _A Præface to the Reader._        177      Syr _Walter Mildmaye_, M. _Astley_, and the rest, said verie     litle: onelie Syr _Rich. Sackuill_, said nothing at all. After dinner     I went vp to read with the Queenes Maiestie. We red than     togither in the Greke tongue, as I well remember. // Demost.     that noble Oration of _Demosthenes_ against _æschines_, // peri pa-     for his false dealing in his Ambassage to king // rapresb.     _Philip_ of Macedonie. Syr _Rich. Sackuile_ came vp sone after: and     finding me in hir Maiesties priuie chamber, he // Syr _R._     tooke me by the hand, & carying me to à // _Sackuiles_     windoe, said, M. _Ascham_, I would not for à good  // communi-     deale of monie, haue bene, this daie, absent from // cation with     diner. Where, though I said nothing, yet I gaue // the Author     as good eare, and do consider as well the taulke,  // of this     that passed, as any one did there. M. Secretarie said very // booke.     wisely, and most truely, that many yong wittes be driuen to     hate learninge, before they know what learninge is. I can be     good witnes to this my selfe: For à fond Scholemaster, before     I was fullie fourtene yeare olde, draue me so, with feare of     beating, from all loue of learninge, as nowe, when I know, what     difference it is, to haue learninge, and to haue litle, or none at     all, I feele it my greatest greife, and finde it my greatest hurte,     that euer came to me, that it was my so ill chance, to light     vpon so lewde à Scholemaster. But seing it is but in vain, to     lament thinges paste, and also wisdome to looke to thinges to     cum, surely, God willinge, if God lend me life, I will make     this my mishap, some occasion of good hap, to litle _Robert     Sackuile_ my sonnes sonne. For whose bringinge vp, I would     gladlie, if it so please you, vse speciallie your good aduice. I     heare saie, you haue à sonne, moch of his age: we wil deale thus     togither. Point you out à Scholemaster, who by your order,     shall teache my sonne and yours, and for all the rest, I will     prouide, yea though they three do cost me a couple of hundred     poundes by yeare: and beside, you shall finde me as fast à     Frend to you and yours, as perchance any you haue. Which     promise, the worthie Ientleman surelie kept with me, vntill his     dying daye.          We had than farther taulke togither, of bringing vp of     children: of the nature, of quicke, and hard wittes:  // The cheife     of the right choice of à good witte: of Feare, and  // pointes of     loue in teachinge children. We passed from // this booke.       178        _A Præface to the Reader._      children and came to yonge men, namely, Ientlemen: we     taulked of their to moch libertie, to liue as they lust: of their     letting louse to sone, to ouer moch experience of ill, contrarie to     the good order of many good olde common welthes of the     Persians and Grekes: of witte gathered, and good fortune     gotten, by some, onely by experience, without learning. And     lastlie, he required of me verie earnestlie, to shewe, what I     thought of the common goinge of Englishe men into Italie.     But, sayth he, bicause this place, and this tyme, will not suffer     so long taulke, as these good matters require, therefore I pray     you, at my request, and at your leysure, put in some order of     writing, the cheife pointes of this our taulke, concerning the     right order of teachinge, and honestie of liuing, for the good     bringing vp of children & yong men. And surelie, beside     contentinge me, you shall both please and profit verie many     others. I made some excuse by lacke of habilitie, and weakenes     of bodie: well, sayth he, I am not now to learne, what you can     do.  Our deare frende, good M. _Goodricke_, whose iudgement I     could well beleue, did once for all, satisfye me fullie therein.     Againe, I heard you say, not long agoe, that you may thanke     Syr _John Cheke_, for all the learninge you haue: And I know     verie well my selfe, that you did teach the Quene. And     therefore seing God did so blesse you, to make you the Scholer     of the best Master, and also the Scholemaster of the best     Scholer, that euer were in our tyme, surelie, you should please     God, benefite your countrie, & honest your owne name, if you     would take the paines, to impart to others, what you learned     of soch à Master, and how ye taught such à scholer. And, in     vttering the stuffe ye receiued of the one, in declaring the     order ye tooke with the other, ye shall neuer lacke, neither     matter, nor maner, what to write, nor how to write in this     kinde of Argument.          I beginning some farther excuse, sodeinlie was called to     cum to the Queene. The night following, I slept litle, my     head was so full of this our former taulke, and I so mindefull,     somewhat to satisfie the honest request of so deare à frend,     I thought to præpare some litle treatise for a New yeares gift     that Christmas. But, as it chanceth to busie builders, so, in     building thys my poore Scholehouse (the rather bicause the forme     of it is somewhat new, and differing from others) the worke       _A Præf ace to the Reader._         179      rose dailie higher and wider, than I thought it would at the     beginninge.          And though it appeare now, and be in verie deede, but a     small cotage, poore for the stuffe, and rude for the workemanship,     yet in going forward, I found the site so good, as I was lothe to     giue it ouer, but the making so costlie, outreaching my habilitie,     as many tymes I wished, that some one of those three, my deare     frendes, with full pursses, Syr _Tho. Smithe_, M. // {_Smith._     _Haddon_, or M. _Watson_, had had the doing of it. // M. {_Haddon._     Yet, neuerthelesse, I my selfe, spending gladlie // {_Watson._     that litle, that I gatte at home by good Syr _Iohn_ // Syr_ I._     _Cheke_, and that that I borrowed abroad of my // _Cheke._     frend _Sturmius_, beside somewhat that was left me // _I. Sturmius._     in Reuersion by my olde Masters, _Plato, Aristotle_, // _Plato._     and _Cicero_, I haue at last patched it vp, as I could, // _Aristotle._     and as you see. If the matter be meane, and meanly handled, // _Cicero._     I pray you beare, both with me, and it: for neuer worke went     vp in worse wether, with mo lettes and stoppes, than this poore     Scholehouse of mine. Westminster Hall can beare some     witnesse, beside moch weakenes of bodie, but more trouble of     minde, by some such sores, as greue me to toche them my     selfe, and therefore I purpose not to open them to others.     And, in middes of outward iniuries, and inward cares, to     encrease them withall, good Syr _Rich. Sackuile_     dieth, that worthie Ientleman: That earnest // Syr _R._     fauorer and furtherer of Gods true Religion: // _Sackuill._     That faithfull Seruitor to his Prince and Countrie: A louer of     learning, & all learned men: Wise in all doinges: Curtesse to     all persons: shewing spite to none: doing good to many: and as     I well found, to me so fast à frend, as I neuer lost the like     before. Whan he was gone, my hart was dead. There was     not one, that woare à blacke gowne for him, who caried à     heuier hart for him, than I. Whan he was gone, I cast this     booke àwaie: I could not looke vpon it, but with weping eyes,     in remembring him, who was the onelie setter on, to do it, and     would haue bene, not onelie à glad commender of it, but also     à sure and certaine comfort, to me and mine, for it. Almost     two yeares togither, this booke lay scattered, and neglected,     and had bene quite giuen ouer of me, if the goodnesse of one     had not giuen me some life and spirite againe. God, the      180        _A Præface to the Reader._      mouer of goodnesse, prosper alwaies him & his, as he hath     many times comforted me and mine, and, I trust to God, shall     comfort more and more. Of whom, most iustlie I may saie,     and verie oft, and alwaies gladlie, I am wont to say, that     sweete verse of _Sophocles_, spoken by _Oedipus_ to worthie _Theseus_.      Soph. in // echo [gar] acho dia se, kouk allon broton.     Oed. Col. //      Thys hope hath helped me to end this booke: which, if he     allowe, I shall thinke my labours well imployed, and shall not     moch æsteme the misliking of any others. And I trust, he     shall thinke the better of it, bicause he shall finde the best part     thereof, to cum out of his Schole, whom he, of all men loued     and liked best.          Yet some men, frendly enough of nature, but of small     iudgement in learninge, do thinke, I take to moch paines, and     _Plato_ in // spend to moch time, in settinge forth these     initio // childrens affaires.   But those good men were     Theagis. //  neuer brought vp in _Socrates_ Schole, who saith     ou gar esti //  plainlie, that no man goeth àbout à more godlie     peri otou //  purpose, than he that is mindfull of the good     theioterou // bringing vp, both of hys owne, and other mens     anthropos // children.     an bouleu- //     saito, e //       Therfore, I trust, good and wise men, will     peri pai-  // thinke well of this my doing. And of other, that     deias, kai // thinke otherwise, I will thinke my selfe, they are     ton auton, // but men, to be pardoned for their follie, and     kai ton // pitied for their ignoraunce.     oikeion. //          In writing this booke, I haue had earnest respecte to three     speciall pointes, trothe of Religion, honestie in liuing, right order     in learning. In which three waies, I praie God, my poore     children may diligently waulke: for whose sake, as nature     moued, and reason required, and necessitie also somewhat     compelled, I was the willinger to take these paines.          For, seing at my death, I am not like to leaue them any     great store of liuing, therefore in my life time, I thought good     to bequeath vnto them, in this litle booke, as in my Will and     Testament, the right waie to good learning: which if they     followe, with the feare of God, they shall verie well cum to     sufficiencie of liuinge.          I wishe also, with all my hart, that yong M. _Rob. Sackuille_,       _A Præface to the Reader._        181      may take that fructe of this labor, that his worthie Grauntfather     purposed he should haue done: And if any other do take, either     proffet, or pleasure hereby, they haue cause to thanke M.     _Robert Sackuille_, for whom speciallie this my Scholemaster was     prouided.          And one thing I would haue the Reader consider in     readinge this booke, that bicause, no Scholemaster hath charge     of any childe, before he enter into hys Schole, therefore I     leauing all former care, of their good bringing vp, to wise and     good Parentes, as à matter not belonging to the Scholemaster,     I do appoynt thys my Scholemaster, than, and there to begin,     where his office and charge beginneth. Which charge lasteth     not long, but vntill the Scholer be made hable to go to the     Vniuersitie, to procede in Logike, Rhetoricke, and other kindes     of learning.          Yet if my Scholemaster, for loue he beareth to hys     Scholer, shall teach hym somewhat for hys furtherance,     and better iudgement in learning, that may serue     him seuen yeare after in the Vniuersitie, he     doth hys Scholer no more wrong, nor de-     serueth no worse name therby, than he     doth in London, who sellinge silke     or cloth vnto his frend, doth     giue hym better measure,     than either hys pro-     mise or bargaine     was.                               _Farewell in Christ._       _The first booke for the youth._      AFter the childe hath learned perfitlie the eight partes of     speach, let him then learne the right ioyning togither of     substantiues with adiectiues, the nowne with the verbe, the     relatiue with the antecedent.  And in learninge farther hys     Syntaxis, by mine aduice, he shall not vse the common order     in common scholes, for making of latines: wherby, the childe     _Cic._ de // commonlie learneth, first, an euill choice of wordes,     Cla. or. // (and right choice of wordes, saith _Cæsar_, is the     foundation of eloquence) than, a wrong placing     of wordes: and lastlie, an ill framing of the sentence, with     a peruerse iudgement, both of wordes and sentences.  These     Making of // faultes, taking once roote in yougthe, be neuer, or     Lattines // hardlie, pluckt away in age.  Moreouer, there is     marreth // no one thing, that hath more, either dulled the     Children. // wittes, or taken awaye the will of children from     learning, then the care they haue, to satisfie their masters, in     making of latines.          For, the scholer, is commonlie beat for the making, when     the master were more worthie to be beat for the mending, or     rather, marring of the same: The master many times, being     as ignorant as the childe, what to saie properlie and fitlie to the     matter.          Two scholemasters haue set forth in print, either of them     _Horman._ // a booke, of soch kinde of latines, _Horman_ and     _Whitting-_ // _Whittington_.     _ton._ //          A childe shall learne of the better of them,     that, which an other daie, if he be wise, and cum to iudgement,     he must be faine to vnlearne againe.       _The first booke for the youth._     183           There is a waie, touched in the first booke of _Cicero     De Oratore_, which, wiselie brought into scholes, // 1. _De Or._     truely taught, and constantly vsed, would not     onely take wholly away this butcherlie feare in making of     latines, but would also, with ease and pleasure, and in short     time, as I know by good experience, worke a true choice and     placing of wordes, a right ordering of sentences, an easie     vnderstandyng of the tonge, a readines to speake, a facultie to     write, a true iudgement, both of his owne, and other mens     doinges, what tonge so euer he doth vse.          The waie is this.  After the three Concordances learned,     as I touched before, let the master read vnto hym the Epistles     of _Cicero_, gathered togither and chosen out by _Sturmius_, for     the capacitie of children.          First, let him teach the childe, cherefullie and plainlie, the     cause, and matter of the letter: then, let him     construe it into Englishe, so oft, as the childe may // The order     easilie carie awaie the vnderstanding of it: // of teaching.     Lastlie, parse it ouer perfitlie.  This done thus, let the childe,     by and by, both construe and parse it ouer againe: so, that it     may appeare, that the childe douteth in nothing, that his     master taught him before.  After this, the childe must take     a paper booke, and sitting in some place, where no man shall     prompe him, by him self, let him translate into Englishe his     former lesson.  Then shewing it to his master,     let the master take from him his latin booke, and // Two pa-     pausing an houre, at the least, than let the childe // per bokes.     translate his owne Englishe into latin againe, in an other paper     booke.  When the childe bringeth it, turned into latin, the     master must compare it with _Tullies_ booke, and laie them both     togither: and where the childe doth well, either in chosing, or     true placing of _Tullies_ wordes, let the master // Children     praise him, and saie here ye do well.

But if the childe misse, either in forgetting a worde, or in     chaunging a good with a worse, or misordering the sentence,     I would not haue the master, either froune, or chide with him,     if the childe haue done his diligence, and vsed no trewandship       184     _The first booke teachyng_      therein.  For I know by good experience, that a childe shall     Ientlenes // take more profit of two fautes, ientlie warned of,     in teaching. // then of foure thinges, rightly hitt.  For than, the     master shall haue good occasion to saie vnto him.     _N. Tullie_ would haue vsed such a worde, not this: _Tullie_     would haue placed this word here, not there: would haue vsed     this case, this number, this person, this degree, this gender: he     would haue vsed this moode, this tens, this simple, rather than     this compound: this aduerbe here, not there: he would haue     ended the sentence with this verbe, not with that nowne or     participle, etc.          In these fewe lines, I haue wrapped vp, the most tedious     part of Grammer: and also the ground of almost all the Rewles,     that are so busilie taught by the Master, and so hardlie learned     by the Scholer, in all common Scholes: which after this sort,     the master shall teach without all error, and the scholer shall     learne without great paine: the master being led by so sure     a guide, and the scholer being brought into so plaine and easie     a waie.  And therefore, we do not contemne Rewles, but we     gladlie teach Rewles: and teach them, more plainlie, sensiblie,     and orderlie, than they be commonlie taught in common     Scholes.  For whan the Master shall compare _Tullies_ booke     with his Scholers translation, let the Master, at the first,     lead and teach his Scholer, to ioyne the Rewles of his Grammer     booke, with the examples of his present lesson, vntill the     Scholer, by him selfe, be hable to fetch out of his Grammer,     euerie Rewle, for euerie Example: So, as the Grammer booke     be euer in the Scholers hand, and also vsed of him, as a     Dictionarie, for euerie present vse.  This is a liuely and perfite     waie of teaching of Rewles: where the common waie, vsed in     common Scholes, to read the Grammer alone by it selfe, is     tedious for the Master, hard for the Scholer, colde and vn-     cumfortable for them bothe.          Let your Scholer be neuer afraide, to aske you any dout,     but vse discretlie the best allurements ye can, to encorage him     to the same: lest, his ouermoch fearinge of you, driue him     to seeke some misorderlie shifte: as, to seeke to be helped     by some other booke, or to be prompted by some other     Scholer, and so goe aboute to begile you moch, and him selfe     more.       _the brynging vp of youth._     185           With this waie, of good vnderstanding the mater, plaine     construinge, diligent parsinge, dailie translatinge, cherefull     admonishinge, and heedefull amendinge of faultes: neuer     leauinge behinde iuste praise for well doinge, I would haue the     Scholer brought vp withall, till he had red, & translated ouer y^e     first booke of Epistles chosen out by _Sturmius_, with a good     peece of a Comedie of _Terence_ also.          All this while, by mine aduise, the childe shall vse to speake     no latine: For, as _Cicero_ saith in like mater, with like wordes,     _loquendo, male loqui discunt_.  And, that excellent // Latin     learned man, _G. Budæus_, in his Greeke Com- // speakyng.     mentaries, sore complaineth, that whan he began // _G. Budæus._     to learne the latin tonge, vse of speaking latin at the table, and     elsewhere, vnaduisedlie, did bring him to soch an euill choice of     wordes, to soch a crooked framing of sentences, that no one     thing did hurt or hinder him more, all the daies of his life     afterward, both for redinesse in speaking, and also good iudge-     ment in writinge.          In very deede, if children were brought vp, in soch a house,     or soch a Schole, where the latin tonge were properlie and     perfitlie spoken, as _Tib._ and _Ca. Gracci_ were brought vp, in     their mother _Cornelias_ house, surelie, than the dailie vse of     speaking, were the best and readiest waie, to learne the latin     tong.  But, now, commonlie, in the best Scholes in England,     for wordes, right choice is smallie regarded, true proprietie     whollie neglected, confusion is brought in, barbariousnesse is     bred vp so in yong wittes, as afterward they be, not onelie     marde for speaking, but also corrupted in iudgement: as with     moch adoe, or neuer at all, they be brought to right frame     againe.          Yet all men couet to haue their children speake latin: and     so do I verie earnestlie too.  We bothe, haue one purpose: we     agree in desire, we wish one end: but we differ somewhat in     order and waie, that leadeth rightlie to that end.  Other would     haue them speake at all aduentures: and, so they be speakinge,     to speake, the Master careth not, the Scholer knoweth not,     what.  This is, to seeme, and not to bee: except it be, to be     bolde without shame, rashe without skill, full of words without     witte.  I wish to haue them speake so, as it may well appeare,     that the braine doth gouerne the tonge, and that reason leadeth       186     _The first booke teachyng_      forth the taulke.  _Socrates_ doctrine is true in _Plato_, and well     _Plato._ // marked, and truely vttered by _Horace_ in _Arte_     _Horat._ // _Poetica_, that, where so euer knowledge doth accom-     panie the witte, there best vtterance doth alwaies     awaite vpon the tonge: For, good vnderstanding must first be bred     Much wri- // in the childe, which, being nurished with skill, and     tyng bree- // vse of writing (as I will teach more largelie     deth ready // hereafter) is the onelie waie to bring him to     speakyng. // iudgement and readinesse in speakinge: and that     in farre shorter time (if he followe constantlie the trade of this     litle lesson) than he shall do, by common teachinge of the     common scholes in England.          But, to go forward, as you perceiue, your scholer to goe     better and better on awaie, first, with vnderstanding his lesson     more quicklie, with parsing more readelie, with translating     more spedelie and perfitlie then he was wonte, after, giue him     longer lessons to translate: and withall, begin to teach him,     The second // both in nownes, & verbes, what is _Proprium_, and     degree and // what is _Translatum_, what _Synonymum_, what     order in // _Diuersum_, which be _Contraria_, and which be     teachyng. // most notable _Phrases_ in all his lecture.

I do gladlie agree with all good Scholemasters in these     pointes: to haue children brought to good perfitnes in learning:     to all honestie in maners: to haue all fautes rightlie amended:     to haue euerie vice seuerelie corrected: but for the order and     waie that leadeth rightlie to these pointes, we somewhat differ.

For whan the scholemaster     is angrie with some other matter, then will he sonest faul to     beate his scholer: and though he him selfe should be punished     for his folie, yet must he beate some scholer for his pleasure:     though there be no cause for him to do so, nor yet fault in the     scholer to deserue so.  These ye will say, be fond scholemasters,     and fewe they be, that be found to be soch.  They be fond in     deede, but surelie ouermany soch be found euerie where.  But     Nature // this I will say, that euen the wisest of your great     punished. // beaters, do as oft punishe nature, as they do     correcte faultes.  Yea, many times, the better     nature, is sorer punished: For, if one, by quicknes of witte,     take his lesson readelie, an other, by hardnes of witte, taketh it     not so speedelie: the first is alwaies commended, the other is     commonlie punished: whan a wise scholemaster, should rather     discretelie consider the right disposition of both their natures,     and not so moch wey what either of them is able to do now,     Quicke // as what either of them is likelie to do hereafter.     wittes for // For this I know, not onelie by reading of bookes     learnyng. // in my studie, but also by experience of life,     abrode in the world, that those, which be commonlie the     wisest, the best learned, and best men also, when they be olde,     were neuer commonlie the quickest of witte, when they were     yonge.  The causes why, amongst other, which be many, that     moue me thus to thinke, be these fewe, which I will recken.     Quicke wittes commonlie, be apte to take, vnapte to keepe:     soone hote and desirous of this and that: as colde and sone       _the brynging vp of youth._     189      wery of the same againe: more quicke to enter spedelie, than     hable to pearse farre: euen like ouer sharpe tooles, whose edges     be verie soone turned.  Soch wittes delite them selues in easie     and pleasant studies, and neuer passe farre forward in hie and     hard sciences.  And therefore the quickest wittes commonlie     may proue the best Poetes, but not the wisest Orators: readie     of tonge to speake boldlie, not deepe of iudgement, // Quicke     either for good counsell or wise writing.  Also, // wittes, for     for maners and life, quicke wittes commonlie, be,  // maners &     in desire, newfangle, in purpose, vnconstant, light // lyfe.     to promise any thing, readie to forget euery thing: both benefite     and inurie: and therby neither fast to frend, nor fearefull to foe:     inquisitiue of euery trifle, not secret in greatest affaires: bolde,     with any person: busie, in euery matter: sothing, soch as be     present: nipping any that is absent: of nature also, alwaies,     flattering their betters, enuying their equals, despising their     inferiors: and, by quicknes of witte, verie quicke and readie, to     like none so well as them selues.          Moreouer commonlie, men, very quicke of witte, be also,     verie light of conditions: and thereby, very readie of disposition,     to be caried ouer quicklie, by any light cumpanie, to any riot     and vnthriftines when they be yonge: and therfore seldome,     either honest of life, or riche in liuing, when they be olde.     For, quicke in witte, and light in maners, be either seldome     troubled, or verie sone wery, in carying a verie heuie purse.     Quicke wittes also be, in most part of all their doinges, ouer-     quicke, hastie, rashe, headie, and brainsicke.  These two last     wordes, Headie, and Brainsicke, be fitte and proper wordes,     rising naturallie of the matter, and tearmed aptlie by the     condition of ouer moch quickenes of witte.  In yougthe also     they be, readie scoffers, priuie mockers, and euer ouer light and     mery.  In aige, sone testie, very waspishe, and alwaies ouer     miserable: and yet fewe of them cum to any great aige, by     reason of their misordered life when they were yong: but     a great deale fewer of them cum to shewe any great counten-     ance, or beare any great authoritie abrode in the world, but     either liue obscurelie, men know not how, or dye obscurelie,     men marke not whan.  They be like trees, that shewe forth,     faire blossoms & broad leaues in spring time, but bring out     small and not long lasting fruite in haruest time: and that       190     _The first booke teachyng_      onelie soch, as fall, and rotte, before they be ripe, and so, neuer,     or seldome, cum to any good at all.  For this ye shall finde     most true by experience, that amongest a number of quicke     wittes in youthe, fewe be found, in the end, either verie     fortunate for them selues, or verie profitable to serue the common     wealth, but decay and vanish, men know not which way:     except a very fewe, to whom peraduenture blood and happie     parentage, may perchance purchace a long standing vpon the     stage.  The which felicitie, because it commeth by others     procuring, not by their owne deseruinge, and stand by other     mens feete, and not by their own, what owtward brag so euer     is borne by them, is in deed, of it selfe, and in wise mens eyes,     of no great estimation.          Some wittes, moderate enough by nature, be many tymes     Som sci- // marde by ouer moch studie and vse of some     ences hurt // sciences, namelie, Musicke, Arithmetick, and     mens wits, // Geometrie.  Thies sciences, as they sharpen mens     and mar // wittes ouer moch, so they change mens maners     mens ma- // ouer sore, if they be not moderatlie mingled, &     ners. //     wiselie applied to som good vse of life.

This is not onelie knowen now by common     experience, but vttered long before by wise mens Iudgement     _Galen._ // and sentence.  _Galene_ saith, moch Musick marreth     _Plato._ // mens maners: and _Plato_ hath a notable place of     the same thing in his bookes _de Rep._ well marked     also, and excellentlie translated by _Tullie_ himself.  Of this     matter, I wrote once more at large, XX. yeare a go, in my booke     of shoting: now I thought but to touch it, to proue, that ouer     moch quicknes of witte, either giuen by nature, or sharpened by     studie, doth not commonlie bring forth, eyther greatest learning,     best maners, or happiest life in the end.          Contrariewise, a witte in youth, that is not ouer dulle,     Hard wits // heauie, knottie and lumpishe, but hard, rough, and     in learning. // though somwhat staffishe, as _Tullie_ wisheth _otium,     quietum, non languidum_: and _negotium cum labore,     non cum periculo_, such a witte I say, if it be, at the first well     handled by the mother, and rightlie smothed and wrought as it       _the brynging vp of youth._     191      should, not ouerwhartlie, and against the wood, by the schole-     master, both for learning, and hole course of liuing, proueth     alwaies the best.  In woode and stone, not the softest, but     hardest, be alwaies aptest, for portrature, both fairest for pleasure,     and most durable for proffit.  Hard wittes be hard to receiue,     but sure to keepe: painefull without werinesse, hedefull without     wauering, constant without newfanglenes: bearing heauie     thinges, thoughe not lightlie, yet willinglie: entring hard     thinges, though not easelie, yet depelie, and so cum to that     perfitnes of learning in the ende, that quicke wittes, seeme in     hope, but do not in deede, or else verie seldome, // Hard wits     euer attaine vnto.  Also, for maners and life, hard // in maners     wittes commonlie, ar hardlie caried, either to // and lyfe.     desire euerie new thing, or else to meruell at euery strange     thinge: and therfore they be carefull and diligent in their own     matters, not curious and busey in other mens affaires: and so,     they becum wise them selues, and also ar counted honest by     others.  They be graue, stedfast, silent of tong, secret of hart.     Not hastie in making, but constant in keping any promise.     Not rashe in vttering, but ware in considering euery matter:     and therby, not quicke in speaking, but deepe of iudgement,     whether they write, or giue counsell in all waightie affaires.     And theis be the men, that becum in the end, both most happie     for themselues, and alwaise best estemed abrode in the world.          I haue bene longer in describing, the nature, the good or ill     successe, of the quicke and hard witte, than perchance som will     thinke, this place and matter doth require.  But // The best     my purpose was hereby, plainlie to vtter, what // wittes dri-     iniurie is offered to all learninge, & to the common // uen from     welthe also, first, by the fond father in chosing, // learnyng,     but chieflie by the lewd scholemaster in beating // to other li-     and driuing away the best natures from learning.  A childe // uyng.     that is still, silent, constant, and somewhat hard of witte, is     either neuer chosen by the father to be made a scholer, or else,     when he commeth to the schole, he is smally regarded, little     looked vnto, he lacketh teaching, he lacketh coraging, he lacketh     all thinges, onelie he neuer lacketh beating, nor any word, that     may moue him to hate learninge, nor any deed that may driue     him from learning, to any other kinde of liuing.          And when this sadde natured, and hard witted child, is bette       192     _The first booke teachyng_      from his booke, and becummeth after eyther student of     Hard wits // the common lawe, or page in the Court, or     proue best // seruingman, or bound prentice to a merchant,     in euery // or to som handiecrafte, he proueth in the ende,     kynde of // wiser, happier and many tymes honester too, than     life. // many of theis quick wittes do, by their learninge.          Learning is, both hindred and iniured to, by the ill choice     of them, that send yong scholers to the vniuersities.  Of whom     must nedes cum all our Diuines, Lawyers, and Physicions.          Thies yong scholers be chosen commonlie, as yong apples be     The ill // chosen by children, in a faire garden about _S._     choice of // _Iames_ tyde: a childe will chose a sweeting, because it     wittes for // is presentlie faire and pleasant, and refuse a Runnet,     learnyng. // because it is than grene, hard, and sowre, whan the     one, if it be eaten, doth breed, both wormes and ill humors:     the other if it stand his tyme, be ordered and kepte as it should, is     holsom of it self, and helpeth to the good digestion of other meates:     Sweetinges, will receyue wormes, rotte, and dye on the tree, and     neuer or seldom cum to the gathering for good and lasting store.          For verie greafe of harte I will not applie the similitude:     but hereby, is plainlie seen, how learning is robbed of hir best     wittes, first by the great beating, and after by the ill chosing     of scholers, to go to the vniuersities.  Whereof cummeth     partelie, that lewde and spitefull prouerbe, sounding to the     greate hurte of learning, and shame of learned men, that, the     greatest Clerkes be not the wisest men.          And though I, in all this discourse, seem plainlie to prefer,     hard and roughe wittes, before quicke and light wittes, both for     learnyng and maners, yet am I not ignorant that som quicknes     of witte, is a singuler gifte of God, and so most rare emonges     men, and namelie such a witte, as is quicke without lightnes,     sharpe without brittlenes, desirous of good thinges without     newfanglenes, diligent in painfull thinges without werisomnes,     and constant in good will to do all thinges well, as I know was     in Syr _Iohn Cheke_, and is in som, that yet liue, in whome all     theis faire qualities of witte ar fullie mette togither.
