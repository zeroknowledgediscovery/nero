Chapter One: Splinters in the Paint

There was a crack in the drywall that someone had tried, poorly, to hide. It had been filled with plaster — too much of it — and unevenly sanded down, so the texture rippled like a tiny, frozen ocean wave. Over that, a swipe of off-white paint, not quite matching the rest of the living room wall, dried in streaks that caught the morning light.

Jude noticed it the moment he walked into the old house on Ashwater Street, even before he saw the sunken sofa, the empty bottles lined up like soldiers on the kitchen counter, or the damp smell of something that had died and had almost — but not quite — been buried. It was the wall that spoke first. It said: Someone messed up, and someone else tried to make it go away.

He stood there, keys still in his hand, the door swinging closed behind him with a soft click. His boots left muddy outlines on the scuffed hardwood, but he didn’t move. He stared at the damaged wall like it had whispered his name.

"Jesus," came a voice from deeper in the house. "I told her to get that fixed before the inspection."

A woman appeared, barefoot and thin as a line sketch. Her name was Melinda, and she was his cousin — technically — though neither of them liked the word. Her hair was tied up with a pencil, and she held a mug that read Ask Me If I Care in peeling red letters.

Jude raised an eyebrow. "You rent this out or keep it as a haunted Airbnb?"

Melinda sipped her coffee. "Funny. You’re funny. And no, I don’t rent it. This was her place."

"Whose?"

She looked at him like he should’ve known. "Eleanor."

Jude blinked. "Eleanor's dead."

"Yeah," Melinda said. "And that’s why you’re here."

He turned back to the wall. Something behind the damage prickled at him, not fear exactly — more like discomfort, like a smell you can’t place but know is wrong. “She lived here?”

“Since March. After the last time she tried rehab.”

Jude didn’t ask how that had gone. The answer was in the silence, and in the crack, and in the scattered things Eleanor had left behind. A blanket half off the couch. Cigarette butts in a teacup. A single black shoe near the hallway like someone had walked out of it and never come back.

“She left a note,” Melinda said.

Jude finally turned to her. “What kind of note?”

“The kind that doesn’t help.”

Melinda walked back into the kitchen, and he followed. The floor creaked under her weight but not his. She moved like someone who lived with ghosts, someone who knew where they stepped.

“It was tucked under the coffeemaker,” she said, lifting a torn envelope from the windowsill. “In case you ever came back.”

He took the paper from her. The handwriting was unmistakably Eleanor’s — shaky, elegant, weirdly neat. One sentence.

They’re under the stairs. I couldn’t burn them.

That was it.

Jude read it twice. Then a third time.

He looked up slowly. “You didn’t…?”

“I haven’t touched anything,” Melinda said. “I don’t want to know what she meant. I figured if it was meant for you, you’d handle it.”

Jude opened the side door to the hallway. There were only three steps leading down to the narrow basement. The light was out. Dust floated in the air like it was underwater.

It took effort to walk down those stairs. The wood gave a protesting groan under each foot. At the bottom, it was cold and smelled of rust and old books. The walls were cement, unfinished. A laundry machine sat in the corner, long dead.

Under the stairs, behind a crooked plywood panel, he found a small cardboard box. Taped shut. But badly.

Just like the wall.

He peeled it open.

Inside: photographs. Hundreds of them. Some Polaroids, some glossy, others matte. Some bent at the corners like they’d been handled too often.

All of them were of people he didn’t know.

All of them had their eyes scratched out.

Jude didn’t breathe for a moment. A low thud echoed from upstairs — maybe Melinda dropping her mug. Or maybe not. He didn’t move.

He took a photo from the pile. A man sitting on a bench. Gray coat. Autumn leaves. His eyes had been gouged out with something sharp.

Another: a woman laughing near a pond. Eyes: slashed.

He looked through them faster now, fingers trembling. A child on a swing, blurred in motion. An old man in a wheelchair. A waitress at a diner, arms mid-gesture. Eyes, eyes, eyes — all missing. As if Eleanor couldn’t bear to see them anymore.

Or couldn’t bear them seeing her.

Jude sat back on the floor. His breath fogged in the cold air.

In the very bottom of the box was something else — a cassette tape.

He turned it over in his hands. On the label, in faint pencil, was one word:

“Don’t.”

He took it anyway.

Later that night, Jude sat in the motel room on the edge of town. The tape lay on the nightstand like a small animal waiting to bite. The TV was on, but the sound was low, just a murmur of news anchors pretending they knew what the hell they were talking about.

He didn’t have a cassette player, not anymore, but Melinda had given him one — dug it out of her attic like a relic from another life. It sat on the dresser now, plugged in and humming faintly.

He inserted the tape.

Pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then breathing.

Then a voice.

"Eleanor?" he said out loud, to no one.

The voice on the tape was hers. But not the version he remembered from childhood, or from the last time he’d seen her in rehab, skeletal and angry. This version was soft. Careful.

“They said they’d stop if I gave them what they wanted. But they never said what that was. I tried… I tried to burn the photos, but the smoke— it came out wrong. I couldn’t stay in the house. Not alone. Not when the walls started… watching.”

A sound followed — like something scratching inside the recorder itself.

“I thought it was just the pills. That I was slipping. But Jude, if you hear this— please don’t open the box. Don’t look at them. They find you that way. Through the eyes.”

He reached forward, stopping the tape.

He felt sick.

The photos were in the trunk of his car. Wrapped in an old towel. He’d meant to throw them out on the way to the motel but hadn’t. Couldn’t.

His eyes drifted to the window. The motel parking lot was empty except for his car, and a black sedan parked three spaces down.

He hadn’t noticed it before.

He stared at the car for a long time.

Then the lights turned on. No engine sound. Just lights.

The motel phone rang.

He didn’t answer.

It rang again.

And again.

Then stopped.

The light in the bathroom flickered once.

Then went out.

Jude stood up. Heart thudding. He looked at the cassette player.

The tape had ejected itself.

It lay on the floor now, snapped in half.

The plastic curled like a smile.

Jude didn’t sleep.

He lay on the stiff motel bed, eyes fixed to the cracked plaster ceiling, counting the ticks of the wall clock like a ritual. Every second brought a new shadow shifting in the corner of his eye. He told himself it was exhaustion. Just exhaustion. But he didn’t believe it.

Outside, the parking lot remained empty except for the sedan. Its lights were off now, windows dark, unmoving. But Jude knew it was still out there. Not just the car — something else. Something watching.

By 4 a.m., he’d wrapped the towel tighter around the box of photographs and shoved it under the bathroom sink. It didn’t help. The air in the room was thick with something he couldn’t name. Not quite dread — more like static. As though the room itself had stopped breathing.

He remembered Eleanor’s voice on the tape. How soft it had been. How sure.

“They find you that way. Through the eyes.”

He closed his eyes and saw nothing but flashes of white light behind his lids, like the afterimage of a camera flash.

The next morning, he drove back to Ashwater Street with the box still in the trunk, determined to bury it. Somewhere deep. Somewhere the light wouldn’t reach.

The sky was a dull slate, the air sticky with impending rain. Melinda wasn’t there when he returned. A note on the door said she’d gone to “pick up supplies” — whatever that meant. Probably liquor. Or sage.

He didn’t go inside. Instead, he popped the trunk, grabbed the box, and walked around to the backyard.

The grass hadn’t been cut in weeks. Maybe longer. He passed a rusted swing set, the chains frayed and tangled, and a wooden shed leaning to one side like it had been drunk for years. Behind it, the ground dipped into a patch of brush, thick and wet. He found a spot beneath a cluster of half-dead trees, the soil soft and loamy, and started to dig with an old rusted spade he’d found beside the house.

It took him longer than it should have. Every time the blade struck rock, it jarred up into his elbows. Sweat poured down his back. But he kept going. Deeper. Until the hole was wide enough.

He lowered the box into the earth like he was burying a coffin.

Then he froze.

Just as he reached for the first handful of dirt to cover it, something shifted in the trees. Not a squirrel. Not a breeze. Something heavy. Deliberate.

He didn’t look up.

Instead, he kept burying.

Faster now. Dirt piled onto the box, clumps falling in a rush like his body knew what his mind refused to. His skin crawled. Every hair on his arms stood upright.

Only when the box was completely covered did he finally lift his head.

Nothing.

Just trees. Grass. The wind beginning to rise.

But still, he felt it. A pressure. Like the air had thickened.

He backed away from the grave. Stumbled slightly. Wiped his hands on his jeans. He didn’t look back.

Inside the house, he went to Eleanor’s room. It was smaller than he remembered. Cluttered. The bed sat unmade, still indented where she must have slept last. A journal lay on the nightstand. He flipped through it, past pages of erratic handwriting, doodles, smeared ink.

They're not people. They wear people like clothes.

That line was circled three times.

Another page: Don’t look at mirrors. Don’t trust windows.

And then, lower down, in all caps, IF YOU SEE THEIR EYES IT’S TOO LATE.

Jude shut the journal and backed away.

He opened the closet. Just clothes — moth-eaten sweaters, worn-out boots. But something clinked on the floor. A tape recorder. He picked it up. No tape inside. Dusty.

Then, from behind him, a whisper.

Not a voice — not really. More like breath. Too close to his neck. Too warm.

He spun, fists clenched.

No one.

But the closet door had creaked wider on its hinges.

That night, Melinda came back, her arms full of grocery bags and her face pale.

“I saw it too,” she said, without preamble.

Jude didn’t respond.

“I was driving back from the store. Looked in the rearview. There was something in the back seat. Just for a second.”

“What’d it look like?” he asked quietly.

Melinda set the bags down. “Like it didn’t fit. Like it was wearing someone else’s skin, but wrong.”

“Eyes?”

She nodded, throat working. “They were… backwards. Not just black. Inside out. Like a mirror looking at itself.”

He swallowed.

“I buried the photos,” he said.

Melinda gave a dry laugh. “That’s not going to help. You looked at them, didn’t you?”

He didn’t need to answer.

“I think,” she said slowly, “that this house was just the beginning. Eleanor brought them here, yeah. But they’re not bound to places.”

Jude thought of the sedan. Of the motel. Of the whisper in the closet.

“They’re bound to witnessing,” he said. “To being seen. Or maybe to being noticed.”

Melinda nodded. “I’ve been burning my journals for weeks. Every drawing. Every scrap of a face. If you even sketch them, they know.”

“What do they want?”

“I don’t think they want anything. I think they just are.”

The next few days passed like a fever.

Jude stopped sleeping. He patrolled the house at night, flashlight in hand. The electricity flickered on and off at random. Mirrors stayed covered with towels. Windows remained shut. The black sedan didn’t return — but sometimes, when he stared at the neighbor’s window across the street, he saw his own reflection blink too slowly.

Melinda got worse. She muttered to herself constantly, burned sage until the air was choked with it. She started locking her bedroom door from the inside.

Then, one morning, she was gone.

No note.

No sign of struggle.

Just a single, freshly printed photograph on the kitchen table.

It was Jude, sitting on the motel bed. His back to the camera. The window behind him reflected a face.

Not his.

He tried to leave Ashwater after that.

Packed his car, turned the key.

Nothing.

Engine dead.

Battery full. Gas tank half. But it wouldn’t turn over.

He called for a tow truck. Got static.

No signal.

The sun refused to rise properly that day. The light stayed dim and sickly, like the world had been stained yellow.

He opened the closet again.

The recorder was gone.

The journal, too.

Only one thing left behind — a child’s drawing. Stick figures. A house.

A figure with huge black eyes looming over the roof.

And in the bottom corner, a signature in shaky cursive:

Eleanor.

That night, as the wind howled and the walls moaned in protest, Jude finally saw one of them.

It didn’t knock. Didn’t sneak. It just stood at the foot of his bed, limbs too long, posture too still. Its skin shimmered like oil in water. And its eyes — oh God, its eyes — they had depth, like falling into a well lined with teeth.

He couldn’t look away.

And then it smiled.

Not with its mouth.

With everything.

Chapter Two: The Ashwater Effect

Jude didn’t remember standing up, or walking, or even opening the front door. All he remembered was the cold, and how it settled on his skin like paint left to dry. His shoes were untied. His right sleeve was torn. Somewhere along the way he had stepped in something wet and sticky, but when he looked down there was nothing on the floor.

He wandered into the street like a man sleepwalking, like something had unzipped the back of his skull and rearranged the pieces inside. The sun was up, if you could call it that — more a smear of gray behind the clouds, offering no warmth or comfort, just the fact of day.

No one else was outside.

Not that there had ever been many neighbors on Ashwater Street. Just a few houses, mostly empty now. Yards that had forgotten what grass was supposed to look like. Mailboxes leaning sideways like they’d given up waiting. He passed a house with a boarded-up porch and thought he saw someone watching from behind the slats — a face, smooth and featureless, like a mannequin dipped in milk — but when he blinked, it was gone.

His car still sat dead in the driveway.

The photograph on the kitchen table had curled at the edges. He’d tried to burn it, and it hadn’t caught. Not really. The flames had danced around it but refused to consume. That’s when he’d started to believe it wasn’t just some hallucination. That what was happening had weight. That the photos were part of something deeper.

He pulled out the journal again.

Not Eleanor’s. His own, now.

Just a spiral notebook he’d found in the hall closet. He’d started filling it yesterday, not even sure why — instinct, maybe. Or the same compulsion that had led Eleanor to take those photos in the first place. He didn’t write about what was happening so much as draw it. Shapes that resembled faces but weren’t. Angles that didn’t conform to architecture. He’d started drawing the house itself over and over again, each version slightly warped, the windows wrong, the walls too tall or too short, and something always lurking behind the curtains.

He sat at the kitchen table and began sketching again, hands moving without direction. He didn’t look down until he was finished.

This time, it was Melinda.

Or what was left of her.

Her eyes were scribbled out, same as the photos. But the rest of her face was painfully detailed, right down to the freckle near her jaw and the missing tooth he’d forgotten she had. Her mouth was open, mid-scream. One hand was raised as if to push the viewer away. Behind her, those black smudges — shapes without shape — hovered, indistinct but heavy.

He ripped the page out, crumpled it, shoved it into the trash. Then lit a match and dropped it in after.

It burned.

This time, it did burn.

But the smoke that rose from it wasn’t gray or white.

It was red.

The library was a mistake.

He knew it as soon as he stepped inside.

Ashwater’s public library had once been a church, or maybe a school — some kind of building with too many rooms and not enough light. The ceilings were too high, the shelves too narrow, and the fluorescent lights buzzed with a frequency just shy of audible.

He went there not for answers, exactly, but to escape. He’d hoped the sterile hum of computers and the smell of dust would anchor him back to something real.

But it didn’t. If anything, it made things worse.

The librarian — a tall woman with skin so pale it looked powdered — didn’t speak when he walked in. Just nodded, then turned away, disappearing between the stacks like a ghost wearing orthopedic shoes.

He wandered past the fiction, past history, into the back room where they kept newspapers and town records. Folders sat in rows like gravestones. Some dated back to the 1950s. Most were untouched.

He started digging.

It took him hours. He lost track of time, lost track of the world. But eventually, he found it.

A single article. Yellowed. Folded four times and tucked inside a manila envelope labeled “Unexplained Phenomena.”

“Family of Three Found Dead on Ashwater Street — Eyes Removed Post-Mortem.”

The headline hit him like a slap.

He read the article twice. Then a third time.

The names were different. The year was 1971. But the address was the same. His aunt Eleanor’s house. Back then it belonged to the Marrows — Daniel, Karen, and their daughter Abigail. No signs of forced entry. No fingerprints. Just three bodies, each with their eyes missing. The police had called it a cult killing. No suspects were ever charged.

Someone had underlined the last sentence of the article in red pen.

“Neighbors reported a strange light in the basement window the night before.”

He felt sick.

He turned the page over.

There, scrawled in barely legible pencil, was a phrase.

They come in through the reflection.

Jude didn’t remember standing up.

Didn’t remember knocking over the chair.

Didn’t remember running out of the library.

Only the cold. And the sound — soft, slick — of something dragging itself across the floor behind him.

By the time he got back to the house, the sun had set again.

He was beginning to hate the way dusk felt on this street — like it wasn’t real, just a pause between one nightmare and the next. The house greeted him with silence. The walls no longer creaked. The air no longer moved. It was a tomb.

He avoided the mirrors. Closed the blinds. Taped newspaper over the bathroom mirror just to be safe.

Then he went back to the basement.

The box was still buried. But something had dug it up.

The dirt had been shoveled aside by hands that weren’t his — too long, too narrow. Finger marks trailed across the concrete like scratches from an animal trying to claw its way out.

The box was open.

Empty.

He stood there for a long time.

Then he heard laughter.

Not loud. Not human.

Just a sound — dry, hollow, echoing up through the floorboards.

And it came from upstairs.

Jude didn’t want to go back upstairs. His body resisted the idea like a magnet pushed against another of equal charge. But he couldn’t stay in the basement, not with the open box and the scratches that didn’t belong to anyone with human anatomy. The air down there had taken on a new scent — not rot, not mildew, but something chemical and metallic, like burnt wiring inside flesh. He climbed the stairs slowly, hand trailing the wall, each step louder than the last in the tight silence of the house.

The laughter had stopped by the time he reached the main floor, but the room still carried its echo, not in sound, but in feeling — like the stale breath that lingers after someone has spoken behind you. He stood at the threshold of the living room. The furniture was as he’d left it, sagging and abandoned. Nothing moved, not even the curtain he knew was cracked open behind the sofa. The air was warm here, stifling, like someone had turned on the heat in a house meant to stay cold.

He circled through the kitchen, then the hallway. The bathroom door was open. The mirror he had covered with newspaper was now bare. The paper was gone — no sign of it anywhere, not on the floor, not in the trash. Just the glass, exposed. Waiting.

He didn't look at it.

He stepped back, avoiding the reflection, and reached out to slam the door closed. The mirror caught a sliver of his eye before the door shut, and that was enough. The cold hit him like a punch to the ribs.

Behind his reflection — just for that split second — had been a shadow standing too close. Not Melinda. Not Eleanor. Not anyone he knew. Just a long shape, wearing something that could’ve once been a person, watching him with eyes like smooth black river stones.

He stumbled backward, heart kicking against his ribs. Every part of him screamed for him to leave. But that same deep voice — the one that had always whispered to him during fights or when he stood too close to rooftops — told him to stay. Told him if he ran now, it would follow.

You can’t outrun what lives inside glass.

He walked to the living room window. Drew the curtain shut. Then the next. And the next.

By the time he’d covered every reflective surface he could find — picture frames, television screen, even the glossy tile on the fireplace mantle — he was sweating. The house felt smaller, like its walls had shifted inward, just slightly, but enough to be noticed.

He sank onto the couch and tried to catch his breath. His hands were trembling, but not with fear. Not only fear. It was something else, something colder. A memory surfacing.

He remembered when he was twelve and had stayed with Eleanor for a summer. She’d already started to fray by then — twitching at shadows, unplugging the TV every night, muttering about “them” in the corners. He’d thought it was the pills, or maybe just loneliness. But now he remembered something else — the mirror in the guest room had always been covered with a dark velvet cloth. He’d lifted it once, curious, and seen not himself, but something behind him. Something tall, too dark, with hands like branches.

He’d told Eleanor. She hadn’t yelled.

She had cried.

He hadn’t thought about that day in years.

Now he couldn’t stop.

That night, he dreamed of water. He was underwater, in a lake that stretched forever in every direction. The light above was distant and cold, and around him floated dozens of pale, expressionless faces — men, women, children, all with their eyes open, all staring directly at him.

He swam toward the surface, but it moved farther away.

One of the faces opened its mouth.

Water didn’t pour out. Instead, a voice — familiar — echoed in his ears.

“You looked. That’s all it takes.”

He woke gasping, clawing at his bedsheets, cold sweat gluing his shirt to his back.

The clock on the nightstand read 3:33.

He turned on the lamp.

It didn’t light.

Neither did the overhead bulb.

Power was out.

Something shifted in the hallway — a soft, deliberate footstep.

He reached for the flashlight under his pillow, clicked it on. The beam was weak, dying, but still gave him enough to see the bedroom door was open.

He hadn’t left it that way.

He swung his legs off the bed. Forced himself up.

In the hallway, nothing moved. But the air was charged, like the aftermath of a lightning strike. He passed by the bathroom again. The mirror was bare. He didn’t dare look.

Instead, he turned toward Melinda’s old room.

The door was ajar.

He stepped inside.

The window was open — wide, the curtain fluttering like a limp flag. There were footprints on the sill, muddy and long, leading in, not out. On the bed lay Melinda’s phone, screen cracked. A single text message was open, half-typed.

“don’t let it see you—”

Jude’s breath hitched.

Behind him, the hallway groaned.

He turned.

There was nothing there.

And yet, he knew something had been. Still was.

He retreated to his room, closed the door, braced it with the nightstand. Sat on the floor with his back against the wall. The flashlight flickered once, then died completely.

He didn’t sleep again.

He couldn’t.

The next morning, the power still hadn’t returned. The house was silent. No birds outside, no cars. Nothing but wind and a low, almost imperceptible hum, like a tuning fork vibrating inside his skull.

Jude went into the attic.

He wasn’t sure why — maybe because it was the one place he hadn’t looked. The ladder creaked under his weight. The hatch door above stuck for a moment before groaning open.

The air inside was dry and sharp. Dust stung his throat as he pulled himself up.

The attic was empty except for a single item in the middle of the floor — a mirror, old and oval-shaped, propped against the far wall.

It hadn’t been there before.

He approached it slowly, heart pounding, eyes downcast.

As he drew closer, he could feel heat radiating off the glass. The surface was dark — not reflective, exactly, but almost liquid. Like ink poured onto ice.

He knelt in front of it.

And without meaning to, without choosing, he looked.

The reflection wasn’t his.

It was the house — not as it was, but as it had been. Pristine. Clean. Bright morning sun spilling in through open windows. And people — three of them — sitting around the kitchen table. A man, a woman, and a girl. All smiling. All eyeless.

Their mouths moved.

Jude couldn’t hear the words.

But he saw them.

Again.

And again.

Until the mirror cracked — a hairline fracture straight down the center — and the attic floor buckled beneath him.

He woke up at the bottom of the stairs.

He didn’t remember falling.

But he wasn’t alone.

Something had come down with him.

And it was still in the house.

Jude didn’t stand immediately. The fall had knocked the wind out of him, but it wasn’t just the pain holding him down — it was the awareness of presence. That vague, electric sensation of not being alone, of someone or something watching, maybe even standing right behind him. He fought the urge to turn his head. Instead, he focused on breathing. In. Out. One hand pressed to the floorboards, the other curled into the fabric of his jeans. His legs felt distant, numb with fear or maybe adrenaline.

The air in the hallway had changed. Thicker, dense with the smell of ozone and something else — something like singed hair or burnt sugar. He could hear the soft, clicking noise again, the one he’d heard on the tape, like nails tapping glass in a slow, deliberate rhythm. That same sound had followed him in the motel. In the library. Now it lived here, in the house, close enough to touch.

He finally turned his head.

The hallway was empty. But the shadows clung too tightly to the corners, and the door to the attic creaked slowly shut behind him, without a draft. No one else in the house could have closed it.

He rose, staggered into the nearest room — Melinda’s — and shut the door behind him, wedging an old desk chair beneath the handle. The room still bore the smell of incense, long since burned out. He pulled open the nightstand drawer and found one of her old notebooks, filled with hurried entries in her tight, angular handwriting.

“Time isn’t working properly in the house.”

“Saw Eleanor again last night — but younger, maybe twelve? She looked right through me.”

“Mirrors are doors. Not all of them open, but the ones that do never shut again.”

The last page wasn’t writing. It was a drawing, jagged and frantic. The house, surrounded by dozens of black shapes. Some of the figures hovered in the trees, others crouched on the roof. None of them had faces. The largest of them stood by the front door, arm extended, as if inviting someone inside.

Jude shut the book and backed away. He stared at the window. He hadn’t looked outside in hours — maybe more. Maybe days. He wasn’t sure anymore. Time was beginning to warp inside the walls, just like Melinda said.

He lifted the curtain and peeked through a narrow slit.

Ashwater Street was gone.

Or rather, it had changed.

The houses were there, but they were rotting. Sagging inward. Covered in vines that moved even though the air outside was still. The sky was colorless. The road had turned to a gray slush, like ash soaked in water. And in the middle of the street stood a line of people — unmoving, watching the house.

They were too far to make out clearly, but Jude didn’t need details. He knew what they were.

Witnesses.

The same figures from the photographs, from the mirror, from Eleanor’s voice. They stood in silent vigil, and as he looked, one of them lifted its arm in a slow, broken wave.

He dropped the curtain and stumbled back, heart pounding. The walls of the house groaned again, like they were being pushed inward from outside. The floorboards beneath his feet were no longer steady. He could feel them flexing. Breathing.

The house was no longer a shelter. It was a throat — and he was being swallowed.

At some point, the door behind him opened.

Jude didn’t hear it, didn’t see it.

He just felt it.

Something brushed past him, cold and invisible. A draft without wind. A hand without form. He froze, barely breathing. Then, slowly, he turned back toward the hallway.

A trail of soot-black footprints had appeared on the wood floor, leading toward the basement. They weren’t wet. They didn’t smudge. They were burned into the grain like someone had stepped in fire and walked barefoot through the house.

He followed.

Not because he wanted to, but because there was no alternative. Whatever had been stirred — by the photos, the mirror, the attic — it was awake now. And it had a path. He needed to know where it ended.

The door to the basement was wide open.

It had never opened that far before.

The light switch didn’t work, as usual, but as Jude descended, he noticed that the basement wasn’t dark anymore. A dull red glow radiated from beneath the stairs. Faint, pulsing. The smell was worse now — ash, rust, and something too sweet, like fruit left in a hot car. The kind of smell that stuck to your lungs.

He reached the bottom step and paused.

The wall beneath the stairs had been torn open.

Not cleanly — not with tools — but clawed apart, chunks of plaster and insulation strewn across the floor. Behind the wreckage was a narrow tunnel, dug into the earth itself, the red light seeping from deep within. It pulsed slowly, like a heartbeat.

He dropped to one knee, shining the dying flashlight into the passage.

It went on farther than it should have. Twisting, descending. More of those blackened footprints trailed inside, and scrawled along the walls were symbols — unfamiliar, crude, but repeating. Over and over. A spiral within a triangle. An open eye with a vertical line through the pupil. A set of teeth, wide and grinning.

He should have turned back.

He didn’t.

The tunnel closed behind him as he crawled forward, like the earth itself was moving to trap him inside. The walls tightened the farther he went, until his shoulders scraped against dirt. The light pulsed stronger ahead.

After what could have been minutes or hours, the tunnel opened into a chamber.

Rough-hewn, damp, shaped like a dome. The light came from a single object in the center — an old television, square and boxy, flickering with static.

Around it, figures.

Dozens of them.

Standing motionless, turned toward the screen. Their bodies were indistinct, wrapped in layers of black fabric that clung to them like tar. No eyes. No faces. Just watchers.

He didn’t scream.

He couldn’t.

He took a step forward, and every figure in the room turned — not their heads, but their bodies — to face him. A wave of stillness crashed over him, louder than any noise.

Then the screen changed.

No longer static.

It showed him.

In the living room.

On the motel bed.

In the basement.

Drawing.

Looking.

It showed Eleanor, too — sitting in the same house, a photograph in her hand, crying.

Then it showed the family from the article. The Marrows.

They sat at a dinner table, their eyes covered in cloth, their mouths moving in prayer or plea.

Then: the screen cut to black.

The figures took a step forward.

Jude backed away.

And then, for the first time, one of them spoke.

“You saw us.”

Its voice was not singular — it was many, a chorus run through broken speakers, layered and hissing.

“You opened the way.”

Jude’s mouth was dry. “I didn’t mean to.”

“There is no meaning. Only seeing.”

He turned, scrambled back into the tunnel. Dirt rained from the ceiling. The red light blinked out. He crawled blindly, clawing at soil, his lungs burning.

Behind him came the scraping — not footsteps — the sound of things pulling themselves forward by their hands.

He reached the basement floor again and pulled himself through the broken wall. The tunnel collapsed behind him, the light gone. The figures — for now — had not followed.

But the footprints were still there.

And the air was no longer his.

Upstairs, he found the front door open.

Daylight streamed in, bright and golden.

For a moment, Jude thought maybe he’d made it through. That maybe the house had released him.

Until he stepped outside and saw the street again.

Not Ashwater.

Not anymore.

The houses were bone-white and windowless. The sky was black, not with clouds, but with absence. And the line of watchers had moved. They now stood on the lawn, facing the house. Facing him.

In their hands were photographs.

All of Jude.

All taken from angles he couldn’t have survived.

And from the edge of the broken mirror in the attic, a crack spread wider.

And a hand — long, black, eyeless — reached through.

Chapter Three: Through the Reflection

The world outside the house was wrong in ways that resisted language. Jude stood in the threshold, unable to convince himself that what he saw was a trick of the eye or a waking dream. It wasn’t just that the sky was too dark, or that the houses no longer resembled places anyone had lived — it was the stillness. A deep, unnatural stillness, like time itself had been hung on a hook and left to drain. The watchers on the lawn remained motionless, clutching their photographs as though participating in some silent ritual. They didn’t blink. They didn’t breathe. Yet they radiated awareness, like candles with eyes.

Jude stepped backward into the house and slammed the door. The sound was dull, like closing a door underwater. Every instinct he had told him he was no longer in the same version of Ashwater Street he’d grown up around. The house had become a border between worlds — or maybe it had always been one, and the events of the past week had finally nudged it into showing its true purpose. He pressed his forehead to the wood of the door, trying to think, to organize his memories into something that could resemble cause and effect. But the effort was like chasing smoke. There were no answers. Only sensations.

In the kitchen, the tap had begun to drip again. The sound of it echoed far too loudly through the space, each droplet hitting the sink like a stone dropped down a metal shaft. Jude ignored it and instead turned toward the hallway. The broken mirror in the attic had cracked open something more than plaster and glass — it had allowed a part of their world, their dimension, to reach into his. And if that was the case, then the only way forward was through it.

He found the mirror exactly as he’d left it, except now the crack had widened. The vertical split ran the full length of the glass, revealing something deeper than a simple room reflection. The interior showed no attic, no wooden beams, no dusty insulation — instead, it displayed a corridor of black stone, lined with doors that pulsed faintly as though breathing. Jude stared into the glass and saw no sign of himself, no reflection at all, only the other place.

A gentle pressure built in his skull — not pain, not exactly, but a pulling sensation. His eyes watered. The mirror wanted him to step through.

He should have resisted.

Instead, he placed a hand against the surface.

It felt warm.

Then he pushed.

The glass didn’t break. It rippled. The sensation was like pushing his hand through cold honey, thick and slow. Then it gave, and he fell forward.

The world changed again.

The corridor was narrow, the ceiling low enough that Jude had to stoop slightly as he walked. The walls weren’t just black — they were wet, glistening with a slick substance that reeked of copper and rot. The doors that lined either side were spaced unevenly, some twice the height of others, some only wide enough for a child to crawl through. Each one had a small round window, and in each window — eyes.

Not human eyes. Not even animal.

They didn’t blink. They didn’t track movement. They simply existed, open and endless, swirling with a depth that suggested falling forever. Each door thrummed as he passed, a low frequency that vibrated in his chest. Some pulses were fast, others so slow it was hard to tell if they moved at all.

At the end of the hallway was a larger door. It lacked a window. Instead, a symbol had been carved into its center — the spiral-in-triangle that had appeared in Melinda’s notebook. He reached out, half-expecting it to burn him. But it didn’t. The door opened easily, silently.

Inside was a room that defied geometry.

The floor was concave, like the inside of a bowl, sloping downward to a central pit. The walls were curved and smooth, covered in that same oily sheen. The pit held a mirror — massive, framed in bone, the glass so dark it seemed to eat the light around it.

Figures stood around the mirror. Not the watchers. Not the silent, faceless entities that had followed him since the house. These were different.

These were people.

Sort of.

There was Eleanor, or something wearing her shape. Her head tilted, lips moving, though no sound escaped. Her eyes — once scratched out in the photos — now glowed faintly, like coals smoldering under skin. Next to her, Melinda. Her limbs were too long, her joints slightly bent in the wrong direction, but her face was hers, wearing that same lopsided smile she used when lying.

Others were strangers. The Marrow family, maybe, or others drawn in over the years. Each of them distorted, warped by the same force that had twisted the house, their features too smooth or too sharp, their movements slightly delayed, like watching a film out of sync.

They turned to face Jude in perfect unison.

He froze at the top of the slope.

Eleanor stepped forward, her mouth finally syncing with a voice.

“You shouldn’t be here.”

“I didn’t come by choice,” he answered, unsure if she could even understand.

“You were shown. That is enough.”

Jude took a shaky breath. “What is this place?”

“The Threshold,” she replied. “Where seeing becomes becoming.”

Melinda stepped beside her. “You looked too long, Jude. That’s the trick. You think you’re witnessing. But really, you’re inviting.”

“You mean the mirrors?”

Melinda shook her head. “The mirrors are just one path. The photos, the dreams, even memories. It doesn’t matter how. Just that you see.”

Jude looked around. “Then what’s the way back?”

Eleanor’s face contorted in something like pity. “There isn’t one.”

He clenched his fists. “I won’t become one of them.”

“You already are,” a voice said behind him.

He turned.

One of the doors at the corridor’s end had opened, and a figure stood in the threshold.

Himself.

Or a version.

Paler. Leaner. No irises — only flat white discs. Its mouth moved in eerie mimicry. It smiled.

“You left the door open,” it said. “You always do.”

Jude backed away.

But there was nowhere left to go.

Behind him, Eleanor and Melinda faded into the walls. The watchers began to emerge from the shadows. The floor of the chamber rippled, softening like warm wax.

The giant mirror at the pit began to vibrate.

Jude screamed and ran — not toward the doors, but directly into the mirror, hoping against logic that it was still liquid.

It wasn’t.

It shattered.

And he fell into the shards.

When he woke, he was on the floor of the attic.

Sunlight poured in through the broken slats.

The mirror was gone.

No frame. No glass. Just dust where it had stood.

He staggered to his feet, blood crusting his shirt and a long gash down his left arm. But he was alive. The air tasted real again. Outside, he could hear birds.

He made his way downstairs.

Ashwater Street looked normal.

The watchers were gone.

Melinda’s room was empty.

Eleanor’s journal was gone from the nightstand.

For a moment, Jude allowed himself to believe he had escaped.

Then he caught his reflection in the hallway mirror.

His eyes were flat white.

And he was smiling.

Jude stared into the mirror far longer than he should have. He knew better. Every warning that had come before echoed now, growing louder — Eleanor’s whispers, Melinda’s notebook, the drawing in the journal. Don’t look. Don’t see. They find you that way. But he was already past the point of instruction. He had already seen. Already become.

The eyes in the mirror weren’t fully his anymore. They were flat, yes, and colorless, but they shimmered at the edges, like something moved just beneath their surface — oil on water, waiting to rise. He lifted a hand to his face. It trembled. Not from fear, but from the strange lack of resistance between thought and movement. It was as though he was thinking himself into action, not doing it. A disconnection had formed, slight but undeniable, between will and execution.

He stepped away from the glass and found his legs moved before he asked them to. Not sluggish. Not clumsy. Just slightly too responsive, as if his body was listening more to the room than to him.

The house was quieter now. That hum — that pressure he had grown so used to — was gone. The kind of silence that should’ve brought peace. But in its absence, Jude felt something worse: expectation. As though the house itself was watching. Or worse, waiting.

He made his way to the kitchen. Everything was still in its place. The crumpled drawing in the trash hadn’t burned all the way. He saw the corner of Melinda’s face peeking out from the ashes, her mouth still open in that silent scream. He picked it up and uncrumpled it. The paper had changed. The background now showed more detail — not just the dark shapes behind her, but the room itself. His room. The chair, the desk, even the small rip in the curtain he hadn’t noticed before.

The paper had updated. Like it was still watching.

Still recording.

He tore it into pieces and flushed it, one strip at a time. But that unease stayed. That sense of being a character in someone else’s story. Or worse — in his own, but one being rewritten every time he looked away.

He needed to leave.

This time, he didn’t go to the front door. He went out the back, through the overgrown garden. The air was sharp and thin, and he realized he hadn’t truly breathed in what felt like days. He walked quickly past the trees where he’d buried the box — where something had unburied it — and beyond the rusting shed, toward the fence at the edge of the property.

It was gone.

The fence, the neighbors, the side street — all of it. What stood beyond the backyard now was a long corridor of gray grass leading into a mist that shimmered like static. The world had rewritten itself beyond the borders of the house. Jude stepped forward and stopped at the line where the yard ended and the new terrain began.

He crouched and touched the grass.

It wasn’t grass.

It looked like it. Felt like it. But when he pulled a blade up between his fingers, it unwound like thread. It shimmered. It twitched.

It was hair.

All of it.

A field of impossibly fine hair, stretched across the land like a curtain.

He staggered back, bile rising in his throat.

When he looked up, the sky had changed.

The clouds had parted into concentric rings. In the center of them — impossibly far, yet clear as a lens — was an eye.

A massive, unblinking, lidless eye.

It wasn’t watching him.

It was watching the house.

He turned and ran.

Back through the yard, into the kitchen, slamming the door shut behind him. He stood with his back pressed to the wood, gasping, trying not to cry.

But crying felt like the most human thing left, and he didn’t know if he could still do it.

The phone rang.

He hadn’t realized it was still plugged in. He hadn’t heard a dial tone in days.

It rang once.

Twice.

He answered on the third.

Silence.

Then a voice.

Low. Familiar.

“You’re where I was,” Eleanor said. “But you’re deeper in.”

“Eleanor.” His voice cracked. “How do I fix this?”

“You can’t fix it. There’s no undoing the seeing. You’re a lens now. Just like I was. Just like Melinda.”

“Then what do they want from us?”

“To be seen. To be believed. That’s all. That’s enough.”

Her voice warped, bending over static. “Once you’re part of the reflection, you’re the door. Others come through you. That’s the whole design. We’re not haunted, Jude. We’re the haunt.”

“No,” he said. “That’s not true.”

“You know it is.”

He hung up.

But the phone didn’t stop.

It kept ringing.

Even after he yanked the cord from the wall.

Even after he smashed the receiver with a hammer.

It rang. And rang.

And rang.

Until he screamed, threw open the door, and hurled it into the field of hair.

It disappeared without sound.

And the phone kept ringing inside his head.

That night, he found another photograph.

Not in the attic.

Not in the basement.

It was on his pillow.

Freshly printed.

Still warm.

It was him.

But older.

His face had thinned. His hair was white. And behind him stood a child — no eyes, no expression, just watching.

On the back of the photo, in his own handwriting:
“You showed them how.”

He dropped it.

Left it.

Went into the bathroom and turned on the faucet.

But the water was no longer clear.

It ran dark and thick.

The mirror above the sink had begun to ripple again.

He watched his reflection.

It smiled.

And he didn’t.

Chapter Four: Hosts and Hollow Places

By the time morning arrived—if the pale smudge in the sky could be called that—Jude had stopped expecting relief. The house had shifted again during the night, not dramatically, but enough for him to notice. The hallway from the kitchen to the stairwell now bent slightly to the left, like a spine curving under its own weight. The ceiling above the front door bowed downward, pulsing with the slow rhythm of breath. A hairline fracture had appeared in the tile floor beside the living room, widening imperceptibly each time he looked away. The house was becoming something else—something not made for people.

He hadn’t slept. Couldn’t. Whenever he closed his eyes, images crept in. A woman made of smoke weeping on the roof. A boy with blackened hands kneeling beside the fireplace. A thousand mouths whispering beneath the floorboards, chewing on his name. It was no longer clear which visions belonged to the house and which came from within him. His mind was unraveling alongside the walls.

The field outside had vanished. In its place was a dense forest, where the trees swayed without wind and bore leaves shaped like teeth. He refused to step out again. The backyard was gone. The world was folding inward, peeling back layers of itself to expose whatever sat beneath. And Jude had the growing suspicion that the house wasn’t simply a structure infected by something else. It was the infection. A living thing that used people as hosts, disguises, bait.

He spent the early hours sitting at the kitchen table, sketching compulsively in what had once been Melinda’s notebook. The drawings poured from him like sweat, uncontrolled. A long hallway filled with clocks that all pointed to the same hour. A crowd of people with blank sheets of paper in place of faces. A woman trapped in a mirror, knocking with bloody fists. With each image he drew, a sense of calm followed. But it never lasted. Once a page was filled, the quiet cracked open again, letting in the hum, the weight, the eyes behind the walls.

Around noon—or what passed for it—he heard something new.

A knock.

Not loud. Not frantic. Just… patient.

Three slow raps on the front door.

He stood without thinking. His hand reached for the doorknob before his brain formed a question.

Who still knocks?

He stopped just short of touching the handle.

Three more knocks.

This time louder.

Then a voice.

“Jude?”

He stepped back.

It was Melinda’s voice.

Too calm.

Too perfect.

“You’ve been in there too long,” she said through the wood. “Let me in.”

He didn’t speak.

She knocked again. Once.

“You’re starting to forget who you are. That’s what they want.”

Her voice was wrong now. Too clear. Like a recording played through a mouth that didn’t quite understand inflection.

“You remember what you said at the lake that summer? You said you’d follow me if I got lost. Even into the water.”

Jude trembled.

He remembered that.

But he hadn’t told her that. He’d only thought it.

That’s when he knew: it wasn’t her.

He backed away, heart hammering, and the door began to shake in its frame.

Not rattling.

Breathing.

The wood expanded outward like lungs inflating. Each knock now came with the groaning protest of nails pulling free.

Then silence.

No more voice.

No more knocks.

Just the knowledge that something had stood on the porch wearing his cousin’s voice.

He retreated to the upstairs hallway and shut himself in the guest bedroom—the one he’d used as a child, long ago, before the house turned on them. Dust coated the windowsill, but everything else remained strangely undisturbed. As though no time had passed at all.

There was a dresser in the corner.

A mirror sat on top of it.

He approached it warily.

His reflecti
