And the title is still something of a misnomer, for many narratives involving a puzzle of some sort, though belonging to the category which I wish to discuss, are handled by the writer without expert detective aid.  Sometimes the puzzle solves itself through operation of circumstance; sometimes somebody who professes no special detective skill happens upon the secret of its mystery; once in a while some venturesome genius has the courage to leave his enigma unexplained.  But ever since Gaboriau created his Lecoq, the transcendent detective has been in favor; and Conan Doyle’s famous gentleman analyst has given him a fresh lease of life, and reanimated the stage by reverting to the method of Poe.  Sherlock Holmes is Dupin redivivus, and mutatus mutandis; personally he is a more stirring and engaging companion, but so far as kinship to probabilities or even possibilities is concerned, perhaps the older version of him is the more presentable.  But in this age of marvels we seem less difficult to suit in this respect than our forefathers were.  The fact is, meanwhile, that, in the riddle story, the detective was an afterthought, or, more accurately, a deus ex machina to make the story go.  The riddle had to be unriddled; and who could do it so naturally and readily as a detective?  The detective, as Poe saw him, was a means to this end; and it was only afterwards that writers perceived his availability as a character.  Lecoq accordingly becomes a figure in fiction, and Sherlock, while he was as yet a novelty, was nearly as attractive as the complications in which he involved himself.  Riddle-story writers in general, however, encounter the obvious embarrassment that their detective is obliged to lavish so much attention on the professional services which the exigencies of the tale demand of him, that he has very little leisure to expound his own personal equation—the rather since the attitude of peering into a millstone is not, of itself, conducive to elucidations of oneself; the professional endowment obscures all the others.  We ordinarily find, therefore, our author dismissing the individuality of his detective with a few strong black-chalk outlines, and devoting his main labor upon what he feels the reader will chiefly occupy his own ingenuity with,— namely, the elaboration of the riddle itself.  Reader and writer sit down to a game, as it were, with the odds, of course, altogether on the latter’s side,—apart from the fact that a writer sometimes permits himself a little cheating.  It more often happens that the detective appears to be in the writer’s pay, and aids the deception by leading the reader off on false scents.  Be that as it may, the professional sleuth is in nine cases out of ten a dummy by malice prepense; and it might be plausibly argued that, in the interests of pure art, that is what he ought to be.  But genius always finds a way that is better than the rules, and I think it will be found that the very best riddle stories contrive to drive character and riddle side by side, and to make each somehow enhance the effect of the other.—The intention of the above paragraph will be more precisely conveyed if I include under the name of detective not only the man from the central office, but also anybody whom the writer may, for ends of his own, consider better qualified for that function.  The latter is a professional detective so far as the exigencies of the tale are concerned, and what becomes of him after that nobody need care,—there is no longer anything to prevent his becoming, in his own right, the most fascinating of mankind.  But in addition to the dummyship of the detective, or to the cases in which the mere slip of circumstance takes his place, there is another reason against narrowing our conception of the riddle story to the degree which the alternative appellation would imply.  And that is, that it would exclude not a few of the most captivating riddle stories in existence; for in De Quincey’s “Avenger,” for example, the interest is not in the unraveling of the web, but in the weaving of it.  The same remark applies to Bulwer’s “Strange Story”; it is the strangeness that is the thing.  There is, in short, an inalienable charm in the mere contemplation of mystery and the hazard of fortunes; and it would be a pity to shut them out from our consideration only because there is no second-sighted conjurer on hand to turn them into plain matter of fact.  Yet we must not be too liberal; and a ghost story can be brought into our charmed and charming circle only if we have made up our minds to believe in the ghosts; otherwise their introduction would not be a square deal.  It would not be fair, in other words, to propose a conundrum on a basis of ostensible materialism, and then, when no other key would fit, to palm off a disembodied spirit on us.  Tell me beforehand that your scenario is to include both worlds, and I have no objection to make; I simply attune my mind to the more extensive scope.  But I rebel at an unheralded ghostland, and declare frankly that your tale is incredible.  And I must confess that I would as lief have ghosts kept out altogether; their stories make a very good library in themselves, and have no need to tag themselves on to what is really another department of fiction. Nevertheless, when a ghost story is told with the consummate art of a Miss Wilkins, and of one or two others on our list, consistency in this regard ceases to be a jewel; art proves irresistible.  As for adventure stories, there is a fringe of them that comes under the riddle-story head; but for the most part the riddle story begins after the adventures have finished.  We are to contemplate a condition, not to watch the events that ultimate in it.  Our detective, or anyone else, may of course meet with haps and mishaps on his way to the solution of his puzzle; but an astute writer will not color such incidents too vividly, lest he risk forfeiting our preoccupation with the problem that we came forth for to study.  In a word, One thing at a time!  The foregoing disquisition may seem uncalled for by such rigid moralists as have made up their minds not to regard detective, or riddle stories, as any part of respectable literature at all.  With that sect, I announce at the outset that I am entirely out of sympathy.  It is not needed to compare “The Gold Bug” with “Paradise Lost”; nobody denies the superior literary stature of the latter, although, as the Oxford Senior Wrangler objected, “What does it prove?”  But I appeal to Emerson, who, in his poem of “The Mountain and the Squirrel,” states the nub of the argument, with incomparable felicity, as follows:—you will recall that the two protagonists had a difference, originating in the fact that the former called the latter “Little Prig.”  Bun made a very sprightly retort, summing up to this effect:—        “Talents differ; all is well and wisely put;       If I cannot carry forests on my back,       Neither can you crack a nut.”   Andes and Paradises Lost are expedient and perhaps necessary in their proper atmosphere and function; but Squirrels and Gold Bugs are indispensable in our daily walk.  There is as fine and as true literature in Poe’s Tales as in Milton’s epics; only the elevation and dimensions differ.  But I would rather live in a world that possessed only literature of the Poe caliber, than shiver in one echoing solely the strains of the Miltonian muse.  Mere human beings are not constructed to stand all day a-tiptoe on the misty mountain tops; they like to walk the streets most of the time and sit in easy chairs.  And writings that picture the human mind and nature, in true colors and in artistic proportions, are literature, and nobody has any business to pooh-pooh them.  In fact, I feel as if I were knocking down a man of straw.  I look in vain for any genuine resistance.  Of course “The Gold Bug” is literature; of course any other story of mystery and puzzle is also literature, provided it is as good as “The Gold Bug,”—or I will say, since that standard has never since been quite attained, provided it is a half or a tenth as good.  It is goldsmith’s work; it is Chinese carving; it is Daedalian; it is fine.  It is the product of the ingenuity lobe of the human brain working and expatiating in freedom.  It is art; not spiritual or transcendental art, but solid art, to be felt and experienced.  You may examine it at your leisure, it will be always ready for you; you need not fast or watch your arms overnight in order to understand it.  Look at the nice setting of the mortises; mark how the cover fits; how smooth is the working of that spring drawer.  Observe that this bit of carving, which seemed mere ornament, is really a vital part of the mechanism.  Note, moreover, how balanced and symmetrical the whole design is, with what economy and foresight every part is fashioned. It is not only an ingenious structure, it is a handsome bit of furniture, and will materially improve the looks of the empty chambers, or disorderly or ungainly chambers that you carry under your crown.  Or if it happen that these apartments are noble in decoration and proportions, then this captivating little object will find a suitable place in some spare nook or other, and will rest or entertain eyes too long focused on the severely sublime and beautiful.  I need not, however, rely upon abstract argument to support my contention.  Many of the best writers of all time have used their skill in the inverted form of story telling, as a glance at our table of contents will show; and many of their tales depend for their effect as much on character and atmosphere as on the play and complication of events.  The statement that a good detective or riddle story is good in art is supported by the fact that the supply of really good ones is relatively small, while the number of writers who would write good ones if they could, and who have tried and failed to write them, is past computation.  And one reason probably is that such stories, for their success, must depend primarily upon structure—a sound and perfect plot—which is one of the rare things in our contemporary fiction.  Our writers get hold of an incident, or a sentiment, or a character, or a moral principle, or a hit of technical knowledge, or a splotch of local color, or even of a new version of dialect, and they will do something in two to ten thousand words out of that and call it a short story.  Magazines may be found to print it—for there are all manner of magazines; but nothing of that sort will serve for a riddle story.  You cannot make a riddle story by beginning it and then trusting to luck to bring it to an end.  You must know all about the end and the middle before thinking, even, of the beginning; the beginning of a riddle story, unlike those of other stories and of other enterprises, is not half the battle; it is next to being quite unimportant, and, moreover, it is always easy.  The unexplained corpse lies weltering in its gore in the first paragraph; the inexplicable cipher presents its enigma at the turning of the opening page.  The writer who is secure in the knowledge that he has got a good thing coming, and has arranged the manner and details of its coming, cannot go far wrong with his exordium; he wants to get into action at once, and that is his best assurance that he will do it in the right way. But O! what a labor and sweat it is; what a planning and trimming; what a remodeling, curtailing, interlining; what despairs succeeded by new lights, what heroic expedients tried at the last moment, and dismissed the moment after; what wastepaper baskets full of futilities, and what gallant commencements all over again!  Did the reader know, or remotely suspect, what terrific struggles the writer of a really good detective story had sustained, he would regard the final product with a new wonder and respect, and read it all over once more to find out how the troubles occurred.  But he will search in vain; there are no signs of them left; no, not so much as a scar.  The tale moves along as smoothly and inevitably as oiled machinery; obviously, it could not have been arranged otherwise than it is; and the wise reader is convinced that he could have done the thing himself without half trying.  At that, the weary writer smiles a bitter smile; but it is one of the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes.  Nobody, except him who has tried it, will ever know how hard it is to write a really good detective story.  The man or woman who can do it can also write a good play (according to modern ideas of plays), and possesses force of character, individuality, and mental ability.  He or she must combine the intuition of the artist with the talent of the master mechanic, but will seldom be a poet, and will generally care more for things and events than for fellow creatures.  For, although the story is often concerned with righting some wrong, or avenging some murder, yet it must be confessed that the author commonly succeeds better in the measure of his ruthlessness in devising crimes and giving his portraits of devils an extra touch of black.  Mercy is not his strong point, however he may abound in justice; and he will not stickle at piling up the agony, if thereby he provides opportunity for enhancing the picturesqueness and completeness of the evil doer’s due.  But this leads me to the admission that one charge, at least, does lie against the door of the riddle-story writer; and that is, that he is not sincere; he makes his mysteries backward, and knows the answer to his riddle before he states its terms.  He deliberately supplies his reader, also, with all manner of false scents, well knowing them to be such; and concocts various seeming artless and innocent remarks and allusions, which in reality are diabolically artful, and would deceive the very elect.  All this, I say, must be conceded; but it is not unfair; the very object, ostensibly, of the riddle story is to prompt you to sharpen your wits; and as you are yourself the real detective in the case, so you must regard your author as the real criminal whom you are to detect.  Credit no statement of his save as supported by the clearest evidence; be continually repeating to yourself, “Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,”—nay, never so much as then.  But, as I said before, when the game is well set, you have no chance whatever against the dealer; and for my own part, I never try to be clever when I go up against these thimble-riggers; I believe all they tell me, and accept the most insolent gold bricks; and in that way I occasionally catch some of the very ablest of them napping; for they are so subtle that they will sometimes tell you the truth because they think you will suppose it to be a lie.  I do not wish to catch them napping, however; I cling to the wisdom of ignorance, and childishly enjoy the way in which things work themselves out— the cul-de-sac resolving itself at the very last moment into a promising corridor toward the outer air.  At every rebuff it is my happiness to be hopelessly bewildered; and I gape with admiration when the Gordian knot is untied.  If the author be old-fashioned enough to apostrophize the Gentle Reader, I know he must mean me, and docilely give ear, and presently tumble head-foremost into the treacherous pit he has digged for me.  In brief, I am there to be sold, and I get my money’s worth.  No one can thoroughly enjoy riddle stories unless he is old enough, or young enough, or, at any rate, wise enough to appreciate the value of the faculty of being surprised.  Those sardonic and omniscient persons who know everything beforehand, and smile compassionately or scornfully at the artless outcries of astonishment of those who are uninformed, may get an ill-natured satisfaction out of the persuasion that they are superior beings; but there is very little meat in that sort of happiness, and the uninformed have the better lot after all.  I need hardly point out that there is a distinction and a difference between short riddle stories and long ones—novels.  The former require far more technical art for their proper development; the enigma cannot be posed in so many ways, but must be stated once for all; there cannot be false scents, or but a few of them; there can be small opportunity for character drawing, and all kinds of ornament and comment must be reduced to their very lowest terms. Here, indeed, as everywhere, genius will have its way; and while a merely talented writer would deem it impossible to tell the story of “The Gold Bug” in less than a volume, Poe could do it in a few thousand words, and yet appear to have said everything worth saying.  In the case of the Sherlock Holmes tales, they form a series, and our previous knowledge of the hero enables the writer to dispense with much description and accompaniment that would be necessary had that eminent personage been presented in only a single complication of events.  Each special episode of the great analyst’s career can therefore be handled with the utmost economy, and yet fill all the requirements of intelligent interest and comprehension.  But, as a rule, the riddle novel approaches its theme in a spirit essentially other than that which inspires the short tale.  We are given, as it were, a wide landscape instead of a detailed genre picture.  The number of the dramatis personae is much larger, and the parts given to many of them may be very small, though each should have his or her necessary function in the general plan.  It is much easier to create perplexity on these terms; but on the other hand, the riddle novel demands a power of vivid character portrayal and of telling description which are not indispensable in the briefer narrative.  A famous tale, published perhaps forty years ago, but which cannot be included in our series, tells the story of a murder the secret of which is admirably concealed till the last; and much of the fascination of the book is due to the ability with which the leading character, and some of the subordinate ones, are drawn.  The author was a woman, and I have often marveled that women so seldom attempt this form of literature; many of them possess a good constructive faculty, and their love of detail and of mystery is notorious. Perhaps they are too fond of sentiment; and sentiment must be handled with caution in riddle stories.  The fault of all riddle novels is that they inevitably involve two kinds of interest, and can seldom balance these so perfectly that one or the other of them shall not suffer.  The mind of the reader becomes weary in its frequent journeys between human characters on one side the mysterious events on the other, and would prefer the more single- eyed treatment of the short tale.  Wonder, too, is a very tender and short-lived emotion, and sometimes perishes after a few pages. Curiosity is tougher; but that too may be baffled too long, and end by tiring of the pursuit while it is yet in its early stages.  Many excellent plots, admirable from the constructive point of view, have been wasted by stringing them out too far; the reader recognizes their merit, but loses his enthusiasm on account of a sort of monotony of strain; he wickedly turns to the concluding chapter, and the game is up.  “The Woman in White,” by Wilkie Collins, was published about 1860, I think, in weekly installments, and certainly they were devoured with insatiable appetite by many thousands of readers.  But I doubt whether a book of similar merit could command such a following to-day; and I will even confess that I have myself never read the concluding parts, and do not know to this day who the woman was or what were the wrongs from which she so poignantly suffered.  The tales contained in the volumes herewith offered are the best riddle or detective stories in the world, according to the best judgment of the editors.  They are the product of writers of all nations; and translation, in this case, is less apt to be misleading than with most other forms of literature, for a mystery or a riddle is equally captivating in all languages.  Many of the good ones—perhaps some of the best ones—have been left out, either because we missed them in our search, or because we had to choose between them and others seemingly of equal excellence, and were obliged to consider space limitations which, however generously laid out, must have some end at last.  Be that as it may, we believe that there are enough good stories here to satisfy the most Gargantuan hunger, and we feel sure that our volumes will never be crowded off the shelf which has once made room for them. If we have, now and then, a little transcended the strict definition of the class of fiction which our title would promise, we shall nevertheless not anticipate any serious quarrel with our readers; if there be room to question the right of any given story to appear in this company, there will be all the more reason for accepting it on its own merits; for it had to be very good indeed in order to overcome its technical disqualification.  And if it did not rightfully belong here, there would probably be objections as strong to admitting it in any other collection.  Between two or more stools, it would be a pity to let it fall to the ground; so let it be forgiven, and please us with whatever gift it has.  In many cases where copyrights were still unexpired, we have to express our acknowledgments to writers and publishers who have accorded us the courtesy of their leave to reproduce what their genius or enterprise has created and put forth.  To our readers we take pleasure in presenting what we know cannot fail to give them pleasure—a collection of the fruits of the finest literary ingenuity and nicest art accessible to the human mind.  Gaudeat, non caveat emptor!  JULIAN HAWTHORNE.     American Mystery Stories     F. Marion Crawford     By the Waters of Paradise   I   I remember my childhood very distinctly.  I do not think that the fact argues a good memory, for I have never been clever at learning words by heart, in prose or rhyme; so that I believe my remembrance of events depends much more upon the events themselves than upon my possessing any special facility for recalling them.  Perhaps I am too imaginative, and the earliest impressions I received were of a kind to stimulate the imagination abnormally.  A long series of little misfortunes, so connected with each other as to suggest a sort of weird fatality, so worked upon my melancholy temperament when I was a boy that, before I was of age, I sincerely believed myself to be under a curse, and not only myself, but my whole family and every individual who bore my name.  I was born in the old place where my father, and his father, and all his predecessors had been born, beyond the memory of man.  It is a very old house, and the greater part of it was originally a castle, strongly fortified, and surrounded by a deep moat supplied with abundant water from the hills by a hidden aqueduct.  Many of the fortifications have been destroyed, and the moat has been filled up.  The water from the aqueduct supplies great fountains, and runs down into huge oblong basins in the terraced gardens, one below the other, each surrounded by a broad pavement of marble between the water and the flower-beds.  The waste surplus finally escapes through an artificial grotto, some thirty yards long, into a stream, flowing down through the park to the meadows beyond, and thence to the distant river.  The buildings were extended a little and greatly altered more than two hundred years ago, in the time of Charles II., but since then little has been done to improve them, though they have been kept in fairly good repair, according to our fortunes.  In the gardens there are terraces and huge hedges of box and evergreen, some of which used to be clipped into shapes of animals, in the Italian style.  I can remember when I was a lad how I used to try to make out what the trees were cut to represent, and how I used to appeal for explanations to Judith, my Welsh nurse.  She dealt in a strange mythology of her own, and peopled the gardens with griffins, dragons, good genii and bad, and filled my mind with them at the same time.  My nursery window afforded a view of the great fountains at the head of the upper basin, and on moonlight nights the Welshwoman would hold me up to the glass and bid me look at the mist and spray rising into mysterious shapes, moving mystically in the white light like living things.  “It’s the Woman of the Water,” she used to say; and sometimes she would threaten that if I did not go to sleep the Woman of the Water would steal up to the high window and carry me away in her wet arms.  The place was gloomy.  The broad basins of water and the tall evergreen hedges gave it a funereal look, and the damp-stained marble causeways by the pools might have been made of tombstones. The gray and weather-beaten walls and towers without, the dark and massively furnished rooms within, the deep, mysterious recesses and the heavy curtains, all affected my spirits.  I was silent and sad from my childhood.  There was a great clock tower above, from which the hours rang dismally during the day, and tolled like a knell in the dead of night.  There was no light nor life in the house, for my mother was a helpless invalid, and my father had grown melancholy in his long task of caring for her.  He was a thin, dark man, with sad eyes; kind, I think, but silent and unhappy.  Next to my mother, I believe he loved me better than anything on earth, for he took immense pains and trouble in teaching me, and what he taught me I have never forgotten.  Perhaps it was his only amusement, and that may be the reason why I had no nursery governess or teacher of any kind while he lived.  I used to be taken to see my mother every day, and sometimes twice a day, for an hour at a time.  Then I sat upon a little stool near her feet, and she would ask me what I had been doing, and what I wanted to do.  I dare say she saw already the seeds of a profound melancholy in my nature, for she looked at me always with a sad smile, and kissed me with a sigh when I was taken away.  One night, when I was just six years old, I lay awake in the nursery.  The door was not quite shut, and the Welsh nurse was sitting sewing in the next room.  Suddenly I heard her groan, and say in a strange voice, “One—two—one—two!”  I was frightened, and I jumped up and ran to the door, barefooted as I was.  “What is it, Judith?” I cried, clinging to her skirts.  I can remember the look in her strange dark eyes as she answered:  “One—two leaden coffins, fallen from the ceiling!” she crooned, working herself in her chair.  “One—two—a light coffin and a heavy coffin, falling to the floor!”  Then she seemed to notice me, and she took me back to bed and sang me to sleep with a queer old Welsh song.  I do not know how it was, but the impression got hold of me that she had meant that my father and mother were going to die very soon.  They died in the very room where she had been sitting that night.  It was a great room, my day nursery, full of sun when there was any; and when the days were dark it was the most cheerful place in the house.  My mother grew rapidly worse, and I was transferred to another part of the building to make place for her.  They thought my nursery was gayer for her, I suppose; but she could not live.  She was beautiful when she was dead, and I cried bitterly.  “The light one, the light one—the heavy one to come,” crooned the Welshwoman.  And she was right.  My father took the room after my mother was gone, and day by day he grew thinner and paler and sadder.  “The heavy one, the heavy one—all of lead,” moaned my nurse, one night in December, standing still, just as she was going to take away the light after putting me to bed.  Then she took me up again and wrapped me in a little gown, and led me away to my father’s room.  She knocked, but no one answered.  She opened the door, and we found him in his easy chair before the fire, very white, quite dead.  So I was alone with the Welshwoman till strange people came, and relations whom I had never seen; and then I heard them saying that I must be taken away to some more cheerful place.  They were kind people, and I will not believe that they were kind only because I was to be very rich when I grew to be a man.  The world never seemed to be a very bad place to me, nor all the people to be miserable sinners, even when I was most melancholy.  I do not remember that anyone ever did me any great injustice, nor that I was ever oppressed or ill treated in any way, even by the boys at school.  I was sad, I suppose, because my childhood was so gloomy, and, later, because I was unlucky in everything I undertook, till I finally believed I was pursued by fate, and I used to dream that the old Welsh nurse and the Woman of the Water between them had vowed to pursue me to my end.  But my natural disposition should have been cheerful, as I have often thought.  Among the lads of my age I was never last, or even among the last, in anything; but I was never first.  If I trained for a race, I was sure to sprain my ankle on the day when I was to run.  If I pulled an oar with others, my oar was sure to break.  If I competed for a prize, some unforeseen accident prevented my winning it at the last moment.  Nothing to which I put my hand succeeded, and I got the reputation of being unlucky, until my companions felt it was always safe to bet against me, no matter what the appearances might be.  I became discouraged and listless in everything.  I gave up the idea of competing for any distinction at the University, comforting myself with the thought that I could not fail in the examination for the ordinary degree.  The day before the examination began I fell ill; and when at last I recovered, after a narrow escape from death, I turned my back upon Oxford, and went down alone to visit the old place where I had been born, feeble in health and profoundly disgusted and discouraged.  I was twenty-one years of age, master of myself and of my fortune; but so deeply had the long chain of small unlucky circumstances affected me that I thought seriously of shutting myself up from the world to live the life of a hermit and to die as soon as possible.  Death seemed the only cheerful possibility in my existence, and my thoughts soon dwelt upon it altogether.  I had never shown any wish to return to my own home since I had been taken away as a little boy, and no one had ever pressed me to do so.  The place had been kept in order after a fashion, and did not seem to have suffered during the fifteen years or more of my absence.  Nothing earthly could affect those old gray walls that had fought the elements for so many centuries.  The garden was more wild than I remembered it; the marble causeways about the pools looked more yellow and damp than of old, and the whole place at first looked smaller.  It was not until I had wandered about the house and grounds for many hours that I realized the huge size of the home where I was to live in solitude.  Then I began to delight in it, and my resolution to live alone grew stronger.  The people had turned out to welcome me, of course, and I tried to recognize the changed faces of the old gardener and the old housekeeper, and to call them by name.  My old nurse I knew at once.  She had grown very gray since she heard the coffins fall in the nursery fifteen years before, but her strange eyes were the same, and the look in them woke all my old memories.  She went over the house with me.  “And how is the Woman of the Water?” I asked, trying to laugh a little.  “Does she still play in the moonlight?”  “She is hungry,” answered the Welshwoman, in a low voice.  “Hungry?  Then we will feed her.”  I laughed.  But old Judith turned very pale, and looked at me strangely.  “Feed her?  Aye—you will feed her well,” she muttered, glancing behind her at the ancient housekeeper, who tottered after us with feeble steps through the halls and passages.  I did not think much of her words.  She had always talked oddly, as Welshwomen will, and though I was very melancholy I am sure I was not superstitious, and I was certainly not timid.  Only, as in a far-off dream, I seemed to see her standing with the light in her hand and muttering, “The heavy one—all of lead,” and then leading a little boy through the long corridors to see his father lying dead in a great easy chair before a smoldering fire.  So we went over the house, and I chose the rooms where I would live; and the servants I had brought with me ordered and arranged everything, and I had no more trouble.  I did not care what they did provided I was left in peace and was not expected to give directions; for I was more listless than ever, owing to the effects of my illness at college.  I dined in solitary state, and the melancholy grandeur of the vast old dining-room pleased me.  Then I went to the room I had selected for my study, and sat down in a deep chair, under a bright light, to think, or to let my thoughts meander through labyrinths of their own choosing, utterly indifferent to the course they might take.  The tall windows of the room opened to the level of the ground upon the terrace at the head of the garden.  It was in the end of July, and everything was open, for the weather was warm.  As I sat alone I heard the unceasing splash of the great fountains, and I fell to thinking of the Woman of the Water.  I rose and went out into the still night, and sat down upon a seat on the terrace, between two gigantic Italian flower pots.  The air was deliciously soft and sweet with the smell of the flowers, and the garden was more congenial to me than the house.  Sad people always like running water and the sound of it at night, though I cannot tell why.  I sat and listened in the gloom, for it was dark below, and the pale moon had not yet climbed over the hills in front of me, though all the air above was light with her rising beams.  Slowly the white halo in the eastern sky ascended in an arch above the wooded crests, making the outlines of the mountains more intensely black by contrast, as though the head of some great white saint were rising from behind a screen in a vast cathedral, throwing misty glories from below.  I longed to see the moon herself, and I tried to reckon the seconds before she must appear.  Then she sprang up quickly, and in a moment more hung round and perfect in the sky.  I gazed at her, and then at the floating spray of the tall fountains, and down at the pools, where the water lilies were rocking softly in their sleep on the velvet surface of the moonlit water.  Just then a great swan floated out silently into the midst of the basin, and wreathed his long neck, catching the water in his broad bill, and scattering showers of diamonds around him.  Suddenly, as I gazed, something came between me and the light.  I looked up instantly.  Between me and the round disk of the moon rose a luminous face of a woman, with great strange eyes, and a woman’s mouth, full and soft, but not smiling, hooded in black, staring at me as I sat still upon my bench.  She was close to me— so close that I could have touched her with my hand.  But I was transfixed and helpless.  She stood still for a moment, but her expression did not change.  Then she passed swiftly away, and my hair stood up on my head, while the cold breeze from her white dress was wafted to my temples as she moved.  The moonlight, shining through the tossing spray of the fountain, made traceries of shadow on the gleaming folds of her garments.  In an instant she was gone and I was alone.  I was strangely shaken by the vision, and some time passed before I could rise to my feet, for I was still weak from my illness, and the sight I had seen would have startled anyone.  I did not reason with myself, for I was certain that I had looked on the unearthly, and no argument could have destroyed that belief.  At last I got up and stood unsteadily, gazing in the direction in which I thought the face had gone; but there was nothing to be seen—nothing but the broad paths, the tall, dark evergreen hedges, the tossing water of the fountains and the smooth pool below.  I fell back upon the seat and recalled the face I had seen.  Strange to say, now that the first impression had passed, there was nothing startling in the recollection; on the contrary, I felt that I was fascinated by the face, and would give anything to see it again.  I could retrace the beautiful straight features, the long dark eyes, and the wonderful mouth most exactly in my mind, and when I had reconstructed every detail from memory I knew that the whole was beautiful, and that I should love a woman with such a face.  “I wonder whether she is the Woman of the Water!” I said to myself. Then rising once more, I wandered down the garden, descending one short flight of steps after another from terrace to terrace by the edge of the marble basins, through the shadow and through the moonlight; and I crossed the water by the rustic bridge above the artificial grotto, and climbed slowly up again to the highest terrace by the other side.  The air seemed sweeter, and I was very calm, so that I think I smiled to myself as I walked, as though a new happiness had come to me.  The woman’s face seemed always before me, and the thought of it gave me an unwonted thrill of pleasure, unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I turned as I reached the house, and looked back upon the scene. It had certainly changed in the short hour since I had come out, and my mood had changed with it.  Just like my luck, I thought, to fall in love with a ghost!  But in old times I would have sighed, and gone to bed more sad than ever, at such a melancholy conclusion.  To-night I felt happy, almost for the first time in my life.  The gloomy old study seemed cheerful when I went in.  The old pictures on the walls smiled at me, and I sat down in my deep chair with a new and delightful sensation that I was not alone. The idea of having seen a ghost, and of feeling much the better for it, was so absurd that I laughed softly, as I took up one of the books I had brought with me and began to read.  That impression did not wear off.  I slept peacefully, and in the morning I threw open my windows to the summer air and looked down at the garden, at the stretches of green and at the colored flower- beds, at the circling swallows and at the bright water.  “A man might make a paradise of this place,” I exclaimed.  “A man and a woman together!”  From that day the old Castle no longer seemed gloomy, and I think I ceased to be sad; for some time, too, I began to take an interest in the place, and to try and make it more alive.  I avoided my old Welsh nurse, lest she should damp my humor with some dismal prophecy, and recall my old self by bringing back memories of my dismal childhood.  But what I thought of most was the ghostly figure I had seen in the garden that first night after my arrival. I went out every evening and wandered through the walks and paths; but, try as I might, I did not see my vision again.  At last, after many days, the memory grew more faint, and my old moody nature gradually overcame the temporary sense of lightness I had experienced.  The summer turned to autumn, and I grew restless.  It began to rain.  The dampness pervaded the gardens, and the outer halls smelled musty, like tombs; the gray sky oppressed me intolerably.  I left the place as it was and went abroad, determined to try anything which might possibly make a second break in the monotonous melancholy from which I suffered.   II   Most people would be struck by the utter insignificance of the small events which, after the death of my parents, influenced my life and made me unhappy.  The grewsome forebodings of a Welsh nurse, which chanced to be realized by an odd coincidence of events, should not seem enough to change the nature of a child and to direct the bent of his character in after years.  The little disappointments of schoolboy life, and the somewhat less childish ones of an uneventful and undistinguished academic career, should not have sufficed to turn me out at one-and-twenty years of age a melancholic, listless idler.  Some weakness of my own character may have contributed to the result, but in a greater degree it was due to my having a reputation for bad luck.  However, I will not try to analyze the causes of my state, for I should satisfy nobody, least of all myself.  Still less will I attempt to explain why I felt a temporary revival of my spirits after my adventure in the garden. It is certain that I was in love with the face I had seen, and that I longed to see it again; that I gave up all hope of a second visitation, grew more sad than ever, packed up my traps, and finally went abroad.  But in my dreams I went back to my home, and it always appeared to me sunny and bright, as it had looked on that summer’s morning after I had seen the woman by the fountain.  I went to Paris.  I went farther, and wandered about Germany.  I tried to amuse myself, and I failed miserably.  With the aimless whims of an idle and useless man come all sorts of suggestions for good resolutions.  One day I made up my mind that I would go and bury myself in a German university for a time, and live simply like a poor student.  I started with the intention of going to Leipzig, determined to stay there until some event should direct my life or change my humor, or make an end of me altogether.  The express train stopped at some station of which I did not know the name.  It was dusk on a winter’s afternoon, and I peered through the thick glass from my seat.  Suddenly another train came gliding in from the opposite direction, and stopped alongside of ours.  I looked at the carriage which chanced to be abreast of mine, and idly read the black letters painted on a white board swinging from the brass handrail: BERLIN—COLOGNE—PARIS.  Then I looked up at the window above.  I started violently, and the cold perspiration broke out upon my forehead.  In the dim light, not six feet from where I sat, I saw the face of a woman, the face I loved, the straight, fine features, the strange eyes, the wonderful mouth, the pale skin. Her head-dress was a dark veil which seemed to be tied about her head and passed over the shoulders under her chin.  As I threw down the window and knelt on the cushioned seat, leaning far out to get a better view, a long whistle screamed through the station, followed by a quick series of dull, clanking sounds; then there was a slight jerk, and my train moved on.  Luckily the window was narrow, being the one over the seat, beside the door, or I believe I would have jumped out of it then and there.  In an instant the speed increased, and I was being carried swiftly away in the opposite direction from the thing I loved.  For a quarter of an hour I lay back in my place, stunned by the suddenness of the apparition.  At last one of the two other passengers, a large and gorgeous captain of the White Konigsberg Cuirassiers, civilly but firmly suggested that I might shut my window, as the evening was cold.  I did so, with an apology, and relapsed into silence.  The train ran swiftly on for a long time, and it was already beginning to slacken speed before entering another station, when I roused myself and made a sudden resolution. As the carriage stopped before the brilliantly lighted platform, I seized my belongings, saluted my fellow-passengers, and got out, determined to take the first express back to Paris.  This time the circumstances of the vision had been so natural that it did not strike me that there was anything unreal about the face, or about the woman to whom it belonged.  I did not try to explain to myself how the face, and the woman, could be traveling by a fast train from Berlin to Paris on a winter’s afternoon, when both were in my mind indelibly associated with the moonlight and the fountains in my own English home.  I certainly would not have admitted that I had been mistaken in the dusk, attributing to what I had seen a resemblance to my former vision which did not really exist.  There was not the slightest doubt in my mind, and I was positively sure that I had again seen the face I loved.  I did not hesitate, and in a few hours I was on my way back to Paris.  I could not help reflecting on my ill luck.  Wandering as I had been for many months, it might as easily have chanced that I should be traveling in the same train with that woman, instead of going the other way.  But my luck was destined to turn for a time.  I searched Paris for several days.  I dined at the principal hotels; I went to the theaters; I rode in the Bois de Boulogne in the morning, and picked up an acquaintance, whom I forced to drive with me in the afternoon.  I went to mass at the Madeleine, and I attended the services at the English Church.  I hung about the Louvre and Notre Dame.  I went to Versailles.  I spent hours in parading the Rue de Rivoli, in the neighborhood of Meurice’s corner, where foreigners pass and repass from morning till night. At last I received an invitation to a reception at the English Embassy.  I went, and I found what I had sought so long.  There she was, sitting by an old lady in gray satin and diamonds, who had a wrinkled but kindly face and keen gray eyes that seemed to take in everything they saw, with very little inclination to give much in return.  But I did not notice the chaperon.  I saw only the face that had haunted me for months, and in the excitement of the moment I walked quickly toward the pair, forgetting such a trifle as the necessity for an introduction.  She was far more beautiful than I had thought, but I never doubted that it was she herself and no other.  Vision or no vision before, this was the reality, and I knew it.  Twice her hair had been covered, now at last I saw it, and the added beauty of its magnificence glorified the whole woman.  It was rich hair, fine and abundant, golden, with deep ruddy tints in it like red bronze spun fine.  There was no ornament in it, not a rose, not a thread of gold, and I felt that it needed nothing to enhance its splendor; nothing but her pale face, her dark strange eyes, and her heavy eyebrows.  I could see that she was slender too, but strong withal, as she sat there quietly gazing at the moving scene in the midst of the brilliant lights and the hum of perpetual conversation.  I recollected the detail of introduction in time, and turned aside to look for my host.  I found him at last.  I begged him to present me to the two ladies, pointing them out to him at the same time.  “Yes—uh—by all means—uh,” replied his Excellency with a pleasant smile.  He evidently had no idea of my name, which was not to be wondered at.  “I am Lord Cairngorm,” I observed.  “Oh—by all means,” answered the Ambassador with the same hospitable smile.  “Yes—uh—the fact is, I must try and find out who they are; such lots of people, you know.”  “Oh, if you will present me, I will try and find out for you,” said I, laughing.  “Ah, yes—so kind of you—come along,” said my host.  We threaded the crowd, and in a few minutes we stood before the two ladies.  “’Lowmintrduce L’d Cairngorm,” he said; then, adding quickly to me, “Come and dine to-morrow, won’t you?” he glided away with his pleasant smile and disappeared in the crowd.  I sat down beside the beautiful girl, conscious that the eyes of the duenna were upon me.  “I think we have been very near meeting before,” I remarked, by way of opening the conversation.  My companion turned her eyes full upon me with an air of inquiry. She evidently did not recall my face, if she had ever seen me.  “Really—I cannot remember,” she observed, in a low and musical voice.  “When?”  “In the first place, you came down from Berlin by the express ten days ago.  I was going the other way, and our carriages stopped opposite each other.  I saw you at the window.”  “Yes—we came that way, but I do not remember—”  She hesitated.  “Secondly,” I continued, “I was sitting alone in my garden last summer—near the end of July—do you remember?  You must have wandered in there through the park; you came up to the house and looked at me—”  “Was that you?” she asked, in evident surprise.  Then she broke into a laugh.  “I told everybody I had seen a ghost; there had never been any Cairngorms in the place since the memory of man.  We left the next day, and never heard that you had come there; indeed, I did not know the castle belonged to you.”  “Where were you staying?” I asked.  “Where?  Why, with my aunt, where I always stay.  She is your neighbor, since it IS you.”  “I—beg your pardon—but then—is your aunt Lady Bluebell?  I did not quite catch—”  “Don’t be afraid.  She is amazingly deaf.  Yes.  She is the relict
