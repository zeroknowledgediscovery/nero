Chapter One: The Thumping Wall

The first time Isaac heard it, he thought it was the pipes. Not unheard of—old buildings in East Ridge had a reputation. His apartment, 3B, rattled when the heater kicked on in winter and groaned from the ceiling when the wind blew just right. But this was different. The noise was sharp, rhythmic. Not quite banging, not quite knocking. A hollow, deliberate thump, like a fist striking drywall once every few seconds. Then silence.

Then again. Thump. Pause. Thump.

It was two in the morning. He sat up in bed, pulse already racing before his thoughts caught up. He glanced at the clock, then at the pale rectangle of the window, where the city beyond glowed a dim orange through the dirty pane. The sound wasn’t coming from outside.

Next door—Apartment 3C.

Isaac had lived in 3B for nearly five months. The neighbor in 3C was a mystery. A man, he thought, although he'd never been certain. The apartment had been quiet for most of the time he’d lived here. No music, no shouting, no footsteps or plumbing sounds. Once or twice, he thought he’d caught a glimpse of someone entering the unit late at night—tall, always in a coat regardless of weather, key ready before they reached the door. Not unusual for the city, and not the sort of thing Isaac usually paid attention to. But something about 3C had always felt... thin. Like the walls of that unit weren’t quite as real as the rest of the building.

Tonight, the wall between them seemed suddenly much too close.

He got out of bed, padded over in bare feet, and pressed his ear against the drywall. It was cold. For a moment, nothing—then again:

Thump.
Pause.
Thump.

Then a new sound: a scrape, something dragging. Wood on wood? Metal? Hard to tell. Isaac's breath fogged slightly against the paint as he leaned in further, trying to discern any hint of speech or movement.

Nothing.

Then, abruptly, a low voice—muffled, too distorted to make out words, but unmistakably a voice. Male. Then a second, higher, faster, anxious. Two voices, one calm, one afraid. He jerked back, heart in his throat.

The noise stopped.

The next morning, Isaac stared at the wall while eating cereal, spoon hovering just above the bowl. In the daylight, the idea of hearing voices through the wall seemed ridiculous. He had been dreaming. Or maybe his neighbor had a television on late. Yeah. A film, maybe something weird and atmospheric.

But it hadn't sounded like a film. It had sounded close. Like the speakers were pressed directly to the wall—or like the people themselves were standing right on the other side.

The cereal went soggy. He let the spoon sink.

That evening, after work, he stood outside 3C’s door for a full minute before knocking. The hallway was narrow and painted in a strange shade of green, the kind that always looked slightly wet. A fluorescent bulb flickered above. He knocked. Lightly at first. Then again.

No answer.

He leaned in, tried to listen.

Silence.

He waited another moment, then turned to leave. As he did, a sound came from within—not the thumping, not even a voice. Just the creak of a floorboard. A single footstep, slow and deliberate.

He froze.

“Hello?” he called. “Sorry to bother—just... heard something last night. Everything okay in there?”

Nothing.

Then, just as he was about to leave, a reply—faint, dry, low.

“I’m fine.”

That was it. Three syllables, nothing more.

Isaac stood frozen for another beat. Then turned and walked quickly back to his apartment, not stopping until the lock clicked shut behind him.

He didn't sleep well that night. He dreamt of walls that pulsed like skin, of doors that opened without knobs. In the dream, he stood in his hallway while the building stretched around him, reshaping itself floor by floor. From behind the door of 3C, someone whispered his name. Not once. Repeated, over and over, gaining pitch with each pass. He awoke covered in sweat, the thumping echo still ringing in his ears.

Two days passed without incident. He told himself it had been nothing—a weird night, a sleep-deprived overreaction. He focused on work, ate dinner in front of his laptop, and tried not to glance too long at the shared wall. But on the third night, it began again.

The same rhythm. Thump. Pause. Thump.

He turned off his lights and sat in the dark, listening.

No voices this time, but the dragging sound returned, followed by something new—a wet noise, soft and awful. Like fabric being pulled from mud.

He stood, unable to sit still anymore, and grabbed his phone.

Recording might help. Proof. Evidence.

He pressed record and moved toward the wall, holding his breath.

The noise stopped.

Then, through the drywall, a sharp sound—like fingernails raking slowly down the inside of the wall. His recording captured it: a dry scrape, unmistakable. He yanked the phone away from the wall, and the sound stopped instantly.

The next morning, he went to the building manager.

Carlos was older, tired-looking, and mostly interested in things that didn’t involve tenant complaints. Still, when Isaac mentioned odd noises from next door, Carlos frowned.

“3C?” he asked. “You sure?”

Isaac nodded. “Yeah. Weird banging, dragging stuff, voices. It’s... I don’t know, something’s off.”

Carlos scratched his chin. “We don’t have anyone on file for 3C.”

Isaac blinked. “What?”

“No lease signed. Not for a while. Last one was three years ago, some guy—forgot his name. Paid six months in cash, left after a week. Since then? Nothing.”

“But someone’s living there.”

Carlos shrugged. “Not according to our books.”

Isaac returned home unsettled. The hallway felt darker. The door to 3C looked unchanged, but now he saw it differently—not as a neighbor’s entrance, but as a sealed gate. A lid on something buried.

He didn’t sleep that night. Not deeply. But at some point, he must’ve drifted off.

He woke to knocking.

Not on his door.

On the inside of his wall.

Five sharp knocks. Close. Then silence.

He approached the wall slowly, dread thick in his throat. As he neared, the knocks repeated, then paused.

Then a voice.

Not muffled. Not distant.

Clear.

Right next to his ear.

“Let me in.”

Isaac stumbled back, heart pounding.

Then he did something he hadn’t intended—he knocked back. Three quick raps.

For a moment, nothing.

Then from the other side:

Knock.
Knock.
Knock.

In perfect response.

Isaac stood frozen, hand still raised.

He hadn’t imagined it. Something—someone—was on the other side.

And they were listening.

Isaac barely slept the rest of that night. He spent the early hours pacing his small living room, glancing at the wall between units every few minutes as if it might open or bleed or speak. The silence after the final knock was even worse than the noise—it hung thick and expectant, like the pause in a horror film before the scream. At one point, near dawn, he caught himself pressing his fingers lightly against the drywall again, waiting for a pulse.

He laughed. A short, raw sound. Then stopped when he heard something shift beyond the wall.

No more knocks came, but the silence felt charged.

By seven a.m., he’d showered, dressed, and gathered a backpack full of excuses to stay out: laptop, charger, a novel he hadn’t touched in months, and a granola bar. He left without looking back at the hallway door.

The city helped. For a while.

He worked from a café downtown, a place with soft jazz playing and too many windows. He kept checking his phone, replaying the voice he’d recorded the night before. It was faint, but clear:

“Let me in.”

He couldn’t decide what chilled him more—that the voice seemed to be asking, or that it knew he was there to hear it.

By midday, he debated showing the recording to someone. Police? Ridiculous. What would he say—there’s a ghost in my wall? A squatter whispering bedtime requests? Maybe the landlord again, but Carlos had barely blinked before. It was just as likely he’d think Isaac was pulling a prank.

In the end, he did nothing.

He stayed out until the sun was gone, dinner eaten on a bench in the park, watching strangers walk dogs and argue on phones and live lives that didn’t brush against hidden voices or knocking walls.

Still, the thought of his apartment waited for him, coiled and patient.

He came back just after nine, gripping the doorknob to 3B longer than necessary before pushing inside. The air felt wrong. Too still, like the apartment had been holding its breath while he was gone.

Everything looked the same—sofa, shelves, dishes in the sink—but the atmosphere was off-kilter. He crossed the living room slowly, paused near the wall that bordered 3C. Nothing. No sounds. No knocks. No whispers.

He waited. And waited longer.

Eventually, convinced he was just worked up from no sleep and too much caffeine, he turned on a movie and tried to relax. Horror, of all things. Something vintage. He liked the way the grain softened everything, even the fear.

It was almost midnight when the picture on the screen began to glitch—just a flicker at first. He thought it might be his streaming service acting up. But then it happened again. And again. Until, instead of the film, the screen went white.

Then black.

Then the sound came.

Not from the movie.

From the wall.

A voice again, clearer this time. No distortion, no drywall to muffle it.

“You’re awake.”

He turned slowly, the remote slipping from his fingers.

The voice wasn’t just near. It was in the room.

He checked the window—closed. The hallway—empty. But the air felt thick again, humid, and humming.

He stared at the wall. No voice followed. No repetition.

Only that single sentence, left hanging.

He picked up his phone, pressed record again, and whispered, “Who are you?”

At first, nothing.

Then a sound, like breath.
Then—

“I remember you.”

He dropped the phone.

The voice wasn’t threatening. It wasn’t kind either. It was full of something else.

Recognition.

The next morning, Isaac stayed home.

It wasn’t a decision he made—he just didn’t leave. The thought of going out into the brightness of day, pretending the last three nights hadn’t happened, felt impossible. Instead, he paced. He wrote in his notebook. He Googled things: apartment voices, wall knocking meaning, shared hallucinations, schizophrenia symptoms, haunted building East Ridge. Nothing helpful.

Around noon, he knocked on 3C again.

No answer.

He crouched and peered under the door. No light. No shadow.

“Hello?” he tried again. “Listen. If someone’s in there—I don’t care. Just—stop messing with me. Please.”

Nothing.

He stayed crouched a moment longer, then sighed, rose—and froze.

Behind him, from inside 3B—

A knock.

Not from 3C.

From his apartment.

He turned. The door was still closed.

But the knock hadn’t come from the hallway. It had come from inside.

He went back in slowly, heart hammering. The living room was quiet. Kitchen too.

Then he saw it.

The bathroom door was ajar. It had been closed when he left.

He reached out, pushed it gently open.

The mirror had fogged.

The tap was dripping.

But the air was cold.

He leaned closer to the mirror. Wiped it with his palm.

Three words were written on the glass in faint condensation:

“It’s not me.”

He stumbled backward, slammed the bathroom door shut.

And then he heard footsteps.

Not from above.

Not from outside.

From beneath the floorboards, walking directly under his feet, slow and steady, pacing the same path he had taken all morning.

That night, he didn’t sleep.

He sat against the wall again, but this time with a pen and a notepad.

He waited.

And eventually, the voice returned.

“I’m sorry.”

Isaac’s hand trembled as he wrote it down.

“What do you want?” he whispered.

Long silence.

Then:

“To remember.”

He wanted to scream. To ask what that meant, to demand clarity, but he already knew he wouldn’t get it. Not yet. He swallowed, and against better judgment, he said:

“What’s your name?”

Silence.

Longer this time.

Just when he thought the conversation was over—

“It used to be yours.”

Isaac didn’t speak for the rest of the night. He couldn’t. His voice felt trapped behind his teeth, as though anything he might say would open a door best left shut. He sat on the floor beside his bed until dawn, notebook open in his lap, pen resting useless in his hand. The message—the last message—still rang in his ears like tinnitus: “It used to be yours.”

He tried to rationalize it, to put it through filters. Maybe it was just a dream again. Sleep deprivation could make the brain do strange things. Maybe there was mold in the walls. Maybe he was having a breakdown.

But the messages on the mirror. The thumping. The synchronized knocks. The voice that shifted, changed, responded.

Those weren’t dream logic. They were specific.

They were real.

And now, apparently, they were personal.

That morning he called his sister. Not because he intended to explain everything—he had no plan for that—but because she was the only person he trusted to notice if he started to unravel. The call went straight to voicemail. He left a message, casual-sounding, asking her to call back when she could.

Afterward, he sat on the floor again, watching the bathroom door like it might move. It didn’t. But the silence inside it felt sentient. Oppressive.

He went into the kitchen, made toast he didn’t eat, boiled water he forgot to pour into anything.

By noon, he’d decided to leave the apartment again.

Not to flee.

To test something.

He brought the notebook, his phone, and the pen. Walked six blocks west to a quieter part of the neighborhood. Found a public bench under a tree. He sat. Waited.

No thumps. No voices.

He opened the notebook and read over what he had written the night before. “What’s your name?” “It used to be yours.”

He flipped to the next page.

Started writing.

"What do you mean it was my name?"

A moment passed. Wind shifted the corner of the page.

He waited. Nothing.

He clicked the pen closed and tucked it behind his ear, staring at the line he’d written. A leaf landed beside him on the bench. Yellow. Veined.

When he turned to pick it up, he noticed something else.

Another note.

Folded, resting right beside him on the bench. It hadn’t been there before.

He picked it up.

Three words, in the same handwriting as the mirror.

"You're getting close."

He stood abruptly, spinning in place.

The street was quiet. A man walked his dog on the other side, uninterested. A delivery truck passed. No one looked at him. No one moved away in a suspicious hurry.

He turned the note over.

Blank on the back.

He stuffed it into his notebook and walked home fast, head down, heart thumping like the knocks.

That night, he waited.

He didn’t turn on any lights. He sat on the floor again, not against the wall this time, but by the window. A different vantage point. He wanted to see if the voice was tied to proximity.

For hours, nothing.

Then, around 1:40 a.m., something changed.

The shadows in the room rearranged themselves—not visibly, but in feel. Like the depth of the dark got deeper. Like the space between his shoulders and the back wall grew narrower. Claustrophobic.

Then: the knock.

Once.

Twice.

Then silence.

And the voice, no longer faint, no longer muffled.

It came from every direction.

“I didn’t mean to leave.”

He closed his eyes. “Who are you?”

“You were me before you forgot.”

“No,” Isaac whispered. “That doesn’t make any sense.”

“You gave me away.”

His voice cracked. “I don’t know what that means.”

“You named me wrong. And then you left.”

He stood. "This is a game. You’re not real."

The shadows pulsed.

And then:

“Check the photos.”

It took him five tries to unlock the hard drive he hadn’t used in years.

It had been buried in a drawer since he moved. His life before East Ridge was fragmented—a mix of cities, jobs, failed friendships, a broken engagement. He didn’t have the stomach to look through most of it, but now he scrolled through the folders with increasing desperation, unsure what he was searching for.

Then he found it. A file named “OTHER.” No date. No tags.

Inside: photographs.

Mostly blurry. Mostly nothing.

But one image caught his eye.

A hallway.

Not from this building. But familiar.

The wallpaper—same shade of green.

The door, just visible at the end—painted black, not brown. Marked not 3C, but 13.

In the corner of the photo, just barely in frame, a figure. Too blurred to make out clearly.

But the posture. The shape. The tilt of the head.

It looked like him.

Only—

Different.

Older?

Wearing something unfamiliar—a coat he’d never owned. Staring directly at the camera.

He checked the photo’s metadata. No date. No geotag.

Nothing.

He stared at the screen, the figure in the photo seeming to loom closer the longer he looked.

And then the computer crashed.

Not just a freeze. A full shutdown.

When it came back on, the folder was gone.

The next night, he didn’t wait for the voice.

He tried speaking first.

He sat on the floor, notebook in his lap.

“I saw the photo,” he said softly. “I don’t know where it came from, or who you are, or why you’re doing this—but I saw it.”

He waited.

Silence.

Then:

“There were two of us. There were always two.”

“Two what?”

“Versions. Halves. Names.”

He scribbled it down in the notebook. “Are you saying you’re... me?”

“I’m the piece you buried. The piece you renamed.”

He shook his head. “I don’t remember anything like that. I swear. I didn’t... do anything.”

“Then let me show you.”

He froze. “How?”

Silence.

Then—beneath his feet—the floor creaked once, twice.

The same rhythm as the knocks.

And slowly, the air grew cold again.

This time, the bathroom door opened on its own.

Inside, the mirror was fogged again.

Only this time, the message was different.

“Under the floor.”

Chapter Two: Beneath the Silence

Isaac stared at the message on the mirror for a long time before he moved. The words—“Under the floor”—weren’t smudged this time. They were etched in perfect arcs through the condensation, too clean, too deliberate. Like someone—or something—had written them from the inside of the glass.

He backed out of the bathroom and stood in the doorway, chest tight. The room behind him looked ordinary. Worn linoleum, old plumbing, aging fixtures. But now it all felt artificial. A stage set. Behind it, another version of truth waited.

He crouched and tapped the floor. It gave a dull knock back. Hollow. He moved through the apartment like someone tracing a bruise, testing spots on the floorboards, pressing, knocking, listening. Near the bed, he found it—a slight shift under pressure. Just enough movement to suggest something not quite locked in place.

He retrieved a screwdriver from the junk drawer. Kneeling, he wedged it under the seam between two boards. They lifted with surprising ease, and beneath them—darkness.

Not insulation. Not pipes. Just a gap, maybe three feet deep, lined with what looked like old brick and something more modern: concrete. There were markings on the walls—scratches, lines etched like someone had kept a tally of days passed.

He lowered a flashlight into the opening.

At the bottom, something metallic gleamed.

It was a box.

The box was heavier than it looked. Small—shoebox-sized—but solid, lined in rust and flaking at the corners. No lock, just a latch worn smooth with time. He set it on the coffee table, hesitating. The apartment felt dense around him, like the air itself was bracing for whatever might come next.

He opened the latch.

Inside: papers. Not many. Faded and curled at the edges, the ink browned with age. A cassette tape. A Polaroid. A name scrawled in capital letters on the topmost page:

ISAIAH DANE.

Not his name.

And yet—

His name.

His body tensed as he read the first page. It was a form. An old psych intake sheet. Client: Isaiah Dane. Age: 21. Date: April 8, 2016. Under "Reason for Visit," someone had written, in all caps: PERSISTENT HALLUCINATIONS / MEMORY DISSOCIATION / UNIDENTIFIED DOPPELGANGER.

Isaac let the page fall back into the box.

The name echoed in his skull: Isaiah Dane.

He didn’t know it.

But it knew him.

He picked up the Polaroid. A hallway again. The same shade of green on the walls. A different building, maybe. Or maybe not. In the center of the photo was a man—blurry, unsmiling. His eyes blacked out by a smear across the image, deliberate and violent. But the chin, the cheekbones, even the tilt of his shoulders—

Isaac.

Or someone nearly identical.

He turned the photo over.

Written in pen, in scratchy, desperate hand: “The wrong one left.”

He reached for the cassette, hands shaking. It was unmarked except for a number scratched faintly into the side: 13.

No player.

He dug through drawers, closets, boxes—until in a bin of old electronics, he found one. Battery-operated, dusty, but still intact. He slid the cassette in and pressed play.

Static. Then—

Breathing.

Shallow, terrified breathing.

Then a voice.

“I don’t know who I am anymore,” it said. “They told me to watch him. Said he was the key. But I—he—he left, and I stayed, and now I don’t know if I’m the real one or the echo. I think I remember his life. I think I remember being him. But he has my face.”

A pause. A sob.

“I can’t get out of the building. Every exit leads back to the door. Every door is 3C.”

Click.

The tape ended.

Isaac didn’t sleep that night. He lay on the couch, eyes fixed on the ceiling, the box still open on the table like a wound. Every few minutes, he replayed the tape, memorizing the inflections. Was it his voice? Could it have been?

He couldn’t decide.

By dawn, he had a plan.

He wrote a note: If I disappear, I lived in 3B. My name was Isaac. Please find 3C. He left it taped to the inside of the kitchen cabinet, behind the cereal box. Just in case.

Then he dressed, packed the box in his backpack, and went to the only place he thought might hold answers: the city archive building.

The archive sat like a concrete tomb just off 12th and Harper. Isaac had only been there once before, helping a friend research an old family deed. Inside, it smelled like dust and forgotten air. He approached the records desk with the box hidden under his arm.

The clerk barely looked up. “Name or address?”

“Apartment 3C, 212 East Ridge,” he said.

She typed something, frowned.

“Nothing for 3C. 3A, B, D, and E are on file. C is blank. No utility history, no lease. It’s a dead entry.”

Isaac leaned forward. “Was it ever listed?”

The woman checked again. “Last record for that unit is from 1998. A demolition request was filed—says the interior was gutted. No confirmation it was rebuilt.”

“But I live next door to it.”

She shrugged. “Then the record’s wrong. Or someone built it illegally.”

He hesitated, then slid the intake form across the desk. “Can you find anything on him? Isaiah Dane.”

She typed. Scanned.

Then frowned again.

“There’s a sealed file under that name. Psychiatry hold. County records, not city. You’ll need a court order to open it.”

Isaac nodded slowly, thanked her, and left.

Outside, the sky had dimmed, though it was barely noon. The clouds rolled heavy, like something just out of reach was pressing down on the city.

He returned to his apartment.

Inside, everything felt slightly out of place.

The couch faced the wrong direction.

His keys were not where he left them.

The bathroom door was shut, though he hadn’t touched it.

He approached it slowly.

Opened it.

The mirror was clean now. No writing.

But something else had been left behind.

A photograph taped to the glass.

This time, it was of him—sitting on his own couch.

Taken from behind.

He hadn’t felt watched.

But someone—or something—had been there.

He peeled it from the glass.

On the back: “You came back. Now stay.”

And beneath that, written in smaller letters, almost invisible:

“If you leave again, I’ll replace you.”

Isaac dropped the photograph onto the floor like it had burned him. He stared at it from where it landed near the bathroom threshold, the words on the back sticking in his thoughts like a sliver. “If you leave again, I’ll replace you.” The phrasing wasn’t just a warning—it was personal. Again. The implication that he’d already abandoned something, someone. Or worse, himself.

He turned on every light in the apartment.

The place looked ordinary, unchanged except for tiny dislocations—curtains parted slightly differently, the couch cushion he always sat on now slightly sunken, as if someone else had used it. The difference was microscopic, but to Isaac, it shouted. The apartment had been entered. Not broken into—entered. By something that didn’t need keys.

He sat on the edge of the bed, the photo still burning a hole in his memory, and opened his notebook.

“I’m not who I thought I was,” he wrote.

“There’s someone else with my face. With my memories. Maybe I’m the echo. Or maybe he is. But one of us is going to have to leave.”

He paused. Then scratched out leave and replaced it with disappear.

The next knock didn’t come from the wall. It came from the front door.

A crisp triple knock. Daylight still streamed through the window, but the sound was sharp, intentional.

Isaac froze.

No one knocked here. Not neighbors, not delivery, not friends—he had few of those left. The hallway peephole showed nothing but the chipped green paint of the corridor.

He cracked the door open.

A man stood there. Average height, early fifties, wearing a faded charcoal jacket and thin glasses that hung crooked on his nose. His eyes were sharp. Too sharp.

“Isaac?” he asked, as if it were only partly a question.

“Yes?”

The man held up a small ID badge, too quickly for Isaac to read the name. “City compliance. Following up on reports about a unit irregularity. 3C.”

Isaac blinked. “You’re here about 3C?”

The man nodded. “May I come in?”

Isaac hesitated, the memory of the photo and the voice warning him not to open doors echoing in his mind. “Do you have something in writing? A report or...?”

The man didn’t flinch. He reached into his coat pocket, pulled out a folded sheet of paper, and handed it over. It looked official enough—Department of Housing and Structural Review—but the font was off. Too modern. The watermark didn’t shimmer like it should.

“I’m sorry,” Isaac said, voice firmer than he expected. “I’m not comfortable letting anyone in.”

The man stared at him for a moment. Then smiled.

“Smart.”

Then he turned and walked away, slow, unhurried.

Isaac closed the door. Locked it. Then bolted it.

Then checked the window.

The man was gone.

Not at the stairwell. Not at the elevator.

Just gone.

He stood there for a full minute, heart hammering.

Then a voice whispered behind him—

“Good. You remembered the rules.”

The next day, Isaac started researching old city plans. Anything he could find online that might explain the strange history of 3C. He pulled up zoning blueprints, demolition notices, property tax records. Over and over, he ran into the same inconsistency: 3C wasn’t supposed to exist. The blueprints showed apartments A, B, D, and E. No C. Always skipped. In some documents, there was even a note: “3C REMOVED – PER REQUEST.”

Whose request?

No name listed. No date.

He spent six hours compiling what he could. Floorplans from the 1980s showed a fire wall in place of 3C. Older ones showed a janitor’s closet, then a dumbwaiter shaft, then nothing.

And then, in a crumbling PDF scan of a zoning meeting from 1996, he found a line buried in the minutes:

“Tenants have raised concerns about residual occupancy in 3C. Recommendation: seal and redact. Vote passed: 4–1.”

Residual occupancy.

He didn’t like the sound of that.

He printed it out anyway.

Then another knock came.

Not the door. Not the wall.

The floor.

Three dull thuds from below, spaced apart. Not mechanical. Not plumbing.

Footsteps.

That night, he returned to the gap under the floorboards, flashlight in hand.

He hadn’t noticed it the first time, but now he saw it: beneath the bricks, just barely visible, a hatch. Metal, covered in dust. The edge was bolted down with old screws, but corrosion had loosened one side. He pulled at it until it creaked open, revealing a shaft leading downward.

A ladder, rusted but solid, descended into darkness.

Isaac stood at the threshold for a long time.

Then he climbed down.

It wasn’t far—maybe ten feet—but when his feet touched the ground, he was somewhere else entirely. The air was warmer. The space smelled like earth and mildew. The light from his flashlight caught shapes—walls made of stone, not brick. Pipes wrapped like veins across the ceiling. He turned and realized he was standing in a narrow corridor.

At the far end: a door.

Black.

Faintly marked with the number 13.

He approached it slowly, heart thudding like thunder in his chest. There was no doorknob. Just a slot at shoulder height, wide enough to slide something through.

As he reached out, the door breathed.

Not literally. But that’s how it felt.

It flexed inward. Like it recognized him.

Then a voice came, close, intimate.

“You found the center. You can come in now.”

“No,” Isaac whispered. “Not until I know what you are.”

Silence.

Then the voice again.

“You were the door.”

He stepped back.

Turned. Climbed up the ladder.

And as he pulled the floorboard back into place above him, he saw, etched on the inside of the wood, a single word burned into the grain:

ISAIAH.

Back in his apartment, the mirror had fogged again.

A new message waited:

“One of us must stay.”

Isaac wrote in the notebook, hands shaking:

“Which one am I?”

And this time, the reply didn’t come from the wall.

It came from the mirror.

From his reflection.

Which didn’t move when he did.

And smiled.

Chapter Three: Through the Mirror

The reflection stood too still. Isaac blinked, but his mirrored self did not. The smile stayed in place, slight and slanted, a knowing curve of the mouth that did not belong to him—not really. It looked like a memory of a smile. A smile he hadn’t made in years, not consciously, but now recognized all too well. And the eyes—the reflection's eyes—were not blinking. They stared back, unblinking, as if they were studying him, as if the mirror had stopped mimicking and started watching.

Isaac took a cautious step back. The reflection did not move.

His mouth was dry. He whispered, “What are you?”

The reflection tilted its head to the side.

A mimicry, finally, but not a perfect one.

Then, slowly, the mirrored version of himself raised one hand and pressed its palm against the glass. Isaac didn’t move, didn’t raise his own hand to match it.

The handprint appeared on the glass anyway.

It was faint. Smudged like condensation. But it was there.

A moment later, words began to bloom underneath the print, not written but forming, as though the breath of the reflection carried shape:

“I never left.”

Isaac stepped closer. “You were... in me? All this time?”

The reflection blinked once, finally, and in that instant, a series of overlapping images pulsed in the glass behind it. Like memories or impressions—his childhood bedroom, the old apartment in Queens, a face he couldn’t place—dark-haired, shouting in a room with no windows. A subway tunnel with no trains. And then the hallway again. Always the green-painted hallway. Always door 3C.

He stared. The reflection opened its mouth.

But no words came out.

Instead, the mirror surface rippled. Liquid-like, just for a moment.

And then—

The reflection stepped forward.

Out.

He didn’t scream.

Isaac froze as his mirrored self stood before him in the cramped bathroom, real, solid, identical in every way down to the callus on his left thumb, the faint crescent-shaped scar on his chin. The other Isaac—or perhaps Isaiah—smiled again.

“I’ve been waiting for you to open the door,” the double said.

Isaac couldn’t move. “You're not supposed to be here.”

“I’ve always been here,” the double said, turning his head to glance at the mirror. “You just forgot.”

“Why now?”

“Because you were getting too far away. You almost left completely. But something brought you back.”

Isaac swallowed hard. “The knocking?”

His double nodded. “A warning. Not from me. From the building. It wants to stay whole.”

Isaac took a step back toward the hallway. “You need to leave.”

The double raised his hand. “No. I need to stay. One of us does. That was the agreement.”

“What agreement?”

“We were never supposed to exist separately. You left. You named yourself Isaac. You tried to forget. But you can’t erase what was made inside this place.”

Isaac shook his head. “I don’t remember. I don’t even know what I left.”

“You left me.” The voice cracked slightly, the smile faltering. “You took the name and the face and the freedom. And you left me with the door.”

“The door under the floor.”

The double nodded. “It’s more than a door. It’s a hold. A binding. Every apartment in this place is a layer. Every wall remembers. And when you broke that memory, it cracked.”

Isaac’s legs felt unsteady. He backed out of the bathroom and into the living room, the double following slowly, not threateningly—but not harmlessly either. He looked at the couch, the photographs, the notebook.

“This is my life,” Isaac whispered. “I made it.”

“No,” the double said, eyes steady. “You borrowed it.”

For the next hour, the two of them sat in the living room, opposite ends of the couch, like twins at a wake. They didn’t speak at first. Isaac was too afraid, too fascinated. The double sat like a patient echo, letting the silence breathe. Eventually, Isaac found his voice again.

“If you’re me,” he said quietly, “then what happens now?”

The double looked out the window.

“I don’t know. It’s never gone this far. You weren’t supposed to come back.”

“Is that why you left the messages? To stop me?”

“No. That was the building.”

“The building?”

“Yes. This place—East Ridge—is older than its bricks. Older than the blueprints. It remembers everyone who’s tried to rewrite themselves here. It lets you escape once. But not twice.”

Isaac’s mind reeled. “Escape from what?”

“From yourself.”

He stood, couldn’t sit still anymore. “Why me? Why any of this?”

The double didn’t answer immediately. Then he said:

“Because when you were still Isaiah, you found the center. And you split it. That doesn’t get undone by forgetting.”

Isaac walked to the wall where the knocking had first started. He pressed his palm to it. Cold, smooth. Solid.

“How do I fix this?”

The double’s voice was quiet behind him.

“You don’t. You choose. One of us stays. One of us goes back.”

“To the door?”

The double nodded.

“And what happens to the one who goes back?”

“They become the story. The version that was forgotten. Bound to the mirror, to the floor, to the walls.”

Isaac turned. “That’s not a choice.”

The double looked sad. “It’s the only one the building allows.”

That night, Isaac dreamed.

The hallway again, only longer than before. He walked for hours, it seemed, past doors that pulsed with warmth and cold. Some were open, revealing empty rooms. Others whispered.

When he reached the end of the hall, a mirror stood there instead of a wall.

He approached.

Inside it, he saw not one, but three reflections.

Each one turned their head slightly, looked directly at him.

And smiled.

He woke with the double still asleep on the couch. Or pretending to be asleep. He looked peaceful. Like he belonged there.

Isaac dressed quietly. Picked up the notebook. Added a new entry:

“He says we were never supposed to exist at the same time. That I took the face, the freedom. That I borrowed my life. I don’t know if I believe him. But I don’t know if I don’t, either. There’s a choice coming. And I don’t think I’m the one in control.”

He paused, then turned the page and wrote:

“I think I want to know who I really was. Even if I can’t keep it.”

He closed the book.

And felt the floor shift slightly beneath his feet.

The double didn’t speak the rest of that morning. He sat on the couch, leafing through the notebook Isaac had left open. His eyes didn’t scan like a casual reader’s; they followed, slow and careful, absorbing each word like someone returning to a memory long buried. Isaac stood in the kitchen, watching from behind the half-wall. He didn’t know what disturbed him more: the fact that this thing—this other him—could walk freely through his home, or the way it moved like it had always belonged there.

Isaac poured a cup of coffee and set it down on the table across from the double.

He didn’t say “thank you.” Just nodded once and kept reading.

After a long pause, Isaac finally asked, “If this is the building’s doing, then why not just... force the choice? Why give me time?”

The double closed the notebook and met his eyes. “Because it needs you to understand before you accept. It’s not punishment. It’s preservation. This place was designed for memory. It doesn’t destroy its tenants. It archives them.”

Isaac folded his arms. “That’s not comforting.”

“It shouldn’t be. You came here to forget. But that act fractured something. The echo of what you left behind didn’t just vanish. It stayed. It waited.”

“You.”

The double nodded. “Yes. Me. But not just me. Every person who’s tried to change their story in this place has left some part of themselves behind. Some fragment. And the building keeps them. Catalogs them.”

Isaac leaned against the wall. “Like a library of ghosts.”

The double smiled faintly. “More like a filing cabinet of unfinished selves.”

The silence hung there for a moment.

Then Isaac said, “So what happens if I choose to stay?”

“You live,” the double said. “You continue. But you live with the knowledge that someone else held the cost. That there’s a version of you, truer maybe, deeper, who took the fall.”

“And if I go?”

The double’s voice softened. “Then you return to the archive. Not as punishment. Just... as preservation.”

Isaac stared at the cup of coffee cooling between them.

“I want to see it again,” he said. “The place below.”

The double nodded, standing. “Then we go together.”

They descended in silence.

Isaac had reinforced the boards after his first trip down, but now the screws came out with ease—as if the apartment had been waiting. When he lifted the wood, the same metal hatch yawned open beneath. The ladder creaked under their weight as they descended.

The corridor below was darker than before.

Something had changed.

The air was thicker, humid, as if the walls themselves were sweating.

At the end of the corridor, the black door marked 13 stood waiting.

The slot was gone now.

There was a handle.

Isaac reached for it.

The double laid a hand on his wrist.

“This door doesn’t open out,” he said quietly. “It opens in.”

Isaac swallowed. “What’s in there?”

“Everything you thought you left behind.”

He pulled the handle.

The room inside was vast. Much larger than the building could’ve allowed. It stretched endlessly in all directions, a featureless floor that absorbed light without reflecting it. In the center, a single chair. No windows. No walls. Only the dark and the chair.

Isaac stepped forward. The door vanished behind him.

The double followed.

And then, just ahead of them, a third figure materialized.

It wore a mask. A porcelain white surface with no expression. It stood beside the chair, unmoving. Waiting.

Isaac whispered, “Is that...?”

The double nodded. “That’s the Archivist.”

The figure gestured to the chair.

Isaac hesitated. “What happens if I sit?”

“You’ll see what was removed. And you’ll decide whether to take it back.”

Isaac stepped toward the chair. Every instinct screamed against it. But something deeper—curiosity, guilt, hunger—compelled him forward. He sat.

And the room disappeared.

He was seventeen.

Standing at the edge of a lake he hadn’t thought of in years. His brother, younger by two years, sat beside him with a bloodied nose, tears streaming down his cheeks. Isaac remembered now—he’d hit him. Not hard. But hard enough. Their parents had been shouting in the house, and he’d taken the chaos and redirected it.

He watched himself in the memory. The guilt. The silence. The way he’d never apologized.

The scene blinked.

Now he was twenty-one.

In a stairwell, holding a cigarette with shaking hands, a letter unopened in his pocket. A scholarship, the one he’d wanted, the one he’d earned. But he never opened it. He never left. He told himself it got lost in the mail. But he’d known. He’d chosen to stay because the thought of leaving terrified him more than the failure of staying.

Blink.

Twenty-three.

A door. A man with dark eyes.

“You need to tell them,” the man said.

But Isaac—Isaiah—shook his head. “No one would believe it.”

Then the door slammed.

And he forgot the man ever existed.

The chair dissolved beneath him.

He stood again in the vast room.

The Archivist was gone.

The double stood alone now, staring at him across the space.

Isaac stepped forward. “I remember.”

The double nodded.

“Then you’re ready.”

Isaac approached slowly. “So what now? Do I step back into the mirror?”

The double shook his head. “You choose. One of us leaves.”

The silence expanded again. Somewhere, deep in the walls, Isaac felt the building shift, listening.

He reached out.

Touched the double’s shoulder.

And whispered:

“I think it was always supposed to be you.”

The double smiled. Not a smirk, not a warning. Something genuine.

“I know.”

And then he stepped back into the dark.

And vanished.

Isaac woke in his bed.

Alone.

The apartment was still.

The air was normal.

The mirror reflected his movements exactly.

He stood, looked around, half-expecting some message scrawled in condensation or a knock behind the wall.

Nothing.

He checked the floor.

The hatch was gone.

Just wood now. Seamless.

As if nothing had ever been opened.

But his notebook still sat on the table.

Open to a new page.

One he hadn’t written.

It read:

“You chose. The archive remembers. But now you are whole.”

And underneath that, smaller:

“Live it well.”

Isaac sat down.

And for the first time in a very long time, he didn’t feel watched.

He felt seen.

The rest of the day passed in quiet. The kind of quiet that seemed to pulse, not from absence but from something deliberately choosing not to speak. Isaac walked from room to room, inspecting every detail of the apartment. The books remained in the exact order he’d left them. The windows looked out on the same worn brick wall and the rusted fire escape. But everything felt subtly refreshed, as if the apartment had exhaled along with him.

He opened the closet in the hallway—just to check—and found it unchanged. No hidden trapdoor. No mirror. Just coats and shoes. Still, he stared at the floor a beat longer than necessary, waiting for it to give way. It didn’t.

In the kitchen, the toaster worked. The kettle hissed as expected. The light above the sink still buzzed faintly. All of it unremarkable, normal.

That was what disturbed him most.

For five months, the mystery of Apartment 3C had clung to him like mold under paint—always there, always pressing through, impossible to ignore. But now that the presence had faded—now that the double was gone—he realized how much of his identity had become bound to the unraveling.

The silence no longer beckoned.

It loitered.

By early evening, Isaac walked out into the hallway. He stood outside 3C, staring at the door. The paint seemed duller, more faded. He put his palm flat against it, half-expecting the cold to jolt him again.

Nothing. Lukewarm, dry.

He knocked once.

No reply.

He bent down, tried to peer under the door again—but now there was no gap. The wood met the threshold flush, perfectly sealed. Even the faint smell of old dust and metal, which had always seemed to radiate from 3C, was gone.

He stood up, turned around—and startled.

At the far end of the hallway stood a man.

Middle-aged. Tall. Wearing a gray coat, familiar in its anonymity. Not the same man from the faux city department days ago, but similar enough to raise Isaac’s nerves.

The man raised a hand in greeting, then approached slowly.

“You’re the one who filed the inquiry,” he said. “About this unit.”

Isaac squinted. “I didn’t file anything.”

The man reached into his pocket and pulled out a small envelope. “Did you not submit this at the archive building?” He handed it to Isaac. “Your handwriting. Or someone’s.”

Isaac opened the envelope.

Inside: a single form, a rough carbon copy. Not from the archive.

From a building that didn’t exist anymore. The Hollow Index Bureau, it read. He stared at the letterhead, unsure whether it was official or invented. His name was printed clearly at the top: Isaac (formerly Isaiah) Dane.

In the description field: “Confirmed breach event in unit 3C. Archive tether reestablished. Identity resolution pending.”

“I don’t remember writing this,” Isaac said, voice thin.

The man nodded slowly. “Sometimes the memory belongs to the version you aren’t using.”

Isaac looked up. “Are you with the city?”

“No. I’m with the threshold.”

“The what?”

“Not a place,” the man said. “A function. We’re the ones who close the loops. When the walls begin to split. When rooms start remembering too much. We make sure the archive is sealed properly.”

Isaac held up the form. “Is it sealed now?”

The man considered, then nodded once. “As well as it can be. For now. But it’s not a permanent fix. You understand that.”

“No,” Isaac said flatly. “I really don’t.”

“You are the loop now,” the man said. “You closed it by returning. By choosing. But the memory of the fracture remains. The building won’t forget. It never does.”

Isaac stared at the door of 3C. “So... what? I’m part of it now?”

“You always were,” the man said gently. “But now you're the active version. The one outside. The archive has what it needs. It will sleep until someone else tries to split their name again.”

Isaac folded the form and tucked it into his back pocket.

“Will I remember all of this in a year? Ten?”

The man shrugged. “Some of it. Enough.”

Isaac narrowed his eyes. “What happens if I move out?”

“You won’t,” the man said. “Not really.”

He turned to go, walked toward the stairwell. Just before he disappeared down the steps, he added without turning around:

“Watch the mirrors. If they lag again, the breach might be trying to reopen.”

Then he was gone.

That night, Isaac sat in front of the mirror again.

This time it reflected him perfectly.

He moved his hand. The reflection mirrored it. He leaned forward. It did the same. There was no flicker, no delay, no hidden smirk.

Still, he whispered to it. Just once.

“Are you still in there?”

The reflection didn’t answer.

But something in its eyes seemed softer.

Not gone.

Just resting.

The following days passed like normal life, only now, normal felt suspect. Every knock at a neighbor’s door made him freeze. Every change in light through the window felt like it carried weight. He went to work. He went grocery shopping. He texted his sister again—this time, she answered. They talked about nothing important. He didn’t mention the building.

He dreamed often.

Always corridors.

But the dreams were quieter now.

Not frantic, not terrifying. Just long, slow walks through shifting walls. Occasionally, he’d pass a mirror in the dream. Sometimes his reflection would nod.

Once, it waved.

He waved back.

On the seventh day, he found a new note in the notebook.

He hadn't opened it in a week.

But there it was.

His own handwriting.

Though he hadn’t written it.

“There will come a time when someone else forgets their name. When they push too hard against the story. When they knock on the wrong door. When that happens, remember the way back. Remember who you were. And choose again.”

Isaac closed the book.

Left it on the windowsill, in the full sun.

Let it warm.

And for the first time since the knocking began, he didn’t feel like someone waiting for a door to open.

He felt like someone who had closed one.

And knew what was on the other side.

Chapter Four: Rooms That Remember

Two weeks passed. Life resumed, or at least a version of it did. Isaac followed routines—brushing teeth, morning coffee, checking his email, walking to the corner store for groceries he sometimes didn’t cook. On the surface, he seemed reabsorbed into the day-to-day mechanisms of urban solitude. But underneath, his perception of the world had changed permanently. Everything he did now moved against a backdrop of uncertainty, of layered meanings. Every space, every wall, felt like it was paying quiet attention. Not watching. Not judging. Just remembering.

And one morning, the building remembered something new.

It started with a voice—not the kind that called through the walls or rose from the floorboards. It was real. Human. A woman’s voice, carried faintly through the hallway.

She was knocking.

On 3C.

Isaac was already awake. He had been standing at the kitchen sink, watching steam curl from his mug, when the sound broke the silence. His body reacted faster than his mind—he stepped into the hall, drawn not by curiosity but by instinct. As if he were tethered now, by some responsibility the others didn't know they carried.

She stood there, hand poised for another knock, her posture rigid. Late twenties, maybe. Short black hair tucked behind her ears. Eyes that had already seen something they shouldn’t have.

She turned at the sound of his door opening.

“Oh,” she said. “I didn’t mean to—startle you.”

Isaac shook his head. “You’re knocking on 3C.”

Her mouth pressed into a line. “Yeah. My cousin used to live here. Or—I think she did.”

“No one lives there,” he said quietly.

“That’s what they told me downstairs.” She paused. “But her last letter—she said she was staying with someone in 3C. She said she’d found a place where the walls talked back.”

Isaac’s blood chilled.

“Do you remember her name?”

“Ayla. Ayla Jensen.”

The name didn’
