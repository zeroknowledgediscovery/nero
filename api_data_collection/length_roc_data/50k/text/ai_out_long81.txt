Title: Ashes of the Decade

Chapter One: The Ten-Year Drift

It had been ten years since Nathan Farren had done anything with purpose. A decade of smoke rings, unpaid parking tickets, aimless nights, and unremembered mornings. His life had become an uneven terrain of excuses and missteps, a mosaic of missed calls and missed chances. Somewhere along the way, responsibility had become not just a nuisance—but an ancient concept, almost mythological in nature. At 35, Nathan lived in a cramped studio in South Boston, nestled above a laundromat that hummed day and night. His mattress sat directly on the floor, sunken in the middle. Half-empty bottles populated every flat surface.

He woke up on a Thursday in April with the sharp taste of gin and orange juice caked at the back of his throat. His phone buzzed beneath a hoodie. The screen lit up: "Joanne - 4 Missed Calls". He squinted. Joanne. The name held weight, a name he hadn’t heard out loud in months. He ran a hand through his hair, greasy and overgrown.

Nathan didn't call her back. Instead, he staggered into the kitchen—which was really just a corner with a hot plate—and poured cereal into a chipped bowl. No milk.

At some point, the world outside his window changed. The sky turned a grayish orange, the kind of color that suggested something significant had happened or was about to. Sirens, or maybe just a dog barking. Hard to say.

The phone buzzed again. A text.

Joanne: “He’s in the hospital. Come now or don’t bother ever again.”

No punctuation. That was how he knew she meant it.

He stared at the message long enough to feel something shift. His hand, trembling just a little, reached for the keys.

The last time Nathan had seen his father, they'd screamed at each other in the driveway. It was raining, and Nathan had been drunk—again. His father had said something about “burning bridges” and Nathan had laughed, lighting a cigarette with shaking hands, and muttering something cruel about graveyards and ashes. That was eight years ago. Since then, there’d been birthday cards signed with a first initial, and one funeral for an uncle neither of them liked.

Now, he stood at the sliding doors of Saint Aurelius Medical Center, unsure whether to walk in or keep walking, maybe all the way to the water.

He pressed through the entrance.

The hospital was colder than he remembered hospitals being. The fluorescent lights hummed with a tired kind of urgency. He asked the nurse for Walter Farren’s room and followed the maze of white-tiled corridors to Room 318.

Joanne sat beside the bed, pale and furious. Her black hair was up in a messy bun, and there were three coffee cups beside her—one from Dunkin’, one hospital styrofoam, one probably his father’s. She didn't look at him.

“You came.”

“I got your text.”

She stood. “He had a stroke.”

Nathan looked at the body in the bed. Walter Farren, once six feet of fury and discipline, now seemed to have shrunk into his sheets. Tubes, wires, the faint hiss of a machine breathing rhythmically.

“When?” Nathan asked.

“Three days ago.”

Three days. “Why didn’t you—”

“Because you don’t answer.” Her voice cracked like a whip. “You haven’t shown up for ten years. Why would I think today would be different?”

Nathan had no answer. He sat down in the plastic chair and leaned forward, elbows on knees.

Joanne crossed her arms. “He was asking about you.”

“Why?”

She shook her head. “He wanted to tell you something. He said he had... papers, in the house. Something he wanted you to have.”

Nathan blinked. “He’s never wanted me to have anything.”

“Well,” she said, gathering her coat, “maybe dying makes people generous.”

The house on Garnet Street hadn’t changed much. The grass was long. The paint on the porch peeled like sunburnt skin. Nathan had a key, still. He kept it in an old jewelry box with some Polaroids and a Zippo he never used.

Inside, the air was thick with dust and old leather. The kind of smell that you remember even in dreams. He moved through the living room slowly, touching furniture as if to confirm it still existed. A stack of unopened mail sat beneath a ceramic owl on the side table.

Upstairs, the bedroom was clean, neat. Walter had always been tidy. A man of systems. Nathan found a metal box in the closet, under a pile of winter coats. It was locked. He knew where the key would be: taped beneath the second drawer in the desk. Always there, since 1992.

He opened the box.

Inside: a folded letter. An envelope with Nathan’s name on it. Two old photographs. And a legal document.

He sat on the bed and unfolded the letter.

“Nathan,

If you’re reading this, then either I’m dead or someone decided you deserved a second chance. I don’t know which is worse.”

He snorted.

“You wasted a decade. I wasted time believing that was just a phase. But there’s something I never told you. Your mother—she left something behind. Not money. Not jewelry. Something harder to explain.

I never opened the safe deposit box after she died. I couldn’t. It’s yours now. Box #442, Chatham Bank. Key’s taped to the back of this letter.”

Nathan blinked. His mother had died when he was fifteen. She’d been a painter, wild and brilliant. He remembered her hands always stained with blue or green. He remembered, too, the way she smiled when she talked about “stories that lived in rooms.”

He turned the envelope over. The key was there. Small, brass.

He pocketed it.

The drive to Chatham was three hours. He made it in two and a half, burning through a mix CD that skipped every other song. His fingers trembled against the steering wheel. He hadn’t thought of his mother in years—not really. She’d become a flicker in memory. A name in a photo album.

At the bank, he showed the ID, signed the paperwork, waited as the clerk returned with a long metal box.

Inside: a notebook. Handbound, wrapped in linen. A letter. And a strange, flat wooden object that looked like a part of a puzzle.

He opened the notebook first. His mother’s handwriting. Swirling, chaotic.

“To my son—if they let you find this, then maybe you’re ready to know.”

What followed was a mess of journal entries, sketches, and a recurring phrase:

“The Ashes Room.”

That night, Nathan sat in a motel outside of Chatham, the notebook spread across the bed. He read every page. His mother described dreams of a door behind a mirror, a house that didn’t exist, a voice that whispered about “embers of memory.” Madness, maybe. Or art. But something in the notebook felt real.

There was a map drawn on one page. Coordinates.

He plugged them into his phone. Northern Vermont.

His heart raced. Was he really doing this?

He packed the notebook, the key, the letter. He booked a cabin in Vermont.

It was time to stop drifting.

Time to follow the ashes.

The road north felt like a different country altogether—thick pine forests crowding the shoulder, telephone lines stretching overhead like the ribs of some ancient, slumbering beast. The farther Nathan drove, the more the world seemed to fall away behind him. By the time he crossed into Vermont, the sun was just beginning to retreat behind the hills, casting long, copper shadows across the road. His phone had lost signal an hour earlier, leaving him alone with the worn notebook in the passenger seat and the rattle of something loose in the engine.

He stopped at a gas station near the town of Winhall, a place so small it seemed to consist entirely of a post office, a hardware store, and a diner. He topped off the tank, bought a bottle of water, and asked the attendant if he knew anything about the area around Lyon Ridge. The man, in his sixties and wearing a Patriots cap, scratched his chin thoughtfully before answering.

“Up past the ridge? Ain’t much up there anymore. Used to be a camp, way back. Closed in the eighties. Lotta trees. Lotta wind.”

“Any houses?” Nathan asked, clutching the notebook under his coat.

“Couple. Mostly empty now. Deer run through there more’n people.”

He thanked the man and continued north. The last leg of the drive wound up a narrow, gravel road that seemed to climb indefinitely. The GPS had died, but the coordinates etched in his mother’s notebook guided him better than any satellite.

The cabin he’d rented sat at the edge of the woods, modest and leaning slightly like it had grown tired of standing up straight. He parked, grabbed his duffel, and walked up the creaking steps. Inside, the air was dry and musty. The furniture was simple—two chairs, a table, a cast iron stove. He lit a fire and sat on the floor, spreading the notebook across the rug.

Pages scrawled in paint and graphite detailed strange symbols—some that looked like constellations, others like alphabets from lost civilizations. Phrases repeated themselves, as if trying to convince him of their importance: “The Room only appears to those who inherit the memory.” And, more puzzling: “The wooden token must be placed beneath the mirror at midnight.”

Nathan reached into his coat and retrieved the flat wooden piece. It was circular, smooth, with a single engraving in the center: a four-pointed star intersected by a spiral. He hadn’t noticed it before, but the lines shimmered faintly when they caught the light of the fire.

Beneath the phrase about the mirror, his mother had added in smaller handwriting: “Don’t forget who you are, even if you’ve forgotten everything else.”

He turned to the map again. The location marked in red ink was less than two miles from where he now sat. The ridge. A hollow near the top of the rise. The handwriting labeled it: “Ashes Room.”

The trail to the ridge was overgrown, but the old instincts kicked in. Nathan had grown up climbing hills and ducking through underbrush behind the house in Boston. His legs burned, and the cold air made his chest ache, but he kept climbing.

At the summit, beneath a low canopy of fir trees, was a clearing. Silent. Untouched. The grass was strangely even, the stones laid out in a semicircle, like they’d been placed there intentionally. In the center, a slab of rock stood upright, weather-worn and cracked down the middle. At its base was a recess just wide enough to fit the wooden token.

He hesitated, his fingers tightening around the smooth edge. Then, carefully, he placed it into the slot.

Nothing happened.

Then, the ground shivered—just slightly, like the aftermath of a distant train. The rock began to hum, a vibration rather than a sound, and from somewhere beneath the soil, a low grinding echoed outward. Nathan stumbled back. The grass in the center of the circle parted, like something beneath had exhaled. Slowly, impossibly, a trapdoor revealed itself. Wood, metal-bound, covered in moss and earth.

He crouched and pulled it open.

Stairs descended into darkness.

He stood for a long time, watching the black void at the bottom of the steps. Then he grabbed his flashlight, turned it on, and stepped down.

The underground room was dry, the walls covered in old plaster and beams that looked centuries old. The air smelled of cedar and something else—dust, yes, but also oil paint. Faint color still lingered on the walls. Murals. His mother’s style was unmistakable—she had painted them. The first wall showed a woman with a mirror for a face, standing in a field of fire. The next showed a house being swallowed by black vines, and inside, tiny golden lights glowing from the windows.

At the far end of the chamber was a door, framed by more symbols. Above it, a phrase written in his mother’s hand: “Only through fire does memory return.”

He hesitated. This had stopped feeling like a scavenger hunt. It felt... like something deeper. An inheritance that had waited silently through the years, gathering dust like the boxes in his father’s closet. Something that had outlived grief and guilt and the ache of time.

He opened the door.

On the other side was a small, windowless room. And at the far end, covered by a tattered red sheet, stood a mirror. Tall, ornate, the glass faded and warped. He crossed the room slowly. The air felt denser here, like walking underwater. The moment he pulled the sheet away, he saw something that didn’t belong.

Not his reflection.

A different room.

A child’s bedroom.

The walls painted with stars.

A music box playing a familiar tune.

He blinked. The image held.

Then, slowly, his reflection swam into view—overlaid on the child’s bedroom like a ghost trying to wake.

The mirror whispered.

Not in words, but in feelings. A pull behind the ribs. A noise behind the ear. A weight behind the eyes.

He reached out to touch the glass.

And fell forward—through it.

He hit the ground hard. Not concrete. Not earth.

Carpet.

He opened his eyes. He was in the bedroom from the mirror. The stars on the walls were hand-painted, swirling in messy constellations. A small twin bed, stuffed animals. On the desk, a watercolor palette, dry and cracked with time. A name painted above the doorway: “Nathaniel.”

His full name. No one had called him that in twenty years.

There was a journal on the bed. Bound in green cloth. He picked it up. Inside were entries dated from 1993, in his mother’s handwriting. Some pages were smeared, others missing.

“The house remembers. Even if he forgets, the house does not.”

“He is the key and the lock. If he finds his way back, tell him I tried to stay.”

The doorknob clicked.

Nathan turned.

A figure stood in the hallway, backlit.

Familiar.

“Nate?” the voice said. Soft, feminine. “Is it really you?”

It was her. His mother.

Alive.

Or something wearing her face.

He stepped back.

She reached out.

And then the room began to shift. The walls rippled like water. The stars peeled from the ceiling. The journal turned to ash in his hands.

He blinked.

He was back in the underground chamber.

Alone.

Sweating, heart racing, the mirror once again only a mirror.

Nathan stumbled back to the cabin in the dark, gripping the wooden token like a lifeline. His mind reeled with what he had seen. Or thought he’d seen. Was it a hallucination? A trick of light and memory? Or something his mother had created, left behind like a message encoded in pigment and madness?

He didn’t sleep that night. Instead, he read the notebook again. Every word, every sketch. He saw now that this wasn’t a story of grief or guilt. It was a map. A coded trail left by someone who knew she wouldn’t be there to guide him herself.

And somehow, Walter had known about it.

Which meant his father wasn’t just a bystander to her mystery.

He was part of it.

Nathan had wasted ten years in a haze, refusing to see the past for what it was.

Now, he wasn’t just chasing ghosts.

He was chasing truth.

And something was waiting for him at the end of it. Something older than regret. Something buried beneath everything he had forgotten.

He didn’t know yet if it would save him.

Or destroy him.

Chapter Two: The Unseen Ledger

Nathan awoke in the late afternoon to a knock at the door—three slow, deliberate taps that felt more like punctuation than an introduction. He hadn’t meant to fall asleep. The fire had burned down to faint embers, and the shadows in the cabin had grown long and restless. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes, unsure for a moment where he was, his dream clinging to him like sweat. A corridor of mirrors, voices behind thin walls, and a child’s laughter that had made his teeth ache.

He opened the door to find a woman standing there. She was about his age, early thirties maybe, with auburn hair tied up under a knitted cap and a scarf that looked handwoven. Her eyes were green—sharper than they had any right to be on such a soft face.

“You Nathan?” she asked, as if she already knew the answer.

“Yeah,” he said, gripping the edge of the door.

“I’m Wren. Joanne called me.”

He blinked. “Joanne?”

“She told me you might be coming up here. Said you’d be poking into... things you don’t understand.”

Nathan stepped back to let her in, suddenly aware of how little he had told his sister about any of this. The fact that she had preemptively warned someone meant either she knew more than she was letting on—or she still didn’t trust him to do anything on his own.

Wren looked around the cabin, taking in the cluttered table, the open notebook, the wooden token now resting in a dish beside the fire.

“I used to know your mother,” she said, finally sitting down. “Not well. But enough. She came up here a lot in the eighties. Painted murals in the old chapel. Said the trees helped her think.”

Nathan leaned against the wall. “What do you know about the mirror?”

Her gaze locked onto his, and something shifted in her expression—something that hadn’t been there a moment before. Not fear. Not surprise. Recognition.

“She found it, didn’t she?” Wren said quietly. “The Ashes Room.”

“I did too,” he said, and she inhaled sharply. “I saw her, Wren. My mother. Or something wearing her face.”

Wren nodded slowly. “It’s a space between things. Not a room, not really. A memory trapped in form. She believed—hell, we all did for a while—that it was left behind by something ancient. Older than names. A memory engine.”

He rubbed his temples. “This is sounding more and more like a fever dream.”

“It isn’t,” she said, standing. “And if you’re seeing her in there, that means the Ashes Room still remembers you. Which means something's been left behind—unfinished.”

Nathan gestured to the notebook. “She wrote about a key. Not the wooden token, something else. Something she didn’t finish.”

“She used to talk about a ledger,” Wren murmured. “Said it didn’t belong to any bank. A book that recorded things people forgot, rather than remembered. That’s what she was painting for, you know. The murals. She thought if she could capture the right pattern, she could find the ledger and break the memory loop.”

He stared at her. “What memory loop?”

“The one we’re all in,” Wren said, and for the first time her voice cracked, just a little. “This place—it resets things. Over and over. You forget, then you remember, then you forget again. The Ashes Room doesn’t show you the past—it pulls you through it, like a net dragging fish.”

Nathan thought about the journal he had seen. The bedroom. The music box.

“And what happens if I don’t go back?”

She didn’t answer right away. She just walked over to the fire and knelt beside it.

“You’ll forget again. And it’ll keep going, like it always has.”

Then she added, almost too softly to hear:

“And someone else will have to dig you out next time.”

The next morning, Nathan found himself standing in front of the old chapel Wren had mentioned. It had taken most of the night to find it, hidden at the base of a hill behind the ruins of what might once have been a barn. The door creaked open with a groan, revealing a sanctuary frozen in time. Dust-covered pews, vines curling in through the broken stained glass, and murals—faded but still vibrant with color—wrapping the walls like a dream held in stasis.

The largest one was behind the altar. It showed a spiral of figures, human and not, descending into what appeared to be a massive book. The faces were distorted, melting at the edges, as though caught between two states of being. At the center of the spiral, a mirror floated above the book. And beneath it, in looping script, the words: “Remember me as I forget myself.”

Nathan stepped forward, studying the image. The spiral reminded him of the token. Same curves. Same symbols. And at the base of the altar, tucked beneath a wooden panel, he found something else—a small, rectangular tin. Inside was another key. Not brass. This one was silver, engraved with a series of tiny stars.

He turned it over. The number “11” etched onto the back.

Another box.

Another piece.

He drove back to Winhall, heart pounding, palms sweating against the wheel. He didn’t know what exactly he was unlocking, only that the pieces were falling into place faster now. Like the story had waited for him to wake up before deciding to rush toward its ending.

At the Winhall municipal building—a squat, gray structure wedged between two snowplow garages—he asked the clerk about safety deposit boxes and was directed to the archives in the basement.

Box 11 was there, untouched, filed under “Farren, M.”

Inside: a reel of 8mm film. A second journal. And a polaroid photograph of Walter Farren, standing in front of a mirror nearly identical to the one Nathan had fallen through.

Only this one was cracked.

He took the journal and flipped to the first page.

“Walter’s version,” it read. “What I couldn’t tell Nathan.”

Back in the cabin, with the projector borrowed from the archives, Nathan watched the film flicker to life. It showed a younger Walter, perhaps late thirties, pacing a room Nathan didn’t recognize. He spoke to the camera in clipped, urgent tones.

“If you’re watching this, it means I never got to explain. Your mother wasn’t the only one who went into the Ashes Room. I followed her. Again and again. Every time she forgot, I tried to bring her back. But it got harder each time. The room... it doesn’t just remember you. It records you.”

He paused, staring into the lens with a look Nathan had never seen before. Fear.

“I tried to burn the ledger. I tried to bury it. But it keeps finding its way back. And now—now it’s growing. Like it’s waiting for someone to open it.”

The screen went black.

Nathan sat in silence, the projector whirring as the tape ran out.

The journal in his lap trembled slightly in his hands. He opened to the last page.

“If you find the ledger, do not read your name aloud. If you do, the room will write a new ending. One you can’t undo.”

Nathan stared at the fire.

He had come here to understand his mother.

Now, he understood his father, too.

They had both walked into the same dream.

They had both failed to wake.

He poured himself a drink, then didn’t touch it. He watched it settle.

This wasn’t about memory anymore.

It was about rewriting the narrative before it wrote him out completely.

The following day broke colder than the last, the Vermont sky stretched thin and colorless over the cabin roof. Nathan stood at the window with a coffee mug in hand, but the coffee had long gone cold. His eyes didn’t focus on anything beyond the glass. They lingered instead on memory—on the image of his father’s face on the grainy 8mm reel, that hollowed look in his eyes, not from age but from knowing something for too long.

He couldn’t shake the feeling that time was folding in on itself. Not in the sci-fi sense—not literal time travel—but something stranger. Emotional time. Grief that aged backwards. Fear that matured into obsession. The ledger, the mirror, the dreams—they weren’t just events or objects. They were experiences that stitched and restitched reality around them. And he was part of it now, whether he had chosen to be or not.

He returned to the notebook—the second journal, his father’s. It smelled of tobacco and glue. On the third page, his father described something called The Mirror Manuscript, a book said to mirror its reader. Every time someone opened it, the contents changed, evolving based on the reader’s memories, guilt, desires. It didn’t record facts. It recorded interpretations—subjective truths, filtered through whoever held the pages.

His father believed this book—this ledger—was a living archive of consciousness. And it was hidden, or protected, or both, within a space Nathan’s mother called “the cavity between.” Neither here nor there. Accessible only through the Ashes Room.

Nathan spent hours staring at the last entry in the journal. It was a sketch, hastily drawn. The mirror again, but now fractured at the edges, leaking tendrils of darkness. Around it, six symbols formed a ring: a key, an eye, a flame, a clock, a feather, and a spiral. Below them, one word: Convergence.

It meant nothing to him. Yet.

He didn’t call Wren. She had left the day before with the kind of quiet urgency people reserve for those who had crossed an invisible line. She’d said what she needed to say. She had offered a warning, and he was choosing to ignore it. That meant she owed him nothing else.

By noon, Nathan had packed his bag with the essentials—the token, both journals, the photograph, and a flashlight. He filled a thermos with water, packed some bread, and checked his phone out of habit. Still no signal.

The ridge called to him again, and he answered.

The second time down the stairs into the Ashes Room was worse. The darkness didn’t welcome him; it resisted. The flashlight flickered as if the air itself interfered with its function. The mirror stood just as he had left it, dustless, as though time didn’t apply within its frame. For a long moment, Nathan stared into its warped reflection, waiting for something—anything—to move on the other side.

Nothing did.

Until he touched the glass.

He didn't fall through this time. He passed, slowly, as if sinking into warm liquid. The sensation was both tender and horrifying. His breath caught in his throat as the world bent around him. The cabin vanished. So did the stairs. So did Vermont.

He stood in a hallway, narrow and dim, lined on either side with picture frames. They contained no photographs. Only cracked glass and mirrored silver. He moved slowly, careful not to disturb the silence, his boots making soft thuds on what felt like velvet flooring. Above him, the ceiling rippled, and every so often he caught the glimmer of his own face in the mirrors—distorted, multiplied, aged.

He reached a door at the end of the corridor. A sign hung on it, dangling from a single rusted nail: “All Ledgers Accounted For.”

Inside, the room was circular. Shelves rose impossibly high, curving into the ceiling like a cathedral of forgotten thoughts. Books lined every wall. Not printed books—these were handmade, stitched in different styles, different sizes. Some bound in red cloth, others in waxed leather or braided cord. They smelled of cedar, ink, and damp parchment.

Nathan stepped forward.

Each spine bore a single name.

He saw familiar ones—Walter Farren, L. Wren Morely, E. Joanne Farren—and then his own.

Nathaniel M. Farren.

The book trembled when he touched it. The title across the cover appeared only as he held it in both hands.

“Ashes: A Record of Incomplete Remembrance.”

He opened to the first page.

“July 19th, 1995. Nathan chooses to forget the color of her eyes.”

The words hit like a hammer to the chest. He hadn’t remembered that day in years. His mother’s funeral. The heat. The way he had tried not to cry, had succeeded, and had immediately hated himself for it. He had stood beside Joanne at the gravesite and refused to look down. He had stared at the sky. And yes—he had told himself, quietly, not to remember the exact green of his mother’s eyes. It hurt too much.

He turned the page.

“December 8th, 2003. Nathan lies about the scholarship. Says he never applied. Tells himself he wouldn’t have gotten in anyway.”

The pages bled with half-truths. With the tiny compromises he’d made that snowballed into a lost decade. Moments that, at the time, had felt meaningless. Forgotten arguments, small betrayals, words left unsaid, apologies never formed.

He flipped further.

“September 2nd, 2012. Nathan breaks the photograph frame in anger. Says he’ll replace it. Never does.”

And then he found one that hadn’t happened yet.

“October 11th, 2025. Nathan opens the manuscript. Reads his name aloud.”

He shut the book immediately.

The shelves groaned. The room tilted slightly, as though something massive had stirred beneath the floor. He backed away from the shelf, nearly dropping the ledger.

“Don’t speak your name in here,” came a voice.

He turned.

A man stood at the edge of the room, half in shadow, dressed in a long coat made of mismatched fabric. His hair was graying. His face was strange, unreadable.

“Who are you?” Nathan asked.

“I was like you. Once.” The man stepped forward. “I came looking for her. For meaning. For a way to fix what I broke. But there’s no fixing. Only recording. The room doesn’t judge. It documents.”

Nathan clutched the book tighter. “Then how do I stop it?”

“You don’t. You choose. Either keep forgetting or rewrite it yourself. But if you try to lie to the ledger, it will write its own ending.”

Nathan’s thoughts spun. He remembered Wren’s words. The ledger doesn’t just hold memory—it shapes it.

“I have to find the original,” he said. “The manuscript. The core.”

The man nodded. “Then you’ll need the sixth symbol.”

Nathan remembered the sketch. The spiral. The last symbol in the ring.

“The spiral represents what?” he asked.

“Your decision,” the man said. “You can’t bring her back. But you can bring yourself forward.”

The lights dimmed.

The shelves began to retract, folding into themselves like shutters. The mirror reappeared on the opposite wall, flickering like heat above pavement.

The man was gone.

Nathan ran toward the glass, heart hammering, the ledger still in hand. This time he didn’t pause.

He stepped through.

And woke up gasping on the floor of the cabin.

The sun was setting.

He had been gone all day—or longer. Time no longer moved cleanly in his head.

Nathan opened the notebook again. His mother’s words stared back at him:

“The end is not an ending. It’s a choice.”

His fingers trembled as he retrieved the sketch from the back of his father’s journal. The six symbols. They weren’t just icons. They were keys.

And they had to be found, each one.

Each symbol, a memory. A sacrifice. A truth.

He had already found the key, the mirror, the flame.

Three more remained.

Somewhere, buried in the stories he never let himself finish.

And if he didn’t finish them now, they’d finish him.

Chapter Three: The Feather and the Flame

Nathan didn’t leave the cabin for two days. He didn’t eat much either—just dry bread, the occasional apple, and swigs of lukewarm coffee that he reheated three, sometimes four times, without ever fully drinking. Sleep came in fits and starts, and the dreams were growing more vivid. They came in layers now—some memories, some projections, some things he couldn’t begin to explain. Once, he dreamed he was inside a library with no roof, where books rained from the sky and mirrors lay face-down on every floorboard. Another time, he stood at his childhood home and watched the windows fill up with black ink.

When he did wake, the notebook sat in his lap. It had become an extension of him, the paper now worn at the corners from constant thumbing. He had copied the six symbols onto a separate sheet and pinned it to the cabin wall above the fireplace. It stared at him like a riddle:

Key. Eye. Flame. Clock. Feather. Spiral.

The spiral—he was sure—was the convergence point. A summation, a reckoning. That meant he needed to find the others first. The mirror, he realized, was the eye. And the wooden token, placed at the Ashes Room’s threshold, had been the key.

That left three.

And something told him the next would come with a price.

He found the first clue tucked inside the spine of the original notebook. A thin slip of paper—more brittle than parchment, folded like it had been hidden for years. On it, his mother’s handwriting in faded blue ink:

“Feathers don’t fall where there’s wind. Go where stillness lives.”

He mulled the phrase over while staring at a wall map pinned beside the window. Most of the region was forested, but one spot stood out—Lake Rionach. A shallow body of water about twenty miles northeast, long-abandoned cabins dotting its shores. The lake had been drained during a failed restoration project a decade ago. Now it was a field of reeds and silence.

He packed lightly. The second ledger came with him, as did the token and a digital voice recorder he hadn’t used since college. Something about the Ashes Room made him want to document everything, as though recording gave him the upper hand against forgetting.

The road to Lake Rionach wound through sleepy valleys and broken fences. The lake itself was barely recognizable as one—more like a sunken field now, dry and crumbling, with wide stretches of cracked mud and skeletal cattails. He parked near what had once been the ranger’s cabin, a small wooden shack leaning into itself like it had given up standing.

Inside, he found what he hadn’t known he was looking for.

A single white feather.

It rested atop a dusty table, untouched by the layer of grime around it. Too perfect. Not random. Not natural. Its presence felt deliberate, almost sacred. As he reached out to pick it up, something in the back of his mind whispered don’t—but he ignored it.

The second his fingers closed around the quill, the light in the room changed. Sharpened. Hardened.

Then came the sound.

It wasn’t loud—not at first. A soft rustling, like a wing brushing against a low ceiling. Then another. Then hundreds.

Nathan turned, heart spiking, as shadows flooded in from the windows. For one impossible moment, the cabin seemed to breathe, the walls flexing outward as though trying to contain something massive and alive.

Then the door burst open.

Wind screamed through the room, cold and dry, but it carried no leaves, no dust. Just air—and feathers. Thousands of them. They spiraled through the cabin in a cyclone of white and gray and pale blue. Nathan backed against the wall, covering his mouth, the feather still clutched in his hand.

In the center of the whirlwind, a shape began to form.

Human in size. Avian in presence. Its body shimmered in the dim light, not flesh or bone, but something carved of memory. A face emerged—not male, not female—framed by wings folded inward like prayer.

It didn’t speak.

It simply pointed to the ledger in Nathan’s coat pocket.

With shaking hands, he pulled it out.

The being raised one arm, and the feathers spun faster. Pages of the ledger began to flutter, open, close, open again. Then one page stayed still.

Nathan read it aloud.

“June 13th, 2015. Nathan refuses the eulogy.”

He hadn’t remembered that until now. Joanne had begged him to speak at their aunt’s funeral. He’d gone, but sat in the back row, head down, saying nothing. Not because he couldn’t. But because he couldn’t justify pretending he cared enough to speak.

The entity lowered its arm.

The wind stopped.

A single feather hovered in the air, then drifted downward until it touched Nathan’s forehead.

He closed his eyes.

When he opened them, the cabin was empty. The feather was gone.

But in his hand now was a small object.

A charm, shaped like a feather, etched with tiny script along the quill.

One price remembered. One step closer.

Back at the cabin, Nathan traced the etching with a magnifying glass. The script repeated a phrase in a looping, hypnotic rhythm: “Not all who forget are lost. Not all who are lost forget.”

The ledger had updated itself again. A new page had been added, blank but marked with a symbol: the flame.

He didn’t need to guess where that would lead him.

The fire tower.

It stood at the edge of Black Pine Forest, about fifteen miles from the Ashes Room. He had passed it once on his first drive north, an old skeletal structure barely visible through the pines. His mother had painted a replica of it once, he now remembered—back when she was obsessed with images of isolation and height.

The climb up the tower was harder than he expected. The steps were rusted, creaking underfoot. Wind whistled through the broken slats in the wood. When he reached the top, the view took his breath—not because it was beautiful, though it was—but because he saw everything laid out below him like a map. The lake. The ridge. Even, faintly, the chapel. As if he were standing at the center of the pattern now, and everything was spiraling inward.

Inside the tower room, he found an old metal stove, a desk with rotted papers, and a single unlit lantern hanging from a hook. He pulled it down, turning it over. There was no fuel.

But the moment he placed the feather charm next to it, the lantern flickered to life.

Its flame danced unnaturally—white-blue, silent.

Nathan stared into it.

Then he saw her.

His mother.

Not in the room.

In the flame.

Her face, calm. Her eyes closed. Her hands pressed against some unseen surface.

Then she opened her mouth and whispered something.

He leaned in closer.

The flame surged.

He didn’t hear words.

He felt them.

A phrase buried in his chest, rising like bile.

“She remembers what you buried.”

Nathan staggered back.

The flame leapt from the lantern, searing a symbol into the wood floor—an ornate version of the spiral.

He fell to his knees.

The flame had branded itself into his mind now. Not fire as destruction, but fire as truth. Cleansing. Clarifying. Unforgiving.

He knew where to go next.

The clock waited. The final symbol before convergence.

But first—

He would have to confront the moment he had tried hardest to forget.

The one memory the ledger had not yet shown him.

The one he had buried, even from himself.

The journey back from the fire tower was slow. Nathan’s legs were numb with cold, but it was the fatigue behind his eyes that bore down the hardest. He walked the final stretch to the cabin without turning on the headlights, letting the dusk carry him. In the rearview mirror, the horizon seemed to ripple faintly—as though the world behind him were being unstitched, replaced by something else.

Inside, the cabin was silent, save for the creaks and sighs of an old structure reacting to the night’s chill. He dropped his pack by the door and sat cross-legged on the floor before the fireplace, watching the ash from the morning’s fire stir as he added kindling and coaxed it back to life. The flames caught quickly, casting orange light on the walls. Shadows returned to their corners.

He pulled the ledger into his lap again.

Its spine now bore three symbols: the eye, the feather, and the flame. All pulsed faintly, warm under his fingers. The page after the flame remained blank, but Nathan could feel it wasn’t empty. It waited.

He turned instead to a note tucked into the back cover, nearly missed before. Folded twice, yellowing at the edges.

It wasn’t his mother’s writing.

It was Walter’s.

“If the spiral is the final question, the clock is the lie that got you there. Don’t ask the hour. Ask what stopped the ticking.”

Nathan exhaled through his teeth. These riddles—half warnings, half puzzles—they weren’t guiding him anymore. They were testing him. Every step forward brought another version of himself into the light. Another weakness. Another failure.

He retrieved the photo of his father in front of the mirror. The crack in the glass. The haunted look in Walter’s eyes. He’d always assumed the old man’s anger had been rooted in disappointment. Now, he understood. Walter hadn’t been angry at Nathan.

He’d been terrified for him.

The spiral wasn’t just a destination. It was a cycle. And they’d both been circling it their whole lives.

The clock, as it turned out, wasn’t a metaphor.

Not entirely.

Nathan found a reference in his mother’s original journal to an estate called Morven Hollow, buried deeper into the Vermont interior, where she had once spent a summer during her university years. She called it “the place where time hesitated.” The house had long since fallen into disrepair—left behind by a family too old to maintain it, too rich to care, and too secretive to let it go to strangers.

The directions were vague, but locals in Wren’s town knew enough of the myth to point Nathan toward the right valley.

He arrived near sunset.

The house looked like it had been waiting for him.

Three stories of gray stone and dark timber, perched like a vulture on the hillside. The windows, all intact, reflected nothing. No trees, no light, no him. It was like they faced inward. The front gate was twisted iron, and as he approached, the latch lifted itself with a sound like a sigh.

The air turned colder as he stepped onto the porch. Inside, the foyer was dark but not abandoned. Dust coated the floor, but the furniture was upright. A coat still hung on the wall hook. The smell wasn’t mold or rot, but wax. Preserved, sealed.

A grandfather clock stood at the base of the stairs.

Its pendulum was missing.

Its face showed midnight. The hands unmoving.

Nathan approached it slowly, every instinct telling him to stop.

He didn’t.

When he touched the wooden casing, something flickered at the edge of his vision. A figure at the top of the stairs. He turned quickly—but nothing was there.

Just the echo of something that once had been.

The clock groaned.

Its hands shivered, then began to turn.

Not forward.

Backward.

The entire room tilted slightly. The walls seemed to ripple again, not melting but stretching, expanding. Time wasn’t breaking. It was looping.

The journal grew heavy in Nathan’s coat.

He stumbled back as the air thickened.

Paintings on the walls twisted in their frames, changing. Faces blurred, then cleared. In one, he saw a boy. Twelve, maybe thirteen. Curly hair, a scowl so deep it looked carved into his features.

It was him.

Nathan.

The boy in the painting looked out toward the clock, not the viewer.

Then, as Nathan watched, the painting blinked.

He ran.

Up the stairs, past the figure he no longer trusted himself not to see. The hallway stretched unnaturally. Rooms flickered open and shut. Some were empty. Some were not. He passed a nursery with no windows. A ballroom where a single violin played by itself. A study filled with clocks, all ticking in different tempos.

And finally, at the very end of the hall—

The spiral door.

He didn’t know how he recognized it.

He just did.

The wood was scorched at the center, marked with a pattern that mirrored the feather charm, the token, and the lantern flame. But now, the spiral had been carved into the center, blackened and deep.

Nathan pushed it open.

The room inside was round, small, and windowless. Mirrors again lined the walls, but these were shattered into exact triangular fragments, pieced back together with silver solder. In the center stood a pedestal.

On it: a clock face.

No hands.

Just a single, blinking red light where the center post should be.

As he stepped closer, the fragments on the wall began to pulse.

Each reflected a different version of him.

Some younger.

Some older.

Some broken.

Some smiling.

One—a child, maybe six years old—stood silent, eyes wide.

Nathan stared at him.

The child raised a hand and pointed downward.

At the pedestal.

At the blinking light.

And then whispered.

Not aloud.

In his head.

“You stopped it.”

And suddenly Nathan remembered.

He was thirteen.

In his father's study.

The old wind-up clock on the wall, ticking louder than his parents' argument downstairs. The air so thick he thought he’d choke. His mother had screamed something about “the mirror,” and Walter had said, “It’s not yours anymore.” Nathan had grabbed the clock, smashed it against the bookshelf, and yelled until they both went silent.

He remembered it now.

Not just the action.

The intent.

He hadn’t broken the clock in anger.

He had broken it to stop time.

To trap that moment forever.

So they’d never be that angry again.

So nothing could get worse.

He knelt beside the pedestal.

Pressed his hand to the blinking red light.

It faded.

The mirrors stopped pulsing.

The room grew still.

Behind him, the spiral on the door began to glow.

A new sound filled the space.

A chime.

Clean. Singular.

A sound that marked not the passing of time—but the resumption of it.

The final price had been paid.

And the spiral was calling.

Back at the cabin, Nathan packed slowly.

He would leave at dawn.

Return to the Ashes Room.

Confront the convergence.

He didn’t know what waited on the other side—but he knew what it demanded.

No more forgetfulness.

No more drifting.

No more erasure.

He had been irresponsible with time, with memory, with meaning. But he would not be irresponsible with truth.

Not now.

He’d collected the six symbols.

He’d confronted the reflections.

All that remained was to step through.

And not flinch.

Chapter Four: Convergence

The next morning came not with sunlight, but with a smothering kind of gray. The sky held its breath. The wind, usually sharp and vocal across the Vermont ridgelines, was mute. The world outside Nathan’s cabin looked less like a forested countryside and more like the photograph of one—flattened, colorless, held behind glass. It was as though the landscape itself understood what he was about to do, and chose to observe in silence.

Nathan dressed with precision. Warm layers. Sturdy boots. The feather charm, the wooden token, the clock pendant, and the now-complete journal—all packed neatly into a small leather satchel slung across his shoulder. In his inner coat pocket, he kept the photograph of his father, the cracked mirror behind him a reminder of what might lie ahead. There were no maps this time. No coordinates to input. The Ashes Room would find him.

He didn’t say goodbye to the cabin. He didn’t even look back.

He followed the trail by instinct, a path he no longer needed to see. Every turn of the winding path, every creaking branch and root-twisted incline, felt familiar now—not as if he had walked it many times, but as if it had been imprinted inside him, long before he ever arrived.

By the time he reached the clearing, the air had shifted. It was colder, but not from weather. The cold came from within, like something ancient breathing just beneath the skin of the world. The stone circle was still there, unmoved. Moss had grown thicker around the trapdoor at its center, but the faint impression of footfalls could still be seen in the grass.

He knelt, brushed away the overgrowth, and lifted the door.

Stale earth greeted him, followed by the deep hush of buried things. He descended without hesitation.

This time, he wasn’t afraid.

The Ashes Room felt different.

It was no longer dark and sealed, but luminous, filled with a dull golden light that pulsed from the mirror. The walls no longer shimmered with unspoken symbols—they were bare, clean, smooth as plaster. The mirror had grown wider, taller, its frame now split by a jagged line down the center, like a crack waiting to choose a direction.

Nathan approached and removed the satchel. One by one, he took out the six items. The wooden token. The mirror photograph. The feather. The flame charm. The pendant from the clock. And finally, the page torn from his father’s sketchbook: the spiral.

He laid them before the mirror, forming the circle as he’d seen in the journal.

When he stepped back, the mirror did not ripple.

It opened.

Not like a door. Not like water.

It folded inward, as though swallowing its own reflection, and revealed—nothing. Just a space without color or shape, a void the size of a room and the depth of memory. He hesitated.

Then stepped through.

It was not a dream, though it felt like one.

He stood in a field. But not one that belonged to the world. The sky above him bled with the colors of a dying storm—golden grays, veined with red. The grass was motionless. Time here was not passing; it was gathering.

Around him stood mirrors.

Hundreds of them.

Some broken.

Some fogged.

Some glistening with images frozen mid-motion.

Each one held a version of him. Some smiling, some weeping, some screaming silently with their hands pressed to the glass. Some stood with others—Joanne, his mother, Wren, even strangers whose names he did not know but whose presence tugged at his gut.

One mirror showed him slumped on the floor of his Boston apartment, an empty bottle in his hand, his mouth open in silent apology.

Another showed him packing a suitcase he never took, holding a ticket to a graduate program he never entered.

Another still showed him at the hospital, holding Walter’s hand and whispering forgiveness.

Moments lived. Moments denied.

He stepped among them, overwhelmed.

The further he walked, the more the field narrowed, until the mirrors formed two walls, funneling him forward into a corridor of himself. The final mirror at the end was unlike the others.

It was blank.

No reflection.

No image.

Just white.

He stepped closer.

A voice, quiet and unmistakably his own, rose in the air like a song remembered half in sleep:

“The version that doesn’t lie is the one that never looks away.”

He reached out.

His fingers passed through.

And again, the world turned inside out.

This time, it was a room.

Circular. Bare.

No mirrors. No color. No floor he could feel. No walls he could define.

But there was someone there.

Not his mother.

Not Wren.

Not Walter.

Himself.

Older. Not by much, but visibly—lines around the mouth, streaks of gray in the hair, eyes that had seen further than Nathan could imagine.

This version of him stood by a desk.

On it, a book.

The ledger.

But larger now. Bound in something that resembled memory more than leather.

“Is this the spiral?” Nathan asked.

His older self nodded. “You’ve arrived.”

Nathan looked down at the book. “And if I read it?”

“It becomes the new draft.”

“Do I get to write it?”

“You already have.”

They stood in silence, two halves of a story that had never been meant to exist at once.

Nathan opened the book.

The first page held no date.

Just words.

“I remembered when it mattered. I forgot when it didn’t. I lied when it hurt. I stopped lying when it hurt worse to pretend.”

He turned the page.

“I abandoned. I returned. I wandered. I chose. And in choosing, I did not erase the past—I gave it context.”

He looked up.

“I don’t want to forget again.”

The other Nathan gave a sad, soft smile.

“Then keep reading.”

Page after page.

A life rewritten in fragments.

Choices reclaimed.

Not erased. Not undone.

Re-understood.

There was no final chapter.

Just a single blank page.

A pen waited beside the book.

Nathan stared at it.

The older self spoke, not unkind
