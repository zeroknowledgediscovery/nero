Title: Paper Walls

Chapter One: The Elevator Game

The hum of fluorescent lights buzzed above, slightly out of sync with the rhythmic clack of keyboards. Carter Ellison adjusted the knot of his tie, which had started the morning crisp and symmetrical and now slouched like it had a hangover. He stepped into the elevator, the brushed metal doors shutting behind him with a sigh.

On the way to the 18th floor of Rembrandt & Lowe, a mid-sized advertising firm that took itself very seriously, Carter wasn’t alone. Lydia Park, with her sharp glasses and sarcastic smile, stood at the back of the elevator, thumbing through Slack messages on her phone. She didn't look up when he entered, but he felt her presence like a mild electric current.

“Morning, Carter,” she said without looking.

He hesitated, uncertain whether she was talking to him or the phone.

"Hey," he replied, glancing at the floor numbers. "Big pitch today?"

"Every day’s a pitch. Today just happens to involve more coffee and fewer excuses," she replied, slipping her phone into her pocket.

The elevator dinged and let them out into the open-concept hellscape that was their floor. Rows of desks, half-heartedly separated by frosted glass partitions, stretched under a ceiling of exposed ductwork and corporate optimism. The place reeked of burnt espresso and ambition.

Carter dropped into his chair beside Joel, the junior copywriter who dressed like he lived out of a lost-and-found box but spoke like a TED Talk. Joel was already sipping from a ceramic mug that read: Don’t Talk To Me Until I’ve Had My Buzzwords.

“Client’s early,” Joel said, not looking away from his monitor. “Like five minutes ago. Lydia’s running point.”

Carter blinked. “What, they’re in the boardroom already?”

Joel nodded. “The McKellan account. She pulled rank. I think she’s in kill mode.”

Kill mode. That was Lydia’s thing. She could destroy a pitch with a precision Carter both admired and feared. She didn’t wield power, she carved with it.

He stood, straightened his tie again, and crossed the floor to the glass-walled conference room. Inside, Lydia was already presenting, her slides clean, her tone casual but sharp-edged. Across the table sat a trio of clients, all with identically folded hands and faces trained in polite skepticism.

Carter took a seat near the back, catching the tail end of Lydia’s line: “…and that’s not just what your brand says. It’s what it whispers.”

Silence. Then the oldest of the three clients—a man with a tan that looked like it came from a bottle and not the sun—nodded slowly.

“Interesting. But what’s the metric behind that whisper?” he asked.

Lydia didn’t miss a beat. “Engagement. Retention. Loyalty. We speak softly, but we make damn sure they listen.”

It was the kind of line that would’ve sounded ridiculous coming from anyone else. But from Lydia, it landed.

After the meeting, Carter caught her by the copy machine.

“Whispers, huh?” he said, leaning against the wall.

She smirked. “Not every campaign needs to shout. Some of them just need to lean in.”

“You’ve been reading old Don Draper scripts again.”

“Guilty. But hey, it worked. They bought in.”

Carter handed her a coffee he had snagged on the way out. “Peace offering. For not telling me you hijacked the pitch.”

She took it, giving him a sideways glance. “Not hijacked. Delegated.”

“Sure. Just next time maybe loop me in on the delegation part.”

There was a flicker of something—amusement, maybe—in her eyes. “Fair.”

Chapter Two: Welcome to Tuesday

By Tuesday, the team had pivoted to full-throttle mode. The McKellan win had elevated Lydia’s status from respected to revered. Carter watched from his desk as people orbited her with new caution, the way junior staff tiptoe around a senior partner they suspect might remember names if she had time.

They were given the Valcor project next—a tech brand trying to break into luxury home automation. This one was Carter’s. Or at least it was supposed to be.

“So here’s the concept,” he began at the morning meeting. “Valcor wants to be seen as both smart and subtle. Think: a house that doesn’t just talk to you, it anticipates you.”

“Like a psychic but with LEDs,” Joel added.

Carter ignored him. “We don’t show the product. We show its absence. Rooms that feel curated, not cluttered. Technology that doesn’t interrupt, it adapts.”

He glanced toward Lydia, who was uncharacteristically quiet. She was sketching something in the margin of her notebook.

“You’re going with minimalism?” she asked.

“Exactly. Let the absence speak.”

She nodded slowly, then said, “Flip it.”

“What?”

“Overdesign the hell out of it. Make it oppressive. Too many screens. Talking fridges. Overstimulating, noisy, over-connected.”

He stared. “But that’s the opposite of—”

“Right. We show what the world looks like without Valcor. Then cut to peace. A room where everything just… works.”

The room was silent for a beat. Then Joel said, “Damn. That’s good.”

Carter’s mouth was dry. He knew the idea was better than his. He hated that he knew it.

“Let’s build both versions,” Lydia said, standing. “Run them past focus groups. Fast.”

As the room emptied, Carter lingered.

“You always do that?” he asked.

“What?”

“Hijack and improve?”

Lydia shrugged. “I only hijack if there’s a better way to land the plane.”

He wanted to argue, but he also wanted to win. And he couldn’t deny the elegance of her angle.

He went back to his desk, frustrated but intrigued. The line between rivalry and flirtation had always been blurry with Lydia, and he wasn’t entirely sure if either of them wanted it sharpened.

Chapter Three: Fire Alarms and Secrets

It was during the quarterly fire drill that Carter saw her notebook again—the one with the sketch she’d made in the meeting. While the entire floor evacuated down sixteen flights of emergency stairs, Lydia stopped halfway to check her phone.

He leaned over. “That important?”

“Only if you think missed calls from creative directors are life-threatening.”

The stairwell was stuffy, filled with the murmur of colleagues pretending not to hate the forced camaraderie. Carter noticed her sketch again—curved lines, an unfinished logo, notes in shorthand. Not Valcor-related. Something else.

“You working on a side project?”

She didn’t answer right away. Then: “You ever think about quitting?”

The question hit him sideways. “Every Monday morning.”

She laughed. “No, I mean really quitting. Leaving all this. Starting something of your own.”

Carter hesitated. “Sometimes. But ideas are cheap. Rent isn’t.”

“Still. Doesn’t it feel like we’re building other people’s empires with our ideas?”

He looked around. Joel was halfway up the stairs quoting Nietzsche to someone. A graphic designer was carrying a plant. The whole office, displaced and dazed.

“Yeah,” he said quietly. “Sometimes it does.”

Lydia didn’t reply, but her look said more than silence usually did.

Later that week, Carter found a name scribbled on the back of a napkin near the trash: “Studio Nine.” A domain name was written below it. It wasn’t anyone’s project on file.

He pocketed it.

Chapter Four: Lines in the Carpet

By mid-February, everything had changed and nothing had.

The McKellan campaign was now live. Valcor was in pre-production. Lydia and Carter had fallen into a rhythm—a volatile, unpredictable rhythm. They finished each other’s sentences and undermined each other’s slides. There was a tension between them like the kind that sparks only when you know someone could either change your life or completely ruin your week.

Joel noticed.

“You guys gonna kiss or throw staplers at each other?” he asked one afternoon, eating instant noodles with a fork from the supply closet.

“Neither,” Carter said, too quickly.

“Both,” Lydia replied from behind him.

That night, after everyone had left, Carter stayed late. He logged onto the domain scribbled on the napkin. A simple placeholder site loaded: “Studio Nine – Coming Soon.”

He clicked the source code. No contact info. No linked profiles. Clean, anonymous.

The next morning, he confronted Lydia in the breakroom.

“You’re starting your own agency?”

She didn’t flinch. “Maybe.”

“With who?”

“No one yet.”

He folded his arms. “Why tell me?”

“I didn’t.”

“But you left the napkin.”

“Maybe I wanted you to find it.”

The silence between them wasn’t awkward. It was electric.

“You serious?” he asked.

Her eyes met his. “Are you?”

–––

After the morning’s pitch, Carter retreated to his corner of the open floor plan—a desk that offered just enough privacy for daydreaming but not enough for productivity. The glass office walls made everything visible, like a fishbowl designed for high-functioning anxiety. He half-heartedly reviewed mockups for an account he didn't particularly care about, clicking through slides that blurred together in a haze of marketing jargon and half-formed slogans. Outside his window, the city pressed in—towering glass buildings and streetlights blinking like tired eyes. Carter let his fingers drift over the keyboard but typed nothing.

He glanced across the office and found Lydia deep in conversation with Simon Brant, one of the creative directors whose cologne entered a room two seconds before he did. Simon leaned too close, smiled too wide. Lydia smiled back, but it was the tight-lipped kind Carter had come to recognize. She was measuring him, not enjoying him.

Carter returned to his screen, annoyed without fully understanding why. He had known Lydia for just under a year, since she'd transferred from the firm’s Chicago office, and in that time they’d gone from mild acquaintances to reluctant collaborators to… something more complicated. She was the kind of person who made everyone else feel a step behind without ever seeming rushed herself. Carter admired that. He also resented it.

At noon, the company catered lunch—an offering meant to inspire loyalty but mostly resulted in digestive complaints and passive-aggressive Slack messages. Carter filled a compostable plate with grilled vegetables and something vaguely Mediterranean, then scanned the break area for a seat. He found one beside Ava from data analytics, who was known for saying very little and analyzing very much.

“You hear about the new account?” she asked, stabbing a cherry tomato with her fork.

“Valcor?”

“No, different one. Just came in this morning. Under wraps.”

“Then how’d you hear about it?”

She gave him a look that said, please, and he realized how dumb the question sounded. Ava had access to every number that passed through the building. She probably knew how many times he visited the bathroom last week.

“It’s something big,” she added. “CEO-level big. Internal code name: ‘Project Silver.’ Rumor is, they’re building a new vertical around it.”

Carter raised an eyebrow. “Any idea who’s heading it?”

“Nope. But if I had to guess…”

They both looked toward Lydia, who was now at her desk, fingers flying over the keyboard like she was trying to outrun her own thoughts.

“Of course,” Carter muttered.

That afternoon, a sudden downpour turned the office windows into frosted glass. The mood in the room shifted—less productive, more contemplative. Rain made people nostalgic or lazy. Sometimes both.

Joel wandered over with a mug of something herbal that smelled like regret.

“You believe in fate?” he asked, leaning on Carter’s desk.

“Do I believe the universe has a plan for me? No. Do I believe in deadlines? Barely.”

Joel ignored the sarcasm. “I mean like—people ending up in the right jobs, meeting the right people. That kind of thing.”

“Is this because of Lydia?”

Joel smirked. “She’s different. She doesn’t just work here. She moves like she owns air rights to the place.”

Carter didn’t respond. He kept his eyes on his screen, though nothing registered.

“You ever think about what she did before this?” Joel pressed.

“She was in Chicago.”

“Yeah, but before that.”

“No idea.”

“Exactly. No one does. She doesn’t talk about it.”

“Maybe she doesn’t want to.”

“Or maybe it’s something big.”

Carter gave him a look. “What are you saying, she’s in witness protection?”

Joel raised his eyebrows. “Just saying, we don’t really know her. But we all orbit her like she’s gravity.”

The conversation left Carter unsettled. Not because he believed Lydia had some hidden past—he didn’t care for conspiracy theories—but because it was true: she did seem to pull the office into her rhythm. And he had no idea how she did it.

The following morning, Carter arrived early. Not out of ambition, but insomnia. He took the elevator alone and sat at his desk with a coffee that tasted like cardboard and caffeine. The silence was eerie—no Slack pings, no printer chugging, no Joel. Just the hum of machinery pretending to be quiet.

Lydia arrived twenty minutes later. She looked surprised to see him.

“Early bird,” she said, taking off her coat. “You okay?”

He nodded. “Just thought I’d try the whole productivity-before-sunrise thing.”

She didn’t respond right away. Instead, she walked past him to the kitchenette and returned with two cups. She set one beside his elbow.

“I made this one myself. Less poison.”

He raised it in mock salute. “Cheers to surviving.”

They sat like that for a while, not working, not talking. The silence was companionable. Unusual. And Carter suddenly realized that in the months they’d worked together, they had never spent time like this—unscheduled and unstructured. No pretense of competition, no performance. Just two people, sharing space.

“I’m thinking of leaving,” Lydia said quietly.

Carter’s heart stopped for a beat. “What?”

“Not right away. But soon.”

“Why?”

She hesitated. “I want something that’s mine. I don’t want to keep building other people’s ladders.”

He understood. More than he wanted to admit.

“You’re starting something?”

She nodded. “Maybe. I’m still working it out.”

“With anyone else?”

“Not yet.”

He tried to measure his next words, but they fell out before he could edit them. “Are you asking me to join you?”

She looked at him then, really looked at him. And her silence said more than any yes or no could.

The elevator chimed again. The office began to fill. The moment passed.

But it didn’t vanish.

By Friday, everything was back to normal on the surface. Carter handed off a campaign draft to Lydia, who critiqued it with her usual blend of insight and sarcasm. Joel made another Nietzsche reference. Ava ran a report that made everyone feel underpaid.

But something had shifted. A tension had opened between them—not conflict, not romance, but potential. Something unspoken that hovered over shared screens and idle chats. Something that looked suspiciously like the beginning of a conspiracy.

That weekend, Carter didn’t sleep much. He kept thinking about Lydia’s words, about the way she’d said “mine” like it was a vow. He opened a blank document and typed three words at the top:

Studio Nine Draft.

Then he deleted them.

And typed them again.

Chapter Two: Studio Nine

Monday mornings carried a certain weight at Rembrandt & Lowe. Not because the workweek began—everyone expected that—but because Monday was when things changed. Someone would be gone, someone promoted, a team restructured, a campaign unexpectedly pulled. It was a ritual of quiet upheaval masked by bagels and stale jokes about “surviving the weekend.” Carter arrived five minutes early, a habit he’d started without realizing. Lydia was already there, tapping away at her keyboard with a cup of mint tea beside her. Her eyes flicked up when he sat down.

“Sleep over the weekend?” she asked without looking away from her screen.

“Define sleep,” Carter replied, loosening his scarf. “I closed my eyes for intervals. There was darkness.”

She smirked faintly and said nothing more. For a few minutes, the only sound was the low hum of startup noise—devices booting, fingers tapping, printers groaning into life. At 9:03 a.m., an all-staff meeting notification popped up on everyone’s screen: Conference Room A. Mandatory.

Joel arrived seconds later with a granola bar in his mouth. He dropped into his chair and glanced at the notification.

“That can’t be good.”

“Or it’s very good,” Carter said, though his tone lacked conviction.

They filed into Conference Room A with the rest of the department. The glass walls fogged slightly from the sheer mass of human breath. It was the kind of crowd that could only be wrangled by someone with absolute authority or complete delusion. This time, it was Gordon Radley, the VP of Creative, who resembled a human version of a husky—larger than necessary and always slightly out of breath. He cleared his throat and tugged at the lapel of his blazer, as if that would magically give his voice more depth.

“Thank you for coming in on time,” he began, glancing meaningfully at Joel, who was still chewing. “We’ve got a few announcements today, but let’s start with the one that affects all of you directly. Starting next quarter, we’re restructuring accounts across departments. You’ll be working more closely with cross-functional teams, which means less siloing, more integration, more—”

“Buzzwords,” Lydia whispered.

Carter almost choked on his coffee.

Gordon continued, oblivious or indifferent to the ripple of discomfort his announcement had caused. “This new structure will align our resources to maximize client impact. You’ll be notified this week if your team is changing. Also, we’re launching an internal innovation challenge—anyone with a pitch for a new venture, product, or process improvement is encouraged to submit by the end of the month.”

Joel perked up. “Like Shark Tank?”

Gordon nodded. “Except no sharks. And no tank. But you might get funding.”

The meeting dissolved into murmurs. Lydia stood and left without a word. Carter followed her into the hallway.

“You going to pitch something?” he asked once they were out of earshot.

“I might,” she said.

“Studio Nine?”

She didn’t answer immediately. Then she gave a slow, deliberate nod. “Maybe not by name. But the skeleton of it, yeah.”

Carter felt a strange twist in his gut. He should’ve been excited. He had wanted her to take the leap, to give this half-formed dream a name and a voice. But now that she was doing it, the distance between them widened. If she was moving, it meant he had to decide whether to move with her.

Later that afternoon, he sat in a brainstorming session for a rebranding campaign involving environmentally conscious pet food. The room smelled like vegan leather and frustration. Carter barely heard a word being said. His mind drifted to Lydia’s sketchbook, the fragments of a future she had started piecing together. He realized he was jealous—not of her talent, but of her clarity.

After the meeting, he returned to his desk and pulled out a notebook from his bottom drawer. Not his work notebook—the other one. The one with scribbles and timelines and rejected names. He opened it to a fresh page and wrote at the top: If we built it ourselves, what would it look like?

He didn’t hear Lydia approach. She leaned over his shoulder, read the heading, and whispered, “You’re late.”

He turned to her. “What?”

“I already wrote that down last week. Page fourteen.”

He blinked. “You went through my notebook?”

“No,” she said, smirking. “But I guessed you’d ask that question eventually.”

For the next few days, the office buzzed with speculative energy. People whispered in corners, comparing notes about who might be moved, who might be promoted, who might be cut. The innovation challenge became a lifeboat for some and a power play for others. Carter and Lydia started meeting in secret—half-hours stolen in empty huddle rooms, scribbling notes on whiteboards they always erased afterward. Their pitch was still nebulous, but the vision was solid: an agency built around ethical branding and minimalist design. Studio Nine. The name stuck.

Joel caught wind of something but couldn’t get details. “You two are up to something,” he said one evening, leaning over Carter’s desk with suspicious eyes.

“We’re just busy,” Carter replied, a little too quickly.

“You’re never this quiet unless you're hiding something.”

Carter tried to brush it off, but Joel had an intuition about people, even if he buried it under sarcasm and sugar. The tension grew. The silence between Carter and Joel became charged with unspoken truths. Lydia noticed.

“We should bring him in,” she said one night after hours, as they sat in the office kitchen eating cold takeout.

“Joel? Are you serious?”

“He’s smarter than people think. And loyal.”

Carter sighed. “And nosy.”

“That, too. But he’d be an asset. We can’t do this alone.”

Carter thought about it. Studio Nine had started as a whisper, a joke almost. But now they had outlines. They had timelines. They even had a prototype website, buried behind password protection and cryptic code names. The more real it became, the more absurd it felt to keep pretending it was nothing.

“Fine,” he said. “But if he makes one Lord of the Rings reference during the pitch, he’s out.”

Lydia grinned. “Deal.”

The next day, they brought Joel into one of the soundproof pods. Carter presented the idea while Lydia clicked through mockups and slides. Joel didn’t say much at first. When they finished, he leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.

“You’re both insane,” he said finally.

Carter’s stomach dropped.

“But I’m in.”

They shook hands without ceremony. There was no speech, no toast. Just the quiet, mutual understanding that something had begun.

By the end of the week, they’d submitted their pitch to the innovation challenge under the name “Project Lucent,” masking the real name until they could secure the domain. They kept working late, refining the pitch, meeting in cafes, updating decks, pretending to care about other projects in the office. Something thrilling hung in the air—risk disguised as excitement.

On Friday, Carter walked into Lydia’s office and found her staring out the window.

“We’re going to win,” she said without turning around.

He raised an eyebrow. “You don’t know that.”

“No,” she agreed. “But I can feel it.”

He stepped closer. “If we win, this place changes.”

“Only if we let it.”

She turned then, her expression calm but fierce.

“We’re not just building an agency, Carter. We’re building a way out.”

Outside, the sun dipped low, casting shadows across the city like bars. Inside, the light caught her eyes and turned them silver.

Carter nodded.

Then they went back to work.

–––

The following week unfolded with the deliberate pace of a chess match. Every move mattered. While the surface routines of the office remained the same—team standups, endless email threads, whiteboard scrawls that vanished by lunch—the current underneath grew more turbulent. Lydia, Carter, and Joel met every other evening in what they jokingly called “The War Room,” a forgotten back-office space previously used for document storage and rarely visited by anyone since the firm went paperless. It was quiet, windowless, and perfect for planning a mutiny.

Each night, they pushed their pitch further, not just refining the language but sharpening the philosophy. Studio Nine wouldn’t be a standard agency. It wouldn’t chase trends or rely on bloated client rosters. It would offer focused, stripped-back branding for companies that wanted to speak clearly in a world saturated by noise. Their mantra—crafted by Lydia and signed off by all three—was simple: Design speaks louder when it whispers.

They worked in a kind of flow state, with Carter building out structural outlines for their pitch deck while Joel dove deep into user behavior research and audience modeling. Lydia, always the strategist, tied it all together with storylines and visual metaphors that made even the most abstract concepts feel intimate. Carter admired how she worked with absolute control yet left enough room for spontaneity to breathe. She didn't dictate—she conducted.

One evening, after four hours of working and three cups of coffee too many, Joel looked up from his screen and said, “You know we’re going to piss off Gordon if we win this, right?”

Lydia didn’t look up. “We don’t owe Gordon anything.”

“Yeah, but the guy's got an ego the size of Chicago.”

“Then he can buy more mirrors,” she replied, finally turning away from her laptop. “We’re not here to manage feelings. We’re here to build something better.”

Carter could tell Joel wasn’t entirely convinced, but he didn’t argue. Instead, he pulled his hoodie tighter and kept typing.

The team wasn’t the only one feeling the tension. Around the office, small changes were happening. Senior staff grew quieter in meetings. HR personnel lingered longer than necessary at team check-ins. Ava, from data, confided to Carter that two analysts had been quietly let go. No announcement. No goodbye email.

“Something’s shifting,” she said one afternoon, her eyes narrowing over the rim of her coffee cup. “This isn’t just restructuring. This is positioning.”

“For what?” Carter asked.

“Power,” she replied simply. “Someone’s trying to build their own kingdom, and someone else is about to get exiled.”

He wondered if she was talking about Gordon or Lydia. Maybe both.

By the second Friday of the month, the innovation challenge presentations were announced. Ten teams had submitted ideas, but only four had been selected to pitch to the executive board. Studio Nine—still masked under the name “Project Lucent”—had made the list.

Carter got the news via email while sitting at his desk, pretending to review analytics on the McKellan campaign. He turned in his chair to look at Lydia, who was already watching him. She didn’t smile. She didn’t need to. The spark in her eyes said everything.

The pitch was scheduled for the following Wednesday. They had less than five days to turn a bold idea into a business case that could survive corporate scrutiny.

That weekend, the War Room became their second home. Carter brought a French press and a Bluetooth speaker. Joel brought takeout and a list of obscure startup failure statistics. Lydia brought a whiteboard she’d rescued from a disused meeting space and began sketching diagrams that looked part-art, part-war-map.

“We open with the problem,” Lydia said late Saturday evening, wiping dry-erase marker off her fingers. “Too much noise in the market. Consumers are overwhelmed. Brands compete for volume instead of value.”

Joel nodded. “Then we show the cost—low engagement, ad fatigue, customer churn.”

“Exactly,” Carter said, stepping in. “Then we present Studio Nine as the antidote. Ethical branding. Intentional design. Campaigns that act like conversations instead of shouting matches.”

They refined it again and again. Deleted half the slides. Rebuilt them. Carter caught himself worrying less about whether they'd win and more about whether they were building something that could survive past the pitch. That’s when he knew he was in too deep to turn back.

On Monday morning, the atmosphere in the office was strange—anticipatory, like the minutes before a storm. Word had gotten around about the pitch list. People were guessing what each code name stood for, gambling over coffee about who would come out on top. Lydia pretended not to care, but she tightened the ponytail at the base of her neck with an almost militant precision. Joel wore a collared shirt for the first time in three months. Carter realized he hadn’t shaved all weekend.

They kept rehearsing, even between meetings. They stole time wherever they could. Hallways. Supply closets. Cafés on the corner. At one point, Lydia took out her phone and showed Carter a message she’d received: “If this is your idea, you better be ready for what comes after.” The sender was anonymous.

He stared at it. “You think Gordon sent that?”

“Maybe. Maybe someone trying to help. Doesn’t matter.”

But it did matter. Because now it wasn’t just a pitch. It was a challenge. A line in the sand.

Wednesday came, and with it, the pitch.

They were third in the schedule. As the previous team exited the boardroom, Carter caught a glimpse of their mockup—an internal productivity app built around gamification. It looked sleek. Safe. Entirely forgettable.

Studio Nine’s turn arrived.

Lydia opened. She walked into the boardroom wearing a fitted black blazer and confidence that could fracture stone. Carter followed with the deck loaded on a tablet, Joel behind them with a printout of their models. The executives barely looked up from their laptops. Gordon leaned back in his chair with arms folded, a smirk barely restrained.

The first slide was a black screen with white text: We don’t sell noise. We make meaning.

Lydia spoke first. Her voice was calm, paced, and unwavering.

“Most agencies will tell you they have a new way to sell an old product. We’re not here to do that. We’re not here to sell louder. We’re here to sell smarter. We’re building an agency for brands that want to be remembered—not for being the loudest, but for saying something worth hearing.”

Carter took over, walking them through the business structure, operational model, projected margins, early partnerships. Joel wrapped it up with analytics and a testimonial from a startup they’d mock-branded as part of their case study.

Silence followed the final slide.

Then one of the executives—a woman Carter recognized from the finance division—leaned forward and asked, “What makes you think you can scale this?”

Lydia met her gaze. “Because we’ve already started.”

The room shifted. Not physically, but perceptibly. The tone changed. They were no longer presenting a possibility. They were presenting a reality.

After the Q&A, the board thanked them. They left the room, hearts hammering, adrenaline crackling under their skin. Back in the War Room, they collapsed onto the mismatched chairs like survivors of a mild earthquake.

Joel exhaled. “I think I forgot how to blink during that.”

Carter laughed, mostly from relief. Lydia didn’t say anything. She just stared at the boardroom door like it still held part of her.

Hours passed. The office went quiet. People left. The sun set. And then, just before midnight, Lydia’s phone buzzed.

She looked at the screen, then handed it to Carter.

It read: “Project Lucent approved. Full funding. Meet tomorrow 8 a.m. for transition planning.”

Carter looked up. Joel grinned.

Lydia exhaled, the tension slipping from her shoulders like a coat.

And then, without preamble, she said, “Let’s burn the map.”

Chapter Three: The Handshake and the Knife

The next morning, Carter arrived before the sun had fully risen. The city outside the glass tower of Rembrandt & Lowe was still wiping sleep from its eyes—windows lit like patchwork lanterns, the streets thick with condensation and delivery trucks. Inside the office, it was near silent, save for the automated ventilation clicking to life and the low hum of the fridge in the staff kitchen. He poured himself a coffee and waited by the tall windows, staring out over the concrete maze.

Lydia walked in twenty minutes later, dressed in navy instead of black, the blazer less severe than usual. Her hair was tied in a knot that looked effortless but wasn’t. Joel arrived last, wearing sneakers and a button-down shirt he clearly hadn’t ironed. He yawned and leaned against the nearest counter, sipping from a travel mug emblazoned with YOU CAN’T SPELL SUCCESS WITHOUT CSS.

At precisely 8:00 a.m., Gordon Radley summoned them to Conference Room C—neutral territory. It was the room they used when potential investors came in or when HR had to mediate between departments without bruising egos. The frosted door bore no logo, and the walls inside were an indistinct taupe, carefully chosen to inspire nothing.

Lydia sat closest to the head of the table. Gordon entered moments later, trailed by two senior executives from operations and legal. He didn’t look pleased. He didn’t look angry either. He looked like a man whose domain had been quietly stolen during the night.

“Well,” he began, adjusting his jacket as he took his seat, “congratulations.”

Joel blinked in surprise. “That’s it?”

Gordon smiled thinly. “Would you like a marching band?”

“No,” Lydia said calmly. “Just clarity.”

The woman from legal—Greta, Carter recalled—opened a folder. “The board has reviewed your proposal, and effective immediately, Studio Nine is to be recognized as a formally incubated subsidiary under Rembrandt & Lowe. You’ll be granted startup funding from the innovation initiative fund. You’ll operate independently but report quarterly. You'll maintain office space on this floor for the time being, though relocation options will be reviewed in the next cycle.”

Carter processed the words slowly. This wasn’t just a green light. It was a leash.

Lydia asked, “What’s the duration of the initial funding phase?”

“Six months,” Greta replied. “Followed by performance review. Continued support will depend on metrics, client retention, and brand growth.”

Gordon folded his hands on the table. “Which means if it flops, you come back here with your heads lowered.”

“No pressure,” Joel muttered.

Gordon ignored him and continued. “You’ll retain access to certain internal tools—HR, billing, basic design resources—but otherwise, you’re on your own. Sink or swim.”

Carter felt the words tighten in his chest. There was something in Gordon’s tone that suggested he was hoping for sink. But Lydia didn’t flinch.

“We’ll swim.”

For the rest of the morning, they reviewed contracts and sign-offs, then toured the three adjacent rooms being cleared for their new workspace. The walls were beige, the desks still held dust from previous occupants, and the overhead lights flickered faintly when turned on.

“It’s like a startup with no startup smell,” Joel joked, opening a window that refused to budge.

“It’ll do,” Lydia said. “We’re not here to decorate.”

Still, they spent most of the afternoon arranging furniture and wiping down surfaces. Joel brought in a cheap lamp he’d found at a flea market and set it on his desk as a kind of totem. Carter stuck a printout of their mission statement to the wall using a piece of scotch tape from a nearly-empty dispenser. Lydia brought in a single item—a glass paperweight shaped like a bird in mid-flight.

By evening, it looked… almost real.

Their first few days as Studio Nine weren’t glamorous. There were no champagne corks, no celebratory dinners, no glossy LinkedIn announcements. Instead, there were client lists to chase, cold emails to draft, back-end systems to set up. They spent hours refining their offerings—three clear packages for clients: Brand Whisper, Visual Harmony, and Narrative Arc. Each with defined deliverables, timelines, and pricing.

“We have to look like we’ve been doing this for years,” Lydia said as she drafted their introductory deck. “No one trusts first-timers. They trust polish.”

Joel handled the branding—colors, typography, logo variations. He designed a logo shaped like a whisper mark, part quotation, part brushstroke. It was subtle, clever, forgettable in the way good design should be.

Carter wrote the manifesto. Three paragraphs long, direct, and almost poetic. It opened with: We are not what you shout. We are what people remember when the volume fades.

He read it out loud and when he finished, Lydia said only, “Perfect.”

Then came the awkward part: working in the same building as the company they’d just stepped away from. Rembrandt & Lowe hadn’t kicked them out—they were still technically within its walls—but it was clear that they were no longer part of the family. People glanced at them differently now. Smiles became brief. Questions became strategic. Conversations stopped when they walked into rooms.

Ava from data stayed friendly, but even she warned them in hushed tones.

“Gordon’s not done. You made him look weak. He’ll wait for you to screw up.”

“Let him wait,” Carter said. But inside, he wasn’t so sure.

Their first client came by accident. A mid-tier clothing brand that had seen their internal newsletter and reached out for consultation. They weren’t glamorous, but they were real. Lydia scheduled the first meeting for a Thursday afternoon. Carter wore his second-best blazer. Joel wore his sneakers again.

The client was nervous. Unclear. Scattered. They spoke in phrases like “authentic synergy” and “pivot potential.”

Lydia listened carefully. Then she rewrote the entire brief on a napkin during the meeting and slid it across the table.

“This is what you’re trying to say,” she told them. “Let us help you say it better.”

The client signed the contract the next day.

That weekend, they finally allowed themselves to celebrate. They didn’t go to a bar or a rooftop lounge. Instead, they gathered at Lydia’s apartment—an eighth-floor walk-up with a view of the river and a balcony just big enough for three people. They drank whiskey from mismatched mugs and listened to Joel’s Spotify playlist titled Ambitious but Sleep-Deprived.

At one point, Carter stepped onto the balcony alone. The city buzzed below—sirens, laughter, traffic. He stared at the lights and wondered what they had just done. Studio Nine existed. It breathed. But so much could still go wrong.

Lydia joined him a moment later, her mug in hand.

“We’re going to be okay,” she said.

“You sure?”

“No. But I like our odds.”

He looked at her then, the way someone might look at a compass and hope it was pointing true north.

“I’ve never built anything from scratch before,” he admitted.

“You’re not building it alone,” she replied.

They stood in silence for a while after that.

Back inside, Joel was asleep on the couch, one shoe on, one off. The speakers hummed softly with the last notes of a jazz track no one had selected.

Lydia turned off the lights.

Carter looked at her in the dark.

And something about the way she smiled told him they were already in deeper than any of them realized.

The next two weeks passed in a blur of caffeine, tight deadlines, and cautious optimism. The Studio Nine team worked with the energy of people who knew they were under a microscope. Every file had to be double-checked. Every response to a client had to be pitch-perfect. Lydia kept a running list on a whiteboard in their office titled “Prove We Belong,” with items like First client success, Brand mention in trade blog, Gordon tries to sabotage us. That last one was half a joke. Half.

Their first client, Norelli Apparel, launched their campaign with muted confidence. The pitch Lydia had reengineered during that first napkin meeting had been molded into a full concept: quiet luxury for everyday people. The branding leaned into earthy tones, soft music, minimalist taglines. Joel produced digital ads that looked like they were printed in fog. Carter oversaw the messaging with the precision of a man rewriting the dictionary. The client was cautious but thrilled. After the first week of live results, their engagement rate tripled.

“It's not flashy, but it works,” Carter told them on the client call.

“No,” Lydia corrected, “it works because it’s not flashy.”

Norelli's head of marketing offered to refer them to two other brands. One call turned into two meetings. Two meetings turned into a lunch that ended with handshakes and interest. Within days, Studio Nine had three active inquiries. Carter wanted to celebrate again. Joel suggested tacos. Lydia said not yet.

“We haven’t made anything that lasts,” she said. “A spark is not the same as a fire.”

Still, the mood in the office lightened. Carter started showing up early, not because he had to, but because he wanted to. Joel brought in a small Bluetooth projector and began playing random nature documentaries on mute during lunch. Lydia allowed a single plant—a tiny succulent she placed near the window like a symbol of cautious hope.

Then came the meeting with Finance.

They’d been asked—required, technically—to submit a cost projection for their next two quarters. The meeting was scheduled for a Tuesday morning, with a man named Vincent Law who wore cufflinks shaped like dollar signs and introduced himself as “just here to keep the math honest.”

From the start, Carter disliked him. It wasn’t the condescension in his tone or the way he interrupted Lydia during her budget walkthrough. It wasn’t even the way he glanced at Joel like he wasn’t supposed to speak. It was something deeper. Calculated. Like Vincent already knew something they didn’t.

“Your burn rate is high for your size,” Vincent said, flipping through printouts. “You’re over-leveraging resources. And this team composition? Three creatives, zero account managers. That’s… unconventional.”

“It’s lean,” Lydia said.

“It’s unsustainable,” Vincent replied.

“We’re not looking to build a corporate pyramid,” Carter interjected. “We’re building something agile.”

Vincent smirked. “Agility without oversight becomes chaos. The board wants projections showing profitability by Q3. Otherwise…”

He didn’t finish the sentence. He didn’t have to. The implied threat sat between them like a stone.

After he left, Joel cursed under his breath. “That guy makes spreadsheets sound like death threats.”

Carter turned to Lydia. “You think Gordon sent him?”

“He didn’t have to,” she said. “Finance is always the second knife.”

The warning stayed with them. They doubled down on metrics. Joel spent late nights tracking analytics, building dashboards, compiling reports. Carter reworked proposal templates to include clearer ROI justifications. Lydia began drafting a thought leadership piece for a design journal, something that could lift their credibility without relying on corporate PR.

Despite the pressure, they landed a second client—an indie tech firm looking for a full rebrand. It wasn’t a massive project, but it was ambitious: visual identity, UX redesign, and a full voice guide. It came with its own headaches, including a founder who described their product as “the Uber of empathy” and wanted colors that “felt like gratitude.”

Joel nearly walked out of the first meeting.

But they delivered. And once again, the client was happy.

By the end of the month, Studio Nine had its name quietly passed around industry circles. A junior editor at a branding magazine called Lydia asking for a quote. Carter started getting unsolicited emails from freelancers wanting to collaborate. Joel found their logo reposted on a design blog without credit. It was a good problem, but a strange one.

Then, just as things began to feel steady, Carter received the message.

It arrived as an internal memo. The subject line read: Operational Realignment Proposal. The contents detailed a proposal to bring Studio Nine back into the main creative department “to ensure greater efficiency and accountability.” The memo wasn’t signed, but the language screamed Gordon. And buried at the bottom was a single bullet point: Personnel reallocation to begin by Q4 if approved.

Carter brought it to Lydia immediately. She read it twice, then once more in silence. Her expression didn’t change, but he noticed her jaw tighten.

“He’s trying to absorb us,” she said.

“He’s trying to kill us and make it look like a promotion.”

Joel walked in mid-conversation. “You mean the memo? Yeah. Ava sent it to me the second she saw it hit the system.”

Carter ran a hand through his hair. “What’s our play?”

Lydia stood. “We don’t wait. We go public.”

Carter stared at her. “What do you mean?”

“We tell our story. Full launch. Real name. Real site. Press piece. Portfolio reveal. If we’re out in the open, if people see what we’ve built, it’s harder to erase us.”

“But that puts a target on our backs.”

“There’s already a target. We may as well be loud about it.”

Joel gave a dry laugh. “For a company built on whispers, that’s pretty damn bold.”

“We whisper until we need to roar,” Lydia said. “Now we roar.”

The next three days were the most intense they’d had since launch. They finalized case studies, edited mockups, and cleaned the site for public view. Carter wrote a brand statement that opened with: We believe brands should not shout to be heard. But today, we choose to speak clearly. Joel animated the logo into a soft reveal—simple, graceful, unassuming. Lydia coordinated with the editor who’d called her weeks ago. The article went live Thursday at noon: The Studio Behind the Silence: How a Tiny Branding Team is Redefining Design Philosophy.

Within hours, they were trending in a small but vocal corner of the industry.

By Friday, the memo had been pulled from the internal system.

Gordon didn’t speak to them for three days.

But the silence, for once, was on their terms.

Chapter Four: The Undercurrent

The euphoria of their public launch lingered for days, and Studio Nine's office pulsed with a different energy—one part validation, one part vigilance. The press coverage had drawn attention from the outside world, sparking curiosity and admiration from peers, freelancers, and even a few competitors who sent backhanded compliments disguised as questions. But it had also shifted the atmosphere inside Rembrandt & Lowe into something colder, more brittle.

People from the larger firm now passed them in the halls with practiced neutrality. Not icy, not friendly—just distant enough to indicate that a line had been drawn. Even Ava, usually fearless, avoided visiting their new suite in daylight.

“Feels like we’re ghosts,” Joel remarked one morning, spinning slowly in his desk chair while a loading bar crawled across his screen. “Like we died in this building and no one wants to admit they can still see us.”

“They see us,” Carter said, not looking up from his laptop. “They just don’t want to acknowledge that we didn’t need them.”

The three of them were operating in a strange purgatory: technically part of the agency but spiritually separate, like a limb the body refused to recognize. It wasn’t an illusion. They were receiving fewer internal memos, fewer shared assets, and more of their requests to HR and operations were being routed to a general inbox instead of the usual direct channels. A quiet freeze-out. The professional version of being ghosted.

Lydia didn’t seem fazed. If anything, she appeared more focused. She started keeping later hours, arriving earlier, working through weekends without complaint. She responded to emails faster, presented sharper decks, and pushed their brand philosophy harder than ever. She was driven, almost mechanical. But Carter noticed something else, too—moments when she paused mid-sentence in meetings, eyes fixed on some thought far away; when she’d forget her tea on the counter and let it go cold. Once, he saw her in the empty hallway, staring out the window with a look not of reflection, but of calculation.

“You haven’t slept,” Carter said one evening as she rubbed her temples under the dim kitchen light.

“Sleep’s overrated,” she replied.

He poured her the tea she had forgotten again and handed it over. “We’re not just running from Gordon anymore, are we?”

She took the cup, then met his gaze. “No.”

“What else?”

She hesitated, then sat down. Her voice dropped.

“You know how I ended up here? In this city, this company?”

Carter shook his head.

“I burned another one down,” she said. “Not literally, but… I pushed too far, too fast. Tried to build something and underestimated how much resistance there’d be. They spun it, called it an ‘internal restructuring.’ I got an offer to transfer here instead of being pushed out.”

Carter stared at her, surprised. “You’ve done this before?”

She nodded. “Not like this. I wasn’t ready back then. I didn’t know how to protect what I was building. I thought talent was enough. It’s not. Talent without strategy is a signal flare. You get noticed, then taken out.”

That moment settled between them like ash.

“But this time,” she said softly, “we do it right.”

Carter understood now why she pushed so hard, why she never flinched when Gordon pulled his stunts. She’d already seen the endgame once. And she wasn’t going to play the same part again.

The following week brought Studio Nine its biggest opportunity yet. A global wellness brand, Sorelli Group, reached out through a mutual contact. They wanted a full rebrand—tone, visuals, product alignment. It was high-profile and high-risk, the kind of project that could tip Studio Nine into legitimacy… or expose every fault line they’d been hiding.

They spent four days preparing the proposal. Lydia took lead strategy, Joel crafted a visual direction built around color gradients and ambient design, and Carter developed the narrative structure. The client was skeptical—Sorelli’s head of marketing was an old-school executive with a fondness for full-page print ads and the kind of boldface taglines that screamed trust through volume.

“We don’t want to look too subtle,” he said during the initial Zoom call, narrowing his eyes like minimalism was a personal insult. “We still need to reach people.”

“Then we speak to their attention, not just their eyes,” Lydia replied. “Subtle isn’t invisible. It’s intentional.”

The man didn’t smile, but he also didn’t hang up.

Carter handled follow-up. He could charm in ways Lydia didn’t try to, and that made them effective as a duo. He’d learned how to match her fire with warmth, how to soften the edges without dulling the blade. Together, they closed the deal.

The contract arrived on a Friday evening, signed and scanned. Lydia read it over twice before handing Carter the final page. His name was listed as the project lead. He blinked.

“You’re handing this to me?”

She nodded. “You’re ready.”

He wasn’t sure whether to feel proud or terrified. He decided to feel both.

The Sorelli work took over their lives for the next month. Long hours, layered feedback cycles, and last-minute pivots kept the team on edge. There were days Carter wanted to throw his laptop into t
