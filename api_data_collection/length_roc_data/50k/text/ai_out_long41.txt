Title: Wired for Bread

Chapter One: Sparks and Spatulas

Julian Trent had always been a man of habits. By day, he wore thick rubber gloves, toted around a voltmeter and a tool belt heavy with screwdrivers and pliers, fixing faulty wiring across the rust-tinged boroughs of Easton. He worked for Myler & Sons Electrical Services, a small, three-man operation with peeling van decals and an answering machine that still clicked and whirred when messages were left. Julian was thirty-eight, wiry, with calloused hands and a thin line of grime always shadowing his fingernails, no matter how hard he scrubbed. He was also the best electrician in the company by a mile—not that it was a hard race to win.

But at night, Julian became someone else.

He would return to his apartment on Pickering Street—third floor walk-up, squeaky banister, a doormat that simply read “Zap!”—kick off his steel-toed boots, and head straight for the kitchen. There, beneath the harsh light of a flickering overhead bulb, he would tie a worn apron around his waist. The apron was white once, now speckled with decades of flour and grease stains. In its center, faded pink embroidery spelled out “Flour Power.”

“Okay, my crusty little beasties,” he would mutter to his sourdough starters—three bubbling jars lined up along the counter like watchful, gelatinous sentinels. “Let’s make some magic.”

Julian baked. Not cookies, not cakes, not dainty tarts or trendy gluten-free nonsense. He baked bread. Real bread. The kind with crusts that cracked like thunder when sliced and crumbs so tender they made grown men weep. His specialty was a rosemary-olive boule that he swore could stop wars.

No one knew.

Not Glenn, his loudmouth boss who thought “yeast” was something you caught. Not his ex-wife Dana, who once threatened to throw his rye batards out the window if he didn’t “start being more present.” Not even Miss Lolly, the nosey widow who lived across the hall and had been trying to get into Julian’s apartment under various pretenses for years.

It was his secret world. A sacred place where the wires didn’t short and no one asked him to crawl into damp basements to fiddle with breaker boxes full of spider carcasses.

That Thursday started like any other. Rain tapped against the van’s windshield as Julian rolled down Milltown Avenue, humming something off-tempo, his breath fogging the glass. Glenn was already chewing in his ear through the walkie clipped to the dash.

“Julian, you get the call from the Holtz place? Power's out in the east wing—probably another damn squirrel chewin’ the lines again. Bring a long ladder.”

“Copy,” Julian muttered, taking a left down Hamber Lane.

The Holtz estate was a sprawling Tudor monstrosity on the edge of town, all gables and ivy and fountains shaped like lions spitting into koi ponds. He had been there once before, fixing an ancient fuse panel in the guesthouse. Mrs. Holtz had offered him tea and then asked, without irony, whether he could rewire a chandelier with Swarovski crystals without turning the lights “too yellow.”

This time, it was the kitchen.

“Right this way, Mr. Trent,” said Mrs. Holtz, leading him through the tiled halls in fuzzy mules that whispered against the floor. “The breaker trips whenever we use the convection oven. It's simply ghastly.”

Julian crouched, inspected the wiring, clicked his tongue.

“You’ve got a neutral arc right here,” he said, pointing with his flashlight. “Probably overloaded the circuit with too many high-draw appliances.”

“Oh, yes,” she said. “You see, we had a new baker start on Monday—young girl from New York, knows all about organic sourdough. She uses that oven like it’s a religion.”

Julian paused.

“A baker?”

“Yes. We’re converting one of the wings into a café. The Holtz Hearth, we’re calling it.”

Julian blinked. Something tugged in his chest—an odd flutter, like a switch had been flicked.

He finished the job in under an hour and was washing his hands in the butler’s sink when he heard a voice behind him.

“You the electrician?”

She stood with a tray of freshly scored loaves, her apron smudged with flour and arms dusted like she’d been caught in a blizzard. Her hair was cropped short, dyed the color of ripe peach skin, and there was a faint crescent of dough at her jawline.

“Yeah,” Julian said. “Just got the oven sorted. Shouldn’t trip the panel anymore.”

She sniffed. “Thank god. I’ve been half-baking my baguettes all week.”

He chuckled despite himself. “Tragedy.”

She held out a hand. “I’m Mira.”

“Julian.”

There was a pause. Mira tilted her head.

“You bake?” she asked.

The question caught him off guard. “Why do you ask?”

“You smell like fresh proofing. Not yeast—like… fermentation. And your shirt’s got flour at the hem. Rookie mistake.”

Julian flushed. “Maybe.”

She grinned. “You should come by sometime. We’re opening next month, but I’m here most nights. Testing recipes.”

He hesitated. Then nodded.

“Maybe I will.”

Chapter Two: Conductive Heat

Julian did go. The next Thursday. And the one after. At first, it was excuses—a ‘quick check on the wiring’ or ‘just making sure the breaker held.’ But Mira wasn’t fooled. She greeted him with smirks and dusted aprons, flinging puns like dough in a pizza shop.

“You’re electrically inclined, but thermally devoted,” she teased once, as they kneaded side by side. Julian couldn’t deny it.

It became ritual. They’d bake late into the evening, trading techniques, shaping loaves, arguing over hydration ratios and the ethics of machine-kneading.

“Hand work is soul work,” Julian insisted, palms sticky with dough.

“Says the guy who loves voltage testers,” Mira shot back.

But there was a rhythm between them. A heat—not just from the ovens.

At work, Glenn started to notice.

“You've been mighty chipper lately,” he said one morning, halfway through a rewiring job at the Roxy Theater. “Got a lady or somethin’?”

Julian shrugged. “Something like that.”

By December, Julian’s own apartment had transformed. Where once stood a battered toaster now gleamed a commercial-grade oven Mira helped him install. His fridge was crammed with starters, herbs, imported olives. A handwritten note taped to the cupboard read, “Less baking soda, more baking soul. — M.”

It was around this time that Dana, his ex-wife, showed up unannounced.

“Your sister said you’ve been… different,” she said, standing stiffly in his doorway. “I wanted to see for myself.”

Julian didn’t know what to say. Dana stepped into the kitchen, looked around, sniffed.

“Bread?” she asked, almost incredulous.

He nodded. “It helps me… balance things.”

She didn’t stay long. But as she left, she turned and said, “You always needed something to ground you. I just thought it’d be me.”

Julian stared at the dough in his hands. Didn’t answer.

That night, Mira brought over a basket of burnt walnut rye.

“Experiment gone wrong,” she said.

He bit in. It was still delicious.

Chapter Three: Live Wires

The trouble started in January.

The café’s soft opening drew attention. Food bloggers. Local reporters. Even a minor celebrity chef who declared their pain au levain “almost transcendent.” Julian remained in the background, quietly supplying loaves, slipping them through the kitchen door and vanishing before anyone could ask where the magic came from.

He didn’t want the spotlight. Mira, though, had different ideas.

“Why hide?” she asked one night, barefoot in his kitchen, sipping wine from a mug. “You’re brilliant.”

He shook his head. “I fix wires. I’m not a baker. Not really.”

“You’re more of a baker than half the folks on Instagram with matching stand mixers.”

Julian frowned. “It’s not about being seen. I just… this is mine. And if I lose it, I don’t want everyone watching.”

Mira looked at him a long time. Then quietly: “You're scared of success?”

“No,” he said. “I’m scared of needing it.”

But things were already moving beyond him. A food magazine ran a story—“The Secret Hands Behind Easton’s Best Bread”—and rumors swirled. Some said Mira had a mystery partner. Others whispered about a masked baker.

Glenn brought a copy of the article to work one day.

“Don’t suppose this ‘phantom of the flour’ is you?” he asked, holding it up with a crooked grin.

Julian didn’t answer.

The lines between his worlds were fraying. Electricity and baking, passion and profession. And one night, as thunder rolled over Easton and power flickered across the boroughs, Julian knew it was time to choose.

The following Friday, Julian stood before the door of the converted wing at the Holtz estate, uncertain whether to knock or just walk in. The glass panel beside the entrance was painted with swirling gold letters: Holtz Hearth — Artisan Breads & Pastries. The place wasn’t officially open yet, but the smell of fermenting dough and roasted grains seeped through the frame, warm and familiar, like the first time he’d fixed a toaster as a kid and felt the thrill of making something work again.

He rapped twice, awkwardly. Mira opened the door with a clatter of bracelets on her wrist and a dusting of powdered sugar clinging to her temple like a failed attempt at face paint. She beamed when she saw him, stepping aside with a graceful sweep of her arm.

“You showed,” she said, “and you didn’t bring a tool belt. I’m impressed.”

Julian stepped inside, rubbing his palms along the seams of his jeans. “Didn’t think I’d need to rewire anything today.”

“Well,” Mira said, nodding toward the stainless steel counter where three rounds of dough sat in proofing baskets like sleeping pets, “you’ll need to wire your hands to a scraper, because I’m short-staffed and behind on tomorrow’s test batch.”

Without waiting for an answer, she handed him a baker’s blade and a dusting wand. “You know your way around a banneton?”

Julian scoffed, rolling up his sleeves. “Please.”

He worked quietly at first, folding dough with practiced hands, letting the gluten strands pull and stretch like taut wires beneath his palms. Mira hummed along to the playlist echoing softly through a Bluetooth speaker tucked on a shelf—jazz, mostly, with the occasional rogue bluegrass tune.

“So,” she said eventually, glancing up from her scoring work, “how long have you been doing this?”

He didn’t look up. “Baking?”

“Yeah.”

“Fifteen years, give or take. Started with an old French cookbook I found in a thrift store. Got obsessed with the science. Fermentation, hydration, oven spring. It’s like fixing circuits. You tweak one variable, everything changes.”

“Didn’t figure electricians for romantic types.”

Julian finally met her gaze, a slow grin breaking through. “Romance is overrated. Precision, now that’s poetry.”

Mira laughed, rich and easy. “That should go on your gravestone.”

They worked until midnight, the kitchen growing thick with the scent of browning crust and wild yeast. Mira poured them both a cup of lukewarm coffee around eleven, setting Julian’s beside him with a gentle clink.

“I’m glad you came,” she said after a quiet moment.

Julian nodded. “Me too.”

The next few weeks unfolded like a slow dance. Julian started showing up more often, always under some thin excuse—adjusting the wiring for the proofing fridge, tightening the gas line to the deck oven. But every visit ended the same: hands floured, shirts streaked, and hearts a little lighter. They baked in a kind of rhythmic harmony that neither of them questioned. Mira’s methods were intuitive, emotional, a little chaotic—she measured with her eyes and her instincts. Julian, on the other hand, kept spreadsheets of every bake, detailing oven temp, ambient humidity, and whether the crust had “adequate shatter.”

They disagreed constantly.

“You’re underhydrating your dough,” Julian said one night, pressing a finger into the sticky mass she’d just shaped. “You’ll get a tight crumb.”

“And you’re too stingy with your scoring,” Mira replied, cutting an elaborate swirl into her round. “Your loaves are scared to open up.”

Despite the sparring, there was affection in every barb, an unspoken recognition of something shared. They didn’t speak of what it was. It was enough to be elbows-deep in flour at 1 a.m., covered in salt and steam and music, the air between them crackling not unlike the old fuse box Julian had rewired just a month earlier.

It wasn’t long before Mira asked the question Julian had been avoiding.

“Why don’t you bake full-time?”

They were standing over a tray of fougasse, brushing the bread with garlic oil. Julian froze mid-swipe, then set the brush down with deliberate care.

“I did. Once.”

Mira tilted her head, surprise flickering across her brow. “You never said.”

He wiped his hands on a dishcloth and leaned against the counter, jaw tightening. “I had a bakery. Back when Dana and I were still married. Small place near the ferry terminal. ‘Breadboard.’ Stupid name.”

Mira didn’t interrupt.

“It failed. Not all at once. The location sucked, we had overhead I couldn’t cover, and I got stubborn. Tried to do everything myself. We closed after eighteen months. Dana left a few weeks after that. Said I couldn’t see past the dough long enough to live in the real world.”

The silence between them hung thick for a moment.

“So,” Julian continued, “I went back to what I knew. Circuits don’t disappoint you. You do the math right, they obey.”

Mira nodded, her voice quiet. “But bread still calls you back.”

He shrugged. “Guess I like pain.”

She smiled, not unkindly. “Or maybe you’re braver than you think.”

Julian didn’t reply. Instead, he picked up the oil brush and resumed where he’d left off, making sure the garlic reached every edge.

Outside, the wind pushed against the windowpanes like an old friend trying to get in.

That night, Mira kissed him.

It happened suddenly—between two racks of baguettes, hands still warm from shaping, the smell of rosemary and steel mingling in the air. There was no warning, no preamble, just the brush of lips like a light flicked on in a dark room. Julian stood there, stunned, then kissed her back, gentle but certain.

Neither of them said anything when they pulled apart. Mira just tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and went back to rotating a tray. Julian returned to his scoring, the blade in his hand trembling slightly.

The following morning, he walked into work early, Glenn still halfway through his morning sausage roll, and announced that he needed Fridays off moving forward.

“What for?” Glenn asked, mouth full.

Julian thought for a second. “Personal wiring.”

Glenn grunted. “Fine. Just don’t expect sick days.”

Julian didn’t answer. He already had his eyes on the van keys.

Chapter Two: Proof and Resistance

Julian’s Friday routine changed almost imperceptibly. Where once he’d sleep until the sun crested the ironworks across the street, he now rose early, well before dawn, slipping into the gray hush of morning with a thermos of weak coffee and the faintest buzz in his chest. He’d take the long route to the Holtz estate on foot, boots clacking against rain-slick sidewalks, the town still groggy with sleep. Mira was always there before him, apron tied, music already playing softly in the background. She wasn’t a morning person, but baking demanded submission to time’s strange rituals, and she obeyed them with begrudging respect.

The café had taken shape quickly. The converted wing had been gutted and rebuilt with polished oak counters and hand-tiled backsplashes in a mosaic of warm, sun-baked colors. Large windows faced the lawn, catching the early light and turning the interior gold by seven. At first glance, it looked like any number of quaint, ambitious bakeries—but there was something else in the air. Something alive.

Julian had never believed in magical realism, but something about the café felt like a story waiting to tip from fiction into fact.

He settled into the rhythm without question. Mira handled the creative side—menus, aesthetics, the social media campaign she hated but dutifully maintained. Julian focused on the numbers: batch scaling, equipment maintenance, and the network of secret late-night bread drops he performed under cover of darkness. Local grocers, co-ops, and even a small hospital cafeteria took the loaves without question, always in unmarked paper bags, the labels plain and unsigned.

“We’re like bread vigilantes,” Mira said one night, cheeks flushed from the walk back from their last delivery. “Masked crusaders of crust.”

Julian shook his head. “You’re not wearing a mask. You waved at people.”

“Vibes are enough. The mystery's in the grain.”

They made an odd pair. She with her instinctive, sensual approach to baking—adjusting recipes mid-knead, sprinkling lavender on sourdough “just to see if it feels floral”—and he, with his spreadsheets, carefully plotted dough temperatures, and digital oven probes. But like two mismatched resistors in the same circuit, they balanced each other out. Where she pushed, he steadied. Where he hesitated, she threw the switch.

It was Mira who first suggested naming their side project.

“I keep getting messages on the café Instagram asking where the loaves in the co-op come from,” she said, balancing on a stool and sipping a chamomile-honey blend she insisted helped her “dream properly.”

Julian wiped his hands on a cloth. “Ignore them.”

“I can’t ignore thirty-seven DMs and a tag from a vegan influencer with 200k followers. People want to know.”

He sighed, glancing over the batch logs pinned to the fridge. “Then lie. Tell them it’s a ghost.”

Mira paused. “That’s… actually kind of perfect.”

The next day, she posted a blurry photo of a loaf cooling on a fire escape. The caption simply read: “Who is The Breadghost? Only the crust knows.”

The hashtag caught on. Within a week, they had three dozen orders for the mystery loaves. By the next Friday, Julian’s modest, silent deliveries had become legend. People posted blurry images of him stepping into alleyways or slipping into shops before dawn. No face, no name—just the silhouette of a man in an old hoodie carrying something sacred in a brown paper bag. It was absurd, Julian thought. But not unpleasant.

Still, he kept his day job. Glenn didn’t care what Julian did off-hours, as long as he didn’t electrocute himself or call out sick. Jobs came in, Julian completed them with military precision, then returned to the world of flour and fire without missing a beat. It was double-life living at its purest. Until one day, the wires crossed.

It started with a call from Mrs. Dupree, a fussy widow who’d hired Myler & Sons to rewire the fixtures in her over-decorated Victorian. Julian had done the preliminary inspection, left her with a quote, and scheduled the job for the following week. It should’ve been simple. But when he arrived that Wednesday, toolbelt ready, he found Mrs. Dupree and her neighbor huddled around a phone in the parlor, watching something on social media.

“That’s him,” the neighbor said. “Look, right there, leaving the bag at the corner co-op.”

Mrs. Dupree squinted. “Are you sure? He looks… younger.”

“I’ve seen him before. Same walk. Same boots.”

Julian stood silently in the doorway for a moment too long, then cleared his throat.

Mrs. Dupree looked up, startled. “Oh! Mr. Trent, we were just admiring that mysterious bread man who’s been all over the Internet. The Breadghost! Ever heard of him?”

Julian forced a tight smile. “Only rumors.”

The job went fine, but he left in a sweat, the collar of his shirt damp and his mind spinning. Word was spreading faster than he’d expected. The anonymity, once a safeguard, had become a liability.

He brought it up with Mira that night, after scraping the last scorched bits from a rye pan that had gone two minutes too long.

“I think this is getting out of hand,” he said.

She looked up from her bench. “What do you mean?”

“They’re recognizing me. At work. In public. If Glenn finds out, he’ll start asking questions. He’ll sniff around the co-op deals, maybe even tip off the health department.”

Mira frowned. “So? Let him. It’s not illegal.”

“It’s messy,” Julian said. “I like my life quiet.”

“You like your life safe,” she replied, her voice soft. “But that’s not the same thing.”

He didn’t respond. Instead, he opened the oven, pulled out a tray of golden country loaves, and let the scent fill the room. The silence was louder than the jazz.

That weekend, Mira posted a poll: Should the Breadghost reveal their identity?

The comments exploded. Some begged for the truth. Others pleaded for mystery. One person wrote: “If you unmask, the magic dies.”

Julian didn’t say a word. But Sunday night, as he walked to the café for his usual prep shift, he noticed someone had spray-painted a stylized ghost holding a baguette on the alley wall near the back entrance. Mira stood beside it, sipping from her coffee mug, smiling like a kid caught drawing on the furniture.

“Local artist,” she said. “He’s calling it 'breadwave noir.'”

Julian stared at it for a moment. “We’re a joke now.”

“We’re a myth,” she corrected. “There’s a difference.”

Despite himself, Julian chuckled.

But in the days that followed, something in the air shifted. People began lingering near the café’s loading area. One woman showed up with a DSLR and pretended to photograph the architecture until Mira shooed her away. The online orders doubled again. Julian’s spreadsheet couldn’t keep up.

And then came the letter.

It arrived in a plain envelope, no return address. The handwriting on the front was meticulous. Inside was a single printed sheet with the city health board’s letterhead, a formal request for inspection under suspicion of unlicensed food sales.

Julian stared at the paper, blood draining from his face. Mira read over his shoulder, her brows knitting.

“They’re onto us,” she whispered.

Julian folded the paper slowly and leaned back in his chair.

“I think… I think we need to shut it down. At least for now.”

Mira didn’t argue. Not at first. But later that night, when the ovens were cold and the racks stood empty, she asked, “Would you give it all up? Just like that?”

Julian’s answer came slowly. “I already have. Once.”

She stepped closer. “And did it fix you?”

He met her eyes, tired but steady. “It kept me from breaking worse.”

Mira shook her head. “You can’t spend your life afraid of loving something too much. That’s not protection. That’s a slow kind of dying.”

For the first time, Julian didn’t know what to say.

He spent that night in his apartment alone, staring at the three bubbling jars on the counter. They looked back, as if daring him to try again.

The inspection came quicker than expected.

It was a Thursday morning when the city official arrived—clipboard in hand, tight gray slacks, and a demeanor as sterile as a hospital floor. Julian spotted him through the window as he was dusting off the counter near the front. He didn’t panic. Panic was for circuits and sudden power surges. This was different. This was a slow leak, a hum in the wires no one wanted to admit they heard until it blew the wall apart.

Mira met the inspector at the door, her smile bright but stiff.

“We weren’t expecting you until next week,” she said, brushing flour from her apron.

“I’m conducting a preliminary observation,” he said, glancing around the café without stepping fully inside. “This will be informal, for now.”

Julian moved quickly, removing the proofing bins from the counter, hiding the hand-labeled “Breadghost Drop” list that Mira kept in her planner, and making sure none of the unlicensed equipment was in plain sight. The bread oven was certified. The mixers were fine. But it was the deliveries—those unregulated sales outside café hours—that could sink them if someone chose to dig.

The inspector spent thirty minutes poking around. He didn’t ask many questions, just made notes, adjusted his glasses, and peered into every corner like he was memorizing the place. When he left, he handed Mira a sheet of paper and warned, “We’ll be following up soon. I advise reviewing your supply chain documentation.”

After the door closed, Mira dropped the smile. Her shoulders sagged like deflated brioche.

“They’re going to shut us down, aren’t they?”

Julian took the paper, read through it, and shook his head. “Not yet. But they’re circling.”

She walked back behind the counter, picking up a bowl of starter and stirring it mindlessly.

“We shouldn’t have gone public,” she said. “The graffiti, the jokes, the damn ghost. It drew them in like moths.”

“No,” Julian said quietly. “That’s what made it real.”

She glanced at him.

“We’ll clean it up,” he continued. “Scale it back. Make everything look above board. No more drops. No more ghost. We go legitimate.”

“And if we can’t?”

Julian hesitated. “Then we start over. Somewhere else. Smaller.”

Mira didn’t answer right away. She turned the bowl in her hands, then finally set it down with a quiet sigh. “I’m not built for small,” she said. “I don’t bake quiet.”

But that night, she did. No music, no jokes, just the two of them in silence, shaping loaves while the clock ticked loudly above the fridge.

Julian thought of the first time he’d tried to make bread—years ago, in a cramped kitchen in Fairview, standing over a torn page from The Joy of Cooking. The dough had been a disaster. Too wet. Under-kneaded. But he remembered the moment when it rose anyway, soft and defiant, as if the yeast itself had forgiven him. He remembered thinking: if something could rise after that, maybe he could too.

Now, as Mira brushed egg wash over a tray of pan loaves and blinked away exhaustion, Julian felt that same quiet defiance settle in his chest.

He wouldn’t let them fall.

The plan unfolded like a rewiring job—messy at first, then surprisingly simple once the flow was mapped. They filed for a commercial license under Mira’s name, with Julian listed only as a maintenance contractor. Mira began keeping strict records, labeling every ingredient, tracking batch weights, and logging temperatures. They drew up fake resumes, retroactively gave Julian a background in kitchen engineering, and cleaned up the kitchen like it was being staged for a magazine shoot.

And they stopped the drops.

Julian hated it more than he admitted. Every Friday now felt hollow. He’d walk the old route past the co-op, past the graffiti, past the hidden door behind the market where he once left loaves with little hearts carved into the crusts. The bags were gone. The notes were gone. Just empty concrete and a few scattered sunflower husks from the birds.

Online, the Breadghost account went dark.

People noticed.

A post from a local food blogger read: “Looks like the Breadghost has vanished. Hope the bread didn’t die with him.”

The comments were sympathetic, nostalgic. Some angry. A few turned bitter.

“Figures. Build something real and then sell out.”

Julian tried not to care, but he caught himself rereading the thread more than once, his jaw clenched. He didn’t want fame. He just wanted the silence to mean something.

In early spring, Mira’s mother came to visit. She arrived unannounced one afternoon, dragging a wheeled suitcase and carrying a bag of organic granola like it was a gift of state.

“Mom,” Mira said at the door, clearly unprepared. “I thought you were in Chile.”

“Delayed the trip,” the woman replied, sweeping into the café. “Wanted to see this… passion project.”

She introduced herself to Julian with a perfunctory nod and a scrutinizing look that made him feel like a misbehaving teenager. Her name was Ruth Klein, a retired architect with silver hair and a voice that sounded like it had been trained to cut through drywall.

“You’re the handyman?” she asked Julian over coffee.

He wiped his hands on his apron. “Electrician. Mostly.”

“Yet you bake.”

“I do.”

She tilted her head. “You don’t look like a baker.”

Julian smiled thinly. “What does a baker look like?”

“Less tired.”

He didn’t answer.

Later, after Ruth had poked around the kitchen, sampled half the display counter, and questioned the layout of the walk-in fridge, she pulled Mira aside.

“I assume he’s temporary.”

Mira blinked. “Excuse me?”

“You’re going to outgrow him. This is a fine little experiment, but you’re thinking too small. A place like this? It should be expanding already. Syndicating. Building a brand. Not hiding behind ghost stories.”

“He’s not temporary,” Mira said quietly.

Her mother raised an eyebrow. “Then I hope he catches up.”

Mira didn’t tell Julian about the conversation. But that night, when she baked with more ferocity than usual and broke a bowl while slamming it into the sink, he knew something had changed.

A week later, they received final clearance from the city.

The Holtz Hearth was now, officially, legitimate.

They celebrated with champagne and too many croissants, the tension lifting just enough for Julian to breathe. For a few weeks, things felt balanced again. The café hummed. Customers returned. Mira laughed like before.

But Julian couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted. Not outside—in the business, the oven, the wiring—but inside Mira. Her eyes stayed on the horizon longer. Her phone buzzed more. She started saying things like “scaling potential” and “brand aesthetic.” She met with a graphic designer. There was talk of merchandising.

“You okay?” he asked one night as they cleaned the counters.

She paused. “Yeah. Just… thinking.”

“About?”

“About where we’re going.”

He nodded. “Together?”

Her silence was answer enough.

That night, he baked alone. A single loaf. Olive and thyme. Deep cuts, wide score, open crumb. He left it on Mira’s counter with a note that said, Remember when it was just bread?

He didn’t sleep.

It wasn’t a breakup, not officially. They still saw each other, still baked. But something in the rhythm faltered. Conversations thinned. Touches cooled. And one Thursday, Julian didn’t show up. No call. No message.

He was three miles across town, climbing a ladder to inspect a faulty bathroom heater in a senior home, when Mira finally texted:

I miss the ghost.

He stared at the message for a full minute. Then replied:

I miss the silence.

Then he put his phone away and went back to work.

Chapter Three: Burnt Ends

Spring crept into Easton slowly, as if unsure of its welcome. The trees budded in halting clusters, the sidewalks remained damp for weeks, and every patch of sun was chased away by low, lumbering clouds before it could warm the brick façades. For Julian, the change in season came with a creeping stillness—not in the streets, but inside him, like the slow drying of a once-lively starter neglected on the counter too long.

He went to work. He fixed what needed fixing. Junction boxes, lighting arrays, occasional rewires in damp basements where the mold grew faster than drywall could be installed. His calls with Glenn were brief. His evenings, quieter than ever. The three sourdough starters in his kitchen bubbled faintly, forgotten most days, barely fed. The old excitement—flour on his hands, the dense satisfaction of a perfect crust crack—felt far away, like something he’d once dreamed but never lived.

He hadn’t seen Mira in nearly three weeks.

Not in person, at least. She appeared sometimes on his feed, tagged in pictures from the café’s launch party. A photo of her holding a rosemary focaccia topped with edible flowers. Another of her posing beside a mural of their Breadghost graffiti, now lacquered and framed inside the Holtz Hearth’s main hallway. No mention of Julian. No one remembered who painted it in the first place.

He told himself it didn’t bother him.

Instead, he poured himself into electrical work, taking on longer shifts, volunteering for the messier jobs Glenn usually pawned off on their apprentice. He rewired the entire fire escape system for Easton High, then spent four days fixing a dangerously overloaded panel in a dentist’s office that hadn’t been inspected since the Reagan era. It was honest work, solitary, grounding. Safe.

One Thursday evening, after a twelve-hour shift, Julian stopped by the co-op out of habit. He didn’t need anything—he hadn’t baked in a week—but he wandered the aisles anyway, trailing his fingers across jars of local honey and steel-cut oats. The bread rack at the back had changed. Gone were the anonymous paper bags. Now there was a branded display: Holtz Hearth’s Daily Artisan Selections. Labels typed in soft brown serif fonts. Packaging with subtle gold accents. Each loaf individually wrapped in wax paper tied with twine.

He reached out, lifted one of the sourdough boules—his recipe, unmistakably his—and examined it like it was a stranger’s child. The crust was too pale. The scoring too neat. A good loaf, but not alive.

“You’re Julian, right?”

The voice startled him. He turned to see a young woman—maybe early twenties—holding a reusable grocery bag stuffed with radishes and plant-based sausage.

“I’ve seen you before,” she said. “A few months ago. You’re the Breadghost.”

Julian’s stomach dropped.

He smiled faintly, trying to deflect. “That’s a myth.”

She held his gaze. “I’m a culinary student. I know your crust. I know your lamination. That ghost stuff… it was the only real bread in town.”

Julian didn’t know how to respond. He gave her a polite nod and walked out without buying anything.

That night, he stood in his kitchen for a long time. The starter jars had dried out on the rims. One had started to collapse, starved of sugar and air. He cleaned them out mechanically, scraping the old crust from the glass, rinsing the residue like a medic washing up after surgery. He began fresh ones, feeding them flour and water like offerings to some dormant god.

For the first time in weeks, the oven preheated.

Across town, Mira was struggling. Not with customers—business was booming. The Holtz Hearth had been featured in a regional lifestyle magazine, their walnut rye declared “a daring take on comfort.” Their catering arm had expanded. Investors were circling, slowly but surely, the way cats do around birds too full from crumbs.

But something in her had gone brittle.

She stayed late every night, sometimes past two, baking test batches that no one would eat. Her new assistant, Thomas, a cheerful recent grad from the state’s culinary school, took on more of the customer-facing responsibilities. He made Instagram reels. He wore a branded apron. He said all the right things. But he didn’t understand the bread. Not like Julian had. Not like she had.

One night, frustrated by a batch of over-proofed spelt boules, she texted Julian:

Do you ever feel like you’re still baking, even when you’re not? Like the dough is still inside you, rising too fast?

She stared at the message, thumb hovering. Then she deleted it.

Instead, she sent a photo of the old ghost graffiti—the one preserved inside the café now.

Underneath, she wrote: I think I laminated my soul and now it’s cracking.

Julian didn’t reply.

But the next morning, she found a paper bag outside her apartment door. Inside: a single country loaf, baked dark, scored with a spiral, and still faintly warm.

No note.

They began again, not all at once, but in small steps.

Julian would leave a loaf. Mira would answer with a muffin. Then a recipe scribbled on paper towel. Then a jar of jam, left on his windowsill.

They didn’t talk. Not properly. But there was communication, dense and layered like the inside of a good croissant.

When they finally saw each other again, it was on neutral ground—a late-night grain market on the west side of town, where farmers sold raw spelt and unfiltered oils from the back of trucks under string lights. Mira was standing beside a stall selling heirloom rye, arguing with the vendor about protein content. Julian approached quietly, holding a small sack of einkorn flour like a peace offering.

She saw him. Didn’t smile. Just nodded.

They stood there for a long while, not speaking, listening to the buzz of conversation and the squeak of crates on concrete.

Then Mira said, “It’s not the same.”

Julian looked out across the market. “No.”

“I made a deal with the Holtz family. They want to franchise. A second location in the city. They’re calling it a brand. A movement.”

He didn’t speak.

She turned to him, eyes bright and brittle. “And I let them. I let them because I thought that’s what success looked like. But I lost the thing that made me want to do it in the first place.”

Julian let out a slow breath. “We chased something we didn’t understand.”

“No,” Mira said. “I chased it. You just followed me because you wanted to see me happy.”

He glanced down at the einkorn bag in his hands. “You make me want to follow things.”

They left the market together, walking quietly, not holding hands but close enough to feel each other’s warmth.

Later that week, Mira made a decision.

She called the Holtz family, told them she would oversee the café through the end of the season but would not be involved in the franchise. She didn’t tell them why. She didn’t have to. They didn’t fight her. They had her name and her recipes, and that was enough for them.

She spent the next two nights baking through every formula she’d ever written, from the first awkward test batch in a community college dorm to the wild-yeast babka she’d once made for a Thanksgiving she forgot to RSVP to.

Then she walked into Julian’s apartment at ten past midnight, carrying a notebook filled with flour-streaked pages and a small loaf of experimental beer bread that still steamed at the center.

“I want to start again,” she said, setting the loaf down.

Julian stared at her. “Here?”

She smiled. “With you. But not here. Not Easton. Not the Hearth. Somewhere quiet. Someplace no one knows our names. We open a bakery the size of a living room. Just you, me, and maybe a busted old oven.”

Julian didn’t answer right away. He took the loaf in his hands, broke it apart, and took a bite. The crust shattered like lightning. The crumb was dense but warm, with a faint hum of ale and sage.

“It needs more salt,” he said, mouth full.

She laughed, tears in her eyes. “So help me fix it.”

“I will,” he said. “I will.”

And for the first time in months, the air in the room felt alive again—like something rising.

They started by mapping the town they hadn’t found yet.

Julian took to drawing diagrams on napkins and cardboard scraps: potential floor plans, fictional kitchens, the circuitry needed for various oven models. Mira did the dreaming. She circled ads for properties in towns they’d never visited, tagged grain mills she’d only heard about, bookmarked pictures of tiny cafés with crooked signage and single-window storefronts. None of it was real yet, but it began to take shape between them like dough slowly rising beneath a linen cloth—something unseen but swelling with purpose.

They didn’t tell anyone. Glenn assumed Julian was finally burning out—he didn’t argue when Julian dropped his hours down to part-time. Thomas at the Holtz Hearth took over completely by the end of May, assuming more responsibilities with the energy of someone desperate to impress investors. Mira trained him reluctantly, then disappeared one day without saying goodbye. The bread kept coming, but it tasted flatter. Cleaner. Like it had been made in a factory with no windows.

One afternoon, as Julian patched a faulty outdoor junction box behind the public library, his phone buzzed. A message from Mira. No words—just an address pinned on a map, a small town called Bellmare, about three hours south. Population under eight thousand. Known for its apple orchards, its weather-worn boardwalk, and not much else. Attached to the pin was a real estate listing. It showed a squat, brick building with boarded-up windows and a faded sign that once read “Lawrence’s Shoe Repair.”

He stared at it for a long while, the sun dipping behind him.

That weekend, they drove out.

Bellmare was smaller than it looked online. Two main streets intersected beside a town square with a cracked fountain and a community bulletin board covered in aging flyers. Teenagers rode bikes past shuttered shops. A man sat in front of a hardware store, carving a piece of wood with a pocket knife. No one looked twice at them. It felt like a place time had softened around the edges, where people still used landlines and the air smelled of loam and pollen.

The building was even more dilapidated in person. The bricks were chipped, the door rusted, the inside filled with forgotten machinery and the faint, acrid smell of rubber glue. But Julian saw more than damage—he saw the wiring potential, the exposed studs ready for cabling, the empty socket where a proofing cabinet could hum. Mira walked through it with her arms crossed, then paused at the window facing the alley.

“There’s good light here in the morning,” she said. “We could use that.”

They didn’t speak on the way home, but the silence wasn’t heavy. It was full.

Three days later, Julian wired the deposit.

The renovation was brutal.

Julian did the electrics himself, of course—stripping old conduit, replacing breaker boxes, threading new wires through holes he carved by hand. Mira tore up the floor, sanded the counters, and argued with local contractors over tile prices and sink permits. They slept in a motel with carpet that smelled of mildew and coffee that tasted like recycled pennies. Every morning, they woke up sore, filthy, half-laughing.

“This is not glamorous,” Mira said one day, balancing on a paint-splattered stool and trying to pry open a skylight with a putty knife.

Julian passed her a crowbar. “It’s honest.”

They kept the name simple. Trent & Klein. No ghost, no gimmicks. Just their names, carved into a wooden board they salvaged from the basement and hand-painted under a single pendant light by the door. They made one promise: no marketing. No Instagram, no write-ups, no food bloggers. Just bread. If people came, they came. If not, they would eat what they made and start again the next day.

It took four months to open.

On the first morning, Mira opened the front door at 6:15 a.m., letting in the cool, sweet air that smelled of dew and distant apples. There was no line. No crowd. Just a quiet street and one elderly man who walked in out of curiosity, bought a slice of spelt toast, and left a five-dollar bill in the tip jar.

By the end of the week, word had spread. A teacher stopped by for a multigrain bun. A mother with two toddlers came in for honey rolls. A man on a bicycle bought six loaves and said he’d drive them up to his sister in Camden.

Julian and Mira didn’t say much, but every night, they closed up tired and full.

They started small. A single rack of rotating loaves. One soup. A few spreads. They served coffee in mismatched mugs Mira found at a thrift store. Julian played jazz from an old speaker mounted above the register. They ran out of bread most days before noon. They refused to increase production.

“We make twenty-four loaves a day,” Mira said. “If you miss it, you try again tomorrow.”

People didn’t seem to mind. In fact, they came more often. The scarcity made it sacred.

And at night, after the chairs were stacked and the counters scrubbed, Julian and Mira baked for themselves. No customers. No pressure. Just the two of them, hands floured, dough rising quietly under damp linen. He’d watch her as she moved through the kitchen barefoot, hair tied back with a bandana, the same smudge of flour always appearing on her left cheek like a ritual.

Sometimes she sang. He never interrupted.

That winter, they received a letter. No return address. Inside was a magazine clipping from Easton Living. A feature titled The Fall of the Breadghost. It was critical—accusing Holtz Hearth of cashing in on a legend they had no right to claim. The piece was full of nostalgia and bitter longing, quoting anonymous sources who said the magic was gone.

Julian read it once, then dropped it into the trash.

He turned to Mira. “Do you miss it?”

She was folding parchment over a batard, brushing stray seeds from the counter. She looked up.

“No,” she said. “We brought it with us.”

He nodded. “Good.”

That night, they experimented with sprouted buckwheat and rosewater. The loaf collapsed, dense and soggy in the middle.

They laughed until their stomachs hurt, sitting on the floor and eating the crust anyway.

Chapter Four: The Flour Line

Bellmare got colder faster than they expected. By early November, frost was permanent on the café’s side window until noon, and the alley light above the delivery door flickered like an indecisive ghost. Inside, though, Trent & Klein remained a small, burning hearth of warmth. The smell of sourdough and cinnamon filled the shop each morning as customers shuffled in wearing scarves and boots, red-cheeked and eager. Word of the bakery’s existence had spread—not far, not viral, but enough to bring a small steady stream of people from nearby towns. Farmers. Teachers. Ex-urbanites who now called this strange, aging place home.

They weren’t influencers or tourists. These were people who didn’t ask for wifi passwords and who paid in cash more often than not. They brought in jam jars to trade for fresh loaves, or tucked handwritten notes into tip jars, praising the rye’s tang or Mira’s pear galette. One woman knitted Mira a pair of mittens after trying the einkorn boules. A retired electrical engineer named Walter left Julian a dog-eared copy of The Joy of Cooking, claiming it had belonged to his late wife.

Julian and Mira didn’t talk about growth anymore. Not the way they once did. When Mira sketched a second bread rack in the margins of her notebook one slow afternoon, Julian didn’t say a word. She didn’t redraw it.

Instead, they focused on the day-to-day. There were new routines now: pre-dawn starter checks, mid-morning kneading sessions with jazz drifting in the background, Mira mumbling to herself about hydration levels, Julian measuring temperatures like he was calibrating a nuclear reactor. Some days they argued—over salt ratios, over oven timing, over whether or not dried cherries belonged in anything. But the arguments stayed contained, like steam in a sealed pan, vented with laughter before they grew into anything sharp.

And yet, even in this new, quieter life, something in Julian remained unsettled. Not unhappy, not dissatisfied—just aware. A current beneath the floorboards. A flicker in a bulb before it goes.

It started with his dreams.

He’d wake up early, long before his alarm, sweat-damp and anxious, his mind filled with images of overproofed dough spilling from containers, of frayed copper wires catching fire behind plaster. He told himself it was fatigue. That he wasn’t sleeping deeply enough, that the stress of maintaining an ancient building in subzero weather was catching up to him. But even during the day, he noticed small things—a hesitation in his movements, a fuzziness in his thoughts. One morning he forgot to adjust the oven before loading the morning batch. Half the loaves came out with pale, sad crusts.

“I’m slipping,” he muttered, staring at them.

Mira didn’t chastise him. She just touched his back and said, “We burn some. That’s how you know we’re alive.”

He smiled, but it didn’t settle the feeling.

The next week, he passed out behind the counter.

It was sudden, no warning—one moment he was refilling the flour bin, the next he was on the floor, blinking at the ceiling lights while Mira crouched beside him, face pale.

“You didn’t eat,” she said, brushing the sweat from his forehead.

“I had coffee,” he mumbled.

“That’s not food, Jules.”

She called the town clinic. They did bloodwork, checked his vitals, gave him fluids. A young nurse with freckles and nervous hands told him it was probably exhaustion, low blood sugar. Mira made him promise to rest, took over the baking for three days straight. He tried to argue, but she gave him a look that was all flint and fury, and he obeyed.

On the third day, Mira brought him a fresh slice of pumpernickel topped with apple butter and a fried egg.

“You’re not allowed to die,” she said, setting the plate down like a verdict.

“I wasn’t planning to.”

“Good. Because I’m not running this place alone. I’ve tasted what happens when I forget to autolyse.”

He chuckled weakly. “A tragedy.”

Her eyes softened. “Yeah. Kind of like baking without you.”

Winter deepened. Snow fell heavily, sometimes for days, blanketing Bellmare until the streets vanished beneath thick white silence. Business slowed, but the regulars came anyway, sometimes pushing through knee-deep drifts for a croissant or a seeded ficelle. Mira started keeping a thermos of tea on the counter for anyone who needed to warm up. Julian carved a saltbox holder for the entrance and lined the doorway with thrifted boots, in case someone needed to borrow a pair.

One night, Mira came down with a fever. It hit hard and sudden, and by morning she was bundled in blankets on the café’s back couch, shivering with chills.

Julian tried to close the shop. She refused.

“They’ll come,” she rasped. “You have to give them the bread.”

“I have to take care of you.”

“You can do both.”

He didn’t believe it, but he tried anyway. He shaped loaves alone, sweating over dough that refused to behave. The rye over-proofed. The levain didn’t rise fast enough. The entire first batch came out wonky. Still, he stacked it on the display with a handwritten note that said Made With Panic and Love.

Customers didn’t complain. In fact, they left bigger tips that day.

He spent the rest of the afternoon checking Mira’s temperature and coaxing her to sip bone broth he didn’t remember how to make but somehow still got right. She slept beside the mixer, wrapped in an old quilt. Julian sat nearby, working through a spreadsheet of ingredient orders, his eyes drifting to her every few minutes.

He realized something as he watched her breathe slowly, face half-shadowed by a flic
