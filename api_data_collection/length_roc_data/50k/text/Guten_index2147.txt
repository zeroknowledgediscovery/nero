And, to signify that       peculiar musical quality of Poe’s genius which inthralls every       reader, Mr. Lowell suggested this additional verse, from the       “Haunted Palace”:     And all with pearl and ruby glowing     Was the fair palace door,    Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,     And sparkling ever more,    A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty     Was but to sing,    In voices of surpassing beauty,     The wit and wisdom of their king.        Born in poverty at Boston, January 19, 1809, dying under painful       circumstances at Baltimore, October 7, 1849, his whole literary       career of scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere       subsistence, his memory malignantly misrepresented by his       earliest biographer, Griswold, how completely has truth at last       routed falsehood and how magnificently has Poe come into his own.       For “The Raven,” first published in 1845, and, within a few       months, read, recited and parodied wherever the English language       was spoken, the half-starved poet received $10! Less than a year       later his brother poet, N. P. Willis, issued this touching appeal       to the admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author, his       dying wife and her devoted mother, then living under very       straitened circumstances in a little cottage at Fordham, N. Y.:        “Here is one of the finest scholars, one of the most original men       of genius, and one of the most industrious of the literary       profession of our country, whose temporary suspension of labor,       from bodily illness, drops him immediately to a level with the       common objects of public charity. There is no intermediate       stopping-place, no respectful shelter, where, with the delicacy       due to genius and culture, he might secure aid, till, with       returning health, he would resume his labors, and his unmortified       sense of independence.”        And this was the tribute paid by the American public to the       master who had given to it such tales of conjuring charm, of       witchery and mystery as “The Fall of the House of Usher” and       “Ligeia”; such fascinating hoaxes as “The Unparalleled Adventure       of Hans Pfaall,” “MSS. Found in a Bottle,” “A Descent Into a       Maelstrom” and “The Balloon-Hoax”; such tales of conscience as       “William Wilson,” “The Black Cat” and “The Tell-tale Heart,”       wherein the retributions of remorse are portrayed with an awful       fidelity; such tales of natural beauty as “The Island of the Fay”       and “The Domain of Arnheim”; such marvellous studies in       ratiocination as the “Gold-bug,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,”       “The Purloined Letter” and “The Mystery of Marie Roget,” the       latter, a recital of fact, demonstrating the author’s wonderful       capability of correctly analyzing the mysteries of the human       mind; such tales of illusion and banter as “The Premature Burial”       and “The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether”; such bits of       extravaganza as “The Devil in the Belfry” and “The Angel of the       Odd”; such tales of adventure as “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon       Pym”; such papers of keen criticism and review as won for Poe the       enthusiastic admiration of Charles Dickens, although they made       him many enemies among the over-puffed minor American writers so       mercilessly exposed by him; such poems of beauty and melody as       “The Bells,” “The Haunted Palace,” “Tamerlane,” “The City in the       Sea” and “The Raven.” What delight for the jaded senses of the       reader is this enchanted domain of wonder-pieces! What an       atmosphere of beauty, music, color! What resources of       imagination, construction, analysis and absolute art! One might       almost sympathize with Sarah Helen Whitman, who, confessing to a       half faith in the old superstition of the significance of       anagrams, found, in the transposed letters of Edgar Poe’s name,       the words “a God-peer.” His mind, she says, was indeed a “Haunted       Palace,” echoing to the footfalls of angels and demons.        “No man,” Poe himself wrote, “has recorded, no man has dared to       record, the wonders of his inner life.”        In these twentieth century days—of lavish recognition—artistic,       popular and material—of genius, what rewards might not a Poe       claim!        Edgar’s father, a son of General David Poe, the American       revolutionary patriot and friend of Lafayette, had married Mrs.       Hopkins, an English actress, and, the match meeting with parental       disapproval, had himself taken to the stage as a profession.       Notwithstanding Mrs. Poe’s beauty and talent the young couple had       a sorry struggle for existence. When Edgar, at the age of two       years, was orphaned, the family was in the utmost destitution.       Apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the world homeless       and friendless. But fate decreed that a few glimmers of sunshine       were to illumine his life, for the little fellow was adopted by       John Allan, a wealthy merchant of Richmond, Va. A brother and       sister, the remaining children, were cared for by others.        In his new home Edgar found all the luxury and advantages money       could provide. He was petted, spoiled and shown off to strangers.       In Mrs. Allan he found all the affection a childless wife could       bestow. Mr. Allan took much pride in the captivating, precocious       lad. At the age of five the boy recited, with fine effect,       passages of English poetry to the visitors at the Allan house.        From his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the Manor       House school, at Stoke-Newington, a suburb of London. It was the       Rev. Dr. Bransby, head of the school, whom Poe so quaintly       portrayed in “William Wilson.” Returning to Richmond in 1820       Edgar was sent to the school of Professor Joseph H. Clarke. He       proved an apt pupil. Years afterward Professor Clarke thus wrote:        “While the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses, Poe wrote       genuine poetry; the boy was a born poet. As a scholar he was       ambitious to excel. He was remarkable for self-respect, without       haughtiness. He had a sensitive and tender heart and would do       anything for a friend. His nature was entirely free from       selfishness.”        At the age of seventeen Poe entered the University of Virginia at       Charlottesville. He left that institution after one session.       Official records prove that he was not expelled. On the contrary,       he gained a creditable record as a student, although it is       admitted that he contracted debts and had “an ungovernable       passion for card-playing.” These debts may have led to his       quarrel with Mr. Allan which eventually compelled him to make his       own way in the world.        Early in 1827 Poe made his first literary venture. He induced       Calvin Thomas, a poor and youthful printer, to publish a small       volume of his verses under the title “Tamerlane and Other Poems.”       In 1829 we find Poe in Baltimore with another manuscript volume       of verses, which was soon published. Its title was “Al Aaraaf,       Tamerlane and Other Poems.” Neither of these ventures seems to       have attracted much attention.        Soon after Mrs. Allan’s death, which occurred in 1829, Poe,       through the aid of Mr. Allan, secured admission to the United       States Military Academy at West Point. Any glamour which may have       attached to cadet life in Poe’s eyes was speedily lost, for       discipline at West Point was never so severe nor were the       accommodations ever so poor. Poe’s bent was more and more toward       literature. Life at the academy daily became increasingly       distasteful. Soon he began to purposely neglect his studies and       to disregard his duties, his aim being to secure his dismissal       from the United States service. In this he succeeded. On March 7,       1831, Poe found himself free. Mr. Allan’s second marriage had       thrown the lad on his own resources. His literary career was to       begin.        Poe’s first genuine victory was won in 1833, when he was the       successful competitor for a prize of $100 offered by a Baltimore       periodical for the best prose story. “A MSS. Found in a Bottle”       was the winning tale. Poe had submitted six stories in a volume.       “Our only difficulty,” says Mr. Latrobe, one of the judges, “was       in selecting from the rich contents of the volume.”        During the fifteen years of his literary life Poe was connected       with various newspapers and magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia       and New York. He was faithful, punctual, industrious, thorough.       N. P. Willis, who for some time employed Poe as critic and       sub-editor on the “Evening Mirror,” wrote thus:        “With the highest admiration for Poe’s genius, and a willingness       to let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led       by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his       duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time       went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious.       We saw but one presentiment of the man—a quiet, patient,       industrious and most gentlemanly person.        “We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be stated in       all mention of his lamentable irregularities), that with a single       glass of wine his whole nature was reversed, the demon became       uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs of intoxication       were visible, his will was palpably insane. In this reversed       character, we repeat, it was never our chance to meet him.”        On September 22, 1835, Poe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in       Baltimore. She had barely turned thirteen years, Poe himself was       but twenty-six. He then was a resident of Richmond and a regular       contributor to the “Southern Literary Messenger.” It was not       until a year later that the bride and her widowed mother followed       him thither.        Poe’s devotion to his child-wife was one of the most beautiful       features of his life. Many of his famous poetic productions were       inspired by her beauty and charm. Consumption had marked her for       its victim, and the constant efforts of husband and mother were       to secure for her all the comfort and happiness their slender       means permitted. Virginia died January 30, 1847, when but       twenty-five years of age. A friend of the family pictures the       death-bed scene—mother and husband trying to impart warmth to her       by chafing her hands and her feet, while her pet cat was suffered       to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth.        These verses from “Annabel Lee,” written by Poe in 1849, the last       year of his life, tell of his sorrow at the loss of his       child-wife:       _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,     In a kingdom by the sea;      But we loved with a love that was more than love—     I and my Annabel Lee;      With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven     Coveted her and me.      And this was the reason that, long ago,     In this kingdom by the sea.      A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling     My beautiful Annabel Lee;      So that her high-born kinsmen came     And bore her away from me,      To shut her up in a sepulchre     In this kingdom by the sea.        Poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with       the “Southern Literary Messenger” in Richmond, Va.; “Graham’s       Magazine” and the “Gentleman’s Magazine” in Philadelphia; the       “Evening Mirror,” the “Broadway Journal,” and “Godey’s Lady’s       Book” in New York. Everywhere Poe’s life was one of unremitting       toil. No tales and poems were ever produced at a greater cost of       brain and spirit.        Poe’s initial salary with the “Southern Literary Messenger,” to       which he contributed the first drafts of a number of his       best-known tales, was $10 a week! Two years later his salary was       but $600 a year. Even in 1844, when his literary reputation was       established securely, he wrote to a friend expressing his       pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute had       agreed to pay him $20 monthly for two pages of criticism.        Those were discouraging times in American literature, but Poe       never lost faith. He was finally to triumph wherever pre-eminent       talents win admirers. His genius has had no better description       than in this stanza from William Winter’s poem, read at the       dedication exercises of the Actors’ Monument to Poe, May 4, 1885,       in New York:       He was the voice of beauty and of woe,      Passion and mystery and the dread unknown;      Pure as the mountains of perpetual snow,      Cold as the icy winds that round them moan,      Dark as the caves wherein earth’s thunders groan,      Wild as the tempests of the upper sky,      Sweet as the faint, far-off celestial tone of angel whispers,      fluttering from on high,      And tender as love’s tear when youth and beauty die.        In the two and a half score years that have elapsed since Poe’s       death he has come fully into his own. For a while Griswold’s       malignant misrepresentations colored the public estimate of Poe       as man and as writer. But, thanks to J. H. Ingram, W. F. Gill,       Eugene Didier, Sarah Helen Whitman and others these scandals have       been dispelled and Poe is seen as he actually was—not as a man       without failings, it is true, but as the finest and most original       genius in American letters. As the years go on his fame       increases. His works have been translated into many foreign       languages. His is a household name in France and England—in fact,       the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that Poe’s own       country has been slow to appreciate him. But that reproach, if it       ever was warranted, certainly is untrue.  W. H. R.     EDGAR ALLAN POE   By James Russell Lowell        The situation of American literature is anomalous. It has no       centre, or, if it have, it is like that of the sphere of Hermes.       It is divided into many systems, each revolving round its several       suns, and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of       a milk-and-water way. Our capital city, unlike London or Paris,       is not a great central heart from which life and vigor radiate to       the extremities, but resembles more an isolated umbilicus stuck       down as near as may be to the centre of the land, and seeming       rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any       present need. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, each has its       literature almost more distinct than those of the different       dialects of Germany; and the Young Queen of the West has also one       of her own, of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us       dwellers by the Atlantic.        Perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism       of contemporary literature. It is even more grateful to give       praise where it is needed than where it is deserved, and       friendship so often seduces the iron stylus of justice into a       vague flourish, that she writes what seems rather like an epitaph       than a criticism. Yet if praise be given as an alms, we could not       drop so poisonous a one into any man’s hat. The critic’s ink may       suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or of       sugar. But it is easier to be generous than to be just, and we       might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding       place of truth, did we judge from the amount of water which we       usually find mixed with it.        Remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of       imaginative men, but Mr. Poe’s biography displays a vicissitude       and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with. The       offspring of a romantic marriage, and left an orphan at an early       age, he was adopted by Mr. Allan, a wealthy Virginian, whose       barren marriage-bed seemed the warranty of a large estate to the       young poet.        Having received a classical education in England, he returned       home and entered the University of Virginia, where, after an       extravagant course, followed by reformation at the last       extremity, he was graduated with the highest honors of his class.       Then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the insurgent       Greeks, which ended at St. Petersburg, where he got into       difficulties through want of a passport, from which he was       rescued by the American consul and sent home. He now entered the       military academy at West Point, from which he obtained a       dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father,       by a second marriage, an event which cut off his expectations as       an heir. The death of Mr. Allan, in whose will his name was not       mentioned, soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard,       and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support.       Previously to this, however, he had published (in 1827) a small       volume of poems, which soon ran through three editions, and       excited high expectations of its author’s future distinction in       the minds of many competent judges.        That no certain augury can be drawn from a poet’s earliest       lispings there are instances enough to prove. Shakespeare’s first       poems, though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness,       give but a very faint promise of the directness, condensation and       overflowing moral of his maturer works. Perhaps, however,       Shakespeare is hardly a case in point, his “Venus and Adonis”       having been published, we believe, in his twenty-sixth year.       Milton’s Latin verses show tenderness, a fine eye for nature, and       a delicate appreciation of classic models, but give no hint of       the author of a new style in poetry. Pope’s youthful pieces have       all the sing-song, wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity       and eloquent irreligion of his later productions. Collins’ callow       namby-pamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original       genius which he afterward displayed. We have never thought that       the world lost more in the “marvellous boy,” Chatterton, than a       very ingenious imitator of obscure and antiquated dulness. Where       he becomes original (as it is called), the interest of ingenuity       ceases and he becomes stupid. Kirke White’s promises were       indorsed by the respectable name of Mr. Southey, but surely with       no authority from Apollo. They have the merit of a traditional       piety, which to our mind, if uttered at all, had been less       objectionable in the retired closet of a diary, and in the sober       raiment of prose. They do not clutch hold of the memory with the       drowning pertinacity of Watts; neither have they the interest of       his occasional simple, lucky beauty. Burns having fortunately       been rescued by his humble station from the contaminating society       of the “Best models,” wrote well and naturally from the first.       Had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste, we       should have had a series of poems from which, as from his       letters, we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of       chaff. Coleridge’s youthful efforts give no promise whatever of       that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest,       tenderest, most original and most purely imaginative poems of       modern times. Byron’s “Hours of Idleness” would never find a       reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity. In       Wordsworth’s first preludings there is but a dim foreboding of       the creator of an era. From Southey’s early poems, a safer augury       might have been drawn. They show the patient investigator, the       close student of history, and the unwearied explorer of the       beauties of predecessors, but they give no assurances of a man       who should add aught to stock of household words, or to the rarer       and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor. The       earliest specimens of Shelley’s poetic mind already, also, give       tokens of that ethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to       soar above the regions of words, but leaves its body, the verse,       to be entombed, without hope of resurrection, in a mass of them.       Cowley is generally instanced as a wonder of precocity. But his       early insipidities show only a capacity for rhyming and for the       metrical arrangement of certain conventional combinations of       words, a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical       organization, and an unhappy memory. An early poem is only       remarkable when it displays an effort of _reason,_ and the rudest       verses in which we can trace some conception of the ends of       poetry, are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile       versification. A school-boy, one would say, might acquire the       regular see-saw of Pope merely by an association with the motion       of the play-ground tilt.        Mr. Poe’s early productions show that he could see through the       verse to the spirit beneath, and that he already had a feeling       that all the life and grace of the one must depend on and be       modulated by the will of the other. We call them the most       remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read. We know of none       that can compare with them for maturity of purpose, and a nice       understanding of the effects of language and metre. Such pieces       are only valuable when they display what we can only express by       the contradictory phrase of _innate experience._ We copy one of       the shorter poems, written when the author was only fourteen.       There is a little dimness in the filling up, but the grace and       symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain. There       is a smack of ambrosia about it.       TO HELEN  Helen, thy beauty is to me     Like those Nicean barks of yore, That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,     The weary, way-worn wanderer bore To his own native shore.  On desperate seas long wont to roam,     Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home     To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome.  Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche     How statue-like I see thee stand! The agate lamp within thy hand,     Ah! Psyche, from the regions which Are Holy Land!        It is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us. Here is       no “withering scorn,” no heart “blighted” ere it has safely got       into its teens, none of the drawing-room sansculottism which       Byron had brought into vogue. All is limpid and serene, with a       pleasant dash of the Greek Helicon in it. The melody of the       whole, too, is remarkable. It is not of that kind which can be       demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of the fingers. It is       of that finer sort which the inner ear alone _can_ estimate. It       seems simple, like a Greek column, because of its perfection. In       a poem named “Ligeia,” under which title he intended to personify       the music of nature, our boy-poet gives us the following       exquisite picture:      Ligeia! Ligeia! My beautiful one,     Whose harshest idea Will to melody run,     Say, is it thy will, On the breezes to toss,     Or, capriciously still, Like the lone albatross,     Incumbent on night, As she on the air,     To keep watch with delight On the harmony there?        John Neal, himself a man of genius, and whose lyre has been too       long capriciously silent, appreciated the high merit of these and       similar passages, and drew a proud horoscope for their author.        Mr. Poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to       call _genius_. No man could ever tell us precisely what it is,       and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence       and its power. Let talent writhe and contort itself as it may, it       has no such magnetism. Larger of bone and sinew it may be, but       the wings are wanting. Talent sticks fast to earth, and its most       perfect works have still one foot of clay. Genius claims kindred       with the very workings of Nature herself, so that a sunset shall       seem like a quotation from Dante, and if Shakespeare be read in       the very presence of the sea itself, his verses shall but seem       nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean. Talent may make       friends for itself, but only genius can give to its creations the       divine power of winning love and veneration. Enthusiasm cannot       cling to what itself is unenthusiastic, nor will he ever have       disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a       disciple. Great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they       are possessed and carried away by their demon, while talent keeps       him, as Paracelsus did, securely prisoned in the pommel of his       sword. To the eye of genius, the veil of the spiritual world is       ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and       evil who throng continually around it. No man of mere talent ever       flung his inkstand at the devil.        When we say that Mr. Poe had genius, we do not mean to say that       he has produced evidence of the highest. But to say that he       possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal, industry,       and a reverence for the trust reposed in him, to achieve the       proudest triumphs and the greenest laurels. If we may believe the       Longinuses and Aristotles of our newspapers, we have quite too       many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them       at all desirable, whether for its hardness of attainment or its       seclusion. The highest peak of our Parnassus is, according to       these gentlemen, by far the most thickly settled portion of the       country, a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable       residence for individuals of a poetical temperament, if love of       solitude be, as immemorial tradition asserts, a necessary part of       their idiosyncrasy.        Mr. Poe has two of the prime qualities of genius, a faculty of       vigorous yet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of       imagination. The first of these faculties is as needful to the       artist in words, as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in       colors or in stone. This enables him to conceive truly, to       maintain a proper relation of parts, and to draw a correct       outline, while the second groups, fills up and colors. Both of       these Mr. Poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his       prose works, the last predominating in his earlier tales, and the       first in his later ones. In judging of the merit of an author,       and assigning him his niche among our household gods, we have a       right to regard him from our own point of view, and to measure       him by our own standard. But, in estimating the amount of power       displayed in his works, we must be governed by his own design,       and placing them by the side of his own ideal, find how much is       wanting. We differ from Mr. Poe in his opinions of the objects of       art. He esteems that object to be the creation of Beauty, and       perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we       disagree with him. But in what we shall say of his writings, we       shall take his own standard as our guide. The temple of the god       of song is equally accessible from every side, and there is room       enough in it for all who bring offerings, or seek in oracle.        In his tales, Mr. Poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in       that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of       the probable into the weird confines of superstition and       unreality. He combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties       which are seldom found united; a power of influencing the mind of       the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery, and a minuteness       of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed. Both       are, in truth, the natural results of the predominating quality       of his mind, to which we have before alluded, analysis. It is       this which distinguishes the artist. His mind at once reaches       forward to the effect to be produced. Having resolved to bring       about certain emotions in the reader, he makes all subordinate       parts tend strictly to the common centre. Even his mystery is       mathematical to his own mind. To him X is a known quantity all       along. In any picture that he paints he understands the chemical       properties of all his colors. However vague some of his figures       may seem, however formless the shadows, to him the outline is as       clear and distinct as that of a geometrical diagram. For this       reason Mr. Poe has no sympathy with Mysticism. The Mystic dwells       in the mystery, is enveloped with it; it colors all his thoughts;       it affects his optic nerve especially, and the commonest things       get a rainbow edging from it. Mr. Poe, on the other hand, is a       spectator _ab extra_. He analyzes, he dissects, he watches      “with an eye serene,      The very pulse of the machine,”        for such it practically is to him, with wheels and cogs and       piston-rods, all working to produce a certain end.        This analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical, and by       giving him the patience to be minute, enables him to throw a       wonderful reality into his most unreal fancies. A monomania he       paints with great power. He loves to dissect one of these cancers       of the mind, and to trace all the subtle ramifications of its       roots. In raising images of horror, also, he has strange success,       conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some terrible _doubt_       which is the secret of all horror. He leaves to imagination the       task of finishing the picture, a task to which only she is       competent.       “For much imaginary work was there;      Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,      That for Achilles’ image stood his spear      Grasped in an armed hand; himself behind      Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind.”        Besides the merit of conception, Mr. Poe’s writings have also       that of form.        His style is highly finished, graceful and truly classical. It       would be hard to find a living author who had displayed such       varied powers. As an example of his style we would refer to one       of his tales, “The House of Usher,” in the first volume of his       “Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque.” It has a singular charm       for us, and we think that no one could read it without being       strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty. Had its author       written nothing else, it would alone have been enough to stamp       him as a man of genius, and the master of a classic style. In       this tale occurs, perhaps, the most beautiful of his poems.        The great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the       vague and the unreal as sources of effect. They have not used       dread and horror alone, but only in combination with other       qualities, as means of subjugating the fancies of their readers.       The loftiest muse has ever a household and fireside charm about       her. Mr. Poe’s secret lies mainly in the skill with which he has       employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror. In this       his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of       art, not artifice. We cannot call his materials the noblest or       purest, but we must concede to him the highest merit of       construction.        As a critic, Mr. Poe was aesthetically deficient. Unerring in his       analysis of dictions, metres and plots, he seemed wanting in the       faculty of perceiving the profounder ethics of art. His       criticisms are, however, distinguished for scientific precision       and coherence of logic. They have the exactness, and at the same       time, the coldness of mathematical demonstrations. Yet they stand       in strikingly refreshing contrast with the vague generalisms and       sharp personalities of the day. If deficient in warmth, they are       also without the heat of partisanship. They are especially       valuable as illustrating the great truth, too generally       overlooked, that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the       critic.        On the whole, it may be considered certain that Mr. Poe has       attained an individual eminence in our literature which he will       keep. He has given proof of power and originality. He has done       that which could only be done once with success or safety, and       the imitation or repetition of which would produce weariness.     DEATH OF EDGAR A. POE   By N. P. Willis        The ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one       body, equally powerful and having the complete mastery by       turns-of one man, that is to say, inhabited by both a devil and       an angel seems to have been realized, if all we hear is true, in       the character of the extraordinary man whose name we have written       above. Our own impression of the nature of Edgar A. Poe, differs       in some important degree, however, from that which has been       generally conveyed in the notices of his death. Let us, before       telling what we personally know of him, copy a graphic and highly       finished portraiture, from the pen of Dr. Rufus W. Griswold,       which appeared in a recent number of the “Tribune”:        “Edgar Allen Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore on Sunday, October       7th. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved       by it. The poet was known, personally or by reputation, in all       this country; he had readers in England and in several of the       states of Continental Europe; but he had few or no friends; and       the regrets for his death will be suggested principally by the       consideration that in him literary art has lost one of its most       brilliant but erratic stars.        “His conversation was at times almost supramortal in its       eloquence. His voice was modulated with astonishing skill, and       his large and variably expressive eyes looked repose or shot       fiery tumult into theirs who listened, while his own face glowed,       or was changeless in pallor, as his imagination quickened his       blood or drew it back frozen to his heart. His imagery was from       the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision of       genius. Suddenly starting from a proposition, exactly and sharply       defined, in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness, he rejected       the forms of customary logic, and by a crystalline process of       accretion, built up his ocular demonstrations in forms of       gloomiest and ghastliest grandeur, or in those of the most airy       and delicious beauty, so minutely and distinctly, yet so rapidly,       that the attention which was yielded to him was chained till it       stood among his wonderful creations, till he himself dissolved       the spell, and brought his hearers back to common and base       existence, by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest       passion.        “He was at all times a dreamer dwelling in ideal realms in heaven       or hell peopled with the creatures and the accidents of his       brain. He walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips       moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate       prayer (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel,       that he was already damned, but) for their happiness who at the       moment were objects of his idolatry; or with his glances       introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish, and with a face       shrouded in gloom, he would brave the wildest storms, and all       night, with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and       rains, would speak as if the spirits that at such times only       could be evoked by him from the Aidenn, close by whose portals       his disturbed soul sought to forget the ills to which his       constitution subjected him—close by the Aidenn where were those       he loved—the Aidenn which he might never see, but in fitful       glimpses, as its gates opened to receive the less fiery and more       happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the doom of       death.        “He seemed, except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his will       and engrossed his faculties, always to bear the memory of some       controlling sorrow. The remarkable poem of ‘The Raven’ was       probably much more nearly than has been supposed, even by those       who were very intimate with him, a reflection and an echo of his       own history. _He_ was that bird’s      “‘Unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore     Of ‘Never—never more.’        “Every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his       works, whatever their design, traces of his personal character:       elements of his immortal being, in which the individual survives       the person. While we read the pages of the ‘Fall of the House of       Usher,’ or of ‘Mesmeric Revelations,’ we see in the solemn and       stately gloom which invests one, and in the subtle metaphysical       analysis of both, indications of the idiosyncrasies of what was       most remarkable and peculiar in the author’s intellectual nature.       But we see here only the better phases of his nature, only the       symbols of his juster action, for his harsh experience had       deprived him of all faith in man or woman. He had made up his       mind upon the numberless complexities of the social world, and       the whole system with him was an imposture. This conviction gave       a direction to his shrewd and naturally unamiable character.       Still, though he regarded society as composed altogether of       villains, the sharpness of his intellect was not of that kind       which enabled him to cope with villany, while it continually       caused him by overshots to fail of the success of honesty. He was       in many respects like Francis Vivian in Bulwer’s novel of ‘The       Caxtons.’ Passion, in him, comprehended many of the worst       emotions which militate against human happiness. You could not       contradict him, but you raised quick choler; you could not speak       of wealth, but his cheek paled with gnawing envy. The astonishing       natural advantages of this poor boy—his beauty, his readiness,       the daring spirit that breathed around him like a fiery       atmosphere—had raised his constitutional self-confidence into an       arrogance that turned his very claims to admiration into       prejudices against him. Irascible, envious—bad enough, but not       the worst, for these salient angles were all varnished over with       a cold, repellant cynicism, his passions vented themselves in       sneers. There seemed to him no moral susceptibility; and, what       was more remarkable in a proud nature, little or nothing of the       true point of honor. He had, to a morbid excess, that, desire to       rise which is vulgarly called ambition, but no wish for the       esteem or the love of his species; only the hard wish to       succeed—not shine, not serve—succeed, that he might have the       right to despise a world which galled his self-conceit.        “We have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes       upon his literature. It was more conspicuous in his later than in       his earlier writings. Nearly all that he wrote in the last two or       three years—including much of his best poetry—was in some sense       biographical; in draperies of his imagination, those who had       taken the trouble to trace his steps, could perceive, but       slightly concealed, the figure of himself.”        Apropos of the disparaging portion of the above well-written       sketch, let us truthfully say:        Some four or five years since, when editing a daily paper in this       city, Mr. Poe was employed by us, for several months, as critic       and sub-editor. This was our first personal acquaintance with       him. He resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles       out of town, but was at his desk in the office, from nine in the       morning till the evening paper went to press. With the highest       admiration for his genius, and a willingness to let it atone for       more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by common report to       expect a very capricious attention to his duties, and       occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time went on,       however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. With his       pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a reminder of what       genius was in him, it was impossible, of course, not to treat him       always with deferential courtesy, and, to our occasional request       that he would not probe too deep in a criticism, or that he would       erase a passage colored too highly with his resentments against       society and mankind, he readily and courteously assented—far more       yielding than most men, we thought, on points so excusably       sensitive. With a prospect of taking the lead in another       periodical, he, at last, voluntarily gave up his employment with       us, and, through all this considerable period, we had seen but       one presentment of the man—a quiet, patient, industrious, and       most gentlemanly person, commanding the utmost respect and good       feeling by his unvarying deportment and ability.        Residing as he did in the country, we never met Mr. Poe in hours       of leisure; but he frequently called on us afterward at our place       of business, and we met him often in the street—invariably the       same sad mannered, winning and refined gentleman, such as we had       always known him. It was by rumor only, up to the day of his       death, that we knew of any other development of manner or       character. We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be       stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities), that,       with a single glass of wine, his whole nature was reversed, the       demon became uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs of       intoxication were visible, his will was palpably insane.       Possessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity, at such       times, and seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and       memory, he easily seemed personating only another phase of his       natural character, and was accused, accordingly, of insulting       arrogance and bad-heartedness. In this reversed character, we       repeat, it was never our chance to see him. We know it from       hearsay, and we mention it in connection with this sad infirmity       of physical constitution; which puts it upon very nearly the       ground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity.        The arrogance, vanity, and depravity of heart, of which Mr. Poe       was generally accused, seem to us referable altogether to this       reversed phase of his character. Under that degree of       intoxication which only acted upon him by demonizing his sense of       truth and right, he doubtless said and did much that was wholly       irreconcilable with his better nature; but, when himself, and as       we knew him only, his modesty and unaffected humility, as to his       own deservings, were a constant charm to his character. His       letters, of which the constant application for autographs has       taken from us, we are sorry to confess, the greater portion,       exhibited this quality very strongly. In one of the carelessly       written notes of which we chance still to retain possession, for       instance, he speaks of “The Raven”—that extraordinary poem which       electrified the world of imaginative readers, and has become the       type of a school of poetry of its own—and, in evident earnest,       attributes its success to the few words of commendation with       which we had prefaced it in this paper. It will throw light on       his sane character to give a literal copy of the note:  “FORDHAM, _April_ 20, 1849        “MY DEAR WILLIS—The poem which I inclose, and which I am so vain       as to hope you will like, in some respects, has been just       published in a paper for which sheer necessity compels me to       write, now and then. It pays well as times go-but unquestionably       it ought to pay ten prices; for whatever I send it I feel I am       consigning to the tomb of the Capulets. The verses accompanying       this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and bring them to       light in the ‘Home Journal?’ If you can oblige me so far as to       copy them, I do not think it will be necessary to say ‘From the       ——,’ that would be too bad; and, perhaps, ‘From a late —— paper,’       would do.        “I have not forgotten how a ‘good word in season’ from you made       ‘The Raven,’ and made ‘Ulalume’ (which by-the-way, people have       done me the honor of attributing to you), therefore, I _would_       ask you (if I dared) to say something of these lines if they       please you.  “Truly yours ever, “EDGAR A. POE.”        In double proof of his earnest disposition to do the best for       himself, and of the trustful and grateful nature which has been       denied him, we give another of the only three of his notes which       we chance to retain:  “FORDHAM, _January_ 22, 1848.        “MY DEAR MR. WILLIS—I am about to make an effort at       re-establishing myself in the literary world, and _feel_ that I       may depend upon your aid.        “My general aim is to start a Magazine, to be called ‘The       Stylus,’ but it would be useless to me, even when established, if       not entirely out of the control of a publisher. I mean,       therefore, to get up a journal which shall be _my own_ at all       points. With this end in view, I must get a list of at least five       hundred subscribers to begin with; nearly two hundred I have       already. I propose, however, to go South and West, among my       personal and literary friends—old college and West Point       acquaintances—and see what I can do. In order to get the means of       taking the first step, I propose to lecture at the Society       Library, on Thursday, the 3d of February, and, that there may be       no cause of _squabbling_, my subject shall _not be literary_ at       all. I have chosen a broad text: ‘The Universe.’        “Having thus given you _the facts_ of the case, I leave all the       rest to the suggestions of your own tact and generosity.       Gratefully, _most gratefully,_  “Your friend always, “EDGAR A. POE.”        Brief and chance-taken as these letters are, we think they       sufficiently prove the existence of the very qualities denied to       Mr. Poe-humility, willingness to persevere, belief in another’s       friendship, and capability of cordial and grateful friendship!       Such he assuredly was when sane. Such only he has invariably       seemed to us, in all we have happened personally to know of him,       through a friendship of five or six years. And so much easier is       it to believe what we have seen and known, than what we hear of       only, that we remember him but with admiration and respect; these       descriptions of him, when morally insane, seeming to us like       portraits, painted in sickness, of a man we have only known in       health.        But there is another, more touching, and far more forcible       evidence that there was _goodness_ in Edgar A. Poe. To reveal it       we are obliged to venture upon the lifting of the veil which       sacredly covers grief and refinement in poverty; but we think it       may be excused, if so we can brighten the memory of the poet,       even were there not a more needed and immediate service which it       may render to the nearest link broken by his death.        Our first knowledge of Mr. Poe’s removal to this city was by a       call which we received from a lady who introduced herself to us       as the mother of his wife. She was in search of employment for       him, and she excused her errand by mentioning that he was ill,       that her daughter was a confirmed invalid, and that their       circumstances were such as compelled her taking it
