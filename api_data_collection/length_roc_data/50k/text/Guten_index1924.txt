And when I came to the high lych-gate    I waited awhile where the corpses wait;    Then I came down the road where the moonlight lay    Like the fallen ghost of the light of day.     The bats shrieked high in their zigzag flight,    The owls’ spread wings were quiet and white,    The wind and the poplar gave sigh for sigh,    And all about were the rustling shy    Little live creatures that love the night—    Little wild creatures timid and free.    I passed, and they were not afraid of me.     It was over the meadow and down the lane    The way to come to my house again:    Through the wood where the lovers talk,    And the ghosts, they say, get leave to walk.    I wore the clothes that we all must wear,    And no one saw me walking there,    No one saw my pale feet pass    By my garden path to my garden grass.    My garden was hung with the veil of spring—    Plum-tree and pear-tree blossoming;    It lay in the moon’s cold sheet of light    In garlands and silence, wondrous and white    As a dead bride decked for her burying.     Then I saw the face of my house    Held close in the arms of the blossomed boughs:    I leaned my face to the window bright    To feel if the heart of my house beat right.    The firelight hung it with fitful gold;    It was warm as the house of the dead is cold.    I saw the settles, the candles tall,    The black-faced presses against the wall,    Polished beechwood and shining brass,    The gleam of china, the glitter of glass,    All the little things that were home to me—    Everything as it used to be.     Then I said, “The fire of life still burns,    And I have returned whence none returns:    I will warm my hands where the fire is lit,    I will warm my heart in the heart of it!”    So I called aloud to the one within:    “Open, open, and let me in!    Let me in to the fire and the light—    It is very cold out here in the night!”    There was never a stir or an answering breath—    Only a silence as deep as death.     Then I beat on the window, and called, and cried.    No one heard me, and none replied.    The golden silence lay warm and deep,    And I wept as the dead, forgotten, weep;    And there was no one to hear or see—    To comfort me, to have pity on me.     But deep in the silence something stirred—    Something that had not seen or heard—    And two drew near to the window-pane,    Kissed in the moonlight and kissed again,    And looked, through my face, to the moon-shroud, spread    Over the garlanded garden bed;    And—“How ghostly the moonlight is!” she said.     Back through the garden, the wood, the lane,    I came to mine own place again.    I wore the garments we all must wear,    And no one saw me walking there.    No one heard my thin feet pass    Through the white of the stones and the gray of the grass,    Along the path where the moonlight hews    Slabs of shadow for thirteen yews.     In the hollow where drifted dreams lie deep    It is good to sleep: it was good to sleep:    But my bed has grown cold with the drip of the dew,    And I cannot sleep as I used to do.     FOR DOLLY WHO DOES NOT LEARN HER LESSONS      YOU see the fairies dancing in the fountain,       Laughing, leaping, sparkling with the spray;    You see the gnomes, at work beneath the mountain,       Make gold and silver and diamonds every day;    You see the angels, sliding down the moonbeams,       Bring white dreams like sheaves of lilies fair;    You see the imps, scarce seen against the moonbeams,       Rise from the bonfire’s blue and liquid air.     All the enchantment, all the magic there is       Hid in trees and blossoms, to you is plain and true.    Dewdrops in lupin leaves are jewels for the fairies;       Every flower that blows is a miracle for you.    Air, earth, water, fire, spread their splendid wares for you.       Millions of magics beseech your little looks;    Every soul your winged soul meets, loves you and cares for you.       Ah! why must we clip those wings and dim those eyes with books?     Soon, soon enough the magic lights grow dimmer,       Marsh mists arise to cloud the radiant sky,    Dust of hard highways will veil the starry glimmer,       Tired hands will lay the folded magic by.    Storm winds will blow through those enchanted closes,       Fairies be crushed where weed and briar grow strong . . .    Leave her her crown of magic stars and roses,       Leave her her kingdom—she will not keep it long!     QUESTIONS      WHAT do the roses do, mother,       Now that the summer’s done?    They lie in the bed that is hung with red       And dream about the sun.     What do the lilies do, mother,       Now that there’s no more June?    Each one lies down in her white nightgown       And dreams about the moon.     What can I dream of, mother,       With the moon and the sun away?    Of a rose unborn, of an untried thorn,       And a lily that lives a day!     THE DAISIES      IN the great green park with the wooden palings—    The wooden palings so hard to climb,    There are fern and foxglove, primrose and violet,    And green things growing all the time;    And out in the open the daisies grow,    Pretty and proud in their proper places,    Millions of white-frilled daisy faces,    Millions and millions—not one or two.    And they call to the bluebells down in the wood:    “Are you out—are you in?  We have been so good    All the school-time winter through,    But now it’s playtime,    The gay time, the May time;    We are out and at play.  Where are you?”     In the gritty garden inside the railings,    The spiky railings all painted green,    There are neat little beds of geraniums and fuchsia    With never a happy weed between.    There’s a neat little grass plot, bald in places,    And very dusty to touch;    A respectable man comes once a week    To keep the garden weeded and swept,    To keep it as we don’t want it kept.    He cuts the grass with his mowing-machine,    And we think he cuts it too much.    But even on the lawn, all dry and gritty,    The daisies play about.    They are so brave as well as so pretty,    You cannot keep them out.    I love them, I want to let them grow,    But that respectable man says no.    He cuts off their heads with his mowing-machine    Like the French Revolution guillotine.    He sweeps up the poor little pretty faces,    The dear little white-frilled daisy faces;    Says things must be kept in their proper places    He has no frill round his ugly face—    I wish I could find his proper place!     THE TOUCHSTONE      THERE was a garden, very strange and fair       With all the roses summer never brings.       The snowy blossom of immortal Springs    Lighted its boughs, and I, even I, was there.       There were new heavens, and the earth was new,       And still I told my heart the dream was true.     But when the sun stood still, and Time went out       Like a blown candle—when she came to me       Under the bride-veil of the blossomed tree,    Chill through the garden blew the winds of doubt,       And when, with starry eyes, and lips too near,       She leaned to me, my heart knew what to fear.     “It is no dream,” she said.  “What dream had stayed       So long?  It is the blessed isle that lies       Between the tides of twin eternities.    It is our island; do not be afraid!”       Then, then at last my heart was well deceived;       I hid my eyes; I trembled and believed.     Her real presence sanctified my faith,       Her very voice my restless fears beguiled,       And it was Life that clasped me when she smiled,    But when she said “I love you!” it was Death.       That, that at least could neither be nor seem—       Oh, then, indeed, I knew it was a dream!     THE DECEMBER ROSE      HERE’S a rose that blows for Chloe,       Fair as ever a rose in June was,    Now the garden’s silent, snowy,       Where the burning summer noon was.     In your garden’s summer glory       One poor corner, shelved and shady,    Told no rosy, radiant story,       Grew no rose to grace its lady.     What shuts sun out shuts out snow too;       From his nook your secret lover    Shows what slighted roses grow to       When the rose you chose is over.     THE FIRE      I WAS picking raspberries, my head was in the canes,    And he came behind and kissed me, and I smacked him for his pains.    Says he, “You take it easy!  That ain’t the way to do!    I love you hot as fire, my girl, and you know you know it too.    So won’t you name the day?”    But I said, “That I will not.”    And I pushed him away,    Out among the raspberries all on a summer day.    And I says, “You ask in winter, if your love’s so hot,    For it’s summer now, and sunny, and my hands is full,” says I,    “With the fair by and by,    And the village dance and all;    And the turkey poults is small,    And so’s the ducks and chicks,    And the hay not yet in ricks,    And the flower-show’ll be presently and hop-picking’s to come,    And the fruiting and the harvest home,    And my new white gown to make, and the jam all to be done.    Can’t you leave a girl alone?    Your love’s too hot for me!    Can’t you leave a girl be    Till the evenings do draw in,    Till the leaves be getting thin,    Till the fires be lighted early, and the curtains drawed for tea?    That’s the time to do your courting, if you come a-courting me!”                                    . . . . .     And he took it as I said it, an’ not as it was meant.    And he went.                                    . . . . .     The hay was stacked, the fruit was picked, the hops were dry and    brown,    And everything was garnered, and the year turned upside down,    And the winter it come on, and the fires were early lit,    And he’d never come anigh again, and all my life was sick.    And I was cold alone, with nought to do but sit    With my hands in my black lap, and hear the clock tick.    For father, he lay dead    With the candles at his head,    And his coffin was that black I could see it through the wall;    And I’d sent them all away,    Though they’d offered for to stay.    I wanted to be cold alone, and learn to bear it all.    Then I heard him.  I’d a-known it for his footstep just as plain    If he’d brought his regiment with him up the rutty frozen lane.    And I hadn’t drawed the curtains, and I see him through the pane;    And I jumped up in my blacks and I threw the door back wide.    Says I, “You come inside;    For it’s cold outside for you,    And it’s cold here too;    And I haven’t no more pride—    It’s too cold for that,” I cried.                                    . . . . .     Then I saw in his face    The fear of death, and desire.    And oh, I took and kissed him again and again,    And I clipped him close and all,    In the winter, in the dusk, in the quiet house-place,    With the coffin lying black and full the other side the wall;    And “_You_ warm my heart,” I told him, “if there’s any fire in men!”    And he got his two arms round me, and I felt the fire then.    And I warmed my heart at the fire.     SONG      NOW the Spring is waking,       Very shy as yet,    Busy mending, making       Grass and violet.    Frowsy Winter’s over:       See the budding lane!    Go and meet your lover:       Spring is here again!     Every day is longer       Than the day before;    Lambs are whiter, stronger,       Birds sing more and more;    Woods are less than shady,       Griefs are more than vain—    Go and kiss your lady:       Spring is here again!     A PARTING               SO good-bye!    This is where we end it, you and I.    Life’s to live, you know, and death’s to die;             So good-bye!              I was yours    For the love in life that loves while life endures,    For the earth-path that the Heaven-flight ensures             I was yours.              You were mine    For the moment that a garland takes to twine,    For the human hour that sorcery shews divine             You were mine.              All is over.    You and I no more are love and lover;    Nought’s to seek now, gain, attain, discover.             All is over.     THE GIFT OF LIFE      LIFE is a night all dark and wild,       Yet still stars shine:    This moment is a star, my child—       Your star and mine.     Life is a desert dry and drear,       Undewed, unblest;    This hour is an oasis, dear;       Here let us rest.     Life is a sea of windy spray,       Cold, fierce and free:    An isle enchanted is to-day       For you and me.     Forget night, sea, and desert: take       The gift supreme,    And, of life’s brief relenting, make       A deathless dream.     INCOMPATIBILITIES      IF you loved me I could trust you to your fancy’s furthest bound    While the sun shone and the wind blew, and the world went round,    To the utmost of the meshes of the devil’s strongest net . . .    If you loved me, if you loved me—but you do not love me yet!     I love you—and I cannot trust you further than the door!    But winds and worlds and seasons change, and you will love me more    And more—until I trust you, dear, as women do trust men—    I shall trust you, I shall trust you, but I shall not love you then!     THE STOLEN GOD LAZARUS TO DIVES      WE do not clamour for vengeance,       We do not whine for fear;    We have cried in the outer darkness       Where was no man to hear.    We cried to man and he heard not;       Yet we thought God heard us pray;    But our God, who loved and was sorry—       Our God is taken away.     Ours were the stream and the pasture,       Forest and fen were ours;    Ours were the wild wood-creatures,       The wild sweet berries and flowers.    You have taken our heirlooms from us,       And hardly you let us save    Enough of our woods for a cradle,       Enough of our earth for a grave.     You took the wood and the cornland,       Where still we tilled and felled;    You took the mine and quarry,       And all you took you held.    The limbs of our weanling children       You crushed in your mills of power;    And you made our bearing women toil       To the very bearing hour.     You have taken our clean quick longings,       Our joy in lover and wife,    Our hope of the sunset quiet       At the evening end of life;    You have taken the land that bore us,       Its soil and stone and sod;    You have taken our faith in each other—       And now you have taken our God.     When our God came down from Heaven       He came among men, a Man,    Eating and drinking and working       As common people can;    And the common people received Him       While the rich men turned away.    But what have we to do with a God       To whom the rich men pray?     He hangs, a dead God, on your altars,       Who lived a Man among men,    You have taken away our Lord       And we cannot find Him again.    You have not left us a handful       Of even the earth He trod . . .    You have made Him a rich man’s idol       Who came as a poor man’s God.     He promised the poor His heaven,       He loved and lived with the poor;    He said that the rich man’s shadow       Should never darken His door:    But bishops and priests lie softly,       Drink full and are fully fed    In the Name of the Lord, who had not       Where to lay His head.     This is the God you have stolen,       As you steal all else—in His name.    You have taken the ease and the honour,       Left us the toil and the shame.    You have chosen the seat of Dives,       We lie where Lazarus lay;    But, by God, we will not yield you our God,       You shall not take Him away.     All else we had you have taken;       All else, but not this, not this.    The God of Heaven is ours, is ours,       And the poor are His, are His.    Is He ours?  Is He yours?  Give answer!       For both He cannot be.    And if He is ours—O you rich men,       Then whose, in God’s name, are ye?     WINTER      HOLD your hands to the blaze;       Winter is here    With the short cold days,       Bleak, keen and drear.    Was there ever a day    With hawthorn along the way    Where you wandered in mild mid-May       With your dear?     That was when you were young       And the world was gold;    Now all the songs are sung,       The tales all told.    You shiver now by the fire    Where the last red sparks expire;    Dead are delight and desire:       You are old.     SEA-SHELLS      I GATHERED shells upon the sand,       Each shell a little perfect thing,    So frail, yet potent to withstand       The mountain-waves’ wild buffeting.    Through storms no ship could dare to brave    The little shells float lightly, save    All that they might have lost of fine    Shape and soft colour crystalline.     Yet I amid the world’s wild surge       Doubt if my soul can face the strife,    The waves of circumstance that urge       That slight ship on the rocks of life.    O soul, be brave, for He who saves    The frail shell in the giant waves,    Will bring thy puny bark to land    Safe in the hollow of His hand.     HOPE      O THRUSH, is it true?       Your song tells    Of a world born anew,    Of fields gold with buttercups, woodlands all blue       With hyacinth bells;    Of primroses deep       In the moss of the lane,    Of a Princess asleep    And dear magic to do.    Will the sun wake the princess?  O thrush, is it true?       Will Spring come again?     Will Spring come again?       Now at last    With soft shine and rain    Will the violet be sweet where the dead leaves have lain?       Will Winter be past?    In the brown of the copse       Will white wind-flowers star through    Where the last oak-leaf drops?       Will the daisies come too,    And the may and the lilac?  Will Spring come again?       O thrush, is it true?     THE PRODIGAL’S RETURN      I REACH my hand to thee!       Stoop; take my hand in thine;    Lead me where I would be,       Father divine.    I do not even know    The way I want to go,       The way that leads to rest:    But, Thou who knowest me,    Lead where I cannot see,       Thou knowest best.     Toys, worthless, yet desired,       Drew me afar to roam.    Father, I am so tired;       I am come home.    The love I held so cheap    I see, so dear, so deep,       So almost understood.    Life is so cold and wild,    I am thy little child—       I _will_ be good.     THE SKYLARK       “. . . a dripping shower of notes from the softening blue.  It is the     skylark come.”—ROBERT À FIELD, in the _New Age_.     “IT is the skylark come.”  For shame!    Robert-à-Cockney is thy name:    Robert-à-Field would surely know    That skylarks, bless them, never go!                                    . . . . .     Love of my life, bear witness here    How we have heard them all the year;    How to the skylark’s song are set    The days we never can forget.    At Rustington, do you remember?    We heard the skylarks in December;    In January above the snow    They sang to us by Hurstmonceux    Once in the keenest airs of March    We heard them near the Marble Arch;    Their April song thrilled Tonbridge air;    May found them singing everywhere;    And oh, in Sheppey, how their tune    Rhymed with the bean-flower scent in June.    One unforgotten day at Rye    They sang a love-song in July;    In August, hard by Lewes town,    They sang of joy ’twixt sky and down;    And in September’s golden spell    We heard them singing on Scaw Fell.    October’s leaves were brown and sere,    But skylarks sang by Teston Weir;    And in November, at Mount’s Bay,    They sang upon our wedding day!                                    . . . . .     Mr.-à-Field, go forth, go forth,    Go east and west and south and north;    You’ll always find the furze in flower,    Find every hour the lovers’ hour,    And, by my faith in love and rhyme,    The skylark singing all the time!     SATURDAY SONG      THEY talk about gardens of roses,       And moonlight over the sea,    And mountains and snow    And sunsetty glow,       But I know what is best for me.    The prettiest sight I know,       Worth all your roses and snow,    Is the blaze of light on a Saturday night,       When the barrows are set in a row.     I’ve heard of bazaars in India       All glitter and spices and smells,    But they don’t compare    With the naphtha flare       And the herrings the coster sells;    And the oranges piled like gold,    The cucumbers lean and cold,    And the red and white block-trimmings       And the strawberries fresh and ripe,    And the peas and beans,    And the sprouts and greens,       And the ’taters and trotters and tripe.     And the shops where they sell the chairs,       The mangles and tables and bedding,    And the lovers go by in pairs,       And look—and think of the wedding.    And your girl has her arm in yours,       And you whisper and make her blush.    Oh! the snap in her eyes—and her smiles and her sighs       As she fancies the purple plush!     And you haven’t a penny to spend,       But you dream that you’ve pounds and pounds;    And arm in arm with your only friend       You make your Saturday rounds:    And you see the cradle bright       With ribbon—lace—pink and white;    And she stops her laugh    And you drop your chaff       In the light of the Saturday night.    And the world is new    For her and you—       A little bit of all-right.     THE CHAMPION      YOUNG and a conqueror, once on a day,    Wild white Winter rode out this way;    With his sword of ice and his banner of snow    Vanquished the Summer and laid her low.     Winter was young then, young and strong;    Now he is old, he has reigned too long.    He shall be routed, he shall be slain;    Summer shall come to her own again!     See the champion of Summer wake    Little armies in field and brake:    “Cruel and cold has King Winter been;    Fight for the Summer, fight for the Queen!”     First the aconite dots the mould    With little round cannon-balls of gold;    Then, to help in the winter’s rout,    Regiments of crocuses march out.     See the swords of the flag-leaves shine;    See the shield of the celandine,    And daffodil lances green and keen,    To fight for the Summer, fight for the Queen.     Silver triumphant the snowdrop swings    Banners that mock at defeated kings;    And wherever the green of the new grass peers,    See the array of victorious spears.     Daffodil trumpets soon shall sound    Over the garden’s battle-ground,    And lovely ladies crowd out to see    The long procession of victory.     Little daisies with snowy frills,    Courtly tulips and sweet jonquils,    Primrose and cowslip, friends well met    With white wood-sorrel and violet.     Hundreds of milkmaids by field and fold;    Thousands of buttercups licked with gold;    Budding hedges and woods and trees—    Spring brings freedom and life to these.     Then the triumphant Spring shall ride    Over the happy countryside;    Deep in the woods the birds shall sing:    “The King is dead—long live the King!”     But Spring is no king, but a faithful knight;    He will ride on through the meadows bright    Till at Summer’s feet he shall light him down    And lay at her feet the royal crown.     She will lean down where the roses twine    Between the may-trees’ silver shine,    And look in the eyes of the dying knight    Who led his army and won her fight.     She will stoop to his lips and say,    “Oh, live, O love!  O my true love, stay!”    While he smiles and sighs her arms between    And dies for the Summer, dies for the Queen.     THE GARDEN REFUSED      THERE is a garden made for our delight,       Where all the dreams we dare not dream come true.          I know it, but I do not know the way.    We slip and tumble in the doubtful night,       Where everything is difficult and new,          And clouds our breath has made obscure the day.     The blank unhappy towns, where sick men strive,       Still doing work that yet is never done;          The hymns to Gold that drown their desperate voice;    The weeds that grow where once corn stood alive,       The black injustice that puts out the sun:          These are our portion, since they are our choice.     Yet there the garden blows with rose on rose,       The sunny, shadow-dappled lawns are there;          There the immortal lilies, heavenly sweet.    O roses, that for us shall not unclose!       O lilies, that we shall not pluck or wear!          O dewy lawns untrodden by our feet!     THESE LITTLE ONES      “WHAT of the garden I gave?”       God said to me;    “Hast thou been diligent to foster and save       The life of flower and tree?    How have the roses thriven,    The lilies I have given,    The pretty scented miracles that Spring    And Summer come to bring?     “My garden is fair and dear,”       I said to God;    “From thorns and nettles I have kept it clear.       Green-trimmed its sod.    The rose is red and bright,    The lily a live delight;    I have not lost a flower of all the flowers    That blessed my hours.”     “What of the child I gave?”       God said to me;    “The little, little one I died to save       And gave in trust to thee?    How have the flowers grown    That in its soul were sown,    The lovely living miracles of youth    And hope and joy and truth?”     “The child’s face is all white,”       I said to God;    “It cries for cold and hunger in the night:       Its little feet have trod    The pavement muddy and cold.    It has no flowers to hold,    And in its soul the flowers you set are dead.”    “Thou fool!” God said.     THE DESPOT      THE garden mould was damp and chill;    Winter had had his brutal will    Since over all the year’s content    His devastating legions went.     The Spring’s bright banners came: there woke    Millions of little growing folk    Who thrilled to know the winter done,    Gave thanks, and strove towards the sun.     Not so the elect; reserved, and slow    To trust a stranger-sun and grow,    They hesitated, cowered and hid,    Waiting to see what others did.     Yet even they, a little, grew,    Put out prim leaves to day and dew,    And lifted level formal heads    In their appointed garden beds.     The gardener came: he coldly loved    The flowers that lived as he approved,    That duly, decorously grew    As he, the despot, meant them to.     He saw the wildlings flower more brave    And bright than any cultured slave;    Yet, since he had not set them there,    He hated them for being fair.     So he uprooted, one by one,    The free things that had loved the sun,    The happy, eager, fruitful seeds    Who had not known that they were weeds.     THE MAGIC RING      YOUR touch on my hand is fire,       Your lips on my lips are flowers.    My darling, my one desire,       Dear crown of my days and hours.    Dear crown of each hour and day       Since ever my life began.    Ah! leave me—ah! go away—       We two are woman and man.     To lie in your arms and see       The stars melt into the sun;    Till there is no you and me,       Since you and I are one.    To loose my soul to your breath,       To bare my heart to your life—    It is death, it is death, it is death!       I am not your wife.     The hours will come and will go,       But never again such an hour    When the tides immortal flow       And life is a flood, a flower . . .    Wait for the ring; it is strong,       It has a magic of might    To make all that was splendid and wrong       Sordid and right.     PHILOSOPHY      THE sulky sage scarce condescends to see       This pretty world of sun and grass and leaves;    To him ’tis all illusion—only he       Is real amid the visions he perceives.     No sage am I, and yet, by Love’s decree,       To me the world’s a masque of shadows too,    And I a shadow also—since to me       The only real thing in life is—you.     THE WHIRLIGIG OF TIME      BEFORE your feet,    My love, my sweet,       Behold! your slave bows down;    And in his hands    From other lands       Brings you another crown.     For in far climes,    In bygone times,       Myself was royal too:    Oh, I have been    A king, my queen,       Who am a slave for you!     MAGIC      WHAT was the spell she wove for me?       Life was a common useful thing,          An eligible building site    To hold a house to shelter me.       There were no woodlands whispering;          No unimagined dreams at night       About that house had folded wing,    Disordering my life for me.     I was so safe until she came       With starry secrets in her eyes,          And on her lips the word of power.    —Like to the moon of May she came,       That makes men mad who were born wise—          Within her hand the only flower       Man ever plucked from Paradise;    So to my half-built house she came.     She turned my useful plot of land       Into a garden wild and fair,          Where stars in garlands hung like flowers:    A moonlit, lonely, lovely land.       Dim groves and glimmering fountains there          Embraced a secret bower of bowers,       And in its rose-ringed heart we were    Alone in that enchanted land.     What was the spell I wove for her,       Her mad dear magic to undo?          The red rose dies, the white rose dies,    The garden spits me forth with her       On the old suburban road I knew.          My house is gone, and by my side       A stranger stands with angry eyes    And lips that swear I ruined her.     WINDFLOWERS      WHEN I was little and good    I walked in the dappled wood    Where light white windflowers grew,    And hyacinths heavy and blue.     The windflowers fluttered light,    Like butterflies white and bright;    The bluebells tremulous stood    Deep in the heart of the wood.     I gathered the white and the blue,    The wild wet woodland through,    With hands too silly and small    To clasp and carry them all.     Some dropped from my hands and died    By the home-road’s grassy side;    And those that my fond hands pressed    Died even before the rest.     AS IT IS         IF you and I       Had wings to fly—    Great wings like seagulls’ wings—       How would we soar       Above the roar    Of loud unneeded things!        We two would rise       Through changing skies    To blue unclouded space,       And undismayed       And unafraid    Meet the sun face to face.        But wings we know not;       The feathers grow not    To carry us so high;       And low in the gloom       Of a little room    We weep and say good-bye.     BEFORE WINTER      THE wind is crying in the night,       Like a lost child;    The waves break wonderful and white       And wild.    The drenched sea-poppies swoon along       The drenched sea-wall,    And there’s an end of summer and of song—       An end of all.     The fingers of the tortured boughs       Gripped by the blast    Clutch at the windows of your house       Closed fast.    And the lost child of love, despair,       Cries in the night,    Remembering how once those windows were       Open and bright.     THE VAULT AFTER SEDGMOOR      YOU need not call at the Inn;       I have ordered my bed:    Fair linen sheets therein       And a tester of lead.    No musty fusty scents       Such as inn chambers keep,    But tapestried with content       And hung with sleep.     My Inn door bears no bar       Set up against fear.    The guests have journeyed far,       They are glad to be here.    Where the damp arch curves up grey,       Long, long shall we lie;    Good King’s men all are they,       A King’s man I.     Old Giles, in his stone asleep,       Fought at Poictiers.    Piers Ralph and Roger keep       The spoil of their fighting years.    I shall lie with my folk at last       In a quiet bed;    I shall dream of the sword held fast       In a round-capped head.     Good tale of men all told       My Inn affords;    And their hands peace shall hold       That once held swords.    And we who rode and ran       On many a loyal quest    Shall find the goal of man—       A bed, and rest.     We shall not stand to the toast       Of Love or King;    We be all too tired to boast       About anything.    We be dumb that did jest and sing;       We rest who laboured and warred . . .    Shout once, shout once for the King.       Shout once for the sword!     SURRENDER      OH, the nights were dark and cold,       When my love was gone.    And life was hard to hold       When my love was gone.    I was wise, I never gave    What they teach a girl to save,    But I wished myself his slave       When my love was gone.     I was all alone at night       When my love came home.    Oh, what thought of wrong or right       When my love came home?    I flung the door back wide    And I pulled my love inside;    There was no more shame or pride       When my love came home.     VALUES      DID you deceive me?  Did I trust    A heart of fire to a heart of dust?    What matter?  Since once the world was fair,    And you gave me the rose of the world to wear.     That was the time to live for!  Flowers,    Sunshine and starshine and magic hours,    Summer about me, Heaven above,    And all seemed immortal, even Love.     Well, the mortal rose of your love was worth    The pains of death and the pains of birth;    And the thorns may be sharper than death—who knows?—    That crowd round the stem of a deathless rose.     IN THE PEOPLE’S PARK      MANY’S the time I’ve found your face       Fresh as a bunch of flowers in May,    Waiting for me at our own old place       At the end of the working day.    Many’s the time I’ve held your hand       On the shady seat in the People’s Park,    And blessed the blaring row of the band       And kissed you there in the dark.     Many’s the time you promised true,       Swore it with kisses, swore it with tears:    “I’ll marry no one without it’s you—       If we have to wait for years.”    And now it’s another chap in the Park       That holds your hand like I used to do;    And I kiss another girl in the dark,       And try to fancy it’s you!     WEDDING DAY      THE enchanted hour,    The magic bower,    Where, crowned with roses,    Love love discloses.     “Kiss me, my lover;    Doubting is over,    Over is waiting;    Love lights our mating!”     “But roses wither,    Chill winds blow hither,    One thing all say, dear,    Love lives a day, dear!”     “Heed those old stories?    New glowing glories    Blot out those lies, love!    Look in my eyes, love!     “Ah, but the world knows—    Naught of the true rose;    Back the world slips, love!    Give me your lips, love!     “Even were their lies true,    Yet were you wise to    Swear, at Love’s portal,    The god’s immortal.”     THE LAST DEFEAT      ACROSS the field of day    In sudden blazon lay    The pallid bar of gold    Borne on the shield of day.    Night had endured so long,    And now the Day grew strong    With lance of light to hold    The Night at bay.     So on my life’s dull night    The splendour of your light    Traversed the dusky shield    And shone forth golden bright.    Your colours I have worn    Through all the fight forlorn,    And these, with life, I yield,    To-night, to Night.     MAY DAY      “WILL you go a-maying, a-maying, a-maying,       Come and be my Queen of May and pluck the may with me?    The fields are full of daisy buds and new lambs playing,       The bird is on the nest, dear, the blossom’s on the tree.”     “If I go with you, if I go a-maying,       To be your Queen and wear my crown this May-day bright,    Hand in hand straying, it must be only playing,       And playtime ends at sunset, and then good-night.     “For I have heard of maidens who laughed and went a-maying,       Went out queens and lost their crowns and came back slaves.    I will be no young man’s slave, submitting and obeying,       Bearing chains as those did, even to their graves.”     “If you come a-maying, a-straying, a-playing,       We will pluck the little flowers, enough for you and me;    And when the day dies, end our one day’s playing,       Give a kiss and take a kiss and go home free.”     GRETNA GREEN      LAST night when I kissed you,       My soul caught alight;    And oh! how I missed you       The rest of the night—    Till Love in derision       Smote sleep with his wings,    And gave me in vision       Impossible things.     A night that was clouded,       Long windows asleep;    Dark avenues crowded       With secrets to keep.    A terrace, a lover,       A foot on the stair;    The waiting was over,       The lady was there.     What a flight, what a night!       The hoofs splashed and pounded.    Dark fainted in light       And the first bird-notes sounded.    You slept on my shoulder,       Shy night hid your face;    But dawn, bolder, colder,       Beheld our embrace.     Your lips of vermilion,       Your ravishing shape,    The flogging postillion,       The village agape,    The rattle and thunder       Of postchaise a-speed . . .    My woman, my wonder,       My ultimate need!     We two matched for mating       Came, handclasped, at last,    Where the blacksmith was waiting       To fetter us fast . . .    At the touch of the fetter       The dream snapped and fell—    And I woke to your letter       That bade me farewell.     THE ETERNAL      YOUR dear desired grace,       Your hands, your lips of red,    The wonder of your perfect face       Will fade, like sweet rose-petals shed,             When you are dead.     Your beautiful hair       Dust in the dust will lie—    But not the light I worship there,       The gold the sunshine crowns you by—             This will not die.     Your beautiful eyes       Will be closed up with clay;    But all the magic they comprise,       The hopes, the dreams, the ecstasies             Pass not away.     All I desire and see       Will be a carrion thing;    But all that you have been to me    Is, and can never cease to be.    O Grave! where is thy victory?       Where, Death, thy sting?     THE POINT OF VIEW: I.   I      THERE was never winter, summer only: roses,       Pink and white and red,    Shining down the warm rich garden closes;          Quiet trees and lawns of dappled shadow,    Silver lilies, whisper of mignonette,       Cloth-of-gold of buttercups outspread;    Good gold sun that kissed me when we met,          Shadows of floating clouds on sunny meadow.    In the hay-field, scented, grey,    Loving life and love, I lay;    By fresh airs blown, drifted into sleep;    Slept and dreamed there.  Winter was the dream.                                       II     Summer never was, was always winter only;       Cold and ice and frost    Only, driven by the ice-wind, lonely,          In a world of strangers, in the welter    Of the puddles and the spiteful wind and sleet,       Blinded by the spitting hailstones, lost    In a bitter unfamiliar street,          I found a doorway, crouched there for just shelter,    Crouched and fought in vain for breath,    Cursed the cold and wished for death;    Crouched there, gathered somehow warmth to sleep;    Slept and dreamed there.  Summer was the dream.     THE POINT OF VIEW: II.   I      IN the wood of lost causes, the valley of tears,       Old hopes, like dead leaves, choke the difficult way;    Dark pinions fold dank round the soul, and it hears:       “It is night, it is night, it has never been day;    Thou hast dreamed of the day, of the rose of delight;    It was always dead leaves and the heart of the night.    Drink deep then, and rest, O thou foolish wayfarer,       For night, like a chalice, holds sleep in her hands.”    II      Then you drain the dark cup, and, half-drugged as you lie       In the arms of despair that is masked as delight,    You thrill to the rush of white wings, and you hear:       “It is day, it is day, it has never been night!    Thou hast dreamed of the night and the wood of lost leaves;    It was always noon, June, and red roses in sheaves,    Unlock the blind lids, and behold the light-bearer    Who holds, like a monstrance, the sun in his hands.”     MARY OF MAGDALA      MARY of Magdala came to bed;    There were no soft curtains round her head;    She had no mother to hold of worth    The little baby she brought to birth.     Mary of Magdala groaned and prayed:    “O God, I am very much afraid;    For out of my body, by sin defiled,    Thou biddest me make a little child.     “O God, I have turned my face from Thee    To that which the angels may not see;    How can I make, from my deep disgrace,    A child whose angel shall see Thy face?     “O God, I have sinned, and I know well    That the pains I bear are the pains of hell;    But the thought of the child that sin has given    Is like the thought of the airs of Heaven.”     Mary of Magdala held her breath    In the clutch of pain like the pains of Death,    And through her heart, like the mortal knife,    Went the pang of joy and the pang of life.     “We two are two alone,” said she,    “And we are two who should be three;    Now who will clothe my baby fair    In the little garments that babies wear?”     There came two angels with quiet wings    And hands that were full of baby things;    And the new-born child was bathed and dressed    And laid again on his mother’s breast.     “Now who will sign on his brow the mark    To keep him safe from the Powers of the Dark?    Who will my baby’s sponsor be?”    “I, the Lord God, who died for thee.”     “Now who will comfort him if he cry;    And who will suckle him by and bye?    For my hands are cold and my breasts are dry,    And I think that my time has come to die.”     “I will dandle thy son as a mother may;    And his lips shall lie where my own Son’s lay.    Come, dear little one, come to me;    The Mother of God shall suckle thee.”     Mary of Magdala laughed and sighed;    “I never deserved a child,” she cried.    “Dear God, I am ready to go to hell,    Since with my little one all is well.”     Then the Son of Mary did o’er her lean.    “Poor mother, thy tears have washed thee clean.    Thy last poor pains, they will soon be done,    And My Mother shall give thee back thy son.”     Frozen grass for a bearing bed,    A halo of frost round a woman’s head,    And pious folks who looked and said:    “A drab and her brat that are better dead.”                                   THE HOME-COMING      THIS was our house.  To this we came    Lighted by love with torch aflame,    And in this chamber, door locked fast,    I held you to my heart at last.     This was our house.  In this we knew    The worst that Time and Fate can do.    You left the room bare, wide the door;    You did not love me any more.     Where once the kind warm curtain hung    The spider’s ghostly cloth is flung;    The beetle and the woodlouse creep    Where once I loved your lovely sleep.     Yet so the vanished spell endures,    That this, our house, still, still is yours.    Here, spite of all these years apart,    I still can hold you to my heart!     AGE TO YOUTH      SUNRISE is in your eyes, and in your heart       The hope and bright desire of morn and May.    My eyes are full of shadow, and my part       Of life is yesterday.     Yet lend my hand your hand, and let us sit       And see your life unfolding like a scroll,    Rich with illuminated blazon, fit       For your arm-bearing soul.     My soul bears arms too, but the scroll’s rolled tight,       Yet the one strip of faded brightness shown    Proclaims that when ’twas splendid in the light       Its blazon matched your own.     IN AGE      THE wine of life was rough and new,       But sweet beyond belief,    And wrong was false, and right was true—       The rose was in the leaf.     In that good sunlight well we knew       The hues of wrong and right;    We slept among the roses through       The long enchanted night.     Now to our eyes, made dim with years,       Right intertwines with wrong.    How can we hear, with these tired ears,       The old, the magic song?     But this we know—wine once was red,       Roses were red and dear;    Once in our ears the truths were said       That now the young men hear!     WHITE MAGIC      THIS is the room to which she came,       And Spring itself came with her;    She stirred the fire of life to flame,       She called all music hither.    Her glance upon the lean white walls       Hung them with cloth of splendour,    And still the rose she dropped recalls       The graces that attend her.     The same poor room, so dull and bare       Before, in consecration,    She breathed upon its common air       The true transfiguration . . .?    This room the same to which she came       For one immortal minute?—    How can it ever be the same       Since she has once been in it!     FROM THE PORTUGUESE   I      WHEN I lived in the village of youth    There were lilies in all the orchards,    Flowers in the orange-gardens    For brides to wear in their hair.    It was always sunshine and summer,    Roses at every lattice,    Dreams in the eyes of maidens,    Love in the eyes of men.     When I lived in the village of youth    The doors, all the doors, stood open;    We went in and out of them laughing,    Laughing and calling each other    To shew each other our fairings,    The new shawl, the new comb, the new fan,    The new rose, the new lover.     Now I live in the town of age    Where are no orchards, no gardens.    Here, too, all the doors stand open,    But no one goes in or goes out.    We sit alone by the hearthstone    Where memories lie like ashes    Upon a hearth that is cold;     And they from the village of youth    Run by our doorsteps laughing,    Calling, to shew each other    The new shawl, the new comb, the new fan,    The new rose, the new lover.     Once we had all these things—    We kept them from the old people,    And now the young people have them    And will not shew them to us—    To us who are old and have nothing    But the white, still, heaped-up ashes    On the hearth where the fire went out    A very long time ago.    II      I HAD a mistress; I loved her.    She left me wit
