The sonnet on the forty-fourth page, against all right Italianate laws, hath but thirteen lines withal: add another to thy liking, if thou art a Maker; or, if thou art none, even be content with what is set before thee.  If it be scant measure, be sure it is choicely good.     A SCOT TO JEANNE D’ARC            DARK Lily without blame,          Not upon us the shame,    Whose sires were to the Auld Alliance true,          They, by the Maiden’s side,          Victorious fought and died,    One stood by thee that fiery torment through,       Till the White Dove from thy pure lips had passed,    And thou wert with thine own St. Catherine at the last.           Once only didst thou see          In artist’s imagery,    Thine own face painted, and that precious thing          Was in an Archer’s hand          From the leal Northern land.    Alas, what price would not thy people bring       To win that portrait of the ruinous    Gulf of devouring years that hide the Maid from us!           Born of a lowly line,          Noteless as once was thine,    One of that name I would were kin to me,          Who, in the Scottish Guard          Won this for his reward,    To fight for France, and memory of thee:       Not upon us, dark Lily without blame,    Not on the North may fall the shadow of that shame.           On France and England both          The shame of broken troth,    Of coward hate and treason black must be;          If England slew thee, France          Sent not one word, one lance,    One coin to rescue or to ransom thee.       And still thy Church unto the Maid denies    The halo and the palms, the Beatific prize.           But yet thy people calls          Within the rescued walls    Of Orleans; and makes its prayer to thee;          What though the Church have chidden          These orisons forbidden,    Yet art thou with this earth’s immortal Three,       With him in Athens that of hemlock died,    And with thy Master dear whom the world crucified.     HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693                             Time of Narrating—1743     YE hae heard Whigs crack o’ the Saints in the Bass, my faith, a    gruesome tale;    How the Remnant paid at a tippeny rate, for a quart o’ ha’penny ale!    But I’ll tell ye anither tale o’ the Bass, that’ll hearten ye up to    hear,    Sae I pledge ye to Middleton first in a glass, and a health to the    Young Chevalier!     The Bass stands frae North Berwick Law a league or less to sea,    About its feet the breakers beat, abune the sea-maws flee,    There’s castle stark and dungeon dark, wherein the godly lay,    That made their rant for the Covenant through mony a weary day.    For twal’ years lang the caverns rang wi’ preaching, prayer, and    psalm,    Ye’d think the winds were soughing wild, when a’ the winds were calm,    There wad they preach, each Saint to each, and glower as the soldiers    pass,    And Peden wared his malison on a bonny leaguer lass,    As she stood and daffed, while the warders laughed, and wha sae blithe    as she,    But a wind o’ ill worked his warlock will, and flang her out to sea.    Then wha sae bright as the Saints that night, and an angel came, say    they,    And sang in the cell where the Righteous dwell, but he took na a Saint    away.    There yet might they be, for nane could flee, and nane daur’d break    the jail,    And still the sobbing o’ the sea might mix wi’ their warlock wail,    But then came in black echty-echt, and bluidy echty-nine,    Wi’ Cess, and Press, and Presbytery, and a’ the dule sin’ syne,    The Saints won free wi’ the power o’ the key, and cavaliers maun pine!    It was Halyburton, Middleton, and Roy and young Dunbar,    That Livingstone took on Cromdale haughs, in the last fight of the    war:    And they were warded in the Bass, till the time they should be slain,    Where bluidy Mitchell, and Blackader, and Earlston lang had lain;    Four lads alone, ’gainst a garrison, but Glory crowns their names,    For they brought it to pass that they took the Bass, and they held it    for King James!     It isna by preaching half the night, ye’ll burst a dungeon door,    It wasna by dint o’ psalmody they broke the hold, they four,    For lang years three that rock in the sea bade Wullie Wanbeard gae    swing,    And England and Scotland fause may be, but the Bass Rock stands for    the King!     There’s but ae pass gangs up the Bass, it’s guarded wi’ strong gates    four,    And still as the soldiers went to the sea, they steikit them, door by    door,    And this did they do when they helped a crew that brought their coals    on shore.    Thither all had gone, save three men alone: then Middleton gripped his    man,    Halyburton felled the sergeant lad, Dunbar seized the gunner, Swan;    Roy bound their hands, in hempen bands, and the Cavaliers were free.    And they trained the guns on the soldier loons that were down wi’ the    boat by the sea!    Then Middleton cried frae the high cliff-side, and his voice garr’d    the auld rocks ring,    ‘Will ye stand or flee by the land or sea, for I hold the Bass for the    King?’     They had nae desire to face the fire; it was mair than men might do,    So they e’en sailed back in the auld coal-smack, a sorry and    shame-faced crew,    And they hirpled doun to Edinburgh toun, wi’ the story of their    shames,    How the prisoners bold had broken hold, and kept the Bass for King    James.     King James he has sent them guns and men, and the Whigs they guard the    Bass,    But they never could catch the Cavaliers, who took toll of ships that    pass,    They fared wild and free as the birds o’ the sea, and at night they    went on the wing,    And they lifted the kye o’ Whigs far and nigh, and they revelled and    drank to the King.     Then Wullie Wanbeard sends his ships to siege the Bass in form,    And first shall they break the fortress down, and syne the Rock    they’ll storm.    After twa days’ fight they fled in the night, and glad eneuch to go,    With their rigging rent, and their powder spent, and many a man laid    low.     So for lang years three did they sweep the sea, but a closer watch was    set,    Till nae food had they, but twa ounce a day o’ meal was the maist    they’d get.    And men fight but tame on an empty wame, so they sent a flag o’ truce,    And blithe were the Privy Council then, when the Whigs had heard that    news.    Twa Lords they sent wi’ a strang intent to be dour on each Cavalier,    But wi’ French cakes fine, and his last drap o’ wine, did Middleton    make them cheer,    On the muzzles o’ guns he put coats and caps, and he set them aboot    the wa’s,    And the Whigs thocht then he had food and men to stand for the    Rightfu’ Cause.    So he got a’ he craved, and his men were saved, and nane might say    them nay,    Wi’ sword by side, and flag o’ pride, free men might they gang their    way,    They might fare to France, they might bide at hame, and the better    their grace to buy,    Wullie Wanbeard’s purse maun pay the keep o’ the men that did him    defy!     Men never hae gotten sic terms o’ peace since first men went to war,    As got Halyburton, and Middleton, and Roy, and the young Dunbar.    Sae I drink to ye here, _To the Young Chevalier_!  I hae said ye an    auld man’s say,    And there may hae been mightier deeds of arms, but there never was    nane sae gay!     THREE PORTRAITS OF PRINCE CHARLES   1731      BEAUTIFUL face of a child,       Lighted with laughter and glee,    Mirthful, and tender, and wild,       My heart is heavy for thee!    1744      Beautiful face of a youth,       As an eagle poised to fly forth,    To the old land loyal of truth,       To the hills and the sounds of the North:    Fair face, daring and proud,       Lo! the shadow of doom, even now,    The fate of thy line, like a cloud,       Rests on the grace of thy brow!    1773      Cruel and angry face,       Hateful and heavy with wine,    Where are the gladness, the grace,       The beauty, the mirth that were thine?     Ah, my Prince, it were well,—       Hadst thou to the gods been dear,—    To have fallen where Keppoch fell,       With the war-pipe loud in thine ear!    To have died with never a stain       On the fair White Rose of Renown,    To have fallen, fighting in vain,       For thy father, thy faith, and thy crown!    More than thy marble pile,       With its women weeping for thee,    Were to dream in thine ancient isle,       To the endless dirge of the sea!    But the Fates deemed otherwise,       Far thou sleepest from home,    From the tears of the Northern skies,       In the secular dust of Rome.                                      * * *     A city of death and the dead,       But thither a pilgrim came,    Wearing on weary head       The crowns of years and fame:    Little the Lucrine lake       Or Tivoli said to him,    Scarce did the memories wake       Of the far-off years and dim.    For he stood by Avernus’ shore,       But he dreamed of a Northern glen    And he murmured, over and o’er,       ‘_For Charlie and his men_:’    And his feet, to death that went,       Crept forth to St. Peter’s shrine,    And the latest Minstrel bent       O’er the last of the Stuart line.     FROM OMAR KHAYYAM                        RHYMED FROM THE PROSE VERSION OF                         MR. JUSTIN HUNTLY M‘CARTHY     THE Paradise they bid us fast to win    Hath Wine and Women; is it then a sin       To live as we shall live in Paradise,    And make a Heaven of Earth, ere Heaven begin?     The wise may search the world from end to end,    From dusty nook to dusty nook, my friend,       And nothing better find than girls and wine,    Of all the things they neither make nor mend.     Nay, listen thou who, walking on Life’s way,    Hast seen no lovelock of thy love’s grow grey       Listen, and love thy life, and let the Wheel    Of Heaven go spinning its own wilful way.     Man is a flagon, and his soul the wine,    Man is a lamp, wherein the Soul doth shine,       Man is a shaken reed, wherein that wind,    The Soul, doth ever rustle and repine.     Each morn I say, to-night I will repent,    Repent! and each night go the way I went—       The way of Wine; but now that reigns the rose,    Lord of Repentance, rage not, but relent.     I wish to drink of wine—so deep, so deep—    The scent of wine my sepulchre shall steep,       And they, the revellers by Omar’s tomb,    Shall breathe it, and in Wine shall fall asleep.     Before the rent walls of a ruined town    Lay the King’s skull, whereby a bird flew down       ‘And where,’ he sang, ‘is all thy clash of arms?    Where the sonorous trumps of thy renown?’     ÆSOP      HE sat among the woods, he heard       The sylvan merriment: he saw    The pranks of butterfly and bird,       The humours of the ape, the daw.     And in the lion or the frog—       In all the life of moor and fen,    In ass and peacock, stork and dog,       He read similitudes of men.     ‘Of these, from those,’ he cried, ‘we come,       Our hearts, our brains descend from these.’    And lo! the Beasts no more were dumb,       But answered out of brakes and trees:     ‘Not ours,’ they cried; ‘Degenerate,       If ours at all,’ they cried again,    ‘Ye fools, who war with God and Fate,       Who strive and toil: strange race of men.     ‘For _we_ are neither bond nor free,       For _we_ have neither slaves nor kings,    But near to Nature’s heart are we,       And conscious of her secret things.     ‘Content are we to fall asleep,       And well content to wake no more,    We do not laugh, we do not weep,       Nor look behind us and before;     ‘But were there cause for moan or mirth,       ’Tis _we_, not you, should sigh or scorn,    Oh, latest children of the Earth,       Most childish children Earth has borne.’                                      * * *     They spoke, but that misshapen slave       Told never of the thing he heard,    And unto men their portraits gave,       In likenesses of beast and bird!     LES ROSES DE SÂDI      THIS morning I vowed I would bring thee my Roses,    They were thrust in the band that my bodice encloses,    But the breast-knots were broken, the Roses went free.    The breast-knots were broken; the Roses together    Floated forth on the wings of the wind and the weather,    And they drifted afar down the streams of the sea.     And the sea was as red as when sunset uncloses,    But my raiment is sweet from the scent of the Roses,    Thou shalt know, Love, how fragrant a memory can be.     THE HAUNTED TOWER                    SUGGESTED BY A POEM OF THÉOPHILE GAUTIER     IN front he saw the donjon tall       Deep in the woods, and stayed to scan    The guards that slept along the wall,       Or dozed upon the bartizan.    He marked the drowsy flag that hung       Unwaved by wind, unfrayed by shower,    He listened to the birds that sung       _Go forth and win the haunted tower_!    The tangled brake made way for him,       The twisted brambles bent aside;    And lo, he pierced the forest dim,       And lo, he won the fairy bride!    For _he_ was young, but ah! we find,       All we, whose beards are flecked with grey,    Our fairy castle’s far behind,       We watch it from the darkling way:    ’Twas ours, that palace, in our youth,       We revelled there in happy cheer:    Who scarce dare visit now in sooth,       Le Vieux Château de Souvenir!    For not the boughs of forest green       Begird that castle far away,    There is a mist where we have been       That weeps about it, cold and grey.    And if we seek to travel back       ’Tis through a thicket dim and sere,    With many a grave beside the track,       And many a haunting form of fear.    Dead leaves are wet among the moss,       With weed and thistle overgrown—    A ruined barge within the fosse,       A castle built of crumbling stone!    The drawbridge drops from rusty chains,       There comes no challenge from the hold;    No squire, nor dame, nor knight remains,       Of all who dwelt with us of old.    And there is silence in the hall       No sound of songs, no ray of fire;    But gloom where all was glad, and all       Is darkened with a vain desire.    And every picture’s fading fast,       Of fair Jehanne, or Cydalise.    Lo, the white shadows hurrying past,       Below the boughs of dripping trees!                                      * * *     Ah rise, and march, and look not back,       Now the long way has brought us here;    We may not turn and seek the track       To the old Château de Souvenir!     BOAT-SONG      ADRIFT, with starlit skies above,       With starlit seas below,    We move with all the suns that move,       With all the seas that flow:    For, bond or free, earth, sky, and sea,       Wheel with one central will,    And thy heart drifteth on to me,       And only Time stands still.     Between two shores of death we drift,       Behind are things forgot,    Before, the tide is racing swift       To shores man knoweth not.    Above, the sky is far and cold,       Below, the moaning sea    Sweeps o’er the loves that were of old,       But thou, Love, love thou me.     Ah, lonely are the ocean ways,       And dangerous the deep,    And frail the fairy barque that strays       Above the seas asleep.    Ah, toil no more with helm or oar,       We drift, or bond or free,    On yon far shore the breakers roar,       But thou, Love, love thou me!     LOST LOVE      WHO wins his Love shall lose her,       Who loses her shall gain,    For still the spirit woos her,       A soul without a stain;    And Memory still pursues her       With longings not in vain!     He loses her who gains her,       Who watches day by day    The dust of time that stains her,       The griefs that leave her grey,    The flesh that yet enchains her       Whose grace hath passed away!     Oh, happier he who gains not       The Love some seem to gain:    The joy that custom stains not       Shall still with him remain,    The loveliness that wanes not,       The Love that ne’er can wane.     In dreams she grows not older       The lands of Dream among,    Though all the world wax colder,       Though all the songs be sung,    In dreams doth he behold her       Still fair and kind and young.     THE PROMISE OF HELEN      WHOM hast thou longed for most,       True love of mine?    Whom hast thou loved and lost?       Lo, she is thine!     She that another wed       Breaks from her vow;    She that hath long been dead       Wakes for thee now.     Dreams haunt the hapless bed,       Ghosts haunt the night,    Life crowns her living head,       Love and Delight.     Nay, not a dream nor ghost,       Nay, but Divine,    She that was loved and lost       Waits to be thine!     THE RESTORATION OF ROMANCE.                   TO H. R. H., R. L. S., A. C. D., AND S. W.     KING Romance was wounded deep,       All his knights were dead and gone,    All his court was fallen on sleep,       In a vale of Avalon!    _Nay_, men said, _he will not come_,       _Any night or any morn_.    _Nay_, _his puissant voice is dumb_,       _Silent his enchanted horn_!     King Romance was forfeited,       Banished from his Royal home,    With a price upon his head,       Driven with sylvan folk to roam.    _King Romance is fallen_, _banned_,       Cried his foemen overbold,    _Broken is the wizard wand_,       _All the stories have been told_!     Then you came from South and North,       From Tugela, from the Tweed,    Blazoned his achievements forth,       King Romance is come indeed!    All his foes are overthrown,       All their wares cast out in scorn,    King Romance hath won his own,       And the lands where he was born!     Marsac at adventure rides,       Felon men meet felon scathe,    Micah Clarke is taking sides       For King Monmouth and the Faith;    For a Cause or for a lass       Men are willing to be slain,    And the dungeons of the Bass       Hold a prisoner again.     King Romance with wand of gold       Sways the realms he ruled of yore.    Hills Dalgetty roamed of old,       Valleys of enchanted Kôr:    Waves his sceptre o’er the isles,       Claims the pirates’ treasuries,    Through innumerable miles       Of the siren-haunted seas!     Elfin folk of coast and cave,       Laud him in the woven dance,    All the tribes of wold and wave       Bow the knee to King Romance!    Wand’ring voices Chaucer knew       On the mountain and the main,    Cry the haunted forest through,       _King Romance has come again_!     CENTRAL AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES                           IN SOUTH KENSINGTON MUSEUM     ‘YOUTH and crabbed age          Cannot live together;’                   So they say.     On this little page          See you when and whether                   That they may.     Age was very old—          Stones from Chichimec                   Hardly wrung;     Youth had hair of gold          Knotted on her neck—                   Fair and young!     Age was carved with odd          Slaves, and priests that slew them—                   God and Beast;     Man and Beast and God—          There she sat and drew them,                   King and Priest!     There she sat and drew          Many a monstrous head                   And antique;     Horrors from Peru,          _Huacas_ doubly dead,                   Dead cacique!     Ere Pizarro came          These were lords of men                   Long ago;     Gods without a name,          Born or how or when,                   None may know!     Now from Yucatan          These doth Science bear                   Over seas;     And methinks a man          Finds youth doubly fair,                   Sketching these!     ON CALAIS SANDS      ON Calais Sands the grey began,       Then rosy red above the grey,    The morn with many a scarlet van       Leap’d, and the world was glad with May!    The little waves along the bay       Broke white upon the shelving strands;    The sea-mews flitted white as they                On Calais Sands!     On Calais Sands must man with man       Wash honour clean in blood to-day;    On spaces wet from waters wan       How white the flashing rapiers play,    Parry, riposte! and lunge!  The fray       Shifts for a while, then mournful stands    The Victor: life ebbs fast away                On Calais Sands!     On Calais Sands a little space       Of silence, then the plash and spray,    The sound of eager waves that ran       To kiss the perfumed locks astray,    To touch these lips that ne’er said ‘Nay,’       To dally with the helpless hands;    Till the deep sea in silence lay                On Calais Sands!     Between the lilac and the may       She waits her love from alien lands;    Her love is colder than the clay                On Calais Sands!     BALLADE OF YULE      _This life’s most jolly_, Amiens said,       Heigh-ho, the Holly!  So sang he.    As the good Duke was comforted       In forest exile, so may we!    The years may darken as they flee,       And Christmas bring his melancholy:    But round the old mahogany tree       We drink, we sing _Heigh-ho_, _the Holly_!     Though some are dead and some are fled       To lands of summer over sea,    The holly berry keeps his red,       The merry children keep their glee;    They hoard with artless secresy       This gift for Maude, and that for Molly,    And Santa Claus he turns the key       On Christmas Eve, _Heigh-ho_, _the Holly_!     Amid the snow the birds are fed,       The snow lies deep on lawn and lea,    The skies are shining overhead,       The robin’s tame that was so free.    Far North, at home, the ‘barley bree’       They brew; they give the hour to folly,    How ‘Rab and Allan cam to pree,’       They sing, we sing _Heigh-ho_, _the Holly_!    ENVOI      Friend, let us pay the wonted fee,       The yearly tithe of mirth: be jolly!    It is a duty so to be,       Though half we sigh, _Heigh-ho_, _the Holly_!     POSCIMUR                                  FROM HORACE     HUSH, for they call!  If in the shade,    My lute, we twain have idly strayed,    And song for many a season made,             Once more reply;    Once more we’ll play as we have played,             My lute and I!     Roman the song: the strain you know,    The Lesbian wrought it long ago.    Now singing as he charged the foe,             Now in the bay,    Where safe in the shore-water’s flow             His galleys lay.     So sang he Bacchus and the Nine,    And Venus and her boy divine,    And Lycus of the dusky eyne,             The dusky hair;    So shalt thou sing, ah, Lute of mine,             Of all things fair;     Apollo’s glory!  Sounding shell,    Thou lute, to Jove desirable,    When soft thine accents sigh and swell             At festival—    Delight more dear than words can tell,             Attend my call!     ON HIS DEAD SEA-MEW                                 FROM THE GREEK    I      BIRD of the graces, dear sea-mew, whose note          Was like the halcyon’s song,    In death thy wings and thy sweet spirit float          Still paths of the night along!    II THE SAILOR’S GRAVE      Tomb of a shipwrecked seafarer am I,          But thou, sail on!    For homeward safe did other vessels fly,          Though we were gone.     FROM MELEAGER      I LOVE not the wine-cup, but if thou art fain       I should drink, do thou taste it, and bring it to me;    If it touch but thy lips it were hard to refrain,       It were hard from the sweet maid who bears it to flee;    For the cup ferries over the kisses, and plain       Does it speak of the grace that was given it by thee.     ON THE GARLAND SENT TO RHODOCLEIA                                    RUFINUS    GOLDEN EYES      ‘AH, Golden Eyes, to win you yet,    I bring mine April coronet,    The lovely blossoms of the spring,    For you I weave, to you I bring    These roses with the lilies set,    The dewy dark-eyed violet,    Narcissus, and the wind-flower wet:    Wilt thou disdain mine offering?                Ah, Golden Eyes!     Crowned with thy lover’s flowers, forget    The pride wherein thy heart is set,    For thou, like these or anything,    Has but a moment of thy spring,    Thy spring, and then—the long regret!                Ah, Golden Eyes!’     A GALLOWAY GARLAND      WE know not, on these hills of ours,       The fabled asphodel of Greece,    That filleth with immortal flowers       Fields where the heroes are at peace!       Not ours are myrtle buds like these    That breathe o’er isles where memories dwell       Of Sappho, in enchanted seas!     We meet not, on our upland moor,       The singing Maid of Helicon,    You may not hear her music pure       Float on the mountain meres withdrawn;       The Muse of Greece, the Muse is gone!    But we have songs that please us well       And flowers we love to look upon.     More sweet than Southern myrtles far       The bruised Marsh-myrtle breatheth keen;    Parnassus names the flower, the star,       That shines among the well-heads green       The bright Marsh-asphodels between—    Marsh-myrtle and Marsh-asphodel       May crown the Northern Muse a queen     CELIA’S EYES                                    PASTICHE     TELL me not that babies dwell       In the deeps of Celia’s eyes;    Cupid in each hazel well       Scans his beauties with surprise,          And would, like Narcissus, drown          In my Celia’s eyes of brown.     Tell me not that any goes       Safe by that enchanted place;    Eros dwells with Anteros       In the garden of her Face,          Where like friends who late were foes          Meet the white and crimson Rose.     BRITANNIA                              FROM JULES LEMAÎTRE     THY mouth is fresh as cherries on the bough,       Red cherries in the dawning, and more white    Than milk or white camellias is thy brow;       And as the golden corn thy hair is bright,    The corn that drinks the Sun’s less fair than thou;    While through thine eyes the child-soul gazeth now—       Eyes like the flower that was Rousseau’s delight.     Sister of sad Ophelia, say, shall these    Thy pearly teeth grow like piano keys       Yellow and long; while thou, all skin and bone,    Angles and morals, in a sky-blue veil,    Shalt hosts of children to the sermon hale,       Blare hymns, read chapters, backbite, and intone?     GALLIA      LADY, lady neat       Of the roguish eye,       Wherefore dost thou hie,    Stealthy, down the street,    On well-booted feet?       From French novels I       Gather that you fly,    Guy or Jules to meet.     Furtive dost thou range,    Oft thy cab dost change;       So, at least, ’tis said:    Oh, the sad old tale    Passionately stale,       We’ve so often read!     THE FAIRY MINISTER    The Rev. Mr. Kirk of Aberfoyle was carried away by the Fairies in 1692.     PEOPLE of Peace! a peaceful man,       Well worthy of your love was he,    Who, while the roaring Garry ran       Red with the life-blood of Dundee,    While coats were turning, crowns were falling,       Wandered along his valley still,    And heard your mystic voices calling       From fairy knowe and haunted hill.    He heard, he saw, he knew too well       The secrets of your fairy clan;    You stole him from the haunted dell,       Who never more was seen of man.    Now far from heaven, and safe from hell,       Unknown of earth, he wanders free.    Would that he might return and tell       Of his mysterious Company!    For we have tired the Folk of Peace;       No more they tax our corn and oil;    Their dances on the moorland cease,       The Brownie stints his wonted toil.    No more shall any shepherd meet       The ladies of the fairy clan,    Nor are their deathly kisses sweet       On lips of any earthly man.    And half I envy him who now,       Clothed in her Court’s enchanted green,    By moonlit loch or mountain’s brow       Is Chaplain to the Fairy Queen.     TO ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON                       WITH KIRK’S ‘SECRET COMMONWEALTH’     O LOUIS! you that like them maist,    Ye’re far frae kelpie, wraith, and ghaist,    And fairy dames, no unco chaste,             And haunted cell.    Among a heathen clan ye’re placed,             That kensna hell!     Ye hae nae heather, peat, nor birks,    Nae trout in a’ yer burnies lurks,    There are nae bonny U.P. kirks,             An awfu’ place!    Nane kens the Covenant o’ Works             Frae that o’ Grace!     But whiles, maybe, to them ye’ll read    Blads o’ the Covenanting creed,    And whiles their pagan wames ye’ll feed             On halesome parritch;    And syne ye’ll gar them learn a screed             O’ the Shorter Carritch.     Yet thae uncovenanted shavers    Hae rowth, ye say, o’ clash and clavers    O’ gods and etins—auld wives’ havers,             But their delight;    The voice o’ him that tells them quavers             Just wi’ fair fright.     And ye might tell, ayont the faem,    Thae Hieland clashes o’ our hame    To speak the truth, I takna shame             To half believe them;    And, stamped wi’ _Tusitala’s_ name,             They’ll a’ receive them.     And folk to come ayont the sea    May hear the yowl o’ the Banshie,    And frae the water-kelpie flee,             Ere a’ things cease,    And island bairns may stolen be             By the Folk o’ Peace.     FOR MARK TWAIN’S JUBILEE      TO brave Mark Twain, across the sea,    The years have brought his jubilee;       One hears it half with pain,    That fifty years have passed and gone    Since danced the merry star that shone       Above the babe, Mark Twain!     How many and many a weary day,    When sad enough were we, ‘Mark’s way’       (Unlike the Laureate’s Mark’s)    Has made us laugh until we cried,    And, sinking back exhausted, sighed,       Like Gargery, _Wot larx_!     We turn his pages, and we see    The Mississippi flowing free;       We turn again, and grin    O’er all _Tom Sawyer_ did and planned,    With him of the Ensanguined Hand,       With _Huckleberry Finn_!     Spirit of mirth, whose chime of bells    Shakes on his cap, and sweetly swells       Across the Atlantic main,    Grant that Mark’s laughter never die,    That men, through many a century,       May chuckle o’er Mark Twain!     III POEMS WRITTEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF WORDSWORTH   MIST      MIST, though I love thee not, who puttest down       Trout in the Lochs, (they feed not, as a rule,       At least on fly, in mere or river-pool    When fogs have fallen, and the air is lown,    And on each Ben, a pillow not a crown,       The fat folds rest,) thou, Mist, hast power to cool       The blatant declamations of the fool    Who raves reciting through the heather brown.     Much do I bar the matron, man, or lass       Who cries ‘How lovely!’ and who does not spare    When light and shadow on the mountain pass,—       Shadow and light, and gleams exceeding fair,    O’er rock, and glade, and glen,—to shout, the Ass,       To me, to me the Poet, ‘Oh, look there!’    LINES   Written under the influence of Wordsworth, with a slate-pencil on a window of the dining-room at the Lowood Hotel, Windermere, while waiting for tea, after being present at the Grasmere Sports on a very wet day, and in consequence of a recent perusal of _Belinda_, a Novel, by Miss Broughton, whose absence is regretted.     HOW solemn is the front of this Hotel,       When now the hills are swathed in modest mist,    And none can speak of scenery, nor tell       Of ‘tints of amber,’ or of ‘amethyst.’    Here once thy daughters, young Romance, did dwell,       Here _Sara_ flirted with whoever list,    _Belinda_ loved not wisely but too well,       And _Mr. Ford_ played the Philologist!    Haunted the house is, and the balcony       Where that fond Matron knew her Lover near,    And here we sit, and wait for tea, and sigh,       While the sad rain sobs in the sullen mere,    And all our hearts go forth into the cry,       Would that the teller of the tale were here!    LINES   Written on the window pane of a railway carriage after reading an advertisement of sunlight soap, and _Poems_, by William Wordsworth.     I PASSED upon the wings of Steam       Along Tay’s valley fair,    The book I read had such a theme       As bids the Soul despair.     A tale of miserable men       Of hearts with doubt distraught,    Wherein a melancholy pen       With helpless problems fought.     Where many a life was brought to dust,       And many a heart laid low,    And many a love was smirched with lust—       I raised mine eyes, and, oh!—     I marked upon a common wall,       These simple words of hope,    That mute appeal to one and all,       _Cheer up_!  _Use Sunlight Soap_!     Our moral energies have range       Beyond their seeming scope,    How tonic were the words, how strange,       _Cheer up_!  _Use Sunlight Soap_!     ‘Behold,’ I cried, ‘the inner touch       That lifts the Soul through cares!’    I loved that Soap-boiler so much       I blessed him unawares!     Perchance he is some vulgar man,       Engrossed in £ s. d.    But, ah! through Nature’s holy plan       He whispered hope to me!    ODE TO GOLF      ‘DELUSIVE Nymph, farewell!’       How oft we’ve said or sung,    When balls evasive fell,    Or in the jaws of ‘Hell,’       Or salt sea-weeds among,    ’Mid shingle and sea-shell!     How oft beside the Burn,       We play the sad ‘two more’;    How often at the turn,    The heather must we spurn;       How oft we’ve ‘topped and swore,’    In bent and whin and fern!     Yes, when the broken head       Bounds further than the ball,    The heart has inly bled.    Ah! and the lips have said       Words we would fain recall—    Wild words, of passion bred!     In bunkers all unknown,       Far beyond ‘Walkinshaw,    Where never ball had flown—    Reached by ourselves alone—       Caddies have heard with awe    The music of our moan!     Yet, Nymph, if once alone,       The ball hath featly fled—    Not smitten from the bone—    That drive doth still atone;       And one long shot laid dead    Our grief to the winds hath blown!     So, still beside the tee,       We meet in storm or calm,    Lady, and worship thee;    While the loud lark sings free,       Piping his matin psalm    Above the grey sad sea!    FRESHMAN’S TERM      RETURN again, thou Freshman’s year,          When bloom was on the rye,    When breakfast came with bottled beer,          When Pleasure walked the High;    When Torpid Bumps were more by far          To every opening mind    Than Trade, or Shares, or Peace, or War,          To senior humankind;    When ribbons of outrageous hues          Were worn with honest pride,    When much was talked of boats and crews,          When Proctors were defied:    When Tick was in its early bloom,          When Schools were far away,    As vaguely distant as the tomb,          Nor more regarded—they!    When arm was freely linked with arm          Beneath the College limes,    When Sunday grinds possessed a charm          Denied to _College Rhymes_:    When ices were in much request          Beside the April fire,    When men were very strangely dressed          By Standen or by Prior.    Return, ye Freshman’s Terms!  They _do_          Return, and much the same,    To boys, who, just like me and you,          Play the absurd old game!    A TOAST   Kate Kennedy is the Patron Saint of St. Leonard’s and St. Salvator.  Her history is quite unknown.     THE learned are all ‘in a swither,’          (They don’t very often agree,)    They know not her ‘whence’ nor her ‘whither,’    The Maiden we drink to together,          The College’s Kate Kennedie!     Did she shine in days early or later?          Did she ever achieve a degree?    Was she pretty or plain?  Did she mate, or    Live lonely?  And who was the _pater_          Of mystical Kate Kennedie?     The learned may scorn her and scout her,          But true to her colours are _we_,    The learned may mock her and flout her,    But surely we’ll rally about her,          In the College that stands by the Sea!     So here’s to her memory! here to          The mystical Maiden drink we,    We pledge her, and we’ll persevere too,    Though the reason is not very clear to          The critical mind, nor to _me_.    Here’s to Kate! she’s our own, and she’s dear to          The College that stands by the Sea.    DEATH IN JUNE                              FOR CRICKETERS ONLY                       _June is the month of Suicides_     WHY do we slay ourselves in June,       When life, if ever, seems so sweet?    When “Moon,” and “tune,” and “afternoon,”       And other happy rhymes we meet,    When strawberries are coming soon?       Why do we do it?’ you repeat!     Ah, careless butterfly, to thee       The strawberry seems passing good;    And sweet, on Music’s wings, to flee       Amid the waltzing multitude,    And revel late—perchance till three—       For Love is monarch of thy mood!     Alas! to _us_ no solace shows       For sorrows we endure—at Lord’s,    When Oxford’s bowling _always_ goes       For ‘fours,’ for ever to the cords—    Or more, perhaps, with ‘overthrows’;—       These things can pierce the heart like swords!     And thus it is though woods are green,       Though mayflies down the Test are rolling,    Though sweet, the silver showers between,       The finches sing in strains consoling,    We cut our throats for very spleen,       And very shame of Oxford’s bowling!    TO CORRESPONDENTS      MY Postman, though I fear thy tread,       And tremble as thy foot draws nearer,    ’Tis not the Christmas Dun I dread,       _My_ mortal foe is much severer,—    The Unknown Correspondent, who,       With undefatigable pen,    And nothing in the world to do,       Perplexes literary men.     From Pentecost and Ponder’s End       They write: from Deal, and from Dacotah,    The people of the Shetlands send       No inconsiderable quota;    They write for _autographs_; in vain,       In vain does Phyllis write, and Flora,    They write that Allan Quatermain       Is not at all the book for Brora.     They write to say that they have met       This writer ‘at a garden party,    And though’ this writer ‘_may_ forget,’       _Their_ recollection’s keen and hearty.    ‘And will you praise in your reviews       A novel by our distant cousin?’    These letters from Provincial Blues       Assail us daily by the dozen!     O friends with time upon your hands,       O friends with postage-stamps in plenty,    O poets out of many lands,       O youths and maidens under twenty,    Seek out some other wretch to bore,       Or wreak yourselves upon your neighbours,    And leave me to my dusty lore       And my unprofitable labours!    BALLADE OF DIFFICULT RHYMES      WITH certain rhymes ’tis hard to deal;       For ‘silver’ we have ne’er a rhyme.    On ‘orange’ (as on orange peel)       The bard has slipped full many a time.    With ‘babe’ there’s scarce a sound will chime,       Though ‘astrolabe’ fits like a glove;    But, ye that on Parnassus climb,       Why, why are rhymes so rare to _Love_?     A rhyme to ‘cusp,’ to beg or steal,       I’ve sought, from evensong to prime,    But vain is my poetic zeal,       There’s not one sound is worth a ‘dime’:    ‘Bilge,’ ‘coif,’ ‘scarf,’ ‘window’—deeds of crime       I’d do to gain the rhymes thereof;    Nor shrink from acts of moral grime—       Why, why are rhymes so rare to _Love_?     To ‘dove’ my fancies flit, and wheel       Like butterflies on banks of thyme.    ‘Above’?—or ‘shove’—alas! I feel,       They’re too much used to be sublime.    I scorn with angry pantomime,       The thought of ‘move’ (pronounced as _muv_).    Ah, in Apollo’s golden clime       Why, why are rhymes so rare to _Love_?   ENVOI      Prince of the lute and lyre, reveal       New rhymes, fresh minted, from above,    Nor still be deaf to our appeal.       Why, _why_ are rhymes so rare to _Love_?    BALLANT O’ BALLANTRAE                           TO ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON  Written in wet weather, this conveyed to the Master of Ballantrae a wrong idea of a very beautiful and charming place, with links, a river celebrated by Burns, good sea-fishing, and, on the river, a ruined castle at every turn of the stream.  ‘Try Ballantrae’ is a word of wisdom.     WHAN suthern wunds gar spindrift flee    Abune the clachan, faddums hie,    Whan for the cluds I canna see             The bonny lift,    I’d fain indite an Ode to _thee_             Had I the gift!     Ken ye the coast o’ wastland Ayr?    Oh mon, it’s unco bleak and bare!    Ye daunder here, ye daunder there,             And mak’ your moan,    They’ve rain and wund eneuch to tear             The suthern cone!     Ye’re seekin’ sport!  There’s nane ava’,    Ye’ll sit and glower ahint the wa’    At bleesin’ breakers till ye staw,             If that’s yer wush;    ‘There’s aye the Stinchar.’  Hoot awa’,             She wunna fush!     She wunna fush at ony gait,    She’s roarin’ reid in wrathfu’ spate;    Maist like yer kimmer when ye’re late             Frae Girvan Fair!    Forbye to speer for leave I’m blate             For fushin’ there!     O Louis, you that writes in Scots,    Ye’re far awa’ frae stirks and stots,    Wi’ drookit hurdies, tails in knots,             An unco way!    _My_ mirth’s like thorns aneth the pots             In Ballantrae!    SONG BY THE SUB-CONSCIOUS SELF                             RHYMES MADE IN A DREAM     I KNOW not what my secret is,       I know but it is mine;    I know to dwell with it were bliss,       To die for it divine.    I cannot yield it in a kiss,       Nor breathe it in a sigh.    I know that I have lived for this;       For this, my love, I die.    THE HAUNTED HOMES OF ENGLAND      THE Haunted Homes of England,       How eerily they stand,    While through them flit their ghosts—to wit,       The Monk with the Red Hand,    The Eyeless Girl—an awful spook—       To stop the boldest breath,    The boy that inked his copybook,       And so got ‘wopped’ to death!     Call them not shams—from haunted Glamis       To haunted Woodhouselea,    I mark in hosts the grisly ghosts       I hear the fell Banshie!    I know the spectral dog that howls       Before the death of Squires;    In my ‘Ghosts’-guide’ addresses hide       For Podmore and for Myers!     I see the Vampire climb the stairs       From vaults below the church;    And hark! the Pirate’s spectre swears!       O Psychical Research,    Canst _thou_ not hear what meets my ear,       The viewless wheels that come?    The wild Banshie that wails to thee?       The Drummer with his drum?     O Haunted Homes of England,       Though tenantless ye stand,    With none content to pay the rent,       Through all the shadowy land,    Now, Science true will find in you       A sympathetic perch,    And take you all, both Grange and Hall,       For Psychical Research!    THE DISAPPOINTMENT      A HOUSE I took, and many a spook       Was deemed to haunt that House,    I bade the glum Researchers come       With Bogles to carouse.    That House I’d sought with anxious thought,       ’Twas old, ’twas dark as sin,    And _deeds of bale_, so ran the tale,       Had oft been done therein.     Full many a child its mother wild,       Men said, had strangled there,    Full many a sire, in heedless ire,       Had slain his daughter fair!    ’Twas rarely let: I can’t forget       A recent tenant’s dread,    This widow lone had heard a moan       Proceeding from her bed.     The tenants next were chiefly vexed       By spectres grim and grey.    A Headless Ghost annoyed them most,       And so they did not stay.    The next in turn saw corpse lights burn,       And also a Banshie,    A spectral Hand they could not stand,       And left the House to me.     Then came my friends for divers ends,       Some curious, some afraid;    No direr pest disturbed their rest       Than a neat chambermaid.    The grisly halls were gay with balls,       One melancholy nook    Where ghosts _galore_ were seen before       Now yielded ne’er a spook.     When man and maid, all unafraid,       ‘Sat out’ upon the stairs,    No spectre dread, with feet of lead,       Came past them unawares.    I know not why, but alway I       Have found that it is so,    That when the glum Researchers come       The brutes of bogeys—go!    TO THE GENTLE READER       ‘A French writer (whom I love well) speaks of three kinds of     companions,—men, women, and books.’                                                             SIR JOHN DAVYS.
