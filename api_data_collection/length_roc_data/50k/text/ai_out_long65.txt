CHAPTER ONE
The Last Letter

Blood—thick and dark—crawled from the wound in his side like some creature bent on escaping him. David Felton gritted his teeth, fighting the tremors in his hand as he dragged the pen across the warped notepaper. His breath hitched, caught in the ruins of a collapsed lung, but he refused to stop. Each letter was carved in pain, the words bleeding from him like the blood soaking the floor beneath his desk.

"They have come for me. If you're reading this, you already know too much."

The ink smudged under his fingertips. His hand faltered.

"Tell her... I'm sorry."

The pen slipped from his grasp and clattered to the hardwood floor. A final breath escaped him, sharp and sudden, like a secret he'd meant to keep but couldn't.

Outside, the wind whispered through the cracked windowpane. Somewhere in the distance, the muffled wail of sirens twisted into the night.

Three days later, Marian Cole stood on the threshold of the old house, her arms wrapped tightly around her chest. She stared up at the second-story window—the same one David had insisted they keep open, even in winter. For the ghosts, he used to say. "They hate feeling trapped."

She hadn’t spoken to him in four years.

"Are you sure you want to go in alone?" asked Eli Moran, her partner from the Bureau. He was tall, soft-eyed, and, at the moment, visibly uncomfortable in his too-tight blazer.

Marian nodded, her dark hair pulled back in a severe ponytail. "He was my friend. I need to see it."

The house smelled like mothballs and old paper. The kind of place where memory hung like smoke. Dust motes danced in the filtered sunlight as she stepped into the study, where the chalk outline still marked the spot where David's body had been found.

On the desk, untouched, was the note. The last thing he’d ever written. She picked it up with gloved hands, reading the jagged words. Something about the handwriting didn’t sit right with her—it looked forced, stuttering. Wrong.

"They have come for me."
"Tell her... I'm sorry."

"Her," Eli murmured, reading over her shoulder. "You think he meant you?"

Marian didn’t answer. She was already looking past the note, toward the edge of the desk. The bloodstains were oddly shaped, not the usual spatter. There was a pattern, almost. Not quite letters—more like symbols.

"What is this?" she whispered.

Eli crouched beside her. "You think he was trying to write something else?"

"I think he was trying to warn us."

Later that night, Marian sat alone in her apartment, the note beside her, the desk lamp burning low. She’d scanned it, enhanced it, inverted it. Nothing made the symbols make sense.

Until she remembered the book.

David’s obsession, the one that had fractured his career and their friendship. The Palinode Manuscript. An untranslatable codex found in the ruins beneath an abandoned monastery in Southern France. He’d believed it held the key to something ancient. Something buried.

They’d all laughed at him.

But now he was dead.

Marian dug through her files until she found the folder—tabbed “Palinode, David” in her cursive. She pulled out a grainy scan of one of the manuscript’s pages and held it beside the bloodstained desk photo.

The match wasn’t exact.

But close enough.

She picked up her phone and dialed.

"Emory," said a sleepy voice on the other end.

"Wake up. I need your help. David was right."

CHAPTER TWO
The Book That Shouldn’t Exist

Emory Vass was the kind of scholar who didn’t wear shoes unless he had to. He opened the door barefoot, wearing a coffee-stained sweater and holding a steaming mug in one hand and a Siamese cat in the other.

"You look terrible," he said, squinting at Marian.

"Thanks. Can I come in?"

She showed him the note, the photo, and the Palinode image. Emory blinked, set the cat down, and leaned in so close his nose nearly touched the paper.

"Where did you say you got this?"

"From David’s desk. The night he died."

Emory exhaled. "Jesus Christ. He found it. He really found it."

"Found what?"

Emory glanced over his shoulder as though the walls had ears. He gestured for her to sit and began pacing.

"You know how people say the Voynich Manuscript was a hoax? Or that it’s just gibberish? Same with the Palinode. But I’ve always believed there’s a root language underneath. A proto-script."

"Are you saying David cracked it?"

"I’m saying he got too close." Emory pulled a battered leather-bound volume from a hidden drawer. Marian’s breath caught. It was the real Palinode.

"I thought this was in storage at the National Archive."

"It was. Until it wasn't."

He flipped to a marked page. There it was—the same symbol, etched in a faded brown ink that looked uncomfortably like dried blood.

"David’s note is a match. This isn’t coincidence. This is invocation."

Marian stiffened. "Invocation of what?"

Emory didn’t answer at first. Then, in a voice low enough that the cat twitched, he said:

"Of them."

It began with the dreams.

That night, Marian woke in sweat, the sheets tangled around her legs. The same image burned in her mind: a circle of black stones, a red sky, and a sound—like whispering, but backward.

She sat up, heart pounding. On the wall, in her own handwriting, were the same symbols from David’s floor. She hadn’t written them. At least, she didn’t remember doing it.

At 3:12 AM, she called Emory.

"I think something followed me back."

Emory didn’t ask what. He just said: "Get over here. Bring salt. And iron."

By the end of the week, two more deaths were reported. Both former colleagues of David. Both found in locked rooms. Both with notes scrawled in blood, and the same stuttering message:

"They have come."

The Bureau began to take interest.

But by then, it was too late.

The language was spreading.

Through dreams. Through speech. Through writing.

Even through thought.

CHAPTER THREE
The Voice in the Ink

Agent Eli Moran was the next to succumb.

He’d always been grounded—pragmatic, unshaken. But when Marian visited him at the field office, she found him staring at a blank wall, muttering in a language she couldn’t place.

"Eli?" she said, touching his shoulder.

He didn’t blink.

"Eli, look at me."

Slowly, he turned. His eyes were red-rimmed, pupils dilated.

"You hear it too?" he whispered.

"Hear what?"

"The voice in the ink. It’s inside the letters."

And then he screamed.

By the time they institutionalized him, three more people were dead. Each linked to the manuscript, each exhibiting the same signs: insomnia, paranoia, and compulsive writing in the Palinode script.

Emory and Marian worked day and night, translating fragments. What they uncovered was a ritual. A calling.

Something ancient was being remembered.

Woken.

A name appeared again and again in the glyphs.

Halem-Yat.

Not a person. Not a god.

A concept. A mouth beneath the earth.

David hadn’t been paranoid.

He’d been trying to stop it.

And they were already too late.

Marian’s own symptoms began with small things. A ringing in her ears. Numbers rearranging themselves. Shadows moving just out of frame.

But when she woke one morning with her fingernails torn off—each one lined up beside her bed like offerings—she knew she was next.

Only one thing remained: finish David’s work. Complete the translation.

Find the ritual. Undo the invocation.

If it wasn’t already permanent.

Marian stayed at David’s house long after Eli had left. The evening light, filtered through dusty blinds, painted the study in long, amber slashes. The bloodstains were faint now, faded by time and cleaning efforts, but the weight of the room hadn't changed. It still pulsed with something—not grief, not fear exactly, but an unsettled hum beneath the surface, as if the walls remembered.

She lowered herself into David’s old leather chair. It creaked under her weight, the scent of aged paper and decaying leather rising around her. Her fingers hovered over the desk, grazing the grooves where he had scribbled so many of his notes. She remembered him hunched over this same desk in college, muttering translations to himself in six different dead languages, his coffee always going cold. He had been brilliant. And he had always been on the edge of something—not just discovery, but collapse.

She took a breath, steadying her hands. The note still lay where she'd left it, beside the faded photograph of the manuscript page. There was no doubt in her mind now that he’d been trying to write something more than a farewell. The shapes in his blood weren't random. The language, if that’s what it was, had cadence. Intent. She traced one of the bloodmarks on the photo, lips moving silently as she attempted to sound out the glyph in her mind. Nothing came. Just a vague static behind her ears and the onset of a pressure headache blooming behind her eyes.

She forced herself to focus. “If this is a message,” she murmured aloud, “then who the hell was it meant for?”

The room offered no answer.

Instead, her eyes drifted to the bookshelf in the corner—untouched, she guessed, by the investigators. David had kept everything. Marian stepped over, fingers brushing the spines: ancient texts, obscure journals, unpublished treatises in foreign alphabets. The fourth shelf housed his more recent obsessions. She recognized the titles immediately: The Ninefold Path, Enochian Variants, The Lost Dialects of Mesopotamia. Her fingers stopped on a slim black volume with no title.

Pulling it free, she flipped it open. A loose page fell out, landing at her feet.

She bent, picked it up. Not paper. Vellum. Faint ink, aged with time. But what startled her wasn't its age—it was the handwriting. Hers.

Her own writing, unmistakably hers, repeated the same symbol over and over. The one from the blood trail. The page was torn abruptly, and a final line had been scrawled at the bottom:

"I didn't mean to remember. But now it won't let me forget."

She sat back slowly, heart thumping in her chest, eyes wide.

Had she written this? When?

The air in the room seemed to change—colder, thicker.

From somewhere deep in the house, a floorboard creaked.

She turned sharply. Nothing.

But she could feel it now. Something had changed. Something had taken notice.

She stayed the night.

Not intentionally. She had meant to leave, but the weight of fatigue had anchored her in the study, curled on the old couch with David’s files spread around her. At some point, exhaustion overtook fear.

At 3:19 AM, she woke to the soft sound of whispering.

It wasn’t clear where it came from—above her, beneath her, from the pages she had left open. The words weren’t in English. They weren’t in any language she knew, yet the meaning was there, curling inside her brain like smoke.

“Don’t look away.”

The voice was inside her skull.

She sat up fast, heart racing, and all around her the room seemed to shimmer, as though seen through water. The bookshelves bent subtly inward, the shadows stretching unnaturally.

And on the wall behind the desk, new symbols had appeared. Etched into the plaster as though seared by heat. The same glyphs David had scrawled in his final moments. But now, arranged in a spiral.

Marian stood. She didn’t remember standing. Her feet moved without her consent. She approached the spiral, her breath shallow.

From the center of the glyphs, a sound began to emerge. Low at first, like the rumble of distant thunder. Then sharper. Distinct. A voice—David’s voice.

"Marian... it knows you."

She stumbled back, nearly knocking over the lamp. The light flickered, buzzed, and then flared brightly before dying with a pop. Darkness swallowed the room, save for the pale moonlight through the blinds.

She was not alone.

And whatever had begun with David’s death—it wasn’t finished.

Not even close.

When morning came, she found herself sprawled on the rug. The symbols on the wall were gone. So was the notebook. The black, titleless one that had contained her handwriting.

Only the photo remained. The blood symbols, the translation note, and a corner of the Palinode.

She didn’t call Eli. She didn’t go back to the Bureau. She knew how this would sound, and she couldn’t afford to be watched. Not yet.

Instead, she drove to the last person David had contacted before his death.

The University of Andover had a reputation for nurturing misfits. It was where David had found the Palinode. Where he had built his reputation—and lost it. Dr. Cassian DuVrey had been his mentor, colleague, and some said his handler when his theories began to slide into fringe territory.

Marian found him in the west wing of the linguistics department, hunched over a whiteboard filled with phonetic trees and undeciphered glyphs. He looked older than she remembered, face drawn, eyes ringed with fatigue. When he saw her, his expression shifted from surprise to something colder.

“I told him to stop,” DuVrey said. “Told him it would consume him. He didn’t listen.”

Marian didn’t bother with pleasantries. She set the photo and the scanned Palinode fragment on the desk.

“Did he talk to you before he died?”

DuVrey looked at the papers for a long time before answering.

“He left a message with my assistant. Something about a convergence. A return. He mentioned your name.”

Marian stiffened. “Why mine?”

“He said you were the only one who could finish the sequence.”

She blinked, mouth suddenly dry. “Sequence?”

DuVrey hesitated. Then, as though deciding it no longer mattered, he reached beneath his desk and pulled out a rolled chart—yellowed, ancient, and disturbingly familiar.

It was a map of the symbols. Arranged geometrically. In stages.

“You see,” he said, unrolling it, “it’s not just language. It’s instruction.”

“For what?” she asked, though she feared she already knew.

DuVrey looked her dead in the eye.

“For opening a door that was sealed before humanity was born.”

Back in her car, Marian sat with the chart spread across the passenger seat. Her hands trembled on the steering wheel.

She whispered the name to herself—Halem-Yat. It wasn’t a name meant for speaking, but it had already burrowed inside her. She felt it behind her eyes when she blinked. Felt it in her jaw when she clenched her teeth.

There was no going back.

Whatever David had started, it had infected her. And the only way to survive was to go forward.

To finish the sequence.

To find the door.

And pray she didn’t open it.

CHAPTER TWO
The Geometry of Madness

The rain had already soaked through Marian’s coat by the time she reached Emory’s flat. A three-story walk-up wedged between a defunct record store and a pawn shop that never opened its door more than halfway, his place always smelled of incense, old wool, and something vaguely metallic. It was dim when he opened the door, the only light coming from a salt lamp glowing in the kitchen and a single, trembling candle on the floor of his living room, surrounded by a circle of iron nails.

“You look like you’ve seen a revenant,” he said, voice dry as ever. “Or worse—a tenure committee.”

She stepped inside, shedding her coat. “Close. Something spoke to me last night. I think it used David’s voice.”

Emory didn’t smile, didn’t make a quip. Instead, he motioned her toward a folding chair opposite his cluttered workstation. Books and yellowed scrolls were stacked high, and the screen of his laptop glowed with an image Marian couldn’t quite place—part code, part map, part waveform.

“I’m not going to lie,” he said, “this got worse a lot faster than I expected.”

“You expected this?”

“I expected symptoms. Maybe localized insanity, maybe a breakdown in cognition. What I didn’t expect was structure.” He tapped a paper with his pen—another copy of the symbol Marian had seen so many times now. “These aren’t just glyphs. They’re coordinates. Spatial and auditory. They correspond to pressure points in the brain—areas associated with memory, perception, even language processing. You don’t just read this script, Marian. You hear it. And when you hear it, something hears you back.”

Marian leaned forward, the pit in her stomach deepening. “DuVrey said the symbols were instructions. You’re saying it’s more than that?”

“Think of it like a lock. A multidimensional lock. And the language isn’t just the key—it’s the hand that turns it.”

She hesitated before speaking. “What happens when it opens?”

Emory looked at her for a long moment. “There are some doors that were closed for a reason. This—” he lifted the Palinode page—“this one is a prison. Or maybe a cage. And someone’s been rattling it from the inside.”

They worked through the night. Emory poured over his phonetic models and comparative syntax charts while Marian cross-referenced David’s translations with field notes from the original excavation of the manuscript. The more they decoded, the more it became apparent that the symbols were layered—each one containing not just sound, but conceptual echoes. Fragments of memory, half-formed urges. It wasn’t just a language—it was a psychic virus, one that rewrote the mind like a computer reprogrammed through whispered command lines.

At some point, they stopped talking.

Outside, the storm escalated. Wind howled through the cracked window frames, and at 4:36 AM, the power cut out.

The apartment went black, save for the flickering candlelight and the glow of the salt lamp.

That was when the sound began.

Not loud. A hiss. Like breath through teeth.

It came from nowhere—and everywhere. Marian froze, eyes wide. Emory sat still, head cocked like a man trying to locate the source of a noise that wasn’t really external.

Then, without a word, he stood up and crossed to the mirror on the far wall.

It was covered in post-it notes and string maps, but through the gaps, Marian saw his reflection—and something else.

Something that wasn’t Emory.

It looked like him—same height, same face. But its eyes were bottomless, obsidian pits, and its mouth never moved, even as the sound grew louder. The hiss became a chant—low, rhythmic, incomprehensible.

Marian stumbled back, knocking over a stack of books. Emory didn’t move.

“Emory,” she whispered, but it wasn’t her voice that left her mouth. It was deeper, detached, as though someone else had borrowed her throat.

The figure in the mirror turned and looked directly at her.

And smiled.

The glass cracked.

The lights returned.

Emory collapsed.

He was alive, but barely.

Marian called no one. Instead, she dragged him onto the couch, wrapped him in blankets, and waited. When he woke hours later, his face was pale and clammy, his pupils still dilated. He whispered one word:

“Coordinates.”

Then he passed out again.

She found the note clenched in his hand, written in his own shaky scrawl:

43° 42' 18" N, 7° 16' 18" E

She typed the coordinates into her phone and waited as the map resolved. The location was in Southern France—just outside Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Mountains, ruins, old Roman watchtowers. And something else.

A dig site.

The same one where David had found the Palinode twenty years earlier.

Marian didn’t hesitate. She packed a bag, booked the next available flight, and left without telling the Bureau. She knew they were watching her now anyway. She’d seen the same black sedan parked across the street three days in a row. Knew the pattern. They probably thought she was grieving. Or unraveling.

They weren’t wrong.

By the time she landed in Nice, the sun was just rising over the sea, and her dreams were already beginning to infect her waking thoughts. The symbols followed her now. In coffee foam, in cracks on the sidewalk, in the branching patterns of trees against the sky.

She rented a car and drove north. The road twisted through narrow mountain passes and olive groves, past crumbling aqueducts and abandoned monasteries. Every mile took her further from safety—and deeper into the mystery that had killed David.

Just before noon, she arrived.

The dig site was barely recognizable.

Overgrown, fenced off, and entirely unstaffed. She parked on the edge of the access road and climbed over the sagging fence. The ground was uneven, the scaffolding rusted. Wind howled through half-covered pits where marble fragments still jutted from the soil.

At the center of the site, beneath a faded tarp, she found the entrance to the underground chamber David had described in his journals.

The stone door was still there.

Ten feet high, five wide, carved with a spiral of symbols that shimmered in the corner of her eye but blurred when she looked directly at them.

She pressed her hand to it.

It was warm.

And then she heard it.

A voice. Not David’s this time. Not her own.

Something older. Something immense.

A wordless invitation.

She fell to her knees, heart hammering, vision swimming.

In that moment, she understood the truth:

The door had never been closed.

It had always been waiting.

And someone—something—was ready to come through.

The sensation of the stone against her palm was not like touching rock at all. It pulsed faintly beneath her skin, as if it were breathing—or as if something just beyond it was. Marian drew her hand back, breath catching in her throat, and stepped away, forcing herself to look at the spiral of glyphs with more intent. They twisted in ways the human eye wasn’t built to follow; her gaze was constantly being pulled outward even as her mind tried to focus inward, a kind of spatial dissonance that made her stomach churn.

She reached into her satchel and pulled out the notes—David’s symbols, the chart DuVrey had given her, and Emory’s phonetic extrapolations. On impulse, she pressed the paper to the door. Nothing happened at first. Then, slowly, one by one, several of the carved glyphs on the stone began to glow with a dull red light, faint like the embers of a dying fire. A hum began to vibrate through the ground, rising through her feet into her bones.

It wasn’t just light—it was recognition.

The door was responding.

Marian backed away further, now clutching the chart to her chest. She needed to think. To prepare. To understand what came next. Every instinct in her body screamed that to proceed now, in haste or panic, was to fall into the very trap David must have tried to warn her about.

She made camp at the edge of the site, not trusting the nearby crumbling town, nor the few wandering faces she had seen on the drive up—silent locals who stared too long, as if they knew what she was and what she was carrying. That night, she lit a small fire and reviewed every piece of paper in her possession.

It was then she found the hidden notation.

Tucked between two pages of David’s handwritten journal was a slip of transparent vellum, nearly invisible against the larger papers. On it was a diagram, faint and meticulously drawn: the spiral from the stone, overlaid with what looked like a star chart. A rough alignment of celestial bodies—Mars, Saturn, and something else, a dark circle with no label.

She checked the date scribbled beneath the chart.

June 9th, 2025.

Tomorrow.

David had known the door could be opened. He had known when. And, she now understood, he had known who would have to open it.

Her.

She slept little that night, curled against the stone wall of a collapsed outbuilding. In her dreams, she stood before the door again. This time, it was open.

What waited beyond was not fire or shadow, but a vast, endless room filled with mirrors. In each, a version of herself stared back—some smiling, some weeping, some with empty eye sockets. In the center of the room stood a single shape, robed and faceless, its hands folded in prayer or restraint. It turned toward her, and though it had no face, she felt it smile.

When she woke, the fire was out and her satchel had been opened. The papers had been moved.

But no one else was there.

The sun rose slowly over the hills, casting long golden light across the ruined stones. Marian approached the door again at dawn. The symbols were no longer glowing, but her hand tingled as she drew close, as though the connection persisted just below the surface.

She laid out the vellum diagram across the grass, pinning the corners with stones, and checked the alignment against her phone’s star chart. Everything matched. The sky had arranged itself. Whatever power had been locked behind the door—whatever had first whispered to David—was awake again.

She began to trace the symbols in sequence. According to Emory’s analysis, pronunciation mattered less than intention. Each glyph was a gate in itself, a conceptual lock that had to be opened with not only sound but focus, belief, and memory. She drew breath, and began.

The first word she spoke felt like a hook behind her sternum. The air warped around her, shimmering like heat rising off asphalt. The second brought a wave of vertigo, and for a moment she thought she saw the landscape around her fracture—lines spreading across the horizon, as if reality itself were a pane of glass beginning to splinter.

By the fifth word, her nose had begun to bleed.

Still, she pressed on.

With the final glyph, a guttural syllable that scraped the throat raw, the spiral on the door shimmered and then slowly began to retract. Stone scraped against stone, echoing across the valley like thunder. Dust poured from the cracks as the center of the door slid inward, revealing a narrow stairway descending into darkness.

A cold wind exhaled from the opening, smelling of earth, rot, and something older—something metallic and sweet, like copper on the tongue.

Marian stood frozen.

She thought of David, of his last words. Of the message written in blood.

"They have come for me."

No, she thought now. That wasn’t a warning to her. It was a statement of fact. They had already arrived.

This door—this ritual—it was never meant to keep something out.

It was built to let something in.

The descent took nearly an hour.

The passage narrowed and widened at intervals, the steps uneven and slick with moisture. Strange fungi grew along the walls, some faintly glowing, others pulsing with rhythmic bioluminescence. At one point, she passed what appeared to be a set of carvings—human figures kneeling in supplication, their heads bowed toward a central shape that had been carefully chiseled away.

Something had erased it. Something that didn’t want its form remembered.

Finally, the stairway ended in a vast chamber.

It wasn’t a tomb. It wasn’t a temple.

It was a library.

Or what was left of one.

Shelves, impossibly tall, rose up into darkness, filled with decaying tomes and bound stacks of parchment. In the center stood a pedestal, and on it, a single book.

She approached, heart in her throat.

The cover was the same dark leather as the pages she had seen in David’s collection. The spine was broken. The cover unmarked.

But when she opened it, the first page was blank.

And then, words began to write themselves.

She watched, horrified, as her name appeared across the top of the page—Marian E. Cole—and below it, a paragraph of dense script, shifting and reforming as she read. The words described her. Her arrival. Her thoughts. Her fear.

The book was writing her.

She slammed it shut, breathing hard. Behind her, something stirred in the shadows. A scrape. A shuffle.

She turned, every muscle coiled for flight.

From the far side of the room, something moved.

Not a person. Not quite.

It crawled, awkwardly, as if unused to form. It had too many joints. Its skin was translucent, revealing bones that didn’t match human anatomy.

Its face was an approximation of one she recognized.

David’s.

But wrong.

Wrong in subtle ways—eyes too wide, lips too flat. As if something had studied him, worn him like a garment, and forgotten a few details.

It spoke in a voice that wasn’t sound, but memory—her own memory of David, twisted and filtered.

“You brought it with you,” it said, though its mouth did not move.

Marian stepped back, clutching the book. “What are you?”

The thing tilted its head, curious. “We are what came before. What language remembers. What speaks through the written word when the tongue is no longer enough.”

The shadows around it quivered.

“Why me?” she asked.

“Because you listened.”

It lunged.

Marian turned and ran.

CHAPTER THREE
Echoes and Mouths

She didn’t remember how she got out.

One moment she was sprinting through the darkness, pursued by a half-formed imitation of David, the next she was stumbling into the harsh sunlight at the mouth of the stairway, her lungs heaving like bellows, her legs covered in scrapes and dirt. The book was still clutched under one arm, though she had no recollection of picking it up. Her coat was torn along the back, three long rips in the fabric like claw marks.

Behind her, the door had sealed itself again. The spiral of symbols on the stone was no longer glowing, but her fingers still burned as though the pattern had etched itself beneath her skin.

She vomited beside the ruins and fell to her knees, dry heaving until her vision blurred. Her brain felt raw. Not like a headache—worse. Like something had been inserted behind her thoughts, some parasitic rhythm that repeated behind every idea, every memory.

When she looked at her reflection in the dusty screen of her phone, she didn’t quite recognize her own face. Her eyes seemed too sharp. Her skin, too still.

She checked the date. June 9th.

It was still the same day.

But it felt like she had been down there for years.

That evening she drove to the coast.

The narrow roads twisted past silent hills and broken stone walls. The locals she passed on the way did not wave, did not speak. Some did not blink. A man in a straw hat stood at the edge of a vineyard, facing the setting sun with his back straight and arms hanging stiff at his sides, like he was waiting to be called inward.

She didn’t stop.

Instead, she checked into a cheap pensione under a false name and spent the evening barricading her door with a chair, her suitcase, and two side tables. She didn’t trust the lock. She didn’t trust the building. She didn’t even trust herself.

The book sat on the bed beside her. Still blank.

She thought of burning it. Leaving it in a trash can or tossing it into the sea. But she knew—somehow, with the same certainty one has in dreams—that it would find its way back to her. It already had.

Instead, she flipped to the first page.

New text had appeared. Again, it was her own name at the top. But this time, the paragraph had changed.

It didn’t describe her.

It described the thing that had followed her out.

She read the words slowly, haltingly. The language kept shifting, sometimes English, sometimes something older and wetter, like ancient root sounds not meant for vocal cords. But the meaning pushed through.

It wore his memory like skin. It remembered the echo of being flesh. And it was hungry for definition.

She turned the page.

Another entry. Shorter this time.

The reader becomes the mouth.

She slammed the book shut and shoved it into her satchel.

She wouldn’t sleep.

She couldn’t afford to.

At 2:03 AM, her phone lit up with a message.

It was from Emory.

They found me. I didn’t speak it. I didn’t speak it. They still came.

Attached was a single audio file.

She stared at it for a long time before pressing play.

The recording was ten seconds of silence.

Then: a whisper. Low. So low she had to press the phone to her ear.

Not words.

A sound.

And yet, it said everything.

She dropped the phone. Her ears were ringing.

In the hallway, the lights went out.

Something shuffled past her door.

Not footsteps. A sliding motion. Flesh on tile.

She held her breath, muscles tense.

There was a pause.

Then came a soft knock.

She didn’t answer.

She waited hours, breath shallow, body still, until the sun filtered through the shutters and the light finally chased whatever it was back into whatever crack it had come from.

When she opened the door, the hallway was empty.

But etched into the wood were the symbols again.

Wider now.

Spread like a mouth.

By noon she was back on the road, driving inland, away from the coast and the sea and the strange lull that had begun to settle over everything. The air smelled different. Trees no longer rustled with the wind but with a low murmur like conversation. In every village she passed, there was one person standing stock still in the center of the square, staring at nothing.

The infection wasn’t metaphorical. It wasn’t supernatural, not in the religious sense.

It was linguistic.

Viral.

Whatever language the Palinode had encoded, it didn’t just describe reality.

It rewrote it.

She stopped in a town called Esclaron, a pale collection of stone houses and weathered archways that looked centuries removed from the modern world. There was a chapel at its heart, abandoned and roofless, its floor layered with dead leaves and forgotten prayers. She stepped inside, drawn not by faith but a hunch, and found what she didn’t expect: signs of a ritual.

Salt circles, iron dust, pages nailed to the pulpit with symbols scrawled in red ink—or perhaps blood. She examined one of the pages. It was written in the same shifting script. Beneath the glyphs, a human hand had written a single sentence in frantic, almost childlike print.

DON’T READ ALOUD. DON’T EVEN THINK IT.

A sound behind her.

She spun, heart leaping.

No one.

But in the far corner of the chapel was a mirror—standing, untouched by time, cracked once across its center.

She approached it slowly.

Her reflection looked back.

And smiled.

She stayed in Esclaron for three nights, studying the writings in the chapel and cross-referencing them with the Palinode. A pattern began to form. The language wasn’t just descriptive—it was performative. Every word spoken aloud activated a piece of the sequence. But even unspoken, even thought or written, the glyphs acted like software code. They could be executed by the mind alone.

What David had found wasn’t a book. It was a spell written in a forgotten syntax.

And she had already begun casting it.

On the third night, someone knocked on her door again.

This time, when she looked through the peephole, no one was there.

But the handle was slowly turning on its own.

She fled through the back window, abandoning the room.

It wasn’t safe anywhere anymore.

Not while she carried the book.

Not while the words still echoed in her skull.

Emory’s messages stopped after that.

His phone went dead. His email bounced back.

She tried calling DuVrey.

No answer.

She called the Bureau, finally, desperate, and reached Eli.

His voice sounded wrong.

Off.

As if something was stretching it from underneath.

“Marian,” he said, too slowly, “we’ve been waiting for you.”

She ended the call and threw the phone into a river.

There could be no more contact.

She had to finish what David started.

Even if it meant walking straight into whatever was waiting at the end of the sequence.

Even if she had to speak the final word.

And become the mouth.

The further Marian traveled inland, the less things made sense. Roads that didn’t appear on maps curled like ribs across the hills. Trees grew in unnatural rows, too symmetrical to be accidental, but too ancient to be planned. She passed through towns with no names, no signs, where every shop was closed and every house shuttered. She saw children watching her from behind curtains with eyes too still, expressions too blank. A dog barked once at her passing, then lay down in the road and didn’t move again.

She began to doubt the concept of distance. Her car’s fuel gauge remained steady for far longer than it should have. She checked it twice, then again. The needle hadn’t moved in seventy kilometers. Either the gauge was broken, or something else was warping her perception. The car hummed beneath her hands with a kind of low-frequency hum she couldn’t place. Once, in the rearview mirror, she saw her own face blink—just a moment too slowly—and her heart stopped. When she turned to look behind her, no one was there.

It was late afternoon when she saw the sign. Not road signage—this one was carved into a standing stone just off the roadside, half-swallowed by tall grass. A symbol. One she had seen before. On the book. On the chapel walls. In her dreams.

The Mouth.

Below it, in English, were three words etched crudely by human hands.

DO NOT ENTER.

She stopped the car and stepped out. The wind was still. Too still. The air held the dry crackle of premonition. Somewhere ahead, through the trees, she could see what looked like ruins—jagged, stone fragments emerging from the earth like old bones. She should have turned back.

But of course, she didn’t.

The path was overgrown and winding. Whatever road had once connected the ruins to civilization had long since surrendered to the forest. Vines and bramble caught at her jacket, the undergrowth thick and fragrant with decay. Her boots sank into soft, uneven ground. And all the while, the trees leaned closer. It wasn’t her imagination—they were curving inward, forming a canopy so tight the sky was swallowed entirely. The air turned damp. The silence became oppressive.

She emerged into a clearing.

The structure ahead had no clear purpose. Part shrine, part amphitheater, it was composed of concentric rings of broken stone, descending like a bowl toward a flat, circular altar in the center. No roof. No signs of life. But Marian felt it immediately—the pull.

The book vibrated inside her bag.

She stepped down carefully, the stone slick with moss and lichen. As she descended, her ears filled with a low resonance, like someone humming a note too deep to hear, too large to belong to any voice.

At the altar stood a figure.

It did not move when she approached. Its robe was tattered and too long, pooling around its feet. Its face was covered by a mask of polished stone, featureless except for a narrow vertical slit where the mouth should have been.

“Marian Cole,” the figure said, though it did not move. The voice came from all around her. “You carry the book.”

“Who are you?” she asked, her voice dry from the long silence.

“We are the threshold,” it said.

“Threshold to what?”

“To the remainder. To the echo that preceded your species and will follow after.”

It raised one hand, palm outward, and the symbols along the altar stones began to glow—faint at first, then pulsing with a cadence that matched her heartbeat. She could feel it in her teeth.

“You have been read,” it continued, “and thus you are read into being. Your pattern has been recognized. Your voice is sufficient.”

“I didn’t ask for this.”

“No one asks,” the figure said. “The language selects. The word seeks a mouth. And now it has found one.”

The book in her satchel snapped open on its own.

Pages turned rapidly, riffling like a fan in an invisible wind until it settled on a page she had never seen.

On it was her name again, but beneath it, a new sequence—a set of phrases she couldn’t translate, yet understood immediately. A command. A ritual.

She shook her head. “I won’t.”

“You already are,” said the voice. “To read is to begin. To speak is to continue. There is no end but silence.”

The figure extended its arm toward her. “Finish the utterance. Complete the cycle. We are waiting.”

Behind her, the forest groaned.

She turned and saw them.

Figures, dozens of them, emerging from the trees—men and women, children and elders, all silent, all watching. Their eyes were hollow. Not in appearance—in presence. Like something essential had been stripped from behind their gaze. They were husks, each one marked with a symbol on their forehead, glowing faintly beneath the skin.

She backed away.

“Leave me alone,” she whispered.

“You are never alone,” the voice said. “You are read. You are known. The language does not forget its speakers.”

Suddenly, the book in her hand ignited—not with flame, but with light. A harsh, white brilliance that seared the edges of her vision. She screamed and dropped it, but the light did not fade.

In the clearing, the air thickened.

She heard it then.

The Word.

The one buried beneath all language.

A syllable made of breath, hunger, and memory.

And she understood.

Not just its shape, but its purpose.

To call something. To open not a door, but a wound in the fabric of reality itself. A crack through which the rest of it could slip.

The Mouth.

The original speaker.

It wasn’t a being. It wasn’t even conscious. It was the echo that came after the first word, and it would consume all that followed.

She did the only thing she could.

She ran.

The next days were a blur.

She traveled mostly on foot, moving from ruin to ruin, hideout to hideout. The world was coming apart in slow, quiet ripples. A man she passed in a petrol station was writing with his own blood, calm as a monk. In a village square, a woman stood with her mouth open and did not move, even as insects crawled in and out of her throat.

Everywhere she went, she saw the signs.

The infection was no longer localized. It had spread.

And it wasn’t just affecting minds—it was warping space. Buildings twisted subtly when unobserved. Her maps contradicted themselves. Clocks ticked backward. She passed the same bent tree three times, though she walked in a straight line.

She stopped sleeping.

The dreams weren’t safe.

Each one brought her closer to the center of the spiral.

Each one ended with the word on her lips.

She could feel it now, just behind her teeth.

Waiting.

Pressing against the back of her thoughts like a tongue probing for loose enamel.

Her phone was long gone. Her satchel torn. The book was still with her—she had tried to leave it behind, to bury it in a ditch, but it reappeared at her side within the hour.

In one abandoned church, she scrawled across the altar with a charred stick: DO NOT SPEAK.

But she knew it wouldn’t help.

She was the last speaker.

And the Mouth was hungry.

By the time Marian reached the city of Carcassonne, she no longer trusted time. The sky had adopted a sickly, bruised hue that didn’t change with the passing of hours. The sun seemed stuck behind a veil of gauze-like clouds, sometimes pulsing instead of rising or falling. Her watch had stopped ticking two days ago. When she checked the clock in the railway station’s plaza, the hands spun constantly, not around the center but in small, erratic loops, as if they no longer understood how to mark the passage of moments.

She needed people. Not to speak to—speech was dangerous now—but to observe, to measure herself against them, to test whether she was still human or only seemed to be. Carcassonne, however, was empty in a way that defied explanation. The streets were swept, the café chairs aligned outside closed shops, and the smell of baking still lingered faintly in the air. But not a soul moved. Not even birds or insects. The silence was so thick it crushed her ears like pressure on a diving bell.

She walked past the massive stone ramparts of the old citadel, her boots echoing against the cobbled streets like thunderclaps. She half-expected the city to rise against her—statues to turn, shadows to stand—but nothing did. Only the hum persisted, that low vibration in her skull, the presence of the word that now sat just behind her tongue, patient and predatory.

In the shadow of the central tower, she found writing—chalk scrawled across the cobblestones in hurried, looping spirals. It was human, frantic, overlapping. She dropped to her knees, brushing away dirt and leaves to reveal the message underneath.

I didn’t speak it. I didn’t speak it. I didn’t—

And beneath that, a symbol.

The Mouth.

Someone else had been here. Someone had stood where she was, felt the pressure she now carried, and tried to hold it back. But they were gone. Only the words remained. That was the nature of this contagion—its vessels vanished, but their echoes remained, etched into the world like scarring.

She sat against the cold stone wall, knees pulled to her chest, eyes darting over the ancient masonry, trying to piece together her next step. She needed answers. Not just to the origin of the Palinode, but to how it had survived. Someone had carried this thing for centuries, hidden it, buried it in ink and symbol, suppressed its utterance. It had almost been forgotten. Almost.

The realization landed like ice in her spine: someone wanted it remembered.

This wasn’t accidental. David hadn’t just stumbled upon something buried. He had been drawn to it, manipulated by it, like a page in the book slowly filling with text.

She stood abruptly. A name stirred in her memory. Not Emory. Not DuVrey. Someone older. A reference David had made once in passing, dismissed at the time as conspiracy.

Jules Halberg.

A theologian and linguistic cryptographer who had vanished in 1978 after publishing a single paper: Liminal Architecture in Pre-Language Structures. David had worshipped the man’s work in his early years, but later grown disillusioned, saying that Halberg “had gone too deep and brought something back.”

There was a note in David’s journal, something scribbled on the margin of a translation page.

"Halberg: Serre de la Lauze. Pyrenees. Page 89."

She retrieved the journal from her bag and flipped to the page. It showed an incomplete translation and, below it, coordinates. Rough, but traceable.

Serre de la Lauze. A monastery ruin halfway up a mountain slope. Practically unreachable by road, and not marked on any recent maps.

If Halberg had gone into hiding there, it wasn’t to escape the world.

It was to silence himself.

The journey into the Pyrenees was agonizing. Her car gave out halfway to the foothills, the engine coughing like a man choking on smoke before finally dying. She abandoned it near a dead orchard and began the trek on foot, the journal and book wrapped in plastic and strapped to her back with rope. The forest thickened as she climbed, paths dissolving into wild underbrush, snow still lingering in the northern shadows. Her legs trembled. Her teeth chattered. The word burned in her skull, eager for escape, pushing itself into her thoughts like an animal clawing at a trap door.

She fought it back with focus. Repetition. Memory.

She recited the periodic table in reverse. Sang the theme song to old cartoons. Counted prime numbers until her lips bled.

Anything to keep the word at bay.

By the second day, she found the monastery.

Or what remained of it.

The outer wall stood half-collapsed, overgrown with ivy and moss, flanked by cracked gargoyles whose faces had been chipped away—as if deliberately defaced. The main building’s roof had caved in, but the nave still stood. She passed through a heavy wooden door reinforced with rusting iron bands and found herself in a long corridor lined with alcoves, each one filled with fragments of books, candles, and bowls of dried herbs. It had the feel of a shrine—but not one built in reverence. It was a ward. A defense.

Someone had tried very hard to keep something in.

A rusted bell hung in the center of the main chamber, suspended from a skeletal frame of scorched beams. Beneath it was a bedroll, dusty and collapsed inward as if its occupant had disintegrated into air. Scattered around it were notebooks—dozens of them, leather-bound, each one stamped on the spine with a name.

Halberg.

Marian knelt and picked one at random.

The writing inside was erratic, alternating between Latin, French, and a form of script she barely recognized. Most of it was indecipherable, full of personal symbols and abbreviations. But in the back, she found a series of drawings—diagrams of the mouth-symbol, embedded into other symbols, forming matrices of power. Interlocking. Expanding.

There was one note repeated often in Halberg’s uneven hand.

The word is recursive. Speaking it once is speaking it forever.

She shivered. Then she turned the page and saw something that stopped her heart.

A sketch of a woman.

Her.

Drawn in black ink, the lines crude but unmistakable.

She flipped the page. Another sketch—her standing before the stone door. And another—her kneeling beside a shallow pool. In the margins: The mouth must find a new shape. The old vessel failed.

She dropped the notebook.

Suddenly, the bell above her groaned.

It swayed once, though no wind moved through the ruin. The air thickened. The shadows around the alcoves shifted.

Marian turned in time to see the edges of the room warp, bend inward like the closing of an eye.

From behind the altar, something rose.

It wore robes like the figure at the ruins. Its face was wrapped in cloth. No mouth. But she could feel it speaking.

No sound.

Only presence.

She staggered back.

The figure pointed toward the scattered notebooks.

She understood.

Halberg hadn’t just studied the Word.

He had rewritten it.

Fractured it.

Tried to break its recursion, to shatter the loop.

One notebook held the key.

She had to find it.

Before the Word found her.

CHAPTER FOUR
The Broken Glyph

The notebooks were brittle with age, their edges frayed, pages flecked with mildew and ash. Marian moved through them methodically, laying each one open across the cracked stone floor, skimming through the arcane scribblings for a pattern. Most contained more of the same—the spiraling symbols, references to “recursive iterations,” and scrawled diagrams of mouths drawn with unsettling anatomical detail. Others were nothing but madness: sentences looping endlessly, sketches of gaping voids, marginalia that read like confessions from someone being devoured from the inside out.

The wind outside had picked up. It howled through the broken windows and whipped down the monastery corridor with a low moan, like the earth itself was mourning. The figure that had appeared to her earlier had vanished, but its absence was not comfort. It had not left—it had withdrawn, retreated into a layer of perception just out of reach. She felt its presence in the walls, in the stones, in the ink of Halberg’
