Whispers of the Wandering Wood
Chapter One: The Glimmer in the Bramble

The Bramblewood was older than the bones of the mountains that loomed behind it. Its trees gnarled and twisted like the thoughts of dreaming gods, their roots threading deep into a soil thick with stories never told aloud. Sunlight never dared to fully pierce the canopy, instead spilling through in fractured beams, soft as sighs. The forest breathed. It remembered.

And somewhere in its forgotten folds, a pixie named Nettle spun magic like a spider weaves silk.

She was not large, even by pixie standards, no taller than a sprig of lavender in bloom. Her wings, veined like frost on a windowpane, shimmered with colors that changed depending on the hour — at dawn, pink; at dusk, a bruised violet. Nettle’s eyes were too large for her face, giving her an expression that seemed forever on the edge of knowing too much. Her hair, a wind-tangled riot of moss and black curls, always smelled faintly of flint and rain.

Most pixies were capable of a trick or two — a glimmer to mislead, a whisper to misplace a hunter’s path. But Nettle? Nettle once turned a falling star into a lantern, just to light the inside of her tree-stump cottage for tea. Magic loved her, clung to her, circled her like moths to a flame that never burned. She was, as the older fae whispered behind the leaves, touched.

And as with all touched things, she was a little... odd.

Nettle’s cottage was hidden in the heart of a hollow oak. The door, a slab of beetle-polished bark, opened to a cozy room lined with shelves that hummed. Not metaphorically — they hummed, the spellbooks too saturated with old enchantments to stay quiet. The walls were covered in a hundred clocks, none of which told the right time but all of which chimed in peculiar unison when the mood struck them. Potions bubbled of their own accord, and the fireplace roared when someone told a particularly scandalous secret.

On this particular morning, which may or may not have been a Tuesday, Nettle stood before her cauldron and frowned.

“Too much ashroot,” she muttered. “Or not enough lieberry. Depends on whether I want it to fly or explode.”

“Perhaps both?” a voice offered helpfully.

Nettle turned to see a raven — or something dressed like one — perched on her window ledge. It wore a hat, which was the first clue that it wasn’t entirely of the bird persuasion.

“Grack,” she said. “You again.”

“Don’t sound so delighted. I brought news.” The raven-creature preened its feathers, which were in fact smoke made solid.

Nettle’s brow arched. “What kind of news?”

“The kind that crawls through roots and shivers through leaves. Something is stirring in the deepwood. Something old.”

She paused, stirring her potion counterclockwise, then clockwise again, then backwards in time. “Old things stir all the time. The Deepwood’s practically a retirement home for ancient evils.”

“Not like this,” Grack replied. “This one’s waking up with purpose.”

There was a long silence. The potion thickened. A single bubble rose, popped, and from it escaped a tiny sound like a trumpet playing a dirge.

Finally, Nettle sighed. “Fine. I’ll have a look.”

The journey to the Deepwood’s heart was not one taken lightly. Even for those born of magic, it was a place where reality folded like paper and secrets took shape in the fog. Nettle packed carefully: a pouch of truths (distilled, not fermented), a bottle of moonlight, a dagger carved from regret, and a biscuit.

The biscuit was for morale.

She flew low, darting between roots and hollows, careful not to disturb the sleeping stones. The deeper she went, the quieter the world became, as though even sound was wary of trespassing.

Then she heard it — not a noise exactly, but the absence of noise. A silence so absolute it had weight.

And in that silence stood a tree.

It was black. Not charred, not dark — black, like the color had been siphoned from every other thing and poured into this shape. It pulsed faintly, as though breathing. At its base, half-swallowed by moss, was a door. Not bark, not wood — stone, old and carved with sigils that curled and shifted when she tried to read them.

“Grack,” she whispered.

He was already beside her. “Told you.”

“This tree shouldn’t be here.”

“It wasn’t. Until it was.”

Nettle circled the door warily. “Do you think it’s a prison?”

Grack didn’t answer immediately. “If it is, something’s already loose.”

Back in the village of Thistledown Hollow, gossip fluttered like moths in the twilight. The elder pixies had noticed the signs: mushrooms blooming upside down, rivers running in loops, shadows refusing to match their owners. And all of it pointed to one conclusion — the Seal was weakening.

The Seal, according to fae lore, was forged in the First Silence — a time before song, before magic. It kept Hollowroot asleep.

And Hollowroot, in turn, had teeth.

Nettle returned home shaken. Not afraid, exactly. She didn’t really do fear the same way others did. But the air tasted different. Things long dead were whispering again.

The next day, she received a visitor.

He arrived on the back of a dragonfly the size of a sheep, wearing robes that sparkled like dew on a spiderweb. His name was Finloe, and he was from the Crystal Archive — a place where magic was studied, classified, and occasionally argued with.

“I’ve heard about your talents,” he said without preamble. “We need your help.”

Nettle gave him tea. “Flattery tastes better with honey. What do you want?”

“There’s a disturbance in the ley-lines. Something big. Your name keeps showing up in the readings.”

“Sounds like your problem.”

Finloe leaned forward. “It will be everyone’s problem if this breaks through. We believe it’s looking for a vessel. A source. A... host.”

“Then it’s foolish,” Nettle replied, sipping. “The woods will eat it.”

Finloe didn’t blink. “Or it will eat the woods.”

That night, Nettle stood on her roof and stared at the stars. They seemed farther away than usual. Her fingers itched with power — not her own, but something older. Something reaching.

She whispered a word she hadn’t spoken in centuries. The ground responded.

And far below the roots and rock, the thing in the tree stirred.

It had remembered her name.

Nettle didn’t sleep that night.

Sleep, for a pixie of her nature, was never just rest — it was wandering through dreamthreads spun by the Forestmind itself, tangling into visions of possible futures and impossible pasts. But that night, every time she tried to drift, she found herself falling into a great black root that spiraled down and down with no end. Faces peered out of the bark, eyes like melted gold, mouths whispering secrets too old to belong to this world. She would jerk awake each time just as the root split open like a mouth to swallow her whole.

So instead, she paced.

The floorboards creaked not from age, but from mild irritation. They didn’t like being walked on in circles, and she could hear them muttering under their breath. Even her cauldron had gone quiet, its usual happy burbling reduced to a low simmer, as if it too sensed something coiled in the dark.

When the first rays of dawn smudged the horizon like charcoal across damp paper, Nettle stopped in front of her window and opened the shutters. The air outside had changed again. Everything was too still. Even the breeze seemed to be holding its breath.

A knock came at her door, light but deliberate. Three taps, a pause, then two more. She frowned. That was the rhythm of the Old Compact, a call-and-response from the first treaties between the fae and the deeper wilds.

She opened it.

A figure stood on her threshold. Not tall, not short — it was the kind of shape your eyes forgot the moment you looked away. It wore a robe stitched from shadow and fog, its face hidden beneath a hood that seemed to drink the light around it. But Nettle knew who — or rather what — it was.

“The Hollowbound,” she murmured, narrowing her eyes. “You're not meant to leave the Rootstone.”

The creature tilted its head. “Neither are you.”

“I never swore an oath.”

“You were born under the First Tree’s shadow. That is oath enough.”

Nettle didn’t invite it in. That would have been unwise. Instead, she stepped out onto the moss-carpeted path and pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders. “Why are you here?”

“The bindings are fraying,” the Hollowbound said in a voice like wind through dead leaves. “Something is calling from the other side. Something that remembers the taste of stars and the songs of fire. We came to warn you.”

“I already saw the black tree.”

“It is not a tree. It is a seed.”

Nettle felt her stomach tighten. “What does it want?”

“Not what. Who.”

They stared at one another for a long moment. Behind her, inside her cottage, the humming from her books began to rise, uneasy and discordant.

“Why me?” she asked at last, though a part of her already knew.

“Because you are the only one foolish enough to touch what should remain untouched. And strong enough to survive it.”

With that, the Hollowbound turned and vanished, melting into the morning mist like ink into water.

By midday, the glade behind her cottage had grown cold despite the sunlight. Nettle stood ankle-deep in spell circles etched into the earth, each carved with precision and sealed with drops of her own blood. Around her floated relics she hadn’t touched in decades — an obsidian comb from the Dusk Court, a bone flute given by a dream-eater, a ring that once belonged to her sister before she’d vanished into the mirror realm. All anchors. All dangerous.

She was preparing for something she didn’t yet understand, but her instincts — older than her bones, older than her name — told her it was necessary.

The air vibrated.

A tear opened above the sigils. Not torn fabric, not light — more like the concept of place had been briefly removed from that spot. Through it, she glimpsed teeth. Not sharp. Wide. Endless. A smile without joy. A mouth without a face.

She flung a ward, then another, then a third — the tear sealed like a wound being pinched shut. The wind fell still again.

“Too soon,” she whispered, wiping sweat from her brow. “It’s trying to push through cracks.”

Behind her, Grack landed with a rustle of wing and smoke.

“You’re poking holes in the world again,” he said, eyeing the scorch mark where the tear had been.

“It poked first.”

“Semantics.” He hopped closer, pecked at a root. “You need help.”

“I have you.”

“I mean real help. This thing isn’t just hungry. It’s curious. That’s worse.”

Nettle knelt, began packing away the relics. “I’ll go to the Weaver.”

Grack fluffed his wings. “She’s not going to be pleased.”

“She never is.”

The Weaver lived where the world thinned to thread.

At the edge of the Barrowveil, where mist wept from the trees and the grass grew in spirals, Nettle found the ancient spider-fae hunched over her loom. Her body was long and low, more silk than flesh, her eight limbs moving in rhythmic precision as she spun strands of time and story into cloth that shimmered with unreal colors.

“Still wearing that awful shawl?” the Weaver said without looking up.

“Still weaving stories no one believes?” Nettle retorted.

They grinned at each other, or at least Nettle did. The Weaver’s expression was harder to read.

“You’ve felt it then,” the Weaver said after a pause. “The stirring.”

“I’ve seen more than felt. It’s not hiding anymore.”

The Weaver cut the thread she’d been working on with a blade made of stillborn lightning and gestured for Nettle to sit. “It’s not a return. It’s a reckoning. What was buried wasn’t dead. Just dreaming.”

Nettle sat on a cushion woven from moss and old songs. “It’s looking for me.”

“No,” the Weaver said, tilting her head. “It’s looking for itself. You’re just... close.”

“Close how?”

“You carry too many old things inside you, Nettle. Memories that aren’t yours. Echoes of oaths you never swore. It wants to wear you like a coat.”

Nettle went cold. “How do I stop it?”

The Weaver reached beneath her loom, pulled out a bundle wrapped in twilight. “You don’t. But you can trick it. If you’re clever. And if you’re willing to lie.”

“To it?”

“To yourself.”

Back at her cottage, Nettle stood in front of her mirror.

The bundle from the Weaver was a charm. Not a weapon, not a shield — a knot of possibility, anchored in a future that might never come to pass. It hummed in her hands.

Her reflection blinked.

She did not.

Nettle stepped forward. The reflection didn’t move. It stared back at her, its eyes black as hollows.

“Found you,” it said.

And then the glass exploded.

The shards rained down like frozen raindrops, glittering midair before clattering to the floor in a discordant chorus of breaking spells and unraveling wards. Nettle threw up a hand, and the air thickened around her — not quite a barrier, more a thrum of resistance, like pushing against heavy fog. The largest pieces of the mirror stilled in place, hovering with malevolent intention, and in their jagged reflections she saw dozens of versions of herself, each expression different — some horrified, others blank, and one smiling far too wide.

She spoke a word then, one she had not uttered since the last Thorn War, a word so old it had no true vowels, only breath and intent. The air snapped tight. The mirror shards dissolved into powder, then into nothing, sucked into the weave of the walls, leaving behind only silence and the faint scent of rosemary and rust.

But the voice remained.

It slithered in behind her, from no mouth and all mouths at once. “You are thin,” it murmured. “A vessel too small. But clever. Clever vessels grow deeper.”

Nettle clenched her fists and turned, but there was nothing there. No shadow, no shape — just the whisper, now fading into the grain of the wood, the fibers of her books, the quiet tremble of magic hiding in corners. She exhaled slowly. This was no longer a stirring. This was intrusion.

Grack sat perched on a windowsill, his wings folded tight, watching with unusual solemnity.

“It’s inside,” she said, voice flat.

“It’s... brushing,” Grack replied. “Like a hand on a curtain, testing the weave. If you let it tug again, it’ll start to come through.”

Nettle moved slowly to the hearth and lit the flame with a twist of her fingers. Blue fire burst forth, casting long shadows that flickered like dancers caught mid-motion. She placed the Weaver’s charm into the flame and whispered a second word — this one not old, but forbidden. The charm pulsed, then cracked open like a seed.

From inside bloomed a sphere of light, no larger than a plum. It floated upward and hovered in the center of the room, spinning slowly. From it projected a lattice of runes that turned in and on themselves, looping like serpent knots.

“What’s that supposed to do?” Grack asked, his voice tight.

Nettle didn’t answer. She was listening. Her eyes followed the patterns in the lattice, tracking their shifting syntax, watching for the break. It came — not in the pattern, but in the reflection it cast against the far wall.

One symbol glowed dark instead of light.

“There,” she breathed. “That’s where it’s pressing.”

The runes snapped together into a single glyph — a door. Not physical, not present. Conceptual. The kind of door only opened from inside.

Nettle turned her back on it. “We’re not ready for that yet.”

“You will be,” said Grack. “Or you’ll be... something else.”

Three nights passed with no further events, though the quiet had changed its tone. Birds flew in strange patterns, avoiding areas of the sky. Bees hummed songs in minor keys. Even the wind carried messages now — not words, exactly, but feelings, sharp and bitter like regret.

On the fourth morning, Nettle woke to find the village elder at her door.

Tansy Elderroot was the kind of pixie who could turn a stare into a weapon. She wore a cloak of ivy and thorn, and her eyes were the silver of moonlit dew. Once, long ago, she had commanded armies of whisper-moths and walked through fire without burning. Now she ruled Thistledown Hollow with a silence more powerful than law.

“May I come in?” Tansy asked.

Nettle stepped aside. “If you’re going to scold me, at least have tea first.”

Tansy took the offered cup without sitting. “Something old has slipped through. The mirror folk have fled. One of the hollow wells is singing.”

“I know,” Nettle said.

“You’ve been stirring things again.”

“I didn’t stir. I just looked. It saw me.”

Tansy’s lips tightened. “Then we must move quickly. The Eldergrove has called a moot. They want you there.”

“That’s a bad idea,” Nettle said without hesitation. “You know how they are. The last time I attended a moot, three willows set fire to themselves and a pine tried to eat my shoes.”

Tansy’s voice was iron wrapped in velvet. “This isn’t a request.”

Nettle exhaled, turned back to her cluttered workbench. “Fine. But if someone tries to bind me again, I’m setting the moss on fire.”

“Understood.”

The Eldergrove was a place few pixies visited lightly. Deep in the heart of the Bramblewood, past the Rootbone Caverns and the Pool of Whispers, it stood as a circle of living trees older than stories. Each was a sentinel of its own domain — Oak, Birch, Ash, Thorn, and Yew. Their bark bore runes in languages spoken only in sleep. Their roots stretched miles deep, interwoven in a lattice of magic that held the entire forest’s memory.

When Nettle arrived, the grove was already crowded.

There were fae of every variety — mosslings from the northern bogs, bark-skinned rootkin from the dry hills, a pair of glasswings from the coast who shimmered with ocean hues. Even a windwalker from the Upper Air had coiled down into a tethered form to attend.

They all fell silent as she stepped into the circle.

The Oak, who served as the mouth of the moot, spoke first.

“Nettle Fernwhistle, you are summoned under the Pact of Leaf and Star. Do you come willingly?”

“No,” she replied, “but I’m here anyway.”

A rustle passed through the grove — half disapproval, half amusement.

“You have awakened an ancient tether,” the Oak continued. “Something that was meant to sleep.”

“I didn’t wake it,” Nettle said. “It was waking already. I just happened to be close enough to notice.”

The Ash spoke then, its voice like crackling bark. “Proximity is not innocence.”

Nettle stepped forward. “Neither is inaction.”

Silence.

Then the Birch — youngest and most impulsive of the grove — leaned forward. “What is it, exactly?”

Nettle hesitated. “It’s not one thing. It’s many things. It’s... the memory of a god, maybe. The echo of what used to be worshipped, before names mattered. It’s hunting for a mind to wear. And it found me.”

The Yew, who had not spoken yet, finally stirred. Its voice was slow, heavy. “Will it succeed?”

“That’s what I came to find out,” Nettle said. “And why I came to ask for something dangerous.”

All the trees leaned inward.

“I need access to the Rootward Vault.”

The reaction was immediate. Shock. Fear. Rage.

The Thorn, sharpest of them all, hissed. “You dare request that?”

“I do,” Nettle replied. “Because it already knows me. If I don’t learn its name, it will take mine.”

The trees conferred in silence. It felt like hours.

Then the Oak turned back. “So be it. You may enter.”

Nettle bowed slightly, though her heart felt like it was crawling toward her throat. The Rootward Vault was sealed for a reason. Only those with permission from the entire moot could even find the entrance.

Now, she was going in. Alone.

As she turned to leave, Grack flapped down beside her, silent.

“You coming?” she asked.

“I don’t think I have a choice anymore.”

“Neither do I.”

Chapter Two: The Vault Beneath the Roots

The entrance to the Rootward Vault was not marked by stone or spell, but by stillness. The path leading to it lay beneath the oldest tree in the Eldergrove — a colossal behemoth of bark and shadow known only as the Deepmother. Her trunk bore no carvings, no glyphs, only the natural folds and fissures that resembled sleeping faces. When Nettle placed her hand against it, the bark opened like a sigh.

She stepped inside.

The air changed immediately, thickening with ancient breath. Inside the trunk was a spiral staircase of roots — not grown but shaped, as though the tree had dreamed them into this form for the sake of those who would descend. The way down was lit by fungus that glowed a color Nettle couldn’t name, neither green nor gold nor blue. It pulsed slowly, like a heartbeat. She could feel her magic growing taut, threads pulling toward something below, something vast.

Grack clung to her shoulder, unusually silent. His eyes were sharper here, more avian, less smoke. The deeper they went, the more he seemed to shift — less illusion, more essence. It reminded her of what he truly was, though she rarely let herself remember.

At the base of the staircase, the walls gave way to open space.

The Vault was a chamber without ceiling or floor, a place suspended between layers of memory. Roots crisscrossed the air like the ribs of a forgotten god, thick as towers and covered in runes that moved of their own accord. In the center of the chamber floated a prism — not crystalline, not material — a knot of compressed time and identity, bound in the language of creation.

The Vault was not a place. It was a consequence.

Nettle stepped into the void and didn’t fall. Her magic kept her balanced, light as breath. She drifted toward the prism, heart pounding in a way it hadn’t since she first glimpsed the black tree.

“What now?” Grack asked, voice hushed by awe or fear.

“I ask,” Nettle replied.

She extended her hand toward the prism and spoke a question — not aloud, but into the lattice of meaning itself.

What hunts me?

The prism shuddered. Lights flickered. The runes across the roots hissed and turned inward, focusing. Then the answer came, not in words, but a feeling, a vision—

A throne of teeth in a hall of mirrors. A crown made of forgotten prayers. Eyes without lids, watching from within every reflection. A hunger that remembered being worshipped. A being known in ancient times as Dreldein, the Hollow Crown.

Nettle reeled back, clutching her chest. The prism’s glow receded, shivering like water struck by a stone.

“Dreldein,” she whispered. “It was exiled by the Pact of the Vein. Buried in the Unwaking Root. The Seal was supposed to fracture its name.”

“It remembers more than it should,” Grack said grimly.

“It’s rebuilding itself. Through dreams. Through mirrors. Through me.”

She reached again for the prism. “How do I sever the tether?”

The answer was slower this time. Images flickered and danced: a blade carved from self-denial, a mirror turned outward, the blood of kin willingly given. A choice.

“It needs a host,” she said. “But it also needs a story. A myth to inhabit. That’s how it survives.”

“So,” said Grack, voice dry, “we kill the story?”

“No,” Nettle said, eyes sharp now. “We rewrite it.”

Returning from the Vault left her drained in ways she didn’t fully understand. The walk back to her cottage felt long and warped, as if the woods shifted with each step, reluctant to let her leave. The Eldergrove was quiet. Even Tansy had not waited for her. Word would spread, of course. The Vault did not open without echo.

Back in her home, Nettle lit every lamp and hung wards across every window. Her shelves rattled with restless books. Her cauldron refused to boil, sulking in its hearth. She didn’t blame it. The room itself felt like it was holding its breath, bracing for something inevitable.

She sat at her desk and opened the Weaver’s scroll — a blank strip of barkskin inked in disappearing script. Slowly, she began to write her counterspell. Not a banishment — that wouldn’t hold Dreldein. No, she would craft a narrative, something to override the god’s own self-image. She needed to trap it in a tale more compelling than the one it had been telling itself for eons.

Grack watched her from the mantle. “You’re going to make it believe a lie?”

“No,” Nettle replied. “I’m going to make it live a different truth.”

“And what truth is that?”

Nettle hesitated, then wrote one sentence at the top of the scroll: The monster was once a child who forgot its name.

Grack tilted his head. “That’s... surprisingly gentle.”

“I don’t believe in evil,” she said. “Only in things that hurt too long and forgot how to stop.”

The scroll glowed faintly. The story had accepted its seed.

But nothing remained quiet for long.

That night, as Nettle prepared her wards and sipped tea made from memory-blossom petals, the shadows in her cottage deepened. One by one, the lanterns went out. Not by draft. Not by will. They snuffed themselves, as though ashamed to cast light.

She stood, back to the hearth, listening.

No footsteps. No wind. No voice.

Only the mirror.

She had replaced the shattered one with silvered water in a frame of birch. It was a temporary ward, reflecting only what should be seen. But now, the water had gone still — not the stillness of calm, but of absence. Like it had forgotten how to ripple.

A face surfaced.

Not hers.

It looked like her — a shadow of her, if she had never laughed, never loved, never chosen curiosity over caution. A version grown in darkness and silence. The reflection smiled.

“You can’t rewrite me,” it said.

Nettle stepped closer. “Can’t I?”

The mirror rippled. “You are the lie. I am the truth of you. The truth beneath.”

“No,” she whispered. “You’re what was left behind when I became myself.”

The face snarled. The mirror cracked — not broken, but split like bark under pressure.

Dreldein was pushing again.

She grasped the scroll and pressed her hand to its center, pouring the story into the room. The glow spread, spiderwebbing along the walls, touching every book, every floorboard. A pulse radiated outward — not magic, but narrative. A version of the world that would not include Dreldein’s version.

The shadow screamed.

And then it was gone.

Only the soft bubbling of the cauldron returned, tentative, like an apology.

Nettle sat down slowly.

“That wasn’t even the full thing,” she muttered.

“No,” Grack said, hopping down beside her. “That was the breath before the scream.”

At dawn, someone knocked on her door again.

This time, it was not a fae or a forest-creature, but a human — a boy, no older than twelve, eyes hollow, voice quiet.

“I dreamed about you,” he said.

Nettle blinked. “You’re a long way from any village.”

“They said I had to find the spark-witch,” the boy replied. “They said you could show me how to wake up.”

Nettle looked past him, at the rising sun. The wind stirred the leaves, carrying with it the scent of iron and honey.

“Come in,” she said.

And as he stepped through, the story began to grow.

The boy's name was Thomlin. He had hair like harvested straw and eyes that had seen too much for someone who still tripped over his own boots. His voice was soft-spoken, but not shy — more like he’d learned to speak in tones that wouldn’t draw attention, the way hunted things do. Nettle offered him bread with honey, and though he ate slowly, it was clear he hadn’t had something warm in days.

He told her his dreams between mouthfuls, his words careful, as if speaking too plainly might make them too real.

“I see this place. Dark and wet. Everything echoes, like it’s deep inside a tree or under a hill. There’s a... humming, like bees trapped in my chest. And then the voice comes. Not loud. But right there.” He tapped his temple. “It says things that I know aren’t mine. Words I never learned.”

“What kinds of words?” Nettle asked, already knowing the answer.

“Old ones. Names that make my ears feel cold. It says I belong to the Hollow Crown. That I was promised before I was even born.”

Nettle’s lips pressed into a line. “You were born during a Silence Year, weren’t you?”

Thomlin nodded. “I never cried. That’s what they said. When I came out, the midwife said the air stopped moving in the room. That my eyes were already open.”

That clinched it. Silence Years were rare — gaps in the pulse of the world, when the Leylines ran quiet and time seemed to fold slightly at the corners. Children born during those years often carried strange tethers, half-born ties to things forgotten.

Nettle stood and began rifling through her shelves, pulling down old records bound in hair and sealed with wax. She didn’t bother asking Thomlin where he’d come from. If the Hollow Crown had truly touched him, distance was irrelevant.

“What happens when you sleep?” she asked.

“I wake up wrong,” he whispered. “Sometimes I’m not in my body when I open my eyes. I can feel him looking out through me. Talking in my voice.”

Grack landed beside him and peered into the boy’s face with one beady eye. “He’s marked,” the raven murmured. “But not fully rooted. You could still cut the tether.”

“Cutting won’t be enough,” Nettle muttered as she flipped through the scrolls. “Dreldein doesn’t just mark with intent. He leaves pieces behind. Hooks. Stories.”

She found the page she was looking for — a ritual from the Thorn Manuscripts. Not a banishment, not a sealing. A rewriting. The same method she had begun using on herself.

She laid the scroll across the table and lit the corner with starlight.

“Thomlin, I need you to listen to me very carefully.”

The boy nodded, all traces of weariness burned off by the intensity in her tone.

“We’re going to tell a different story about you. One that Dreldein can’t live inside. It’ll be hard. It might hurt. But when we’re done, he won’t be able to find you again.”

Thomlin’s fingers curled around the edge of the table. “What if I forget who I am?”

“You won’t,” she said. “You’ll remember who you chose to be. That’s stronger than any memory he gave you.”

The ritual began at sundown.

She had cleared a space behind her cottage, circling the clearing with ash from her own hearth, blood from her fingertip, and the last breath of a summer wind caught in a glass jar. Thomlin stood barefoot in the center, wearing a simple tunic. In his hands, he held three things: a feather, a broken tooth, and a blackened acorn. Each was a symbol of something Dreldein had touched — air, flesh, seed — and each would be rewritten.

Grack perched on a low branch, silent for once.

Nettle stood opposite the boy and raised the scroll.

“In the name of thread and thorn,” she intoned, “in the name of all names unspoken, I cast the tale anew.”

The scroll burned, but the words hung in the air, glowing symbols dancing between them. One by one, she began to speak them aloud, binding each to Thomlin’s breath, his pulse, his shadow.

“You are not the silence born, but the echo breaker.

“You are not a hollow seed, but a wild root.

“You are not the mouth of Dreldein, but the end of his whisper.”

As the words took shape, Thomlin’s eyes rolled back. The clearing shuddered. The ground groaned.

And then — laughter.

Not from the boy. Not from Nettle.

From the trees.

The laughter echoed through bark and branch, cold and amused.

“So small,” said a voice from the roots themselves. “You think a child’s tale can unmake me?”

The clearing darkened, the light from Nettle’s wards dimming.

A shape stepped from the trees. Not a body, not truly. It wore a robe of writhing vines and a crown of thorns that bled darkness. Its face was a mask of many — sometimes a child’s, sometimes hers, sometimes something far older.

Grack leapt from the tree, wings spread wide. “Too soon!” he cried. “You pulled him through too soon!”

Nettle stood her ground, the words still hovering around her. “He followed the tether. Thomlin is the anchor.”

Dreldein tilted its head. “He was always mine. I planted him in the world and waited. You think rewriting changes the root?”

“I don’t need to change it,” Nettle said. “Just burn it.”

She snapped her fingers.

The scroll’s remaining words ignited. The symbols twisted, reversed, reshaped. A glyph formed — the same one she’d seen in the Vault, only inverted. A sigil of identity unbinding.

Dreldein screamed. The sound tore through the clearing like broken glass.

Thomlin collapsed to his knees. The feather turned to flame. The tooth dissolved into salt. The acorn crumbled to dust. One by one, the bindings unraveled.

Nettle stepped forward, her magic laced with fire and blood.

“This is my story,” she said. “You’re just a footnote.”

And she thrust her hand into the shadow’s chest.

There was no resistance — only a howl, and then smoke, thick and cloying, burst outward from the shape. Dreldein fractured, his form collapsing like a puppet cut from its strings. The dark scattered, flailing toward the corners of the world.

And then there was silence.

Real silence.

The ritual had worked.

Thomlin lay on the ground, breathing hard, tears streaking down his face. Nettle knelt beside him, brushing hair from his forehead. His skin felt warmer. Softer. Like it had finally remembered what being alive meant.

“Is it gone?” he whispered.

“For now,” Nettle said. “But stories like that never die. They hide. They change shape. You’ll need to be careful.”

He nodded. “So will you.”

That night, after Thomlin was asleep in her guest hammock and the wards had been redrawn with stronger lines, Nettle sat at her desk and wrote a new page.

She titled it The Dream That Forgot Its Dreamer.

It wasn’t a spell. Not exactly.

It was a warning.

And a beginning.

Because the tether wasn’t just to Thomlin. It had been testing others, too. The dream-roots stretched across the ley, touching other Silence-born, other cracks in the world’s rhythm. Dreldein’s reach was deeper than she’d feared.

Grack, reading over her shoulder, gave a low whistle.

“How many others do you think are touched?”

“Too many,” Nettle replied. “And most don’t even know.”

She folded the page and sealed it with wax shaped like a spiral — the symbol of memory reclaiming itself.

“It’s time we found them,” she said.

“You mean... start a war?”

She shook her head. “Start a story. One strong enough to hold them together.”

And outside, somewhere beyond the trees, something listened.

Not Dreldein.

Something older.

And it was curious.

Chapter Three: Threads Beyond the Hollow

The message was carried by a dream moth, its wings translucent and trailing particles of sleep. It arrived at Nettle’s window just after dusk three nights after the ritual, spiraling through the hazy twilight with the drunken grace of something more idea than creature. When it landed on the sill, it folded itself into a curl and disintegrated into letters of glowing ink. Nettle read the missive once, then a second time, her frown deepening.

“They found another one,” she muttered.

Grack, roosting upside down from the rafters, twisted his head toward her. “Another Silence-born?”

“Worse. This one is dream-flooded.” She pressed her palm flat to the wooden sill, letting the message seep into the grain of her cottage. “It’s spreading faster than we thought.”

Grack straightened, wings flaring. “Where?”

“Far edge of the Drowning Fen. Near the Lornspire.”

He let out a breath through his beak. “That’s old land. Dead land. Nothing sane lives there.”

“Nothing sane,” she agreed. “But something lives.”

Nettle stood, already reaching for her travel kit. She packed it methodically: truththorn for cutting lies, a silver spool of tether-thread, three potions in clouded glass, and her wand — crooked, burnt at the tip, and still humming with the aftershock of her last duel. The wand she hadn’t used in decades, not since the Winter Binding.

“Will the boy be safe?” Grack asked.

“Thomlin will be fine. Tansy’s watchers are already stationed nearby. And he has the glyph now. It’ll warn him.”

She paused, her hand hovering over a crystal vial filled with compressed dusk.

“Grack.”

He tilted his head.

“If I don’t come back in three nights, burn the scrolls. All of them. Don’t let what’s inside them find another way out.”

The raven’s eyes darkened. “Don’t talk like that.”

“I’m not planning to die. Just... hedging.”

The Drowning Fen earned its name honestly. It was a place where the land forgot it was supposed to stay solid. Mist clung to every surface, and the water beneath the grass was never more than an inch away, lurking like a predator. Paths shifted when unlooked at. Sounds traveled in loops. It was a place where things once buried tended to resurface.

Nettle touched down just before midnight.

Her wings were already slick with dew, her boots mud-caked. The air was thick with the scent of peat, salt, and something slightly metallic — like wet coins buried under rotting leaves. She pulled her shawl tighter, muttering a hex to keep her temperature steady. The chill here wasn’t natural. It gnawed.

The letter had given her coordinates in the old way: three paces west of the crying tree, past the mirror pool, until the ground sings. Nettle found the tree easily — its bark weeping sap that smelled like grief. The pool came next, reflecting nothing but sky even though clouds had long since swallowed the moon.

And then the ground began to hum.

She stopped.

Before her was a clearing, impossibly dry, and in its center stood a girl. Not quite child, not quite grown — suspended in that ageless state peculiar to beings touched by the fey or by fate. Her eyes glowed faintly. Her feet didn’t touch the ground.

Nettle felt her mouth go dry.

The girl turned, slowly, as if sensing a draft rather than sound. When she spoke, her voice echoed twice — once in the air, once in Nettle’s spine.

“You are the one who rewrites,” said the girl.

“I try,” Nettle replied carefully. “What’s your name?”

The girl blinked. “They called me Eline once. But now I have many names. Most of them not mine.”

“Are you awake?”

“Sometimes. But mostly... I dream. And in the dream, I am everyone. And everything.”

Nettle took a cautious step closer. “Someone touched you. Something.”

“Not someone,” Eline said. “Everyone. Every Silence-born. Every tether. I feel them. I am them. The dream passes through me like water through cloth. I catch the shape, but never the weight.”

This was worse than she feared. Eline wasn’t just marked. She was becoming a conduit.

“How long have you been here?”

“Time is unthreaded. But I remember the bees.”

Nettle nodded once. Then, slowly, she reached into her satchel and removed the tether-thread. “May I try something?”

Eline tilted her head. “If you break me, I will unravel.”

“I’m not here to break anything.”

Carefully, Nettle unraveled a length of the thread — it shimmered as it moved, catching traces of thought and sound. She circled Eline once, whispering binding words that didn’t bind, but define. The thread responded, drawing a shape from the girl’s floating form — an outline of selfhood, a border between what was hers and what was not.

Eline gasped.

“I remember the river,” she whispered. “I remember my mother’s song. I remember... me.”

The thread pulsed, anchoring.

But then, the ground screamed.

It wasn’t a sound — not in the normal way. It was pressure, emotional and real, forcing tears to Nettle’s eyes without permission. A pulse burst from the soil, hurling her backward into the mud. The mist around them snapped taut and peeled back, revealing eyes — dozens of them, blinking from trees, from puddles, from air itself.

Dreldein had found her again.

“Grack,” she hissed into the air, activating the whisper bond. “Get here. Now.”

The raven’s reply was distorted by distance. “Already on my way.”

Eline was hovering higher now, her glow flickering. Her voice rose, panicked.

“They’re inside again. The dream is cracking.”

Nettle stood, swaying, her hand pressed to her chest. Her wards were fraying. The spell was leaking. She had no choice.

“Eline. Listen. You have to come back into your body. Take hold. Choose.”

“I’m not strong enough!”

“Yes, you are. I’m not your story. You are.”

Eline screamed — and in that sound was everything: terror, defiance, mourning. Her light exploded outward. The eyes recoiled, melting. The mist shivered and collapsed. And then...

Silence.

Real, full, holy silence.

Eline crumpled to the earth, breathing hard, her eyes normal again.

Nettle knelt beside her. “You’re back.”

“I held the thread,” the girl whispered. “It was so small. But it was mine.”

Nettle smiled, exhausted. “That’s all it ever takes.”

Grack arrived ten minutes later, soaked and swearing.

“Did I miss the apocalypse again?”

“Barely,” Nettle said, helping Eline to her feet. “You’re late.”

“I brought snacks,” he offered, lifting a satchel that smelled strongly of burnt sugar.

They returned to the edge of the Fen by morning, traveling in silence for long stretches. Eline slept part of the way, head resting against Nettle’s shoulder, the thread tied like a bracelet around her wrist.

“You’ll need to teach her,” Grack murmured. “She’s more than a survivor.”

“I know,” Nettle replied. “She’s an amplifier. Every voice Dreldein touches, she echoes. But she can echo truth now. That matters.”

“And if Dreldein returns?”

Nettle glanced up at the stars, fading in the light.

“Then we teach every Silence-born how to write their own ending.”

The sun broke the edge of the horizon like a yolk in water, its light bleeding across the damp edge of the Fen, painting everything in orange and violet. The trees, warped and hunched from years of slow decay, cast long fingers of shadow that reached and curled over the mossy ground. Eline stirred under the crook of Nettle’s arm, her breath steady, no longer echoing. For the first time in days, her presence did not disturb the air around her. She was anchored now, at least for the moment.

They made their way slowly through the shallows of the bog, climbing the ridges where land forgot it was meant to be submerged. Nettle could feel the rhythm of the ley returning beneath her boots — sluggish, but not broken. Where Dreldein had touched, the threads of the world remained twisted, singed at the edges, but the damage was no longer growing.

The next hill came into view, one she recognized. At its base stood a monolith — ancient, etched with moss-eaten glyphs — a boundary marker from the elder days. It had once signaled a limit to the Old Kingdoms, a place where civilization dared not tread. Now it was a reminder that even history could drown if it wasn’t tied to something solid.

They paused beneath it.

Eline looked up at the stones. “What is that?”

“A warding post,” Nettle answered. “Before stories like Dreldein’s even began, the old ones carved the world with meaning. This is one of the last that still holds. Faint, but it resists him.”

“It doesn’t look like much,” Eline said, brushing her fingers along the moss.

“Neither do most things that matter,” Nettle replied, and for a moment, the three of them — the witch, the child, the half-formed raven — stood in silence beneath it, breathing in the space it offered.

A low tremor passed beneath their feet. Not a threat, not this time. Something stirring deeper, slower. The world adjusting its spine after a long, uneasy slumber.

“I think we’re being watched,” Grack muttered.

“I know we’re being watched,” Nettle said. “The Lornspire's too close for comfort.”

The Lornspire rose above the bog just two miles north — a spire of bone-white stone shaped like a spear hurled from the heavens. It had no doors, no visible seams, but the fae whispered it had once been a prison, or a tower, or perhaps a relic of a dead god’s finger. No one truly knew. All they agreed on was that it never changed position, yet always seemed to loom closer when you looked away.

“We’re not going there,” Grack warned.

“Not today,” Nettle agreed. “But soon. Dreldein left echoes behind. Not just in minds. In places.”

Eline had turned back toward the marker, her brow furrowed.

“There’s something in the stone,” she said.

“What do you mean?”

She stepped forward and pressed her ear to the glyphs. Her body stiffened. Her eyes widened. Her mouth opened — not in scream or warning, but in recitation.

A voice emerged, old and androgynous, neither hers nor Dreldein’s.

“When the roots forget the song of water, the hollow returns. When silence falls on the name of light, the mirror opens. When the crowned mouth speaks through dreaming wood, the weaver must choose: cut the thread, or be unspun.”

Then silence.

Eline slumped to her knees, panting.

Grack's feathers stood on end. “Well. That’s ominous.”

Nettle stepped forward, hands trembling slightly. She knelt beside Eline, checking her pulse, her breath, the clarity in her eyes.

“I think,” she said slowly, “we just heard part of the old prophecy. The one they buried after the Thorn Reckoning. The one the Eldergrove denied existed.”

Eline’s voice was hoarse. “It’s not a prophecy. It’s a warning. A choice.”

Nettle helped her to her feet. “They all are.”

By the time they returned to Thistledown Hollow, the sky had gone gray. Not with storm, but with the peculiar heaviness that signaled a thinning of the world’s border. Pixies in the treetops whispered of strange winds. The mushrooms glowed when they shouldn’t. The reflection-pools were still even when disturbed.

Tansy Elderroot met them at the gate.

She looked older than before — not in body, but in gaze. Like she’d seen something she couldn’t unsee. She said nothing at first, only looked at Eline, and then at Nettle.

“You brought it with you.”

“I brought her,” Nettle replied. “And yes, she touched it. But she’s not part of it. Not anymore.”

“Are you certain?”

“No. But certainty isn’t a luxury we get.”

Tansy nodded slowly. “There’s been movement. The waters near the Hollow Wells are sinking. Something is pulling the veins of the forest. We believe Dreldein left something behind in the Rootmirror.”

Nettle grimaced. “That well was sealed. With six glyphs.”

“They broke,” Tansy said simply.

Grack let out a low, pitiful groan. “Well, that’s... delightful.”

Nettle looked at Eline. “You’re going to stay here for now. Tansy will teach you the deeper wards. You’ll be safe. Or safer, at least.”

“I want to help,” Eline said. “I want to help find the others.”

“You will. But right now, you’re a spark. You need time before you become a flame.”

Eline nodded, though reluctantly. She understood, even if she didn’t like it.

Nettle turned to Tansy. “There’s more of them. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. And Dreldein was never the only voice in the dark. He was just the one that remembered how to sing.”

Tansy tilted her head. “You’re saying something worse is coming?”

“I’m saying something older is waking. The vault dream was only a symptom. The illness is spreading through memory. Through legacy.”

Tansy stepped aside. “Then I’ll ready the Hollow. You do what you do best.”

Nettle looked to the sky, where the sun had been, but no longer was.

“Rewrite the endings.”

That night, she didn’t sleep.

Instead, she sat at her desk, carving new runes into the wood. This time, she was not sealing. She was preparing. There was a difference.

Grack watched her, preening in awkward silence.

“You’re getting serious again,” he said. “I don’t like when you get serious.”

“I’m always serious,” she murmured.

“No, you’re always dangerous. There’s a difference.”

Nettle didn’t respond. She was too busy drawing the map — not of roads, but of dreams. The dreamlines stretched like veins across the parchment, pulsing faintly as she touched each node. Her magic hummed along the edges.

“There,” she whispered. “There’s where the next voice will rise.”

Grack leaned closer. “That’s the Icehollow. Nothing lives there anymore.”

“Exactly,” Nettle said. “Which makes it the perfect place for forgotten stories to grow.”

She marked it with a thorn-shaped sigil. Then another beside it — the Weaver’s spiral.

Then she picked up the thread bracelet Eline had given her and tied it around her wrist.

“Tomorrow,” she said. “We begin again.”

Outside, the forest held its breath.

And somewhere far away, under ice and silence, something opened its eyes.

Chapter Four: The Icehollow Silence

It took Nettle three days to reach the Icehollow.

The journey was more trial than travel — every mile marked by twisted geography and the aftermath of dreams gone wrong. She crossed forests that whispered in reversed tongues, glades where time pulsed too quickly or too slowly, and hills that bent inward, swallowing their own paths. The Hollow Crown’s touch lingered in the land, like a bruise that would not fade.

By the time the air grew sharp enough to bite skin, she knew she was close.

The Icehollow was a place even maps refused. A circular basin carved from ancient glacier-bone, it sat silent beneath the eaves of the Northwall Cliffs, hemmed in by frost and riddled with silence. It was always snowing there, even in the height of summer. But it was not a stormy snow. It fell evenly, gently, like ash.

And just beneath the surface of that snow, things stirred.

Nettle stopped at the edge and crouched, pressing her palm to the frost. Her magic flinched. The leyline here was not broken — it was dormant, as if something had settled over it like a blanket, dulling the pulse. She let her eyes flutter closed, listening.

Nothing.

No birds. No wind. No rustle of branch or footfall. The air did not echo. It absorbed.

She stood, adjusted her coat — a heavy wool garment stitched with whisper-wards and lined with red fox-fur — and stepped into the basin.

With every step, the snow swallowed sound. The weight of it didn’t press against her so much as follow, clinging to her boots, her shawl, her thoughts. By the time she reached the center, she wasn’t sure how long she’d been walking. Time seemed to have gone sideways.

At the heart of the basin stood a single structure: a spire of ice, impossibly tall, its shape warped like a mirror half-melted. The spire vibrated faintly, and inside it, something moved.

Not fast. Not urgent.

Just...
