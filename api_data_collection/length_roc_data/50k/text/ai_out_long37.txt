The Curse of Eldralore
Chapter One: The Whispers of Windsreach

The kingdom of Eldralore was unlike any other land beneath the sun. Its forests shimmered with leaves of iridescent silver, its rivers sang with voices none could mimic, and at its heart stood Windsreach Castle, tall and cold as forgotten winter. There, among the ancient spires and halls steeped in old magic, lived a princess with a gift more feared than revered.

Princess Elowen was born during a thunderstorm so fierce it split the skies with fire. Her first cry silenced the winds, and the rain froze midair. Whispers had it that the spirits of the wild had touched her soul, leaving behind a gift — or a curse. As she grew, animals would gather near her chambers, birds perching along her windowsill, deer bowing their heads beneath her balcony, even wolves waiting patiently at the castle gates.

When she turned seven, her power emerged — in fury and fear.

It was a game, harmless at first. Her cousin Rilen teased her, as he often did, hiding her favorite ribbon in the castle stables. Frustrated, she had pointed a finger at him, her eyes shining strangely, and spoken words she did not know. In an instant, Rilen dropped to the floor, writhing, twisting — and where once stood a boy now sat a wide-eyed fox, trembling in the straw.

Queen Arlayne wept for days. King Vaeron summoned all the wise men of Eldralore, and none could reverse the spell. The fox remained, half-caged and half-free, prowling the castle grounds, sometimes glaring up at the towers with a look too human to bear.

Elowen was kept under close watch after that. Her tutors drilled restraint into her. Her every emotion was measured, monitored, dulled. Yet the gift grew stronger. And the animals came still — snakes in the kitchens, falcons perching inside the chapel, bears lumbering near the outer wall.

By the time she reached sixteen, Princess Elowen had become a myth within her own realm.

“Be still,” whispered the handmaids when they brushed her silver-threaded hair. “Be kind, be calm. Don’t get angry. Don’t dream too loudly.”

But dreams do not heed such warnings. And Elowen dreamed — of running through the wilds without shoes, of shouting into the stars, of using her power to protect, not hide.

She had no friends, save for a stable boy named Dareth, who spoke little and smiled less, but who once brought her a wounded hawk and said nothing when she healed it with just a glance. He was quiet and strong and seemed to sense the pulse of the land the same way she did.

One evening, as twilight bled into the trees, Elowen climbed to the northern tower — her sanctuary. The wind tugged at her gown, and below, the forest rustled like a restless sea.

“She’s coming,” said a voice behind her.

It was her grandmother, Queen Myrielle — old, cloaked in crow feathers, blind in both eyes, but somehow always knowing where to go. Myrielle had been the last true sorceress in Eldralore, before the magic thinned.

“Who’s coming?” Elowen asked, still watching the woods.

“The one who fears you. The one who seeks to bind you. A princess of flame. A rider of ruin. Her name will be ash and her hands full of chains.”

Elowen turned. “You speak in riddles.”

“I speak in what remains,” the old queen said, and turned, bones cracking, to leave. “You must learn what you are, before others decide it for you.”

That night, Elowen dreamed of fire swallowing the castle. She stood on the parapet, robes burning, and below her the kingdom screamed. But she did not flee — she raised her hand, and animals poured from the forest in waves: lions, wolves, great owls, snakes thick as rivers. They surged over the walls, obeying her call, and the fire receded.

She woke sweating. Somewhere, a fox barked.

The next day, an envoy arrived from the southern empire of Kirell. The banner was blood red, the sigil a burning crown. The emissary was Lady Serina — tall, veiled in crimson, with eyes like molten gold. She smiled with her mouth but not her eyes.

“A proposal,” Serina said, bowing low before King Vaeron. “Our emperor’s daughter seeks an alliance. Princess Tharelle would wed your daughter. Unite the old blood with the flame.”

Elowen choked on her breath. A marriage? To a stranger? To the daughter of Kirell — a realm that scorned Eldralore’s magic, that hunted wild things for sport?

King Vaeron looked troubled. “We are not… a people of such customs.”

Serina smiled. “Then consider it a peace offering. One that might avert certain... consequences.”

And Elowen understood: this was not a proposal. It was a warning.

That night she crept from the castle, through the hidden gate beneath the kitchens, past the yawning roots of the Old Elm, and into the woods. Dareth met her there, without needing to be called.

“I have to know,” she said, clutching a worn map. “What they fear in me. What I really am.”

He nodded, and they walked together into the deep forest, where the moon never fully touched the ground and the air was thick with secrets.

They reached a glade where the air shimmered strangely. Dareth stepped back.

“This is druid land,” he said. “They won’t harm you. But they’ll see you.”

And they did.

From the trees emerged the Thorned Circle — druids robed in vines and antlers, eyes inked black. One stepped forward: a woman with hair of moss and lips cracked like bark.

“You carry the Beast Soul,” she said to Elowen. “It was once a gift of kings. Then they feared it. Locked it away in the blood of daughters. But it grows. It always grows.”

Elowen’s voice shook. “Can it be controlled?”

“No. But it can be chosen. Will you be cage or key?”

“I don’t understand.”

“You will.”

Then they touched her forehead, and she fell — not down, but inward.

She saw herself — a thousand selves — bird and bear, serpent and stag, running through fire, through ice, through time. She saw wars lost and won by whispers. She saw a throne carved of bone. She saw the fox again — her cousin — and behind his eyes, fury.

When she woke, Dareth was holding her hand.

“They said you screamed,” he said. “Like a falcon.”

Back at the castle, the Emperor’s daughter had arrived.

Tharelle was everything Elowen was not: fiery, loud, wrapped in silk and steel. She walked through Windsreach like a conqueror, and wherever she stepped, torches flared.

At the feast, Tharelle toasted Elowen.

“To the girl with beasts for blood,” she said. “Let us tame each other.”

Elowen’s smile was thin. “You’d have better luck taming the moon.”

Later, in the gardens, Tharelle cornered her.

“You scare them,” Tharelle said. “That makes us kin.”

“I am not like you.”

“You will be. Or you’ll burn.”

And then — without warning — Tharelle reached out, seizing Elowen’s wrist. Pain lanced through her. Elowen gasped, her vision going white.

“Say the words,” Tharelle hissed. “Turn me. Let’s see the monster.”

But Elowen did not.

Instead, the flowers around them withered. Birds dropped from the trees. A growl rose from the dark — low, guttural, ancient.

Tharelle let go, stepping back.

“I see,” she whispered. “You’re not just the monster. You’re the forest itself.”

And with that, she vanished into shadow.

Elowen stood alone in the silence.

She knew now what had to be done. She would no longer be kept in towers. No longer be a curse wearing a crown.

She would find the old bloodlines. The beast kings. The scattered tribes of the wild.

She would build her own court — not of lords and ladies, but of those who remembered what it was to run on four legs and speak with the wind.

And when Tharelle came again, with fire and chains, she would meet not a girl.

But a kingdom reborn in tooth and claw.

The days following Tharelle’s arrival unfolded with an uneasy quiet, like the hush before a storm. Elowen walked the halls of Windsreach as if in a dream, her footsteps echoing against stone that remembered too much. The castle, once cold but constant, now seemed to lean inward, listening, waiting. Tharelle had taken up residence in the eastern wing — a place rarely used since the old wars. Now torches blazed there day and night, and the scent of foreign spices filled the halls. Servants gossiped in whispers, speaking of voices in the firelight and shadows that moved against their will.

Elowen tried to remain distant, to retreat to her tower, to the woods, to the small circle of solace she had left, but it was impossible to ignore the pulse of something changing. She could feel it, like the shift in air before a lightning strike — the taste of magic thickening on her tongue, the rustling of beasts growing restless in the woods. It wasn’t just Tharelle’s presence, though she brought with her the weight of empire and threat. It was something older. Something waking.

Dareth found her again at the stables one morning, brushing the mane of a wild-haired mare that no one else could ride. He stood in the doorway, silent for a time, until she looked up and nodded.

“They’re watching you,” he said quietly. “Not just the southerners. Your father’s men. Even some of the court.”

“I know,” she replied, resting her cheek against the mare’s neck. “They think I’m going to snap.”

“Are you?”

Elowen straightened and met his gaze. “Not yet.”

They stood in silence, the mare nickering softly between them. A breeze rustled the straw, and somewhere beyond the walls, the caw of a raven echoed.

“There are rumors,” Dareth said, stepping closer. “Of a beast in the eastern woods. A great one. Too fast for arrows. Too clever for snares.”

Elowen’s breath caught. “Has it harmed anyone?”

“No. But the trees near where it’s been seen... they twist. Curl inwards, like they're afraid. People are saying it's a spirit, an omen. Maybe even one of your kind.”

“My kind,” she echoed bitterly. “You sound like them now.”

Dareth’s face softened. “I meant no insult. I just thought... if it’s like you, maybe it’s drawn to you. Maybe you could speak to it.”

She nodded slowly, her mind already far from the stables. “I’ll go tonight.”

That night, moonlight flooded the gardens like silver wine, and Elowen slipped from the castle again. She moved through the woods with quiet feet, guided by a whisper she didn’t fully understand. The air grew denser as she passed deeper into the trees, and though no birds sang and no wind stirred, she was not afraid.

She found the clearing just past the old druid stones — a place untouched by time, where the grass glowed faintly and the trees arched overhead like a cathedral. In the center stood the beast.

It was unlike any creature she had seen. Tall as a horse, fur like mist, eyes like shattered starlight. Its antlers were branches, its breath carried the scent of lightning.

They stared at one another for a long time. Elowen did not speak. She only opened her palms, empty and unthreatening.

The beast stepped forward. Its breath warmed her skin, and she heard it — not in words, but in thought, in feeling.

You are the broken chain. The returning song. The forest remembers.

Elowen blinked back tears. “What am I supposed to do?”

Bind or free. That is always the choice.

She reached out. The beast did not move.

Her fingers brushed its fur, and the world spun.

She stood suddenly in a different forest, one on fire. Animals fled through smoke. Screams rose behind her — human, desperate. Tharelle’s voice echoed through the flames.

You did this. You let them come.

Then the beast beside her roared — a sound that split the sky — and everything turned to ash.

Elowen fell backward, gasping, the vision gone. The clearing was quiet again, the beast still watching her.

It turned, stepped into the shadows, and was gone.

She sat there until dawn, her hands trembling.

When she returned to the castle, her gown was damp with dew, her hair tangled with leaves. She expected the usual disapproval, the thin-lipped glares from her father’s council, but the halls were not the same.

The court was abuzz. Something had happened.

In the grand chamber, her father stood red-faced, his voice echoing off the stone.

“She attacked one of our guards. Burned his sword in his hand!”

Tharelle lounged on the throne beside him, legs crossed, one hand resting lightly on the hilt of a dagger that had not been there before.

“He insulted me,” she said coolly. “And I do not suffer fools.”

Queen Arlayne stood nearby, pale and silent, her hands twisted together.

Elowen stepped forward. “What is this?”

Tharelle’s eyes flicked toward her. “Your court doesn’t seem to grasp the meaning of alliance. I thought I’d educate them.”

King Vaeron turned to his daughter. “You see now what this means? This is not a guest. She’s a spark to a field of dry grass.”

“I saw something in the woods,” Elowen said. “A beast. A message. The forest is warning us.”

Her father’s eyes narrowed. “And what would you have me do? Bow to trees? Fight an empire with wolves and riddles?”

“No,” she said. “Let me leave. Let me find the rest. There are others — like the druids. Like the beast. There’s a strength out there we’ve forgotten.”

“You would abandon your duty?”

“I would fulfill it,” she said, stepping closer. “But not by sitting idle while Tharelle poisons our court. She will never be my wife. And I will never be a pawn.”

The silence that followed was like the edge of a knife.

At last, Queen Arlayne spoke, voice thin as wind. “Let her go. Before we lose more than our pride.”

And so it was decided.

Elowen would leave under darkness, with only Dareth and a pack of provisions. No retinue, no guards. Just the memory of a prophecy and the mark of a power she could barely control.

As the gates opened before them and the wild world stretched out in mist and shadow, Elowen looked back only once.

Tharelle stood atop the wall, red cloak whipping in the wind, her gaze locked on Elowen’s back. She did not wave.

The forest welcomed her like an old friend.

And somewhere within, the future stirred.

Chapter Two: The Road of Hollow Names

The forest swallowed Elowen and Dareth without fanfare, and the world behind them fell into memory like a door closing quietly in the night. The trees here were different — older, stranger. Their trunks twisted like sleeping giants, their roots knotted into cruel patterns as though grown from forgotten grief. Elowen felt them whisper beneath her boots, not with words but with a sense of ancient recognition, as though they were not just entering the forest — they were returning.

For three days they traveled south, keeping to the deer paths and low-lying gullies, where the ferns grew thick and the canopy above blurred the sky into a green-hued haze. The world smelled of moss and wet bark, and the only sounds were their footsteps and the occasional caw of a distant bird. Elowen spoke little, often pausing mid-step to tilt her head or place her hand against the bark of a tree. She was listening — to the wind, to the creatures just beyond sight, to something deeper than either of them understood. Dareth did not question it. He had known, since the day she turned a wounded hawk whole again, that the forest held a part of her soul.

On the fourth morning, they reached the ruins of Hollowmere — once a druidic village, now nothing but shattered stone and vine-choked altars. Elowen stopped at the edge, heart pounding. The stories she had heard as a child described Hollowmere as cursed, haunted by those who had tried to master nature rather than serve it. But there was something else in the air here — not malice, but sorrow. The kind of sorrow that lingers after betrayal.

They passed between two pillars covered in runes too faded to read. Elowen’s fingers brushed them and, for a heartbeat, the runes flickered with dull amber light. The village beyond was no more than fragments — broken hearthstones, sunken wells, firepits full of ash long cold. Yet the layout still whispered of meaning: a circle around a central hill, where a great tree once stood. Its stump remained, hollowed and cracked, wide enough to fit a horse. Around it lay bones — bird, deer, and something else, something wrong in shape.

“They died here,” Elowen said, crouching beside the stump. “Defending something.”

Dareth frowned. “From what?”

She didn’t answer. Instead, she stood, placed her palm against the stump’s dark heart, and closed her eyes. The world tilted. She felt herself sinking, not in body but in mind — pulled through the rings of memory, down through years etched into the wood.

She saw a gathering — druids in robes of ash and root, faces painted with blood. They chanted beneath the branches of the living tree, and in the center stood a child, no older than ten. The child wept, and the tree wept with her — leaves falling like tears.

A roar split the vision. Fire spilled across the clearing. Men in red armor descended with blades drawn. The druids fought, but their spells shattered against steel and flame. The child reached for the tree. Light exploded. Then silence.

Elowen gasped and staggered back. Dareth caught her before she fell.

“They sacrificed everything,” she whispered. “To protect her.”

“Who?”

“I don’t know,” she said. “But she was like me.”

They camped that night in the ruins, beneath stars visible through the broken canopy. Elowen didn’t sleep. She sat beside the old stump and stared into its hollow like it might speak again. Her power pulsed inside her — not violently, but steady, as if the forest were breathing with her.

Just past midnight, something moved between the stones. Dareth was already on his feet, hand on his hunting knife. Elowen raised a hand, signaling silence.

From the shadows came a figure — cloaked in bark and feathers, face obscured by a mask shaped like a stag’s skull. The figure stopped at the edge of the firelight, hands empty.

“You walked the memory,” the figure said, voice low and rough with time. “Few can. Fewer survive.”

Elowen stood. “Who are you?”

“A warden,” the figure replied. “One of the last.”

Elowen stepped closer, unafraid. “What was this place?”

“A sanctuary,” said the warden. “For those marked by the old wilds. For those who could not be caged.”

“She was one of us,” Elowen said. “The girl. The one they tried to protect.”

“She was the first beast-kin,” the warden said, voice hollow. “Born of forest and fury. The empire came to bind her. They failed. But the cost—”

“I saw it.”

The warden tilted his head. “You are her echo. The magic runs again.”

“I need to find the others,” Elowen said. “The scattered. The forgotten. Before the fire returns.”

“The fire never left,” the warden said. “It sleeps in the south. Fed by steel and fear. You must go north.”

“North?”

“To the Vale of Mourned Howls. There you will find the Feral Court. They remember the true way.”

“I thought they were myth,” Dareth said.

The warden chuckled dryly. “So are you.”

He tossed something toward Elowen — a pendant carved of bone and marked with the same fading runes as the ruined pillars. It was warm in her hand.

“They will know you by that. And by your silence.”

“Silence?” she asked.

“Beasts do not speak in tongues of men. Learn to listen.”

By morning, the warden was gone, and the air over Hollowmere felt thinner, emptied of something vital. Elowen and Dareth gathered their things and turned their feet northward, toward the Vale — a place spoken of in lullabies and warnings. It would be a long journey, through lands twisted by old wars and older magic, through the Spitewoods and across the Scorched Fen. But there was no doubt now — the path forward had been laid in ash and blood.

As they crossed into a thicket where the trees grew black and close, Elowen paused. She reached down to the moss and touched it gently. In her mind, she heard the faintest hum — a recognition, a greeting. The forest knew her now. And it would guide her.

But far to the south, in the halls of Windsreach, another fire kindled.

Tharelle stood in the great chapel, her reflection fractured in the stained glass. Behind her, Queen Arlayne knelt in prayer — not to gods, but to ancestors.

“She will not return,” Tharelle said.

Arlayne did not lift her head. “You do not know my daughter.”

“I know power,” Tharelle said. “And power left unchecked does not return. It conquers or dies.”

At that, the queen looked up, and in her eyes burned a quiet, undying defiance. “Perhaps you’ve mistaken her.”

Tharelle smiled faintly. “No. I’ve simply prepared for her. The chain she would break? I forged another.”

And in her private chamber, where the southern banners hung heavy and red, Tharelle opened a cage wrought of gold and bone.

Inside, the fox watched her.

Its eyes were still human.

Still Rilen.

Still burning.

They left Hollowmere at dawn, the ruined village retreating behind a veil of mist and shadow. The pendant given by the warden hung around Elowen’s neck, cool and oddly heavy, like it carried more than weight. Dareth walked beside her in silence, his hand never straying far from the hilt of his blade. Their path northward led them along the roots of the Blackspine Hills, where cliffs jutted like broken teeth and trees clawed at the sky. Every bird call and snapping twig set Dareth on edge, but Elowen seemed untroubled. If anything, she grew calmer the deeper they went.

By the third day, the air had grown thin and sharp. Frost rimed the edges of the leaves though summer still held the rest of Eldralore. It was a place the maps didn’t name, where the path curved strangely and the wind shifted without warning. That night they camped beneath a bent pine that smelled faintly of mint. Elowen built no fire. The forest here felt like it might reject flame.

Dareth sharpened his blade as she sat nearby, humming softly under her breath. The tune was strange, without beginning or end, but the forest seemed to hush itself to listen.

“You always hum when you’re thinking,” he said finally.

“I always hum when I’m listening,” she replied.

“To what?”

She looked up at him, her eyes reflecting the moonlight. “To the parts of the world that haven’t forgotten what I am.”

Dareth nodded slowly, as though he understood, though he didn’t truly. He understood her pain, her solitude, her strange silences — but not the weight of magic she carried, the beast that paced beneath her skin. He had watched her call a sparrow to her hand with a whisper, watched her still the breath of a dying fox and pull life back into its chest. She frightened him, sometimes. But that fear was never bigger than his loyalty.

They rose early the next day and reached the edge of the Spitewoods by noon. The trees here grew in tangled formations, knotted as if twisted in pain. The air buzzed faintly, like insects murmuring in a language only they understood. Dareth hesitated at the border.

“They say nothing grows here that wasn’t cursed,” he muttered.

Elowen stepped forward, placing a hand on one of the gnarled trunks. “Then perhaps they need reminding that curses can be undone.”

Inside, the forest felt like a wound. The light that filtered through the canopy was dim and stained, and the ground squelched beneath their feet. Shapes moved just at the edge of sight — not animals, but something older. Elowen walked with her head high, eyes steady. She did not fear this place, though she could feel the resistance in the soil, the sharp whisper of old magic offended by her presence.

They made camp that night beside a stream that ran black but smelled clean. Dareth tried to fish but caught only stones slick with slime. Elowen wandered away for a time and returned with berries glowing faintly red. Dareth eyed them warily.

“They look poisonous.”

“They’re dreamberries,” she said, sitting down beside him. “They help you see what the forest wants you to see.”

He shook his head. “I’ve had enough of seeing what I don’t understand.”

She didn’t push the issue, only popped one in her mouth and leaned back against a tree. For a while, neither spoke. A wind stirred through the trees, strange and chill.

Then, without warning, the forest went silent.

Dareth stood instantly. “Something’s wrong.”

Elowen was already on her feet. The stillness wasn’t just quiet — it was a warning. Even the insects had stopped. They moved quickly, leaving behind their camp and pushing deeper into the woods. Something followed them, unseen but near, a presence that moved like smoke and clung to the edges of the path.

By nightfall, they stumbled into a glade filled with stone carvings — crude faces with mouths sewn shut, eyes gouged out. Elowen paused at the edge. “This is a boundary.”

Dareth looked around uneasily. “Of what?”

“Of silence,” she whispered. “Of punishment.”

Before she could explain further, the shadows coalesced into a figure. It was taller than any man, its limbs long and knotted like old roots. Its head was crowned with twisted antlers, and its eyes burned with pale blue fire.

“You trespass,” it said, voice like wind through dry leaves.

“We seek the Feral Court,” Elowen said calmly, stepping forward. “I bear the sign of Hollowmere.”

The creature’s gaze dropped to the pendant. Its expression did not change, but the air shifted.

“The court does not suffer half-awakened ones. You are danger. You are change.”

“Then let them see me,” she said. “Let them decide.”

The creature was silent for a long moment, then turned. “Follow. But speak no lie. The trees remember.”

They were led through winding trails marked by symbols carved into the bark. At times the path doubled back on itself or seemed to lead them in circles, but Elowen did not protest. She understood the way of the old wilds — trust was not given, only earned through endurance.

At last, the trees parted, and they stood at the edge of a vast valley.

The Vale of Mourned Howls.

It was nothing like the songs. There were no ruins, no gold-tinged beasts or glittering rivers. It was raw and wild — mountains half-swallowed by cloud, valleys scarred by age, and at its heart a gathering unlike any Elowen had imagined.

They stood in rings — wolves that walked upright, women with antlers, men cloaked in feathers, children whose eyes glowed amber in the dark. The Feral Court. Not human, not beast — but both. The old bloodlines.

At the center stood a woman cloaked in gray fur, her face half-hidden by a hood shaped like a bear’s skull. Her presence radiated quiet strength.

“You are the storm’s child,” the woman said. “We felt your birth in the roots. Why have you come?”

Elowen stepped forward, unflinching. “To remember what was lost. To protect what remains. To stop what’s coming.”

“You are hunted,” the woman said. “By empire, by flame, by kin. Your power is not yet whole.”

“Then teach me.”

There was silence. Then the woman smiled — not with kindness, but approval.

“Then kneel, Elowen of Eldralore. Kneel and choose the beast.”

Elowen knelt.

The court closed in.

The choosing began.

The circle of the Feral Court closed around her, a living wall of ancient blood and memory. Their faces shifted in the firelight — some wholly human save for the flash of golden eyes, others more beast than man, all radiating the same sense of feral wisdom and coiled strength. The air inside the circle was heavy, thick with magic and the weight of judgment. Elowen knelt in the damp grass, her heart thrumming not with fear, but anticipation. She had felt untethered for so long — a creature of in-betweens, neither daughter nor queen, neither girl nor sorceress. But now, in the presence of these wild ones, something in her stirred. The fragments of her self began to knit.

The woman in the bear’s skull cloak stepped closer, bare feet silent against the earth. Her voice, when she spoke again, was neither soft nor loud, but it carried weight like a falling stone.

“We do not choose the beast. The beast chooses us. You must call it.”

“I don’t know how,” Elowen said, her voice steady, though her throat felt dry as dust.

“You do,” the woman said, bending until their foreheads almost touched. “You’ve simply been taught to forget.”

The ring of court members began to chant, a low humming that vibrated through the ground. The fire in the center flared, and the night around them shifted. Stars wheeled faster overhead. Wind pushed against the treetops. Dareth stood outside the circle, frozen, uncertain whether to intervene or kneel himself. But he held back. This was not his path.

“Let go of your name,” the woman whispered into Elowen’s ear. “Let go of your blood, your crown, your shame. Call the truth beneath the skin.”

Elowen closed her eyes. For a moment, she felt nothing but the cold bite of the night and the warmth of the fire. Then, deep within her, she felt it — a presence, familiar and waiting. It was not separate from her. It had always been there, pacing in the corners of her soul, watching her through the bars of fear and doubt.

She reached for it.

It surged toward her.

She gasped, falling forward onto her hands, the ground warm beneath her fingers. Her breath came fast, her skin tingled, and pain lanced through her spine. The court did not move. They only watched as the magic within her broke through the dam she had not known existed.

A low growl rose from her throat.

Not fear. Not rage.

Recognition.

Her back arched, her fingers clawed the soil, and her mouth opened in a sound that was not quite human — a cry, a howl, something in between.

The fire exploded upward in a pillar of light, and for a moment, she was elsewhere.

She stood in a forest untouched by time, surrounded by towering trees with leaves like mirrors and roots that sang. Before her stood a great white beast — a wolf with eyes of gold and fur streaked with blue light. It was beautiful and terrible, the shape of her power and her past. It stepped forward and pressed its forehead to hers.

You are not alone. You never were.

Then it was gone.

And she was kneeling in the Vale again, the court around her silent, watching.

Elowen stood slowly, her hands trembling, her hair wild, her eyes burning faintly with gold.

The woman in the bear’s skull cloak nodded once. “You have been chosen. Now the forest will answer.”

A ripple moved through the onlookers — a sound of approval, or perhaps awe. The chants faded. The fire dimmed. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf howled — a long, mourning note that was answered by others. The night had accepted her.

Later, as the court dispersed and the air cooled, Elowen sat with Dareth beside a low-burning fire. Her limbs ached, her thoughts moved slowly, but a strange peace had settled into her bones.

“You changed,” he said after a long silence.

“I remembered,” she said.

“Did it hurt?”

“No. Only the forgetting hurt.”

He offered her a strip of dried meat, which she took without comment. Around them, the Vale buzzed with the quiet rhythms of the Feral Court — laughter like wind, strange music played on reed and bone, conversations in tongues older than the kingdom.

“What happens now?” Dareth asked.

“I learn,” Elowen said. “And then I return.”

“To Windsreach?”

“To the empire. To the fire. To Tharelle.”

Dareth hesitated. “Are you strong enough?”

Elowen turned to him. “I don’t know. But I’m not alone anymore. And I think… maybe that’s enough.”

That night, she dreamed not of fire, but of running — fast and wild through endless forest, the white wolf at her side and other shapes in the shadows: a stag with eyes like moonlight, a serpent of glass, a bear with a voice that shook the stars. They were watching her, waiting.

She woke before dawn.

The next days were a blur of trial and transformation. The Feral Court did not teach through words or scrolls. They taught through experience. Elowen ran with the wolves and swam in freezing mountain streams. She fought with tooth and claw, learned to mimic bird calls, to follow the scent of strangers on the wind. She learned to breathe without sound, to sit so still that foxes walked past her unafraid.

But most of all, she learned to speak with her magic.

The beast within her was no longer a prison. It was a companion. When she called, it answered. When she faltered, it steadied her.

Each night, the court gathered and shared stories in the language of flame and gesture. And each night, Elowen grew more certain of her place in the world — not as heir, not as threat, but as something new entirely. A bridge between the forgotten and the future.

One morning, as frost touched the edge of the vale and the breath of winter stirred in the north, the woman in the bear cloak approached her once more.

“You are ready,” she said simply.

“I don’t feel ready.”

“You won’t. Until you are.”

Elowen looked out across the vale, watching the court stir in the morning light — children chasing deer, elders carving runes into bone, a lynx sleeping atop a pile of stone.

“I thought I would stay longer.”

“You must not linger. The empire moves. And something dark follows its shadow. You have heard it.”

Elowen nodded. The dreams had changed — no longer fire, but a deeper blackness. Not the emptiness of death, but the hunger of something that consumed even memory. A name whispered without sound.

She turned to Dareth, who was already preparing their packs.

“You knew we wouldn’t stay,” he said, without looking up.

She smiled faintly. “You know me too well.”

“Not well enough to understand what you’ve become. But well enough to follow.”

They left the Vale before noon, walking east through a pass known only to the court. Their destination was not yet clear, only their direction — toward fire, toward confrontation, toward whatever Tharelle was building in the south.

As they passed beyond the borders of the Vale, the pendant at Elowen’s throat pulsed once with warmth. The forest behind them sighed, and somewhere above, a falcon circled.

Whatever came next, Elowen was no longer afraid.

The beast had chosen.

And she would not run.

Chapter Three: Embers Beneath the Crown

The lowlands east of the Vale stretched before them like an open wound — fields once green now stripped bare, the soil ash-grey and brittle beneath their boots. As Elowen and Dareth made their way through the rolling hills, the air grew heavy with the scent of iron and smoke. The quiet hum of life that had followed them through the wilds faded behind them. In its place: silence that pressed against their ears, broken only by the whisper of wind over abandoned roads.

“Someone’s burned these lands,” Dareth muttered, crouching to run his fingers through a patch of charred grass. “Recently.”

Elowen knelt beside him, palm flat on the earth. The warmth lingered just beneath the surface, like the memory of fire. She closed her eyes. The land was trying to speak, but its voice was hoarse and strained, like a creature too long wounded.

“It wasn’t just fire,” she said. “It was something... wrong. The roots are screaming.”

Dareth stood, his brow furrowed. “If this is Tharelle’s doing—”

“She’s not working alone,” Elowen cut in. “This isn’t her magic. Hers burns, yes, but this—this corrodes. This eats everything, even the memory of what was.”

They pressed onward, the road twisting past villages reduced to ruins. Burned-out homes leaned like drunks against blackened fences. In one hamlet, they found the remains of a stone well—its water black, reflecting no sky. Strange marks were scratched into the wooden doors that still stood, spirals intersected with harsh diagonal slashes. Elowen touched one and felt a jolt up her arm, a flash of cold that made her teeth ache.

That night, they camped inside the shell of a collapsed barn. Dareth slept lightly, his blade near his hand, while Elowen sat cross-legged in the hay, trying to reach the voice of the wild that had become her anchor. But the forest was far behind, and here the land was fractured. When sleep finally came, it did so roughly.

She dreamed of cages.

Cages made of bone. Of trees bent into bars, of animals twisted into mockeries of themselves. She saw wolves with burning eyes, birds whose wings dripped molten metal. At the center of the dream stood Tharelle, clothed in flame, her hands outstretched as golden chains slithered from her sleeves like snakes. Behind her was a throne — not of gold, but of flesh and antler and claw.

Elowen woke with a cry, breath sharp in her throat.

Dareth was already alert, crouched at the edge of the barn’s crumbled doorway.

“I heard something,” he whispered.

Elowen joined him, the night around them thick as wool. Beyond the barn, the road was dim, lit faintly by a sliver of moonlight. Movement flickered at the edge of sight — low, crawling, unnatural. Elowen raised her hand instinctively, her pulse syncing with the thrum of power at her core. The earth answered, but faintly. Something dulled it here.

Shapes emerged — not men, not beasts, but something in between. Twisted forms that walked upright but hunched like apes, their faces blank save for a single eye in the center of their forehead. Their skin was the color of wet stone, and their mouths stretched far too wide. Dareth raised his blade.

“Don’t,” Elowen said sharply. “They’re not alive. Not fully.”

She stepped forward, holding the pendant from Hollowmere out in front of her. The creatures paused, sniffing the air, swaying like reeds. One shuddered and made a wet, gurgling noise. Then, as one, they turned and slithered back into the darkness.

Dareth stared. “What in the void were those?”

“Remnants,” Elowen said. “What’s left after the soul’s been torn out. Something’s using them. Hollow things.”

“Is this the empire’s doing?”

“No,” she said. “Something deeper. Something older. The empire’s just the hand. This… this is the voice that tells it where to strike.”

The next day they followed the road to a fortress town marked on no recent map. Wyrn’s Hollow, Dareth called it, a place once used by hunters and trappers before the wars. It stood partially crumbled, its outer walls overgrown with ivy and moss. But smoke curled from the chimneys of the keep, and banners flapped from the tower — not those of Eldralore, nor Kirell, but black cloth stitched with the sigil of a white spiral.

The same mark scratched into the burned villages.

“They’ve moved in,” Elowen said grimly. “Whoever they are.”

Dareth shifted uneasily. “We’re not ready for a siege.”

“We won’t attack,” she said. “We’ll infiltrate. At night.”

Under cover of dark, they crept along the outer wall, weaving through the overgrowth. Elowen whispered a simple cloaking charm she’d learned from the feral ones — not invisibility, but distraction. The eye would slide past them, the ear would forget their steps. Inside the walls, they moved like ghosts.

The keep was quiet, the doors unguarded. Too easy.

Inside, the halls were dim, lit by torches burning a pale blue flame. They passed rooms filled with strange symbols — circles etched into the floor, bones arranged in star shapes. In one chamber, a massive mirror stretched from floor to ceiling, its glass rippling like water. A woman stood before it, robed in crimson.

Elowen froze.

It wasn’t Tharelle — this woman’s features were obscured by a mask of polished wood, her fingers elongated unnaturally.

“I know you’re here,” the woman said without turning.

Elowen raised her hand, ready to call the beast, but something held her back.

“I can feel the forest in you,” the woman continued, voice low and rich. “But it’s thin. You’ve come far, but not far enough.”

“Who are you?” Elowen asked.

The woman turned. Her mask was blank, but power radiated from her like heat from a forge.

“I am the one who breaks names,” she said. “I am the one who found the fire sleeping and gave it form. The empire calls me Whisper-Mother. You may call me foe.”

“Why corrupt the land?” Elowen demanded. “Why twist the wild things?”

“To cleanse them,” the Whisper-Mother said. “The world must be remade. The wild is broken. Your kind — the beast-blooded — are cracks in the surface. We will seal them. Burn them smooth.”

“You think your fire purifies?” Elowen stepped forward. “It only devours.”

“Devouring is cleansing,” the Whisper-Mother replied.

Dareth gripped her shoulder. “We need to leave. Now.”

But Elowen stood her ground.

“This isn’t over,” she said.

“No,” the Whisper-Mother said. “This is only the start. Tell the court of beasts their age ends soon. And tell the crown — I will teach Tharelle how to make a leash from your bones.”

The mirror flared.

Light swallowed the room.

When Elowen blinked again, they were outside the fortress, thrown clear by the magic like leaves in a gale. She sat up, coughing, the taste of copper in her mouth.

Dareth groaned beside her, bleeding from one arm.

Elowen looked back at the keep. It was still, silent, not a torch in sight.

She rose to her feet.

“We have to warn them,” she said. “The Feral Court. My mother. Everyone.”

Dareth wiped his mouth. “You think they’ll listen?”

“They have to,” she said. “Or there’ll be nothing left to listen with.”

And so they ran — south through the broken fields, toward fire and memory and war.

The wind turned against them the farther they ran. It howled through the jagged hills and shallow passes like a wounded thing, flinging dust into their eyes and battering them with invisible hands. Elowen could feel it — not a storm of weather, but of magic. A tide rising from the south, swelling with each hour. The Whisper-Mother's power wasn’t just growing; it was spreading, reaching into the cracks of the world like creeping frost. Trees whispered of it as they passed, leaves shuddering though no branch moved. Even the earth pulsed beneath Elowen’s boots, a heartbeat that no longer beat in rhythm with her own.

By the fourth day, they reached a cluster of settlements nestled beneath the cliffs of Glynmoor. The villagers had barricaded themselves in with old wood and rusted iron, makeshift walls barely standing. Dareth approached first, hands raised, while Elowen remained just behind, the pendant tucked into her tunic and her senses stretched wide.

The villagers were wary but let them in. Their faces bore the grime of fear — wide eyes, sunken cheeks, twitching movements like animals who knew the predator still watched. They gathered in a crumbling tavern that smelled of oil and stale bread. The leader, an older woman with a crooked nose and the sharp, assessing look of someone who had buried too many, introduced herself as Maela.

“We’ve had visitors like you,” she said after hearing their names. “Not long ago. Wore fine armor. Said the empire was coming to make things right.”

“And you believed them?” Dareth asked.

“No. But the people wanted to. It’s easier to kneel than fight when your children are hungry.”

Elowen spoke softly. “They’ll turn you into weapons. If they can't, they’ll burn what’s left.”

Maela looked away. “They already took six of ours. Said they were to be tested. We haven’t seen them since.”

Elowen’s hand curled into a fist. “We’re going to Windsreach. The court must be warned.”

Maela nodded. “Then take this road,” she said, pointing to a thin, winding trail on a faded map. “Avoid the valley. It’s gone strange.”

That night, Elowen walked alone beneath the cliffs while Dareth slept. She tried to speak with the birds, the trees, anything that still answered, but everything was quiet, dulled like the world had been wrapped in wax. It left her feeling hollow.

Suddenly, she heard it — not sound, but memory. A song, half-forgotten, threading through her mind like the echo of a lullaby her mother once hummed. It tugged her toward a narrow crevice in the cliffside. She followed.

Inside, the air was cool, the walls slick with moisture. Moss glowed faintly beneath her fingertips. The path narrowed and then opened into a chamber no larger than a chapel. At its center, a pool of still water reflected the stone above with perfect clarity. A tree root arched above it, and carved into it were words in an ancient tongue. She did not need to read them to understand their meaning. They were a vow, a warning, a prayer.

The pool rippled, and Elowen leaned closer.

A vision swelled beneath the surface: the Feral Court ringed in flame, their faces twisted not in fear, but fury. Tharelle stood at the front of a battalion, her blade raised high, its edge crackling with red fire. And behind her — behind them all — came the creatures. The Hollow. The name-breakers. A tide of bodies and blank eyes and devoured memories.

Elowen gasped and stumbled back. The vision vanished.

When she returned to camp, Dareth was already awake, his knife drawn.

“You vanished,” he said tightly.

“I found something,” she said. “A warning. The fire is moving faster than we thought.”

They departed at first light, taking the trail Maela had shown them. It led through winding ravines and across old bridges held together by nothing more than root and rust. The land here felt thinner — not dead, but eroded, like too many footsteps had walked it with no purpose. They passed shrines overgrown with ivy, statues crumbled to unrecognizable stumps. Elowen murmured a blessing as they went, unsure who might be listening, but unwilling to let the silence win.

Three nights later, they reached the outlying woods of Windsreach. The air here felt different — heavy, electric. The castle itself, once a distant shape framed by mountains, now loomed nearer with each hour. Smoke rose from its towers — not the smoke of hearth or forge, but thick plumes tinged with red.

“Elowen,” Dareth said quietly. “Do you see that?”

She followed his gaze. Along the western road, soldiers moved in slow columns. They wore the red and gold of Kirell, but there were no banners, no horns. Their heads hung low. They marched like men going to a grave.

“Controlled,” she said. “Tharelle’s binding them.”

“They don’t look bound.”

“She doesn’t need chains. She uses oaths, fear, fire in the blood.”

They skirted the road and made for the old path through the forest, the one Elowen had used to escape weeks ago. It was narrower now, trees pressed in tighter, but the route remained. As they moved, Elowen felt a flicker of warmth in her pendant. She pressed her fingers to it. The forest was reaching out.

“She knows I’m close,” Elowen murmured. “The land feels it.”

By nightfall they arrived at the edge of the southern forest bordering Windsreach. There, a figure waited — cloaked, tall, arms folded. For a heartbeat, Elowen thought it might be one of the Feral Court. But then she saw the eyes — pale, cold, calculating.

It was Tharelle.

Flanked by two guards with glass eyes and ash-pale skin, she stood like a queen sculpted from fire and will.

“Elowen,” she said smoothly. “You came home.”

“This isn’t my home anymore,” Elowen replied, stepping forward.

“Strange,” Tharelle said. “It’s the only place your blood still stains the stones.”

Dareth stepped in front of Elowen, but she brushed past him.

“What are you doing to them?” she asked, motioning to the guards.

“Giving them purpose. A world without chaos, without pain. Order. Peace.”

“Peace built on chains is still war,” Elowen said.

“Spoken like a wildling,” Tharelle said with a soft smile. “Did the beasts teach you to howl at the sun and hope it burns less?”

“They taught me not to kneel.”

Tharelle’s eyes narrowed. “You should have knelt. You would have ruled beside me. Now you’ll die behind them.”

The wind shifted. The trees groaned.

From the shadows, wolves stepped forward.

Not ordinary wolves — larger, eyes bright with memory, fur streaked with silver and midnight.

The Feral Court had come.

Tharelle’s smile vanished. “So you brought your pack.”

Elowen drew herself tall. “I didn’t bring them. They came.”

Behind her, the court gathered — not just wolves, but stags, serpents, ravens, men and women who bore the marks of old blood, claws and teeth and the light of magic in their eyes.

“This land does not belong to empires,” Elowen said. “It belongs to those who remember.”

Tharelle stepped back. For the first time, her hand trembled on her sword hilt.

“Then remember this,” she said. “I offered mercy. Now I offer flame.”

And with a whisper, she vanished into smoke.

The trees caught fire where she had stood.

Elowen turned to her court. “We ride tonight. No more running. No more silence. We take back the heart of Eldralore.”

And as the fire roared behind them, the court howled — a sound that echoed across the kingdom, and was answered by beasts waking in every corner of the world.

Chapter Four: The Siege of Silence

The skies above Windsreach darkened unnaturally. Where once stars would have gleamed behind tattered clouds, now only a bruised pall hung over the castle and its surrounding hills. As the Feral Court took position along the forest’s edge, Elowen felt the weight of years pressing on her shoulders—not just her own years, but those of the land itself, of the old bloodlines, of everything that had been lost while kings squabbled and empires bloated with their own hunger. She stood at the head of a gathering not seen in generations: druids wrapped in root and bone, warriors with the spirits of animals in their veins, creatures half-man, half-beast who had slept in myths but now stepped boldly into dawn.

Behind them, the forest pulsed with awareness. It would not remain a silent witness.

Dareth stood beside her, his cloak damp with dew, his blade newly sharpened and gleaming in the faint morning light. He had said little since their encounter with Tharelle. It was as if some part of him—something deep and quiet—had curled in on itself. Elowen understood. There were no words that could prepare someone for what was coming.

They were not storming a fortress.

They were confronting a new world.

The walls of Windsreach had changed. Where once ivy had climbed in lazy spirals and stone bore the patient cracks of age, now shimmering sigils had been burned into the mortar, and metal spines rose from the parapets like the bones of some petrified beast. Watchtowers glowed with eerie light, and t
