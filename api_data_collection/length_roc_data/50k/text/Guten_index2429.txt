Subienkow had travelled a long trail of bitterness and horror, homing like a dove for the capitals of Europe, and here, farther away than ever, in Russian America, the trail ceased.  He sat in the snow, arms tied behind him, waiting the torture.  He stared curiously before him at a huge Cossack, prone in the snow, moaning in his pain. The men had finished handling the giant and turned him over to the women. That they exceeded the fiendishness of the men, the man’s cries attested.  Subienkow looked on, and shuddered.  He was not afraid to die.  He had carried his life too long in his hands, on that weary trail from Warsaw to Nulato, to shudder at mere dying.  But he objected to the torture.  It offended his soul.  And this offence, in turn, was not due to the mere pain he must endure, but to the sorry spectacle the pain would make of him.  He knew that he would pray, and beg, and entreat, even as Big Ivan and the others that had gone before.  This would not be nice.  To pass out bravely and cleanly, with a smile and a jest—ah! that would have been the way.  But to lose control, to have his soul upset by the pangs of the flesh, to screech and gibber like an ape, to become the veriest beast—ah, that was what was so terrible.  There had been no chance to escape.  From the beginning, when he dreamed the fiery dream of Poland’s independence, he had become a puppet in the hands of Fate.  From the beginning, at Warsaw, at St. Petersburg, in the Siberian mines, in Kamtchatka, on the crazy boats of the fur-thieves, Fate had been driving him to this end.  Without doubt, in the foundations of the world was graved this end for him—for him, who was so fine and sensitive, whose nerves scarcely sheltered under his skin, who was a dreamer, and a poet, and an artist.  Before he was dreamed of, it had been determined that the quivering bundle of sensitiveness that constituted him should be doomed to live in raw and howling savagery, and to die in this far land of night, in this dark place beyond the last boundaries of the world.  He sighed.  So that thing before him was Big Ivan—Big Ivan the giant, the man without nerves, the man of iron, the Cossack turned freebooter of the seas, who was as phlegmatic as an ox, with a nervous system so low that what was pain to ordinary men was scarcely a tickle to him.  Well, well, trust these Nulato Indians to find Big Ivan’s nerves and trace them to the roots of his quivering soul.  They were certainly doing it.  It was inconceivable that a man could suffer so much and yet live.  Big Ivan was paying for his low order of nerves.  Already he had lasted twice as long as any of the others.  Subienkow felt that he could not stand the Cossack’s sufferings much longer.  Why didn’t Ivan die?  He would go mad if that screaming did not cease.  But when it did cease, his turn would come.  And there was Yakaga awaiting him, too, grinning at him even now in anticipation—Yakaga, whom only last week he had kicked out of the fort, and upon whose face he had laid the lash of his dog-whip.  Yakaga would attend to him.  Doubtlessly Yakaga was saving for him more refined tortures, more exquisite nerve-racking.  Ah! that must have been a good one, from the way Ivan screamed.  The squaws bending over him stepped back with laughter and clapping of hands.  Subienkow saw the monstrous thing that had been perpetrated, and began to laugh hysterically.  The Indians looked at him in wonderment that he should laugh.  But Subienkow could not stop.  This would never do.  He controlled himself, the spasmodic twitchings slowly dying away.  He strove to think of other things, and began reading back in his own life.  He remembered his mother and his father, and the little spotted pony, and the French tutor who had taught him dancing and sneaked him an old worn copy of Voltaire.  Once more he saw Paris, and dreary London, and gay Vienna, and Rome.  And once more he saw that wild group of youths who had dreamed, even as he, the dream of an independent Poland with a king of Poland on the throne at Warsaw.  Ah, there it was that the long trail began.  Well, he had lasted longest.  One by one, beginning with the two executed at St. Petersburg, he took up the count of the passing of those brave spirits.  Here one had been beaten to death by a jailer, and there, on that bloodstained highway of the exiles, where they had marched for endless months, beaten and maltreated by their Cossack guards, another had dropped by the way.  Always it had been savagery—brutal, bestial savagery.  They had died—of fever, in the mines, under the knout.  The last two had died after the escape, in the battle with the Cossacks, and he alone had won to Kamtchatka with the stolen papers and the money of a traveller he had left lying in the snow.  It had been nothing but savagery.  All the years, with his heart in studios, and theatres, and courts, he had been hemmed in by savagery.  He had purchased his life with blood.  Everybody had killed.  He had killed that traveller for his passports.  He had proved that he was a man of parts by duelling with two Russian officers on a single day.  He had had to prove himself in order to win to a place among the fur-thieves.  He had had to win to that place.  Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.  He could not escape that way.  The only way was ahead, across the dark and icy sea of Bering to Alaska.  The way had led from savagery to deeper savagery.  On the scurvy-rotten ships of the fur-thieves, out of food and out of water, buffeted by the interminable storms of that stormy sea, men had become animals.  Thrice he had sailed east from Kamtchatka.  And thrice, after all manner of hardship and suffering, the survivors had come back to Kamtchatka.  There had been no outlet for escape, and he could not go back the way he had come, for the mines and the knout awaited him.  Again, the fourth and last time, he had sailed east.  He had been with those who first found the fabled Seal Islands; but he had not returned with them to share the wealth of furs in the mad orgies of Kamtchatka. He had sworn never to go back.  He knew that to win to those dear capitals of Europe he must go on.  So he had changed ships and remained in the dark new land.  His comrades were Slavonian hunters and Russian adventurers, Mongols and Tartars and Siberian aborigines; and through the savages of the new world they had cut a path of blood.  They had massacred whole villages that refused to furnish the fur-tribute; and they, in turn, had been massacred by ships’ companies.  He, with one Finn, had been the sole survivor of such a company.  They had spent a winter of solitude and starvation on a lonely Aleutian isle, and their rescue in the spring by another fur-ship had been one chance in a thousand.  But always the terrible savagery had hemmed him in.  Passing from ship to ship, and ever refusing to return, he had come to the ship that explored south.  All down the Alaska coast they had encountered nothing but hosts of savages.  Every anchorage among the beetling islands or under the frowning cliffs of the mainland had meant a battle or a storm.  Either the gales blew, threatening destruction, or the war canoes came off, manned by howling natives with the war-paint on their faces, who came to learn the bloody virtues of the sea-rovers’ gunpowder.  South, south they had coasted, clear to the myth-land of California.  Here, it was said, were Spanish adventurers who had fought their way up from Mexico.  He had had hopes of those Spanish adventurers.  Escaping to them, the rest would have been easy—a year or two, what did it matter more or less—and he would win to Mexico, then a ship, and Europe would be his.  But they had met no Spaniards.  Only had they encountered the same impregnable wall of savagery.  The denizens of the confines of the world, painted for war, had driven them back from the shores.  At last, when one boat was cut off and every man killed, the commander had abandoned the quest and sailed back to the north.  The years had passed.  He had served under Tebenkoff when Michaelovski Redoubt was built.  He had spent two years in the Kuskokwim country.  Two summers, in the month of June, he had managed to be at the head of Kotzebue Sound.  Here, at this time, the tribes assembled for barter; here were to be found spotted deerskins from Siberia, ivory from the Diomedes, walrus skins from the shores of the Arctic, strange stone lamps, passing in trade from tribe to tribe, no one knew whence, and, once, a hunting-knife of English make; and here, Subienkow knew, was the school in which to learn geography.  For he met Eskimos from Norton Sound, from King Island and St. Lawrence Island, from Cape Prince of Wales, and Point Barrow.  Such places had other names, and their distances were measured in days.  It was a vast region these trading savages came from, and a vaster region from which, by repeated trade, their stone lamps and that steel knife had come.  Subienkow bullied, and cajoled, and bribed.  Every far-journeyer or strange tribesman was brought before him.  Perils unaccountable and unthinkable were mentioned, as well as wild beasts, hostile tribes, impenetrable forests, and mighty mountain ranges; but always from beyond came the rumour and the tale of white-skinned men, blue of eye and fair of hair, who fought like devils and who sought always for furs.  They were to the east—far, far to the east.  No one had seen them.  It was the word that had been passed along.  It was a hard school.  One could not learn geography very well through the medium of strange dialects, from dark minds that mingled fact and fable and that measured distances by “sleeps” that varied according to the difficulty of the going.  But at last came the whisper that gave Subienkow courage.  In the east lay a great river where were these blue-eyed men.  The river was called the Yukon.  South of Michaelovski Redoubt emptied another great river which the Russians knew as the Kwikpak.  These two rivers were one, ran the whisper.  Subienkow returned to Michaelovski.  For a year he urged an expedition up the Kwikpak.  Then arose Malakoff, the Russian half-breed, to lead the wildest and most ferocious of the hell’s broth of mongrel adventurers who had crossed from Kamtchatka.  Subienkow was his lieutenant.  They threaded the mazes of the great delta of the Kwikpak, picked up the first low hills on the northern bank, and for half a thousand miles, in skin canoes loaded to the gunwales with trade-goods and ammunition, fought their way against the five-knot current of a river that ran from two to ten miles wide in a channel many fathoms deep.  Malakoff decided to build the fort at Nulato.  Subienkow urged to go farther.  But he quickly reconciled himself to Nulato.  The long winter was coming on.  It would be better to wait.  Early the following summer, when the ice was gone, he would disappear up the Kwikpak and work his way to the Hudson Bay Company’s posts.  Malakoff had never heard the whisper that the Kwikpak was the Yukon, and Subienkow did not tell him.  Came the building of the fort.  It was enforced labour.  The tiered walls of logs arose to the sighs and groans of the Nulato Indians.  The lash was laid upon their backs, and it was the iron hand of the freebooters of the sea that laid on the lash.  There were Indians that ran away, and when they were caught they were brought back and spread-eagled before the fort, where they and their tribe learned the efficacy of the knout.  Two died under it; others were injured for life; and the rest took the lesson to heart and ran away no more.  The snow was flying ere the fort was finished, and then it was the time for furs.  A heavy tribute was laid upon the tribe.  Blows and lashings continued, and that the tribute should be paid, the women and children were held as hostages and treated with the barbarity that only the fur-thieves knew.  Well, it had been a sowing of blood, and now was come the harvest.  The fort was gone.  In the light of its burning, half the fur-thieves had been cut down.  The other half had passed under the torture.  Only Subienkow remained, or Subienkow and Big Ivan, if that whimpering, moaning thing in the snow could be called Big Ivan.  Subienkow caught Yakaga grinning at him.  There was no gainsaying Yakaga.  The mark of the lash was still on his face.  After all, Subienkow could not blame him, but he disliked the thought of what Yakaga would do to him.  He thought of appealing to Makamuk, the head-chief; but his judgment told him that such appeal was useless.  Then, too, he thought of bursting his bonds and dying fighting.  Such an end would be quick.  But he could not break his bonds.  Caribou thongs were stronger than he.  Still devising, another thought came to him.  He signed for Makamuk, and that an interpreter who knew the coast dialect should be brought.  “Oh, Makamuk,” he said, “I am not minded to die.  I am a great man, and it were foolishness for me to die.  In truth, I shall not die.  I am not like these other carrion.”  He looked at the moaning thing that had once been Big Ivan, and stirred it contemptuously with his toe.  “I am too wise to die.  Behold, I have a great medicine.  I alone know this medicine.  Since I am not going to die, I shall exchange this medicine with you.”  “What is this medicine?” Makamuk demanded.  “It is a strange medicine.”  Subienkow debated with himself for a moment, as if loth to part with the secret.  “I will tell you.  A little bit of this medicine rubbed on the skin makes the skin hard like a rock, hard like iron, so that no cutting weapon can cut it.  The strongest blow of a cutting weapon is a vain thing against it.  A bone knife becomes like a piece of mud; and it will turn the edge of the iron knives we have brought among you.  What will you give me for the secret of the medicine?”  “I will give you your life,” Makamuk made answer through the interpreter.  Subienkow laughed scornfully.  “And you shall be a slave in my house until you die.”  The Pole laughed more scornfully.  “Untie my hands and feet and let us talk,” he said.  The chief made the sign; and when he was loosed Subienkow rolled a cigarette and lighted it.  “This is foolish talk,” said Makamuk.  “There is no such medicine.  It cannot be.  A cutting edge is stronger than any medicine.”  The chief was incredulous, and yet he wavered.  He had seen too many deviltries of fur-thieves that worked.  He could not wholly doubt.  “I will give you your life; but you shall not be a slave,” he announced.  “More than that.”  Subienkow played his game as coolly as if he were bartering for a foxskin.  “It is a very great medicine.  It has saved my life many times.  I want a sled and dogs, and six of your hunters to travel with me down the river and give me safety to one day’s sleep from Michaelovski Redoubt.”  “You must live here, and teach us all of your deviltries,” was the reply.  Subienkow shrugged his shoulders and remained silent.  He blew cigarette smoke out on the icy air, and curiously regarded what remained of the big Cossack.  “That scar!” Makamuk said suddenly, pointing to the Pole’s neck, where a livid mark advertised the slash of a knife in a Kamtchatkan brawl.  “The medicine is not good.  The cutting edge was stronger than the medicine.”  “It was a strong man that drove the stroke.”  (Subienkow considered.) “Stronger than you, stronger than your strongest hunter, stronger than he.”  Again, with the toe of his moccasin, he touched the Cossack—a grisly spectacle, no longer conscious—yet in whose dismembered body the pain-racked life clung and was loth to go.  “Also, the medicine was weak.  For at that place there were no berries of a certain kind, of which I see you have plenty in this country.  The medicine here will be strong.”  “I will let you go down river,” said Makamuk; “and the sled and the dogs and the six hunters to give you safety shall be yours.”  “You are slow,” was the cool rejoinder.  “You have committed an offence against my medicine in that you did not at once accept my terms.  Behold, I now demand more.  I want one hundred beaver skins.”  (Makamuk sneered.)  “I want one hundred pounds of dried fish.”  (Makamuk nodded, for fish were plentiful and cheap.)  “I want two sleds—one for me and one for my furs and fish.  And my rifle must be returned to me.  If you do not like the price, in a little while the price will grow.”  Yakaga whispered to the chief.  “But how can I know your medicine is true medicine?” Makamuk asked.  “It is very easy.  First, I shall go into the woods—”  Again Yakaga whispered to Makamuk, who made a suspicious dissent.  “You can send twenty hunters with me,” Subienkow went on.  “You see, I must get the berries and the roots with which to make the medicine. Then, when you have brought the two sleds and loaded on them the fish and the beaver skins and the rifle, and when you have told off the six hunters who will go with me—then, when all is ready, I will rub the medicine on my neck, so, and lay my neck there on that log.  Then can your strongest hunter take the axe and strike three times on my neck. You yourself can strike the three times.”  Makamuk stood with gaping mouth, drinking in this latest and most wonderful magic of the fur-thieves.  “But first,” the Pole added hastily, “between each blow I must put on fresh medicine.  The axe is heavy and sharp, and I want no mistakes.”  “All that you have asked shall be yours,” Makamuk cried in a rush of acceptance.  “Proceed to make your medicine.”  Subienkow concealed his elation.  He was playing a desperate game, and there must be no slips.  He spoke arrogantly.  “You have been slow.  My medicine is offended.  To make the offence clean you must give me your daughter.”  He pointed to the girl, an unwholesome creature, with a cast in one eye and a bristling wolf-tooth.  Makamuk was angry, but the Pole remained imperturbable, rolling and lighting another cigarette.  “Make haste,” he threatened.  “If you are not quick, I shall demand yet more.”  In the silence that followed, the dreary northland scene faded before him, and he saw once more his native land, and France, and, once, as he glanced at the wolf-toothed girl, he remembered another girl, a singer and a dancer, whom he had known when first as a youth he came to Paris.  “What do you want with the girl?” Makamuk asked.  “To go down the river with me.”  Subienkow glanced over her critically. “She will make a good wife, and it is an honour worthy of my medicine to be married to your blood.”  Again he remembered the singer and dancer and hummed aloud a song she had taught him.  He lived the old life over, but in a detached, impersonal sort of way, looking at the memory-pictures of his own life as if they were pictures in a book of anybody’s life.  The chief’s voice, abruptly breaking the silence, startled him  “It shall be done,” said Makamuk.  “The girl shall go down the river with you.  But be it understood that I myself strike the three blows with the axe on your neck.”  “But each time I shall put on the medicine,” Subienkow answered, with a show of ill-concealed anxiety.  “You shall put the medicine on between each blow.  Here are the hunters who shall see you do not escape.  Go into the forest and gather your medicine.”  Makamuk had been convinced of the worth of the medicine by the Pole’s rapacity.  Surely nothing less than the greatest of medicines could enable a man in the shadow of death to stand up and drive an old-woman’s bargain.  “Besides,” whispered Yakaga, when the Pole, with his guard, had disappeared among the spruce trees, “when you have learned the medicine you can easily destroy him.”  “But how can I destroy him?” Makamuk argued.  “His medicine will not let me destroy him.”  “There will be some part where he has not rubbed the medicine,” was Yakaga’s reply.  “We will destroy him through that part.  It may be his ears.  Very well; we will thrust a spear in one ear and out the other. Or it may be his eyes.  Surely the medicine will be much too strong to rub on his eyes.”  The chief nodded.  “You are wise, Yakaga.  If he possesses no other devil-things, we will then destroy him.”  Subienkow did not waste time in gathering the ingredients for his medicine, he selected whatsoever came to hand such as spruce needles, the inner bark of the willow, a strip of birch bark, and a quantity of moss-berries, which he made the hunters dig up for him from beneath the snow.  A few frozen roots completed his supply, and he led the way back to camp.  Makamuk and Yakaga crouched beside him, noting the quantities and kinds of the ingredients he dropped into the pot of boiling water.  “You must be careful that the moss-berries go in first,” he explained.  “And—oh, yes, one other thing—the finger of a man.  Here, Yakaga, let me cut off your finger.”  But Yakaga put his hands behind him and scowled.  “Just a small finger,” Subienkow pleaded.  “Yakaga, give him your finger,” Makamuk commanded.  “There be plenty of fingers lying around,” Yakaga grunted, indicating the human wreckage in the snow of the score of persons who had been tortured to death.  “It must be the finger of a live man,” the Pole objected.  “Then shall you have the finger of a live man.”  Yakaga strode over to the Cossack and sliced off a finger.  “He is not yet dead,” he announced, flinging the bloody trophy in the snow at the Pole’s feet.  “Also, it is a good finger, because it is large.”  Subienkow dropped it into the fire under the pot and began to sing.  It was a French love-song that with great solemnity he sang into the brew.  “Without these words I utter into it, the medicine is worthless,” he explained.  “The words are the chiefest strength of it.  Behold, it is ready.”  “Name the words slowly, that I may know them,” Makamuk commanded.  “Not until after the test.  When the axe flies back three times from my neck, then will I give you the secret of the words.”  “But if the medicine is not good medicine?” Makamuk queried anxiously.  Subienkow turned upon him wrathfully.  “My medicine is always good.  However, if it is not good, then do by me as you have done to the others.  Cut me up a bit at a time, even as you have cut him up.”  He pointed to the Cossack.  “The medicine is now cool. Thus, I rub it on my neck, saying this further medicine.”  With great gravity he slowly intoned a line of the “Marseillaise,” at the same time rubbing the villainous brew thoroughly into his neck.  An outcry interrupted his play-acting.  The giant Cossack, with a last resurgence of his tremendous vitality, had arisen to his knees.  Laughter and cries of surprise and applause arose from the Nulatos, as Big Ivan began flinging himself about in the snow with mighty spasms.  Subienkow was made sick by the sight, but he mastered his qualms and made believe to be angry.  “This will not do,” he said.  “Finish him, and then we will make the test.  Here, you, Yakaga, see that his noise ceases.”  While this was being done, Subienkow turned to Makamuk.  “And remember, you are to strike hard.  This is not baby-work.  Here, take the axe and strike the log, so that I can see you strike like a man.”  Makamuk obeyed, striking twice, precisely and with vigour, cutting out a large chip.  “It is well.”  Subienkow looked about him at the circle of savage faces that somehow seemed to symbolize the wall of savagery that had hemmed him about ever since the Czar’s police had first arrested him in Warsaw. “Take your axe, Makamuk, and stand so.  I shall lie down.  When I raise my hand, strike, and strike with all your might.  And be careful that no one stands behind you.  The medicine is good, and the axe may bounce from off my neck and right out of your hands.”  He looked at the two sleds, with the dogs in harness, loaded with furs and fish.  His rifle lay on top of the beaver skins.  The six hunters who were to act as his guard stood by the sleds.  “Where is the girl?” the Pole demanded.  “Bring her up to the sleds before the test goes on.”  When this had been carried out, Subienkow lay down in the snow, resting his head on the log like a tired child about to sleep.  He had lived so many dreary years that he was indeed tired.  “I laugh at you and your strength, O Makamuk,” he said.  “Strike, and strike hard.”  He lifted his hand.  Makamuk swung the axe, a broadaxe for the squaring of logs.  The bright steel flashed through the frosty air, poised for a perceptible instant above Makamuk’s head, then descended upon Subienkow’s bare neck.  Clear through flesh and bone it cut its way, biting deeply into the log beneath.  The amazed savages saw the head bounce a yard away from the blood-spouting trunk.  There was a great bewilderment and silence, while slowly it began to dawn in their minds that there had been no medicine.  The fur-thief had outwitted them.  Alone, of all their prisoners, he had escaped the torture.  That had been the stake for which he played.  A great roar of laughter went up.  Makamuk bowed his head in shame.  The fur-thief had fooled him.  He had lost face before all his people.  Still they continued to roar out their laughter.  Makamuk turned, and with bowed head stalked away.  He knew that thenceforth he would be no longer known as Makamuk.  He would be Lost Face; the record of his shame would be with him until he died; and whenever the tribes gathered in the spring for the salmon, or in the summer for the trading, the story would pass back and forth across the camp-fires of how the fur-thief died peaceably, at a single stroke, by the hand of Lost Face.  “Who was Lost Face?” he could hear, in anticipation, some insolent young buck demand, “Oh, Lost Face,” would be the answer, “he who once was Makamuk in the days before he cut off the fur-thief’s head.”     TRUST   All lines had been cast off, and the _Seattle No._ 4 was pulling slowly out from the shore.  Her decks were piled high with freight and baggage, and swarmed with a heterogeneous company of Indians, dogs, and dog-mushers, prospectors, traders, and homeward-bound gold-seekers.  A goodly portion of Dawson was lined up on the bank, saying good-bye.  As the gang-plank came in and the steamer nosed into the stream, the clamour of farewell became deafening.  Also, in that eleventh moment, everybody began to remember final farewell messages and to shout them back and forth across the widening stretch of water.  Louis Bondell, curling his yellow moustache with one hand and languidly waving the other hand to his friends on shore, suddenly remembered something and sprang to the rail.  “Oh, Fred!” he bawled.  “Oh, Fred!”  The “Fred” desired thrust a strapping pair of shoulders through the forefront of the crowd on the bank and tried to catch Louis Bondell’s message.  The latter grew red in the face with vain vociferation.  Still the water widened between steamboat and shore.  “Hey, you, Captain Scott!” he yelled at the pilot-house.  “Stop the boat!”  The gongs clanged, and the big stern wheel reversed, then stopped.  All hands on steamboat and on bank took advantage of this respite to exchange final, new, and imperative farewells.  More futile than ever was Louis Bondell’s effort to make himself heard.  The _Seattle No._ 4 lost way and drifted down-stream, and Captain Scott had to go ahead and reverse a second time.  His head disappeared inside the pilot-house, coming into view a moment later behind a big megaphone.  Now Captain Scott had a remarkable voice, and the “Shut up!” he launched at the crowd on deck and on shore could have been heard at the top of Moosehide Mountain and as far as Klondike City.  This official remonstrance from the pilot-house spread a film of silence over the tumult.  “Now, what do you want to say?” Captain Scott demanded.  “Tell Fred Churchill—he’s on the bank there—tell him to go to Macdonald. It’s in his safe—a small gripsack of mine.  Tell him to get it and bring it out when he comes.”  In the silence Captain Scott bellowed the message ashore through the megaphone:—  “You, Fred Churchill, go to Macdonald—in his safe—small gripsack—belongs to Louis Bondell—important!  Bring it out when you come!  Got it!”  Churchill waved his hand in token that he had got it.  In truth, had Macdonald, half a mile away, opened his window, he’d have got it, too. The tumult of farewell rose again, the gongs clanged, and the _Seattle No._ 4 went ahead, swung out into the stream, turned on her heel, and headed down the Yukon, Bondell and Churchill waving farewell and mutual affection to the last.  That was in midsummer.  In the fall of the year, the _W. H. Willis_ started up the Yukon with two hundred homeward-bound pilgrims on board. Among them was Churchill.  In his state-room, in the middle of a clothes-bag, was Louis Bondell’s grip.  It was a small, stout leather affair, and its weight of forty pounds always made Churchill nervous when he wandered too far from it.  The man in the adjoining state-room had a treasure of gold-dust hidden similarly in a clothes-bag, and the pair of them ultimately arranged to stand watch and watch.  While one went down to eat, the other kept an eye on the two state-room doors.  When Churchill wanted to take a hand at whist, the other man mounted guard, and when the other man wanted to relax his soul, Churchill read four-months’ old newspapers on a camp stool between the two doors.  There were signs of an early winter, and the question that was discussed from dawn till dark, and far into the dark, was whether they would get out before the freeze-up or be compelled to abandon the steamboat and tramp out over the ice.  There were irritating delays.  Twice the engines broke down and had to be tinkered up, and each time there were snow flurries to warn them of the imminence of winter.  Nine times the _W. H. Willis_ essayed to ascend the Five-Finger Rapids with her impaired machinery, and when she succeeded, she was four days behind her very liberal schedule.  The question that then arose was whether or not the steamboat _Flora_ would wait for her above the Box Cañon.  The stretch of water between the head of the Box Cañon and the foot of the White Horse Rapids was unnavigable for steamboats, and passengers were transhipped at that point, walking around the rapids from one steamboat to the other. There were no telephones in the country, hence no way of informing the waiting _Flora_ that the _Willis_ was four days late, but coming.  When the _W. H. Willis_ pulled into White Horse, it was learned that the _Flora_ had waited three days over the limit, and had departed only a few hours before.  Also, it was learned that she would tie up at Tagish Post till nine o’clock, Sunday morning.  It was then four o’clock, Saturday afternoon.  The pilgrims called a meeting.  On board was a large Peterborough canoe, consigned to the police post at the head of Lake Bennett.  They agreed to be responsible for it and to deliver it.  Next, they called for volunteers.  Two men were needed to make a race for the _Flora_.  A score of men volunteered on the instant.  Among them was Churchill, such being his nature that he volunteered before he thought of Bondell’s gripsack.  When this thought came to him, he began to hope that he would not be selected; but a man who had made a name as captain of a college football eleven, as a president of an athletic club, as a dog-musher and a stampeder in the Yukon, and, moreover, who possessed such shoulders as he, had no right to avoid the honour.  It was thrust upon him and upon a gigantic German, Nick Antonsen.  While a crowd of the pilgrims, the canoe on their shoulders, started on a trot over the portage, Churchill ran to his state-room.  He turned the contents of the clothes-bag on the floor and caught up the grip, with the intention of entrusting it to the man next door.  Then the thought smote him that it was not his grip, and that he had no right to let it out of his possession.  So he dashed ashore with it and ran up the portage changing it often from one hand to the other, and wondering if it really did not weigh more than forty pounds.  It was half-past four in the afternoon when the two men started.  The current of the Thirty Mile River was so strong that rarely could they use the paddles.  It was out on one bank with a tow-line over the shoulders, stumbling over the rocks, forcing a way through the underbrush, slipping at times and falling into the water, wading often up to the knees and waist; and then, when an insurmountable bluff was encountered, it was into the canoe, out paddles, and a wild and losing dash across the current to the other bank, in paddles, over the side, and out tow-line again.  It was exhausting work.  Antonsen toiled like the giant he was, uncomplaining, persistent, but driven to his utmost by the powerful body and indomitable brain of Churchill.  They never paused for rest.  It was go, go, and keep on going.  A crisp wind blew down the river, freezing their hands and making it imperative, from time to time, to beat the blood back into the numbed fingers.  As night came on, they were compelled to trust to luck.  They fell repeatedly on the untravelled banks and tore their clothing to shreds in the underbrush they could not see.  Both men were badly scratched and bleeding.  A dozen times, in their wild dashes from bank to bank, they struck snags and were capsized.  The first time this happened, Churchill dived and groped in three feet of water for the gripsack.  He lost half an hour in recovering it, and after that it was carried securely lashed to the canoe.  As long as the canoe floated it was safe.  Antonsen jeered at the grip, and toward morning began to curse it; but Churchill vouchsafed no explanations.  Their delays and mischances were endless.  On one swift bend, around which poured a healthy young rapid, they lost two hours, making a score of attempts and capsizing twice.  At this point, on both banks, were precipitous bluffs, rising out of deep water, and along which they could neither tow nor pole, while they could not gain with the paddles against the current.  At each attempt they strained to the utmost with the paddles, and each time, with heads nigh to bursting from the effort, they were played out and swept back.  They succeeded finally by an accident. In the swiftest current, near the end of another failure, a freak of the current sheered the canoe out of Churchill’s control and flung it against the bluff.  Churchill made a blind leap at the bluff and landed in a crevice.  Holding on with one hand, he held the swamped canoe with the other till Antonsen dragged himself out of the water.  Then they pulled the canoe out and rested.  A fresh start at this crucial point took them by.  They landed on the bank above and plunged immediately ashore and into the brush with the tow-line.  Daylight found them far below Tagish Post.  At nine o’clock Sunday morning they could hear the _Flora_ whistling her departure.  And when, at ten o’clock, they dragged themselves in to the Post, they could barely see the _Flora’s_ smoke far to the southward.  It was a pair of worn-out tatterdemalions that Captain Jones of the Mounted Police welcomed and fed, and he afterward averred that they possessed two of the most tremendous appetites he had ever observed.  They lay down and slept in their wet rags by the stove.  At the end of two hours Churchill got up, carried Bondell’s grip, which he had used for a pillow, down to the canoe, kicked Antonsen awake, and started in pursuit of the _Flora_.  “There’s no telling what might happen—machinery break down, or something,” was his reply to Captain Jones’s expostulations.  “I’m going to catch that steamer and send her back for the boys.”  Tagish Lake was white with a fall gale that blew in their teeth.  Big, swinging seas rushed upon the canoe, compelling one man to bale and leaving one man to paddle.  Headway could not be made.  They ran along the shallow shore and went overboard, one man ahead on the tow-line, the other shoving on the canoe.  They fought the gale up to their waists in the icy water, often up to their necks, often over their heads and buried by the big, crested waves.  There was no rest, never a moment’s pause from the cheerless, heart-breaking battle.  That night, at the head of Tagish Lake, in the thick of a driving snow-squall, they overhauled the _Flora_.  Antonsen fell on board, lay where he had fallen, and snored. Churchill looked like a wild man.  His clothes barely clung to him.  His face was iced up and swollen from the protracted effort of twenty-four hours, while his hands were so swollen that he could not close the fingers.  As for his feet, it was an agony to stand upon them.  The captain of the _Flora_ was loth to go back to White Horse.  Churchill was persistent and imperative; the captain was stubborn.  He pointed out finally that nothing was to be gained by going back, because the only ocean steamer at Dyea, the _Athenian_, was to sail on Tuesday morning, and that he could not make the back trip to White Horse and bring up the stranded pilgrims in time to make the connection.  “What time does the _Athenian_ sail?” Churchill demanded.  “Seven o’clock, Tuesday morning.”  “All right,” Churchill said, at the same time kicking a tattoo on the ribs of the snoring Antonsen.  “You go back to White Home.  We’ll go ahead and hold the _Athenian_.”  Antonsen, stupid with sleep, not yet clothed in his waking mind, was bundled into the canoe, and did not realize what had happened till he was drenched with the icy spray of a big sea, and heard Churchill snarling at him through the darkness:—  “Paddle, can’t you!  Do you want to be swamped?”  Daylight found them at Caribou Crossing, the wind dying down, and Antonsen too far gone to dip a paddle.  Churchill grounded the canoe on a quiet beach, where they slept.  He took the precaution of twisting his arm under the weight of his head.  Every few minutes the pain of the pent circulation aroused him, whereupon he would look at his watch and twist the other arm under his head.  At the end of two hours he fought with Antonsen to rouse him.  Then they started.  Lake Bennett, thirty miles in length, was like a millpond; but, half way across, a gale from the south smote them and turned the water white.  Hour after hour they repeated the struggle on Tagish, over the side, pulling and shoving on the canoe, up to their waists and necks, and over their heads, in the icy water; toward the last the good-natured giant played completely out.  Churchill drove him mercilessly; but when he pitched forward and bade fair to drown in three feet of water, the other dragged him into the canoe.  After that, Churchill fought on alone, arriving at the police post at the head of Bennett in the early afternoon.  He tried to help Antonsen out of the canoe, but failed.  He listened to the exhausted man’s heavy breathing, and envied him when he thought of what he himself had yet to undergo. Antonsen could lie there and sleep; but he, behind time, must go on over mighty Chilcoot and down to the sea.  The real struggle lay before him, and he almost regretted the strength that resided in his frame because of the torment it could inflict upon that frame.  Churchill pulled the canoe up on the beach, seized Bondell’s grip, and started on a limping dog-trot for the police post.  “There’s a canoe down there, consigned to you from Dawson,” he hurled at the officer who answered his knock.  “And there’s a man in it pretty near dead.  Nothing serious; only played out.  Take care of him.  I’ve got to rush.  Good-bye.  Want to catch the _Athenian_.”  A mile portage connected Lake Bennett and Lake Linderman, and his last words he flung back after him as he resumed the trot.  It was a very painful trot, but he clenched his teeth and kept on, forgetting his pain most of the time in the fervent heat with which he regarded the gripsack. It was a severe handicap.  He swung it from one hand to the other, and back again.  He tucked it under his arm.  He threw one hand over the opposite shoulder, and the bag bumped and pounded on his back as he ran along.  He could scarcely hold it in his bruised and swollen fingers, and several times he dropped it.  Once, in changing from one hand to the other, it escaped his clutch and fell in front of him, tripped him up, and threw him violently to the ground.  At the far end of the portage he bought an old set of pack-straps for a dollar, and in them he swung the grip.  Also, he chartered a launch to run him the six miles to the upper end of Lake Linderman, where he arrived at four in the afternoon.  The _Athenian_ was to sail from Dyea next morning at seven.  Dyea was twenty-eight miles away, and between towered Chilcoot.  He sat down to adjust his foot-gear for the long climb, and woke up.  He had dozed the instant he sat down, though he had not slept thirty seconds.  He was afraid his next doze might be longer, so he finished fixing his foot-gear standing up.  Even then he was overpowered for a fleeting moment.  He experienced the flash of unconsciousness; becoming aware of it, in mid-air, as his relaxed body was sinking to the ground and as he caught himself together, he stiffened his muscles with a spasmodic wrench, and escaped the fall.  The sudden jerk back to consciousness left him sick and trembling.  He beat his head with the heel of his hand, knocking wakefulness into the numbed brain.  Jack Burns’s pack-train was starting back light for Crater Lake, and Churchill was invited to a mule.  Burns wanted to put the gripsack on another animal, but Churchill held on to it, carrying it on his saddle-pommel.  But he dozed, and the grip persisted in dropping off the pommel, one side or the other, each time wakening him with a sickening start.  Then, in the early darkness, Churchill’s mule brushed him against a projecting branch that laid his cheek open.  To cap it, the mule blundered off the trail and fell, throwing rider and gripsack out upon the rocks.  After that, Churchill walked, or stumbled rather, over the apology for a trail, leading the mule.  Stray and awful odours, drifting from each side of the trail, told of the horses that had died in the rush for gold.  But he did not mind.  He was too sleepy.  By the time Long Lake was reached, however, he had recovered from his sleepiness; and at Deep Lake he resigned the gripsack to Burns.  But thereafter, by the light of the dim stars, he kept his eyes on Burns.  There were not going to be any accidents with that bag.  At Crater Lake, the pack-train went into camp, and Churchill, slinging the grip on his back, started the steep climb for the summit.  For the first time, on that precipitous wall, he realized how tired he was.  He crept and crawled like a crab, burdened by the weight of his limbs.  A distinct and painful effort of will was required each time he lifted a foot.  An hallucination came to him that he was shod with lead, like a deep-sea diver, and it was all he could do to resist the desire to reach down and feel the lead.  As for Bondell’s gripsack, it was inconceivable that forty pounds could weigh so much.  It pressed him down like a mountain, and he looked back with unbelief to the year before, when he had climbed that same pass with a hundred and fifty pounds on his back. If those loads had weighed a hundred and fifty pounds, then Bondell’s grip weighed five hundred.  The first rise of the divide from Crater Lake was across a small glacier. Here was a well-defined trail.  But above the glacier, which was also above timber-line, was naught but a chaos of naked rock and enormous boulders.  There was no way of seeing the trail in the darkness, and he blundered on, paying thrice the ordinary exertion for all that he accomplished.  He won the summit in the thick of howling wind and driving snow, providentially stumbling upon a small, deserted tent, into which he crawled.  There he found and bolted some ancient fried potatoes and half a dozen raw eggs.  When the snow ceased and the wind eased down, he began the almost impossible descent.  There was no trail, and he stumbled and blundered, often finding himself, at the last moment, on the edge of rocky walls and steep slopes the depth of which he had no way of judging.  Part way down, the stars clouded over again, and in the consequent obscurity he slipped and rolled and slid for a hundred feet, landing bruised and bleeding on the bottom of a large shallow hole.  From all about him arose the stench of dead horses.  The hole was handy to the trail, and the packers had made a practice of tumbling into it their broken and dying animals.  The stench overpowered him, making him deadly sick, and as in a nightmare he scrambled out.  Half-way up, he recollected Bondell’s gripsack.  It had fallen into the hole with him; the pack-strap had evidently broken, and he had forgotten it.  Back he went into the pestilential charnel-pit, where he crawled around on hands and knees and groped for half an hour. Altogether he encountered and counted seventeen dead horses (and one horse still alive that he shot with his revolver) before he found Bondell’s grip.  Looking back upon a life that had not been without valour and achievement, he unhesitatingly declared to himself that this return after the grip was the most heroic act he had ever performed.  So heroic was it that he was twice on the verge of fainting before he crawled out of the hole.  By the time he had descended to the Scales, the steep pitch of Chilcoot was past, and the way became easier.  Not that it was an easy way, however, in the best of places; but it became a really possible trail, along which he could have made good time if he had not been worn out, if he had had light with which to pick his steps, and if it had not been for Bondell’s gripsack.  To him, in his exhausted condition, it was the last straw.  Having barely strength to carry himself along, the additional weight of the grip was sufficient to throw him nearly every time he tripped or stumbled.  And when he escaped tripping, branches reached out in the darkness, hooked the grip between his shoulders, and held him back.  His mind was made up that if he missed the _Athenian_ it would be the fault of the gripsack.  In fact, only two things remained in his consciousness—Bondell’s grip and the steamer.  He knew only those two things, and they became identified, in a way, with some stern mission upon which he had journeyed and toiled for centuries.  He walked and struggled on as in a dream.  As part of the dream was his arrival at Sheep Camp.  He stumbled into a saloon, slid his shoulders out of the straps, and started to deposit the grip at his feet.  But it slipped from his fingers and struck the floor with a heavy thud that was not unnoticed by two men who were just leaving.  Churchill drank a glass of whisky, told the barkeeper to call him in ten minutes, and sat down, his feet on the grip, his head on his knees.  So badly did his misused body stiffen, that when he was called it required another ten minutes and a second glass of whisky to unbend his joints and limber up the muscles.  “Hey not that way!” the barkeeper shouted, and then went after him and started him through the darkness toward Canyon City.  Some little husk of inner consciousness told Churchill that the direction was right, and, still as in a dream, he took the cañon trail.  He did not know what warned him, but after what seemed several centuries of travelling, he sensed danger and drew his revolver.  Still in the dream, he saw two men step out and heard them halt him.  His revolver went off four times, and he saw the flashes and heard the explosions of their revolvers.  Also, he was aware that he had been hit in the thigh.  He saw one man go down, and, as the other came for him, he smashed him a straight blow with the heavy revolver full in the face.  Then he turned and ran.  He came from the dream shortly afterward, to find himself plunging down the trail at a limping lope.  His first thought was for the gripsack.  It was still on his back.  He was convinced that what had happened was a dream till he felt for his revolver and found it gone.  Next he became aware of a sharp stinging of his thigh, and after investigating, he found his hand warm with blood.  It was a superficial wound, but it was incontestable.  He became wider awake, and kept up the lumbering run to Canyon City.  He found a man, with a team of horses and a wagon, who got out of bed and harnessed up for twenty dollars.  Churchill crawled in on the wagon-bed and slept, the gripsack st
