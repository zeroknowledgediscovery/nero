Chapter One: The Hollow Sound

The footsteps were moving away, slow and deliberate. Muffled slightly by the old, cracked linoleum, they seemed to echo off the bare walls more than they should have, as if the sound were trying to stay behind even as the person left.

Lena sat upright in her bed, her heart crawling up into her throat like a beetle trying to escape the dark. She strained to hear more, but the silence was complete now. Silence had a weight in this place—it wasn’t absence of sound, but the presence of something else.

She slipped her feet to the cold floor, pausing, listening again. Nothing. Not the creak of a floorboard. Not the groan of the pipes. The footsteps had stopped. Or maybe whoever it was had paused too, waiting.

She crossed the small room—bare walls, a desk with a chipped edge, two books stacked in defiance of the minimalism demanded by the house rules. She pressed her ear to the door.

Still nothing.

She opened it slowly, flinching at the faint click of the latch. The hallway stretched left and right in a straight line of dim yellow light from overhead bulbs caged in wire. The carpet had long since been torn out, leaving the hall an uneven landscape of glue patches and scuff marks.

To the left, something shifted. A whisper of movement.

“Hello?” she called, then hated herself for it. Her voice sounded smaller than she intended, fragile and brittle like frost on a window.

Nothing replied.

She took a cautious step, then another. She passed Room 8, then 9. Hers was 10. Room 11’s door was slightly ajar.

She pushed it open.

The room was empty.

No.

The closet door was open, hanging on one hinge. The chair at the desk was tipped back, as if someone had left in a hurry. Lena’s eyes scanned the walls. There were photos pinned up, curling at the corners. Someone’s parents, a lake, a cracked Polaroid of a cat.

She backed out of the room, closed the door quietly.

Room 12 was farther down, and it, too, was silent.

Only when she reached the stairwell did she realize she was holding her breath.

She let it out slowly. She wasn’t supposed to be out after lights out. There were rules here. Punishments, too, the kind that didn’t leave marks. She turned to go back—

—and the footsteps started again.

Only this time, they were behind her.

She turned sharply, but the hallway was still.

Room 10 sat like a closed eye, no sign of movement.

She rushed back to it and closed the door behind her, leaned her back against it. Her heart was a hammer now. Not footsteps, maybe. Could’ve been something else. A draft. A dream still lingering.

She slept little after that. When the sun came up, pale and indifferent, she sat at her desk and wrote a letter. She addressed it to herself and kept it under her pillow.

—

Breakfast was quiet. It usually was. A room of twenty girls, each wrapped in their own silence like a blanket.

Across from her, Annie stirred her oatmeal with mechanical boredom.

“You look like hell,” Annie said, not unkindly.

“Did you hear anything last night?” Lena asked.

“Always,” Annie replied, lifting a spoon. “This place is full of sounds. Creaks. Whispers. Doors that don’t shut right.”

“No, like—footsteps.”

Annie looked up then, her dark eyes narrowing just slightly. “Where?”

“In the hall. Past curfew.”

Annie chewed her lip a moment. “Could’ve been Ms. Halberd.”

“She doesn’t walk that slow.”

Annie didn’t reply.

—

That day, classes dragged. History, then etiquette, then quiet hour. During the latter, Lena slipped away. Not far. Just to the stairwell, then down. The basement was off-limits. That’s why she went.

It wasn’t locked. The door was heavy, smelled of rust.

She stepped inside.

Dust motes danced like ghosts in the narrow shafts of light. The air was thick, cloying. It smelled like mold and something else—wet stone, maybe.

She passed the old laundry machines, all unplugged and dented. Beyond them, another hallway opened, lined with storage rooms. The door at the end was metal, newer than the rest. No label.

She reached for the handle—

It turned on its own.

Lena yanked her hand back.

The door opened slowly.

No one stood there. Just another room.

No, not a room. A corridor. Bare, concrete, unfinished. It sloped downward.

A noise drifted up—

A song.

Soft, and wrong.

She backed away, closed the door carefully, and ran back up the stairs.

—

That night, she dreamed of footsteps and the song, woven together like static through an old radio.

—

Three days passed. Lena stopped telling Annie what she saw, because the other girl had started looking at her differently.

On the fourth day, one of the girls didn’t show up for morning duties.

“She ran,” someone whispered.

“Jumped the fence.”

“No way,” said Annie, arms crossed. “Not her.”

Lena felt cold. Room 11 was empty now.

The headmistress said nothing. Only instructed the others to remain indoors after sundown.

Two days later, another girl vanished.

The rooms were silent again, but different now. The silence was afraid.

—

That night, Lena left her room again. She had to know.

She went back to the basement. The metal door was closed.

She opened it.

The corridor was darker this time.

She walked. Slowly. Carefully.

The song came again—closer.

A voice, rising and falling like it didn’t belong to a person.

She followed it until she reached the second door.

This one had no handle.

She knocked.

Once.

Twice.

The singing stopped.

Then, from the other side:

“Do you remember the orchard?”

Lena froze. Her heart stopped.

She had been four when her parents brought her to the orchard. A weekend. Apples. The sun. No one else had known.

“Who are you?” she whispered.

“Come in.”

The door swung open.

There was only darkness.

And the footsteps came again—this time, walking toward her.

She should have run. Every instinct in her body twisted into a knot of resistance, but her feet refused to move. The door had opened without her touch. The voice—so soft and familiar, as though whispered directly into her memory—had spoken the words only she could recognize. Something about the air down here, thick and pressurized like before a thunderstorm, kept her rooted. She stepped forward.

The darkness was not absolute. Her eyes adjusted slowly, revealing the barest contours of the room beyond. The walls were raw concrete, wet in patches. Water dripped from exposed pipes overhead, tapping an uneven rhythm against metal grates on the floor. There were no light bulbs, only a faint green glow that came from behind another door farther in. It pulsed like a heartbeat.

She passed a collapsed shelving unit, its contents—folders, brittle pages, something that looked like a leather-bound book—strewn across the floor in disarray. A rusted cart leaned against one wall. As she stepped around it, she saw the marks on the concrete: long, arching scrapes that started and stopped in no logical pattern.

The second door creaked open with a gentle push.

The green light was coming from an old monitor. The kind with a bulbous screen and thick wires. It was plugged into a socket that looked far too new for the room around it. On the screen, grainy footage played on a loop: the hallway outside her room. The time stamp read: 02:43 AM.

She watched the black and white image until movement caught her eye. A figure appeared—no details, just a shape. The camera fuzzed when it passed, but Lena felt certain it had looked directly into the lens. The loop restarted, and the figure walked past again.

Behind her, something scraped the floor.

She spun around, fists clenched, but there was no one.

Only the door slowly swinging shut.

She rushed forward, grabbed the handle—but there wasn’t one. Just a flat panel of steel.

She slammed her palm against it. Once, twice. “Hello?” she shouted. Her voice echoed strangely, folding back on itself.

Then: footsteps again.

Closer.

Slower.

This time, they circled.

She pressed herself to the corner, trying to find a weapon. A broken length of pipe lay nearby, and she snatched it up.

The footsteps stopped just beyond the edge of the green glow.

“I didn’t think you’d come back,” said the voice.

It was a woman’s voice, vaguely familiar, but distorted, like it was being spoken underwater.

“I want to see who you are,” Lena said.

The glow flickered, and a shape stepped forward. Not quite a woman—taller, her limbs too long, her skin the wrong shade of pale. Eyes that didn’t blink. A face that looked like someone had tried to remember what a face should be and almost got it right.

“You asked who I am,” it said. “But you already know.”

“No,” Lena whispered.

“Yes,” it said. “You left me here.”

“I don’t—”

The thing smiled, and Lena saw teeth. Too many.

“You brought me here. When you opened that box. In the orchard.”

The memory hit her like cold water. A cardboard box buried under the soil beneath the oldest apple tree. Her mother yelling. Her father dragging her away. A shriek she hadn’t been able to explain.

“I was five,” she said. “That wasn’t real.”

“You let me out,” it said. “And they sent you here because they knew. But they didn’t know how deep I went.”

Lena gripped the pipe tighter. “What do you want?”

“To be remembered,” it said. “To be known. And I need a name.”

“I’m not giving you mine.”

“You already did.”

It stepped closer, and Lena swung. The pipe connected, but there was no impact—like swinging through steam. The creature blurred, then reformed beside her.

“I remember the orchard,” it said again. “You sang to me.”

Lena bolted. She hit the door with all her strength, screaming, clawing, until the green light behind her dimmed to nothing.

Then the door opened.

And she fell through, onto the basement floor.

The room behind her was gone. Only a solid wall of concrete remained.

When she looked back, her hands were black with soot.

—

They didn’t believe her.

Not when she told Annie. Not when she tried to find the door again. The hallway was there. The old laundry machines were there. But the metal door wasn’t.

The wall was seamless.

“I swear it was here,” she said, pounding against it.

Annie folded her arms. “You need to talk to someone.”

Lena looked at her, desperate. “Do you remember when Kira disappeared?”

“Yes.”

“And when Ellie vanished two days later?”

“Yes, Lena. But that’s not proof of a—whatever it is you saw.”

“She said I gave her a name. She said I let her out.”

Annie flinched. “You’re talking crazy.”

Lena reached into her pocket and pulled out the folded letter—the one she had written to herself after the first night. She handed it over. Annie read it in silence.

“She knew the orchard. No one knew that,” Lena said.

Annie didn’t speak for a long time. Then she folded the letter again and handed it back. “You’re not crazy. But maybe we both need to get out of here.”

They planned to run the next night.

But Annie never showed.

And Lena’s door was open when she returned from dinner.

Inside, scrawled across her wall in black ash, were four words:

“You gave me you.”

—

Lena didn’t sleep that night.

She sat with the light on, facing the door, her hands trembling in her lap.

She’d told someone. She’d tried to fight.

And now it was too late.

But the letter—maybe someone else would find it. Maybe that was enough.

In the morning, her room was empty.

Only the letter remained, folded beneath her pillow.

And somewhere deep below, in the concrete guts of the house, the footsteps began again.

An hour before dawn, the house stirred. Not with voices or movement, but with the strange breath of old buildings—the pop of metal expanding in walls, the distant shifting of beams under their own weight. The cold in Lena’s now-empty room was sharp, unnatural, the kind of chill that sank into the bones rather than wrapped around the skin. The window was closed. The radiator hissed like a dying animal but produced no heat. The only sign that she had ever been there, besides the letter, was a small clump of black residue on the floor beneath the bed.

Mrs. Halberd was the first to discover the room empty. She didn’t react. She closed the door quietly and locked it from the outside. Later, when questioned, she would say Lena had been transferred—though no paperwork would support it. And if pressed further, her eyes would grow strangely blank, and she’d insist, “She was never here in the first place.”

But others remembered.

At breakfast, Annie didn’t eat. She sat with her tray untouched, her spoon drifting in her hand like she’d forgotten what it was for. Her gaze never left the hallway. When Ellie had disappeared, she'd rationalized it. When Kira vanished, she blamed the house. But Lena? Lena had known something. Something that reached beyond the cold rational rules of their confinement.

Later that morning, she stole the letter.

She didn’t mean to. She found herself standing in front of Lena’s door before she'd realized she’d walked there. The lock had already been removed. Inside, the room smelled of iron and woodsmoke. She found the letter beneath the mattress rather than under the pillow—it had been moved. Touched. Maybe read by someone else.

She opened it.

The handwriting was jagged, the pressure uneven like Lena had written it in haste, or while trembling.

If someone finds this, know that there’s something in the basement. I saw it. I heard it. It knows things it shouldn’t. Don’t go through the second door. And don’t listen when it sings.

The letter ended with a smudged drawing—a shape that looked like a tree with roots reaching downward into a pit.

Annie didn’t sleep that night either.

—

The days grew thinner after that, brittle as frost-bitten leaves. The girls in the home no longer whispered so much as moved through their routines like shadows of themselves. Ms. Halberd and the other staff seemed stretched thinner, too—hollowed out, their expressions dulled. Some looked over their shoulders when they walked.

Two more girls vanished. No explanations followed.

The counselors increased their rounds, but with every new regulation, the sense of unease deepened. It was as though the walls themselves had begun to expect something.

Then came the humming.

Soft at first. Only heard after lights out. Some girls claimed it was the pipes, others swore it was music. A lullaby. Annie recognized the tune before she admitted it aloud. It was the song Lena had hummed sometimes while doing her chores.

The same song that had played in the corridor on the monitor.

—

Annie waited until the third night of the humming. She brought a flashlight and the dull paring knife she’d stolen from the kitchen.

The basement door opened easier than she thought it would. It didn’t creak. It didn’t resist. Like it had been waiting.

Down she went.

The machines were still there. The faint smell of mildew lingered. But this time, there was a noise—softer than a whisper, but steady. A beat. A rhythm.

She moved toward the far end.

The wall where Lena claimed the metal door had been showed no seams. But Annie stepped closer. She ran her fingers along the concrete, then paused.

A breath. Not her own.

Then, under her hand, warmth.

The wall pulsed.

It wasn’t a wall.

She stepped back, and the surface shimmered slightly, like a film over water. Her flashlight flickered, then died.

Annie closed her eyes.

And when she opened them again, the door was there.

Metal. Seamless. Waiting.

She opened it.

Inside, the green light flickered just as Lena had described.

The monitor was on.

Footage played.

This time it was the dining hall. Girls sitting. A flicker between frames. One of the girls vanished.

Reappeared two frames later outside the building, standing alone in the field.

Then gone again.

The loop restarted.

Annie turned.

A voice greeted her from the dark:

“Did she give you the letter?”

Annie couldn’t answer.

“She opened me. But you will keep me open.”

The shape stepped forward. Again, not quite a person. The face was different now—closer to Lena’s, but still not right. The eyes were too still. The mouth too sharp.

“What are you?” Annie asked.

The figure tilted its head. “I am made of forgetting. Of the things left behind in cracks. I am the name no one remembers writing.”

Annie shook her head. “You’re not real.”

The figure smiled.

And the green light behind her flickered again—only this time, a second monitor came to life.

On it: her. Standing in the room.

But her body wasn’t moving.

The figure walked to the monitor and touched the screen gently.

“This is you,” it said. “Without time. Without place.”

Then the screen showed Lena. Not in the room—but outside, under a tree, lips moving silently.

“She called me,” the creature said. “She gave me her breath.”

“I want her back,” Annie said, stepping forward.

“She is not gone. She is here,” it replied, pressing its hand to its chest. “She is what I am now. And you can join her.”

“No.”

The lights went out.

Annie ran.

But the corridor twisted behind her. The walls pulsed. Doors opened, led to dead ends.

Until she found the stairwell again.

She burst into the laundry room. Up the stairs.

And the door was no longer behind her.

She collapsed in her bed before sunrise, trembling.

In her hand, she still held the paring knife.

The next morning, the headmistress’s face was tight, her eyes bloodshot. Annie was summoned.

“You’ve been where you shouldn’t be,” Ms. Halberd said.

“I saw it,” Annie said. “It’s not human.”

“No,” Ms. Halberd said, then sighed. “It’s older than human. It lives in what we forget. We keep it fed with rules. Routine. Denial.”

“Why?”

“To keep it from growing.”

“Then you know.”

“I’ve always known,” she said. “We all pay our price.”

Annie stood up. “I’m not going to be part of this.”

“You already are.”

The next night, the power went out.

In the dark, every girl heard the same song.

And all their footsteps, one by one, began to move.

Chapter Two: The Bone Orchard

It started with a dream.

Not Annie’s—though she’d dreamt often since the night she ran from the basement—but a shared dream, collective and heavy, seeping into the minds of the girls in the house like smoke through old curtains. The details shifted from girl to girl, but the essence remained the same: a tree without leaves, its bark split and rotting; a pit at its base; voices rising from the soil, not screaming, not pleading—just... singing.

The staff tried to brush it off. “Adolescents go through stress dreams,” said one counselor. “Group delusions,” another muttered, before retreating behind a locked door.

But the girls began to mark their arms with symbols drawn in ink, charcoal, even scraped into skin—small curved lines like roots, a circle with a diagonal slash, a crooked triangle that pointed not up or down, but inward.

Annie kept to herself, avoiding the other girls. She watched them move through the days like birds in a fog, unable to recall what happened an hour earlier, their eyes flickering to corners and cracks like something was waiting to emerge.

One morning, someone placed a folded slip of paper on her pillow.

She read it before the sun rose.

There is a door inside the orchard. Under the third tree, west of the fence. I buried it again. It’s breathing.

There was no name.

She didn’t need one.

—

The orchard had been off-limits for years. Technically it was still part of the property, but the fence was rusted, sagging in places, and none of the current staff seemed eager to patrol it. A small sign warned of unstable ground, but no one had tried to enforce it.

Annie waited until late afternoon, when most of the girls were occupied with “journaling hour.” She slipped a small trowel from the gardening shed and climbed through the gap in the chain-link fence.

The orchard stood like an accusation.

The trees were bent, their branches low and narrow, their bark covered in soft green moss that pulsed faintly in the dappled light. Some had collapsed entirely, their roots protruding like fingers reaching for the sky.

She found the third tree by counting backwards from the southern edge of the orchard, her feet sinking slightly into the soft, mossy ground. The air was quiet—not the silence of absence, but the kind that comes before something speaks.

She began to dig.

The soil came away easily, moist and warm, like peeling back layers of fabric. Within minutes, the tip of something hard caught her trowel. She dropped to her knees, clawing with her hands.

It was wood.

A hatch.

Old, maybe handmade.

She wiped the last of the soil away and found a rusted ring attached to the wood. When she pulled, it lifted with effort and groan.

Darkness waited beneath.

No ladder. Just a slope, shallow but uneven.

She considered leaving. Walking away. Pretending she’d never come.

Then she saw the handprint.

Pressed into the underside of the hatch. Black. Smudged. Small.

Lena’s.

Annie entered.

—

The tunnel beneath the orchard didn’t feel like a tunnel. It felt like being swallowed. The walls were earthen at first—dirt packed with wooden supports—but slowly gave way to stone. The air smelled sweet and rotted, like fermented fruit and old sugar.

She followed the slope down until she reached a chamber.

In the dim glow from her flashlight, she saw carvings. Not words, but impressions: loops, spirals, symbols matching the ones the girls had been scratching into their arms.

She turned in a circle. The chamber had three exits. Each was a tunnel leading deeper.

On the far wall, written in charcoal, was a message:

Choose only one. Choose wrong and you wake up hollow.

She paused, breathing shallow.

The left tunnel smelled of ash.

The right tunnel exhaled cold.

The middle tunnel was silent, but her flashlight flickered whenever she pointed it toward that path.

She took the middle.

The darkness in this tunnel felt wrong. Too dense. Her feet found uneven stones—steps, maybe. The tunnel turned sharply, then widened.

The floor beneath her became smooth. Concrete.

She recognized it.

Basement.

But not the basement she’d known.

Here, the walls were covered in mirrors.

Each one reflected a different version of her.

Some older. Some younger. One bleeding from the eyes. One smiling with teeth too long.

She turned her flashlight away.

In the center of the room was a shape.

Not the creature from before. Not exactly.

This one was smaller.

Childlike.

Its face was veiled in gauze. Its hands were folded neatly in its lap. When she stepped closer, it turned its head.

“You’re late,” it said, in a voice that echoed like water dripping in a well.

“Who are you?”

“You gave me a path,” it said. “You opened the root.”

“I didn’t open anything.”

“You remembered the song,” it said. “That is all it takes.”

She backed away.

The mirrors shifted.

Now they showed Lena.

She stood in a field, hair tangled, eyes distant. She was mouthing something.

Then her face turned sharply, and she stared through the mirror directly at Annie.

“She’s not dead,” Annie whispered.

“No,” the thing said. “She’s becoming.”

The mirrors shattered.

The tunnel collapsed into itself.

Annie ran.

Up stairs that hadn’t been there before.

Back into a hallway that wasn’t the one she entered from.

She burst into the light.

Only it wasn’t the orchard.

It was Room 10.

Lena’s room.

And sitting on the bed was Lena.

She looked up slowly, eyes distant.

“I found the door,” Annie said.

Lena blinked. Once.

“You shouldn’t have,” she whispered. “It wasn’t locked for you.”

“What’s happening to you?”

“I’m remembering things I never lived,” Lena said. “Waking up in people who aren’t me. Walking where I haven’t gone.”

Annie crossed the room and sat beside her. “We can leave.”

Lena shook her head. “There is no more outside. Not for me.”

The walls of the room began to darken, slow as ink spreading through paper.

And the song returned.

This time, it wasn’t distant.

It came from under the bed.

From the cracks in the floor.

From their own mouths.

Annie clamped her hand over her mouth as the song continued to rise from her throat. Lena didn’t try to stop hers. Her voice hummed the melody softly, eyes wide open, staring through the wall like she was watching a distant fire from across a river. The floor under the bed warped—just slightly—but enough to send a tremor through the metal frame, a creak that went unnoticed except by the oldest parts of the house.

“You hear it now,” Lena said calmly, her voice slow and dreamlike. “You understand what it’s made of. All the things we lost. All the names we forgot to keep.”

Annie pushed herself up from the bed, staggering backward, her legs stiff and numb. “You need to fight it. Whatever it is. You were trying to fight it before, weren’t you? You left that letter. You wanted someone to find it. You didn’t give in.”

Lena blinked slowly. “I thought the letter might protect me. Like a spell. Like an anchor. But I forgot... she reads what I write now. Before I even finish writing it.”

The floor groaned again. From beneath the floorboards, something—some shape—pressed upward for a moment. Not fully visible, not enough to define, but unmistakably real. A shoulder? A ribcage? A head just beneath the wood, straining toward the surface as if the room was only skin.

Annie gritted her teeth and reached for Lena, grabbing her wrist. “You are not her. You’re not it. Not yet.”

Lena looked down, surprised by the contact. Her skin was cold, but not lifeless. Her eyes briefly flickered with something other than numb resignation—fear, maybe. Or pain.

“Get up,” Annie said. “We’re going to the chapel.”

“No,” Lena said, and now her voice cracked. “She hates that place. She can’t see in there. That’s why she wants it so badly.”

Annie hesitated. “Then it’s exactly where we’re going.”

She pulled Lena to her feet. The room shuddered once more, the song momentarily halting—as if whatever force was beneath them realized it was losing grip. Lena stumbled as they crossed the threshold into the hallway.

Everything was wrong.

The walls were longer than before, stretched like wax. The wallpaper peeled in strips that twitched slightly in their peripheral vision. At the end of the corridor, a door slammed open and then shut again, though no one had touched it.

Annie didn’t wait. She half-dragged, half-led Lena down the twisting halls, past the dorm rooms, past the common area where books had been stacked into circles around empty chairs. Some of the other girls had left messages carved into the tables—some in ink, others with nails. Messages like “IT SEES THROUGH MEMORY” and “I NEVER HAD A NAME.”

They reached the chapel just before the lights in the corridor burst all at once.

Inside, the air was cooler.

Still.

The chapel wasn’t much to look at—a single room with pews that groaned when sat upon, stained-glass windows dulled by grime, and an altar that hadn’t seen use in decades. No one prayed there. Not officially. But the room remained.

Lena sank into the front pew and collapsed forward, head in her hands.

“She’s louder in here,” she muttered. “Like static. Like she’s screaming just outside the walls.”

Annie closed the chapel door and took the broken latch from beneath the pulpit, wedging it into place. It wouldn’t hold anything supernatural, but it might keep her mind from unraveling long enough to think.

She sat beside Lena. “Tell me what happened under the orchard. What you saw the first time.”

Lena didn’t respond at first. Her fingers worked at the fabric of her skirt, twisting and loosening, again and again, a compulsive motion that didn’t seem entirely her own. When she spoke, it came in halting fragments.

“There was a room. No walls. No ceiling. Just floor. Black. Slick. It felt like glass, but it was warm. I walked. For a long time. Until I saw the others. Not bodies. Shapes. People like echoes. Some wore the same uniform. Some had no faces. One of them... one of them was my mother. But she was only bones.”

Annie swallowed hard.

“I think that place isn’t real,” Lena went on, “but it makes you real there. More real than you are here. And when it knows you enough, when it’s written you into its root, it starts changing you. From the inside.”

She lifted her hand and showed Annie her palm. A symbol was burned into the skin—an inverted root that curved and split three ways.

“I didn’t carve it,” Lena whispered. “It grew.”

Annie stared, chilled.

“Do you remember when we first arrived here?” she asked suddenly. “The orientation booklet? The rules?”

Lena nodded slowly.

“Rule Seven,” Annie said. “Never go into the orchard. Not because of the land or the fence. But because they knew.”

“They always knew,” Lena said. “This place was built around it. Or maybe it was drawn to this place. The way mold finds a crack.”

Suddenly, the stained-glass window above them darkened.

A shape had passed across it—briefly blotting out the light.

Lena’s head jerked up.

“She’s coming.”

The room darkened slightly, though no clouds moved outside. The shadows bent strangely.

Annie stood up, backing toward the pulpit. “She said she needed a name.”

Lena stood as well, slower. Her face looked drained, but calmer now.

“She has it already,” she said. “She steals names. Every girl that goes missing... she keeps their names. That’s how she moves. That’s how she builds herself.”

Annie’s eyes widened. “Then we take them back.”

Lena gave a hollow laugh. “You can’t un-know a name. But you can forget it. If you forget who you are before she finishes learning, she can’t wear you. She can’t walk in you.”

“That’s suicide,” Annie said.

“No,” Lena said. “It’s pruning.”

The window shattered.

The door behind them buckled.

The lights above the altar flickered violently.

Annie grabbed Lena’s shoulders. “We’re not done. There’s still a way to trap her. You said she can’t enter here. If she wants in, maybe we can force her into something—lock her inside.”

Lena blinked, shivering. “Like a body?”

“No,” Annie said, “like a name. A real one. A full one. We give her a name that doesn’t belong to anyone. One she can’t escape.”

“We don’t have one.”

Annie looked around. Her gaze fell on the hymnal book—torn, its cover falling off. Inside was a dedication page.

“To Eloise Kathryn Warren, who gave the first stone.”

“I think we do,” she said, her fingers tracing the faded ink.

The chapel doors burst open.

And the song filled the room again.

But now it was different.

It wasn’t coming from the cracks.

It was coming toward them.

Chapter Three: The Name Beneath the Floor

The wind that swept into the chapel wasn’t natural. It didn’t rustle fabric or stir dust—it moved through them, bypassing skin and bone, sinking into their thoughts like a wet rope dragging across the floor of the mind. Annie instinctively shielded her face, though there was nothing physical to stop. Beside her, Lena dropped to her knees again, hands pressed to her ears, rocking forward and back as if that motion might jar the sound loose.

The name—Eloise Kathryn Warren—burned in Annie’s mind like a flare, flickering and fierce. She gripped the hymnal tight. The book seemed warm, almost alive in her hands, as if it knew it was being remembered after years of gathering dust and rot. The dedication page was stained in one corner, the signature barely legible. And yet, as the air grew thicker and the door groaned wider, that single name felt like a key she hadn't known she'd been holding.

A figure stepped across the threshold.

Or rather, it bled into the room.

Not quite walking, not floating either—sliding across the floor with impossible stillness. The shape had no clear face. No fixed dimensions. It flickered between being too tall and too small, shoulders twitching as though trying to decide what shape to wear. Behind the figure, the hallway cracked, wallpaper curling outward like peeling skin. The lights in the corridor blinked one final time and then died, leaving the chapel the only room with power.

Annie backed toward the pulpit, pulling Lena up with her.

“She can’t hold a name unless it fits,” Lena whispered hoarsely, “unless it’s worn in.”

“But if we force it,” Annie replied, her breath unsteady, “she might get stuck in it.”

The figure stopped near the front pews, twitching again. Its voice filled the chapel—not from its mouth, which it didn’t appear to have, but from the air around them.

“You would give me something false?” it said, not angrily, but with something almost like amusement. “You think I cannot tell the difference between truth and bone?”

“We’re not giving you anything,” Annie said. “We’re naming you. You want to live in us? Then live in this instead.”

She threw the hymnal down onto the floor between them, the pages scattering, the name burning in her mouth as she shouted it.

“Eloise Kathryn Warren.”

The thing shuddered. Its shoulders rippled, features blinking in and out like frames on broken film. The song faltered. For the first time since entering the chapel, the presence recoiled, folding in on itself, as though struck.

Lena stood straighter, her eyes now clear for a moment. “Say it again.”

Annie did. “Eloise Kathryn Warren!”

The name echoed in the chapel, bouncing off the walls like an incantation. The stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. The figure staggered back a step, then twisted its head—or what passed for one—sharply to the side.

“You do not know what she was,” it said, voice vibrating like plucked wire. “She gave the stone, yes, but she was no martyr. She begged for the first gate. She opened the orchard long before you were born.”

Lena stepped forward now, the symbol in her palm glowing faintly. “Then you wear her instead. See how it fits when we force you into it.”

The hymnals burst into flame. A circle of fire spiraled outward from the book, not consuming but illuminating. The figure let out a sound—neither scream nor roar, but something ancient and low, like metal grinding inside a hollow mountain.

Annie grabbed Lena’s wrist. “Now. The altar.”

Together they moved to the front of the room and climbed the three small steps. Annie reached under the pulpit and found the false panel she’d seen once during a cleaning chore. She pulled it loose. Inside was a jar.

Glass. Sealed with wax.

Inside the jar—ashes.

A faint, spiraling pattern scratched into the inside of the glass.

Lena stared at it. “Eloise.”

Annie held the jar high. “This is your name now. You asked for one. Here it is.”

The creature howled.

The floor cracked.

Splinters erupted from the boards, snapping upward like teeth.

But the fire didn’t touch the girls. It closed around the figure, which now twisted violently, shrinking, growing, attempting every form it could summon.

Children. Women. Shadows. A mouth with no head.

“You cannot name me,” it bellowed.

“You were already named,” Annie replied. “You just forgot.”

Lena took the jar from Annie’s hands and hurled it at the creature.

It didn’t break.

It melted midair, becoming light—pure, silver, and sudden.

The creature screamed.

And then collapsed inward.

Not falling—folding, like paper burned at the edges, curling into nothing.

Then silence.

No song.

No movement.

Just the smell of scorched cloth and the soft rustle of pages returning to rest.

Annie sat down on the steps of the altar and stared ahead, barely breathing.

Lena stood quietly, her hands at her sides, fingers twitching.

For the first time in what felt like weeks, the chapel felt empty in the right way.

The haunting had ceased.

Or at least, the worst part of it.

—

They reported it, in whispers. Annie spoke to one of the few staff members who still seemed to have a soul left, a nurse named Clara who’d always watched the girls with quiet suspicion, like she knew the house could grow teeth.

Clara listened, and when Annie described the hymn, the fire, the name, she closed her eyes and nodded.

“There were always rumors,” she said. “I stayed quiet. We all did. But that name—Eloise—it’s carved beneath the altar. Under the wood. I saw it once during a renovation. Didn’t know what it meant.”

“It meant she was the beginning,” Annie said.

“Maybe now she’s the end.”

Lena didn’t speak much after that. She remained calm, but quieter than before, distant in a way that didn’t seem unnatural, just... detached.

They never found the other girls.

Not fully.

Sometimes their names showed up scratched into wood or layered beneath paint.

Sometimes Annie woke in the middle of the night to find her own name written backward on the inside of her window.

But no more singing.

And no more footsteps in the hall.

—

A month later, a letter arrived for Annie. No return address.

Inside, a single sentence in familiar handwriting:

It’s not dead. It’s waiting for another orchard.

Annie folded the letter slowly and placed it inside the hymnal.

She didn’t tell anyone.

But that night, before lights out, she took a razor blade and carved the name Eloise Kathryn Warren into the wood under her bed.

Just in case.

The weeks that followed felt like the world had stopped rotating. It wasn’t peace, exactly—more like a fragile pause in the chaos, the long inhalation before some future blow. The house resumed its routine. Wake. Eat. Class. Quiet hour. Lights out. But underneath that thin crust of normality, something had changed. The silence wasn’t the same. It no longer held that sharp edge, that sense of something watching from the corners.

But nothing had really gone back to how it was.

The staff avoided eye contact. Some rooms—Room 11, Room 17—remained locked, and no one spoke of the girls who had vanished. They weren’t removed from the roster. Their names still appeared on attendance sheets, as if the house itself refused to let them go. When questioned, the staff would simply blink and offer shrugs, or vague assurances that “those girls have been reassigned to another facility.” But there were no files. No records.

Annie no longer believed in accidents or oversights.

She started keeping notes. A notebook, stuffed into the hem of her mattress, filled with dates, names, patterns. She tracked when lights flickered during study hour. When strange water stains appeared near the baseboards. The one morning when every girl in Dorm B woke up with muddy feet and couldn’t explain why.

Lena helped her at first, but gradually she withdrew. She would stare out the windows for hours, even when there was nothing to see. The orchard had been fenced off with new iron bars, reinforced with floodlights and thick mesh. The gate was padlocked and chained twice over. But that didn’t stop her eyes from drifting toward it.

Annie watched her carefully, noting each change. Lena now slept with her hands curled in fists, often mumbling under her breath words that weren’t English—or any language Annie recognized. She scratched herself absentmindedly during meals, her fingers always hovering around the spot where the inverted root symbol had burned itself into her palm.

One evening, just after dinner, Lena spoke.

“She left a seed behind.”

Annie looked up from her tray. “What do you mean?”

Lena's voice was flat. “The creature. She folded herself, yes. But not entirely. That’s what the name did. It gave her a shape. A container. But it didn’t destroy her. You can’t destroy what lives in forgetting. You can only... give it less to wear.”

“You’re not saying she’s coming back?”

“I’m saying she never left.”

The room buzzed around them—girls talking, scraping chairs, clattering utensils. But the conversation between the two of them seemed to drop the entire world into slow motion. Annie leaned closer.

“How do you know?”

Lena didn’t answer. Instead, she pushed up the sleeve of her uniform. Her wrist, pale and thin, was covered in thin cracks. Not bruises. Not cuts. Cracks—like her skin was becoming glass.

“It started last night,” she whispered. “I think... I think she’s under my skin.”

Annie swallowed. “No. We stopped her. We burned the name into the room. We saw her disappear.”

“She didn’t disappear,” Lena said. “She entered. She went into the space between me and my name. There’s enough of her in me that she found a corner to hide in.”

Annie grabbed her wrist. “We’ll stop it. We’ll cut her out if we have to.”

“No,” Lena said, pulling her hand away. “Cut me, and she might bleed into you.”

Later that night, Annie stared at the ceiling in the dark, wide awake, trying not to think about the way Lena’s eyes had looked: distant, but full of a terrible clarity, like someone who had already accepted the worst. She had to believe there was still a way out.

She had to.

She found herself back in the chapel at dawn, kneeling beside the altar, fingers tracing the carved name again and again. Eloise Kathryn Warren. The name had worked before—had bound the thing, given it form, forced it into some known constraint. But maybe a name wasn’t enough now.

Maybe they needed to rewrite her.

Annie thought about the way the figure had changed shapes. The way it had mirrored the girls. It didn’t just take names—it took stories. Histories. Identity.

If that was how it moved, then maybe it could be sealed—not in fire, not in ash, but in memory.

She spent three days researching. Digging through the house archives, lying to staff about her interest in writing a “fictionalized oral history” for a class project. Most dismissed her. But a few humored her, gave her scraps.

One fragment was a file folder, dusty and misfiled, labeled “EKW.” Inside was a single page. A list of hymns. None she recognized. One stood out. “She Wore the Names of Morning.”

Annie read the lyrics, heart sinking.

The hymn told the story of a woman who wore the names of the dead so the living would forget them. A saint, in some versions. A monster in others. The last line read: “Let no tongue speak her truth, lest she wake and walk once more.”

She had been named before.

But the chapel had awakened her.

And now, perhaps, the name alone wasn’t enough.

—

That night, Lena disappeared.

She wasn’t in her room. Her bed was untouched. Her shoes gone.

Annie searched everywhere. The orchard gate was still locked. No alarms had triggered. But something in the air told her the truth: Lena had gone underground again.

She didn’t wait. She grabbed her flashlight, the hymnal, the notebook, and a blade.

The hatch beneath the third tree opened easily this time.

The tunnel had changed.

Now it pulsed. Faintly. The walls were warmer. The floor slick.

She walked quickly, ignoring the whispers in her ears. Not voices—memories. Old phrases. Her mother. A teacher. A friend.

She reached the main chamber.

It was no longer empty.

Dozens of figures lined the walls—statues, unmoving, but shifting subtly in the corners of her eyes.

And in the center: Lena.

She stood barefoot, her body swaying. Cracks covered her arms and face now. Her hair had grayed.

Annie stepped forward. “Lena.”

Her friend turned. Her eyes were solid black.

“You came too late,” she said. “But not for nothing.”

“Fight her. You’re stronger than her.”

“I’m not fighting,” Lena said. “I’m remembering. And when I remember enough, I’ll replace her.”

“What?”

“She feeds on forgetting. On what’s left behind. I’m going to flood her with everything. Every name. Every moment. Every grief.”

The statues trembled.

A sound began—low, like thunder under the sea.

Annie ran to her, but Lena raised a hand. “Don’t stop me.”

“You’ll die.”

“No,” Lena said. “I’ll end. And she’ll end with me.”

Then the chamber exploded with light.

Annie shielded her eyes.

The sound was deafening.

Names filled the air like ash.

And when she looked again, Lena was gone.

Not taken. Not torn.

Just gone.

And the room was finally, finally still.

The chamber echoed with silence. Not the hollow, watchful kind that had always haunted the house, but the kind left in the wake of something finished—an aftermath. Annie stood frozen in the center of the room, surrounded by the statues that no longer seemed to breathe or shift. Whatever had animated them, had whispered from within their cracked mouths, had curled around their limbs and made their shadows too long—it was gone.

The air was heavy with dust and the tang of iron. Somewhere above, something groaned and settled, as if the foundations of the house were realigning themselves.

Annie stepped forward to where Lena had stood just moments before. There was no trace—no clothing, no ash, no blood. Only a faint, dark stain in the dirt, as though the earth itself had opened its mouth and swallowed her whole.

A slow, deep ache rose in her chest. She crouched, ran her fingers through the soil. It was warm. Alive, even. For a moment, she thought she could feel a pulse in the dirt.

She whispered Lena’s name. Once.

Nothing happened.

But that, she realized, was the point.

No more echoes. No more voices answering back.

Lena had done it.

She had remembered enough to fill the hollow thing with something it couldn’t digest. A flood of memory instead of a gap. Names, moments, real lives—things that couldn’t be worn like a mask.

Annie sat on the ground for a long time. The flashlight began to dim.

She turned it off and let the dark come.

—

When she emerged from the tunnel, the sky above the orchard was pale with pre-dawn. The house loomed in the distance, squat and colorless in the morning fog. But something about it looked… softer. Less sharp at the edges. The windows were dark. No movement stirred inside.

At the base of the tree, Annie replaced the hatch and buried it again.

Not to hide it. Not to forget.

To mark it.

To acknowledge.

She traced a symbol into the bark of the tree above it—not the root, not the circle, but a name. Just the first initial: L.

That, she thought, would be enough.

—

Inside the house, everything continued, but not unchanged. The air no longer pressed against the skin like invisible fingers. The water tasted clearer. The lights stayed steady.

Girls no longer vanished.

And when they dreamed, it wasn’t of trees or teeth or tunnels.

Their names stayed on the rosters.

Their beds stayed full.

Annie returned to classes, to chores, to the rhythm of days that no longer felt shaped by something invisible and hungry. She didn’t talk much, but the other girls noticed that when she walked down the hallway, the lights always stayed on.

Sometimes, a new girl would arrive. Always pale, always a little too quiet, like something in her past had been carefully folded and tucked away. Annie made a habit of introducing herself first, saying her name slowly, clearly, making sure it stuck.

She didn’t ask for theirs until they were ready to give it.

And when she taught them how to make their beds or fold their laundry or stack their books alphabetically, she would mention the chapel.

“Good place to sit when the world gets loud,” she’d say.

They’d nod, not quite understanding.

But some nights, when the moon was full and the air a little too still, a few of them would find their way there.

And they would find Annie already inside, running her fingers across a certain spot under the altar, whispering a name that no one else dared speak.

—

The notebooks grew.

She filled three over the course of a year.

One was facts—things she remembered, things she’d gathered. Another was filled with names—every girl who’d ever vanished, as best she could trace. The third was Lena.

Moments, memories, quotes. The way she tilted her head when thinking. The melody she hummed when mopping. Her favorite seat at dinner.

Annie reread it often, especially on quiet mornings when the house felt too empty even when it was full.

One day, she left that notebook on the chapel steps.

She didn’t return for it.

When she came back the next morning, it was gone.

But a name had been written into the dust along the wooden floorboards:

Lena, remembered.

—

Years passed.

The house changed. It became something else. A “residential recovery program.” New staff. New policies.

But the orchard remained fenced.

And no one touched the chapel.

Annie left eventually. She was older than the rest by then, a kind of unofficial overseer, more myth than peer to the new arrivals. When she packed her things, she found the hymnal still under her mattress.

She almost left it.

Instead, she slipped it into her bag.

And as she walked down the front path for the final time, she didn’t look back.

But she did whisper two names under her breath.

One to seal the past.

And one to carry forward.

—

The house would forget her.

But not completely.

Not when the cracks in the foundation still carried a faint warmth.

Not when the roots still curled quietly beneath the orchard.

And not when, every so often, a girl awoke with the echo of a song she didn’t remember learning—soft, distant, and full of names.

Chapter Four: The Keeper’s House

Long after Annie left the grounds of the home, long after her footsteps faded into the wider world, the house remained. But it had changed, not just in name or signage or staffing, but in presence. No longer did its walls press inward, no longer did the silence in its halls pulse with the knowledge of unseen watchers. It was quieter in the proper way. The oppressive hum beneath the floorboards had gone still.

But the house had memory.

It remembered through the shape of things. The curve of doorways worn by girls who’d leaned too often against them in exhaustion or defeat. The grooves in floors where beds had been dragged by trembling hands. The faint scent of old smoke that no new paint could fully cover.

The chapel was rarely used. A place of occasional curiosity now. New girls wandered in once or twice and found it underwhelming. The pews were warped. The windows never seemed to let in much light. But no one lingered.

Something in the room—some shape of silence—encouraged respect. Even for those who had never heard the story.

And no one, not even staff, ever touched the panel under the pulpit.

The hatch in the orchard remained buried. Its tree grew thi
