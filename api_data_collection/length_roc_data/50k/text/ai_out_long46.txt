Chapter One: Echoes in the Wind

The sun bled across the cracked horizon like a wound that never quite healed. Out in the middle of the high school track field in Cherry Falls, Colorado, the wind rustled the bleachers and tugged at the worn banners that still clung stubbornly to the fences: "State Champions 2002." Faded maroon and gold, the colors of another life.

Jace Weller stood at the edge of lane three, hands on his hips, chest heaving from a two-lap shuffle that bore only a passing resemblance to the gazelle-like sprints of his past. His knees ached. His lungs felt too tight in his chest, as if they were still trying to remember how to fill the space he once owned on this oval.

"Coach would’ve called that a brisk funeral march," he muttered to himself, spitting into the grass. He didn’t smile. The joke didn’t feel like it was his. Not anymore.

Behind him, the sound of an old pickup door creaking open cut the wind. He turned.

"You really gonna try and kill yourself out here again?" The voice was familiar, half-sarcastic and half-concerned. Drew Snyder walked toward him, ball cap low over his forehead, a six-pack clinking inside a plastic bag that swung at his side.

Jace laughed once, short and breathless. "Gotta die somewhere."

Drew shook his head, passing him a bottle. "You used to fly. Now you wheeze. Why come back here, man?"

That was the question, wasn’t it?

Jace Weller was thirty-eight, jobless, divorced, and living in his late father’s basement since his company laid him off eight months ago. Once, he had been the golden boy. 400-meter state record. Scholarship to the University of Texas. Brief flirtation with Olympic trials. And then—well. Torn hamstring in ‘08. A couple of bad decisions. One too many beers. No medals. No podiums. Just years bleeding together, like ink spilled across a ledger nobody would read.

He looked out over the track. It was overgrown at the edges, the rubber cracking like a sunburnt back. Ghosts ran here—versions of himself at seventeen, at twenty, at twenty-five. Their legs pumping, their eyes full of fire. He was always chasing them now. Never catching.

“I’m not here to relive it,” Jace lied. “Just trying to remember what it felt like.”

Drew gave a snort and sat down on the lowest bench of the bleachers. “Bullshit. You’re trying to bring it back.”

“Is that so wrong?”

“Only if you’re expecting a different ending.”

Back in the house—no, the basement, let’s not pretend—Jace stood shirtless in front of the mirror, fingers grazing the ragged white scar across his upper thigh. The result of his final competitive race. Nationals. 2008. It tore during the curve on the third leg. He fell face first, watched the rest of the heat blur past him from the cinder.

He used to dream about that exact moment. Still did, sometimes. The sound of his own grunt as he hit the ground. The silence afterward.

In the kitchen upstairs, his mother’s footsteps creaked the ceiling. The smell of boiled eggs and coffee drifted down like a judgment.

“Jace? You going to the store today? We need bread.”

“I’ll go,” he called back. He didn’t move.

The town hadn’t changed much. Cherry Falls was the kind of place people left, not the kind they came back to. Except Jace. He’d circled back like a lost dog, tail between legs. The people at the grocery store either didn’t recognize him or pretended not to.

All except Lacey.

“Weller.” Her voice cracked through the dusty silence of aisle three. He turned. She still wore her hair in a messy bun, but there were lines now around her mouth and eyes that hadn’t been there when she cheered from the sidelines, pompoms raised. “Didn’t expect to see you haunting these aisles.”

“Didn’t expect to be haunted,” he replied.

She raised an eyebrow. “Still dramatic. You coaching or just jogging around the old track for the hell of it?”

“Just… getting back into shape.”

“Shape of what?” she grinned. Then her eyes softened. “You okay, Jace?”

“No one asks that question if they really want the truth.”

“I do.”

He didn’t answer. She let the silence rest between them like a folded letter.

“Hey,” she said suddenly. “You know about the alumni invitational next month, right?”

He blinked. “The what?”

“They’re doing this big anniversary thing. Twenty-five years since the championship team. Little exhibition race. You should come. Hell, you should run. People would lose their minds.”

He laughed, genuinely this time. It came out dry and coughing. “Run?”

“Just a hundred meters. For fun. Nostalgia, y’know?”

“I haven’t sprinted a hundred in over a decade.”

“Then maybe it’s time.”

She walked off with a wink, the rustle of her grocery bags echoing behind her.

Back at home, Jace dug through the musty bins in the attic. His old spikes, long since rusted and yellowed with time, stared up at him like bones. His Texas track hoodie still smelled faintly of sweat and Gatorade and defeat.

He found his journal buried under a stack of high school trophies. It opened to a page from 2007:

"Keep pushing. There’s no glory in easy."

He slammed it shut. His hand trembled slightly.

Training was slow. Painful. His body resisted like a rusted engine coughing to life. Each morning he ran the straights, walked the curves. Pushups in the basement. Crunches. Ice baths that left his skin purple and his breath jagged.

Drew came by sometimes, watching from the bleachers, tossing sarcastic encouragement like pebbles.

“You really think you’re gonna win this thing?”

“I’m not trying to win.”

“Uh-huh.”

By week three, his form was coming back. Not like it was. Never like it was. But the rhythm returned. Knees lifting. Arms driving. The sound of feet on rubber was its own kind of heartbeat.

The night before the race, Jace stood in front of the mirror again, dressed in a replica of his old kit. It didn’t quite fit the same. His stomach wasn’t what it was, his shoulders broader with age and wear. But in the eyes—there was still something. A flicker.

His mother knocked gently on the doorframe.

“I washed your shoes,” she said.

“Thanks.”

She hesitated. “Don’t hurt yourself.”

“I won’t.”

“I just mean—don’t go chasing something that’s already gone.”

He nodded. But in his heart, he wasn’t sure she was right.

Race day. The stands were packed. Not like a college meet, but more than he expected. Faces from his past, aged and blurred. Coaches, old rivals, kids in jerseys too new to know his name. Lacey waved from the snack tent. Drew brought a folding chair and a cooler.

The sun was harsh and merciless. Lane four. His lane.

The other runners were former teammates, beer-bellied and laughing, but as the gun was raised, the air grew still. Something sacred, almost.

Crack.

He drove out of the blocks like memory. His legs screamed. His lungs tore. But for ten, maybe fifteen seconds, the world fell away. There was no past, no future—only the rush of wind in his ears and the taste of something sharp and clean.

He didn’t win. He came in third.

But as he crossed the line, Jace raised his arms anyway, laughing like someone who had remembered something vital at last.

And the crowd cheered—not for a comeback, not for a champion—but for a man who had run, not from something, but toward it.

Jace sat on the grass after the race, legs stretched out, sweat drenching the back of his shirt. His chest still heaved from the effort, though the pain had settled into something dull and oddly comforting. The sun was starting its slow descent over Cherry Falls, casting golden light across the field. His legs were jelly, but there was an ember burning in his chest—small, defiant, something that hadn’t stirred in years.

He stared at his hands, fingers trembling slightly as he traced a line of callus at the base of his palm. They used to wrap starting blocks with these hands, tie his laces with purpose, hold batons with the trust of teammates who believed in him without question. Back then, every ache was proof of progress, every drop of sweat an investment. Now the pain simply reminded him that he still had skin in the game, even if he didn’t quite know which game he was playing anymore.

Lacey wandered over and dropped beside him with two paper cups. “Gatorade, though I think it’s the powdered kind. Budget cuts,” she said, offering one.

He accepted it with a grunt of thanks, the drink lukewarm and overly sweet, but it tasted like high school and lost afternoons. She took a sip from her own cup and leaned back on her elbows, squinting toward the field.

“You looked... almost like you used to. There was this second, maybe halfway through, where I swear I forgot it was an alumni thing.”

Jace chuckled, the sound low and scratchy. “You flatter me.”

“No, I’m serious. For a heartbeat, I saw seventeen again. You running like hell, the crowd losing it. Just like old times.”

“Old times,” he echoed, looking toward the goalposts at the far end. “Feels like a movie I barely remember watching.”

Lacey didn’t say anything for a moment. The quiet between them was thicker now, tinged with something unsaid, something both heavy and familiar. She picked at the grass with her free hand, her fingers twitching.

“You know,” she said, finally, “you could stick around. Help coach the team. Kids could use someone who’s been through it.”

He shook his head. “I don’t think I’m what they need.”

“Don’t be so sure.”

A small group of kids was still hanging by the track, some of them replaying videos on their phones, laughing, pointing, mimicking exaggerated sprint poses. One boy, probably fifteen or sixteen, noticed Jace and lifted a hand.

“Hey, man! That was sick out there!”

Jace raised a hand in return, nodding.

Lacey smirked. “Seems like at least one of them disagrees.”

He finished the Gatorade, crumpling the cup in his hand. “I’m not sure what the hell I’m doing here, Lacey.”

“You ran. That’s something.”

She stood and brushed the grass off her jeans. Her eyes softened as she looked down at him. “You don’t have to know the destination to start walking. Or running.”

He watched her go, the sway of her gait slow and steady, like she’d figured out some balance he’d never quite mastered.

Later that night, in the basement, Jace lay on the old pull-out mattress surrounded by trophies he hadn’t bothered to box back up yet. He stared at the ceiling, listening to the quiet thump of the furnace kicking on. Somewhere upstairs, his mother was watching TV, the faint sound of a news anchor’s voice filtering through the floorboards.

He grabbed the journal again. Opened to the last entry.

“Keep pushing. There’s no glory in easy.”

He flipped to a new page. The pen scratched across the paper, unevenly at first, then steadier.

June 2nd. I ran today. Not like I used to. But I ran.

He paused.

It felt like a beginning. Or an ending. Or maybe just a moment. Either way, I think I needed it.

He capped the pen and let the journal fall to his chest.

The next morning, he didn’t need the alarm. He was awake before the sun had breached the horizon, his body sore but oddly electric. The kind of soreness that reminded him he was still in the game, even if he didn’t know the score.

He pulled on his old hoodie, the fabric thinned from age but soft from wear. Outside, the streets were still bathed in early light, a quiet gold that settled on the pavement like a promise. He ran—just two miles, slow and steady, his breath fogging the air in soft puffs.

At the end of his route, he paused on the bridge over Little Creek. Water rushed below, fast from spring melt. He leaned against the rail, breathing hard.

What was he chasing? He didn’t know.

He only knew that for the first time in years, he wasn’t standing still.

At Cherry Falls High, Coach McKenna greeted him with a smirk and a clap on the back hard enough to jolt his shoulder.

“Well I’ll be damned. Weller. Thought you were a ghost.”

“Close enough,” Jace replied, cracking a half-smile.

They walked along the track together, the younger athletes watching them curiously. McKenna, grey-haired and thick around the middle now, waved a clipboard like a preacher with a Bible.

“I saw you run. Still got something in those legs, huh?”

“Something. Not sure what.”

“Doesn’t matter. These kids? They need someone who knows what it’s like to push through failure. Not just the kids who win everything. The ones who fall and get up again. You want to help out? There’s a spot.”

Jace didn’t answer right away. He watched a girl in lane two trip during a hurdle drill, fall, then scramble back up before anyone could say a word. He remembered that feeling—the sting of failure, the desperate need to prove you could shake it off.

“Yeah,” he said quietly. “Maybe I do.”

That night, he drove past the old gas station, the one where he used to meet friends before Friday night games, where he once kissed Lacey for the first time while her cherry slush dripped down her hand. It was boarded up now, faded graffiti scrawled on the side.

He turned left on Main, past the coffee shop that still had the same barista working weekends, and pulled into the parking lot of the rec center. A flyer was posted near the door: Community 5K – Fundraiser for the Youth Track Club. Volunteers Needed. Runners Welcome.

He tore off one of the tabs at the bottom and stuffed it into his pocket.

The future didn’t look like gold medals or Olympic trials anymore. It looked like this—cracked tracks, second chances, kids trying to run away from their own shadows.

Jace had run from a lot of things. But maybe now, at last, he could start running toward something.

A week after the alumni race, the soreness had faded into something almost nostalgic. The kind of ache that followed real effort, not the dull fatigue of desk jobs and disappointment. Jace had returned to the track each morning like a ritual. No spectators, no stopwatch, just the sound of his breath and the rhythm of his shoes on the lane. He liked the solitude. He liked knowing no one expected anything of him but motion.

It had started to rain the third morning in a row. Thin, chilly drops that dampened the rubber underfoot and clung to his eyelashes. He didn't stop. Something inside him had shifted, subtle but irreversible. He wasn't chasing trophies anymore, and he wasn’t interested in living in the golden years that had become a kind of prison. He wanted to feel the ground under him, to feel the wind in his face—not for the sake of proving anything, but simply to feel alive again.

That same morning, as he jogged the final curve, he spotted a lone figure sitting under the bleachers, knees hugged tight to her chest. It was the same girl who had tripped during hurdle practice the week before. Her name was Mariela, a freshman with long legs and uncertain eyes. Coach McKenna had mentioned her during a post-practice chat, saying she had raw speed but no confidence to match.

She didn’t notice Jace at first, and when he approached, she startled slightly.

“Didn’t mean to sneak up on you,” he said, trying to sound casual. “Rain makes good cover, I guess.”

She shrugged, wiping at her face in a way that could’ve been rain or something more.

“You alright?”

“Yeah,” she said too quickly. Then, “I’m just tired.”

Jace sat a few feet away on the lowest bleacher step, careful not to invade her space. “Tired’s fair. Track takes it out of you. Especially when you care.”

She hesitated. “It’s not that. I just... I don’t think I’m any good.”

“Why’s that?”

She looked down at her muddy sneakers, the laces frayed. “I fell. Again. Everyone saw.”

“You think I never fell?”

“You ran at state. People talk about you like you were a legend.”

He chuckled softly. “Legends fall too. They just fall louder.”

Her eyes flicked toward him, uncertain.

“I fell hard,” he continued. “Broke down in front of thousands of people. Tore a muscle, lost my scholarship, drank too much, burned out. And for years, I thought that fall defined me.”

“It didn’t?”

“No. What did was standing up. Not right away. Took me a long time. But I’m here, aren’t I?”

She sat in silence, processing that.

“You’ve got good form,” he said. “You run angry. That’s a good start. You want to work on your starts sometime?”

She looked up. “Would you?”

He nodded. “Be here tomorrow. 7 a.m. Rain or shine.”

She gave a small smile, the kind that almost doesn’t make it to the lips. “Okay.”

By the end of the second week, word had spread that Jace Weller was helping with the team. He never made it official, and neither did Coach McKenna. He wasn’t paid. He didn’t even have a whistle. But the kids came to him anyway—awkward, shy, half-curious. He didn’t give speeches or try to sound wise. He just showed up. He ran the warmups with them. Timed their intervals. Gave quiet pointers that hit harder than any pep talk.

Mariela improved first. Her starts became sharper. Her strides less panicked. She began finishing practice with a grin rather than an apology. Then others followed. Carter, the wiry junior with a lazy gait but explosive speed. Darnell, the shot-put kid who had hidden sprints under a layer of sarcasm and sweatpants. Even Nia, the captain, started to seek him out after practice, asking about techniques and nutrition.

It was strange, this feeling. Being useful again. It scared him a little, how much he wanted to protect them from the mistakes he’d made. How badly he wanted them to find the finish line he never did.

On a Friday evening, after practice had ended and the sun dipped low behind the bleachers, Drew showed up again. Same baseball cap, same cooler, same crooked grin.

“You’re becoming a regular Mister Miyagi out here,” he joked, tossing Jace a bottle of water.

“They’re good kids.”

“They always are. Until life gets at ‘em.”

Jace didn’t argue. Instead, he glanced across the track where Mariela was still doing stretches alone. She held each pose with careful concentration, as if afraid to move too quickly and mess it up.

“You remember when we used to run in the dark?” Jace asked.

Drew snorted. “You mean when you ran and I huffed behind you cursing your name?”

“Yeah. Those nights were better than I knew.”

“You only know what things mean when you’ve already left ‘em.”

Jace sighed, tipping the water bottle back. “Maybe I’m not done running.”

Drew tilted his head. “You thinking about that 5K?”

He hadn’t said it aloud yet. Not even to himself. But the flyer was still in his pocket. Crumpled, sure. But still there.

“Maybe.”

“Think you could do it?”

“I think I need to find out.”

The next morning, he didn’t go to the track. He drove twenty minutes east to a trail that wound through the foothills, one he hadn’t visited since college. It was uneven, rocky, and brutally inclined in parts, but the kind of place where each mile felt like a revelation.

He parked by the trailhead, stretched in silence, and began to run.

The uphill burned immediately. His thighs screamed in protest, and sweat stung his eyes within minutes. But he kept going. One mile. Then two. Each footfall was a drumbeat. His breathing was ragged, but it had rhythm.

By the fourth mile, something cracked open inside him—not physically, but deeper. A memory: his father cheering from the sidelines, a time before the pressure had turned joy into performance. Another: the first time he kissed Lacey beneath the bleachers, the cold aluminum against his back. And another: sitting in a hotel hallway after Nationals, a bottle of whiskey in one hand, an icepack in the other, wondering if he had wasted it all.

He reached the top of the trail just as the sun crested the ridgeline. The light hit him square in the face, sharp and clean and unflinching.

Jace dropped to his knees in the dirt, heart thundering, breath caught somewhere between a sob and a laugh.

He had nothing to prove. Not anymore.

But he still had something left to give.

Later, back at home, he stood in front of the bathroom mirror again. Same scar. Same tired eyes. But the set of his shoulders had changed.

He pinned the 5K flyer to the corkboard above his desk. Then he picked up the phone.

“Coach McKenna,” he said when the voice answered. “You still got that stopwatch?”

“Always.”

“Think I’m ready to get timed again.”

A pause. Then, “You serious?”

“Dead serious.”

“Well, damn. Let’s make it count.”

Chapter Two: The Long Run

The morning of the trial run, the air tasted like cold metal—clean, crisp, and full of warning. Jace stood on the edge of the high school track once more, this time not as a nostalgic visitor, but as a man with a goal. Not a medal. Not a headline. Just a number on a clock. Coach McKenna leaned on the rail with the stopwatch in hand, the old-school kind that still clicked when the button pressed.

“Alright,” McKenna said, chewing on the corner of a toothpick. “Three miles. Let’s see what kind of rust we’re dealing with.”

Jace nodded and took his place in lane one, bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet. His breath fogged in the morning air, muscles tense but ready. He’d warmed up carefully. There was no use in pulling something before even starting. He reminded himself, again and again, that he wasn’t here to win. He was here to run.

McKenna’s voice broke the silence. “Ready?”

Jace exhaled. “Yeah.”

“Go!”

The first lap felt good. He kept his strides even, his arms tucked in close, resisting the urge to push too hard too soon. His body was older now, wiser in its own battered way. It didn’t respond to adrenaline the way it once did—it required pacing, patience, and a quiet kind of respect.

By the second lap, his legs began to protest. Not the burning ache of exhaustion yet, but a familiar tension in the tendons and joints that warned of limits. He adjusted his gait, focused on breathing through his nose, drawing in long, slow pulls of air. McKenna called out the splits as he passed each marker, his voice steady, neutral, giving nothing away.

By mile two, his lungs felt tight, the cold air slicing into him like small blades. But he didn’t slow down. He couldn’t. Something old had awakened inside him again—something feral and relentless. It wasn’t pride. It wasn’t even redemption. It was the memory of motion itself, the sacred geometry of running. One foot in front of the other, over and over again, as if each step was a vow to not stop.

When he crossed the final line, he collapsed to one knee, coughing into the dirt, chest heaving. McKenna didn’t say anything for a moment, just clicked the stopwatch and whistled.

“Twenty-five thirty-six,” he finally said. “Not bad for an old man with busted knees.”

Jace laughed breathlessly. “Could’ve been worse.”

“Could’ve been a lot worse.”

Jace looked up. “Think I can cut it under twenty-two in three weeks?”

McKenna squinted at him. “With enough work? Maybe. But that’s not really why you’re doing it, is it?”

Jace stood slowly, wiping sweat from his brow. “No,” he said. “But it’d be nice.”

That afternoon, he returned home sore but buzzing. He soaked in the tub for nearly an hour, the water tinged with Epsom salt and heat. His body hummed with the dull symphony of effort and repair. Every joint, every muscle had played its part. He had tested the limits. Found them. And discovered they were just far enough away to make the next goal possible.

The phone rang somewhere in the other room. He ignored it. His mother would answer if it was important.

Instead, he lay back in the bath and closed his eyes, remembering a night years ago, when he’d first broken fifty seconds in the 400-meter dash. The roar of the crowd. The feel of his coach’s hands on his shoulders. The unbearable brightness of the stadium lights. He could still feel it in his chest—the burn that felt more like triumph than pain.

He hadn’t thought about that night in years. Had buried it under failures and invoices and lost years. But now, that moment glimmered in his memory like a lighthouse. A place he could steer toward, even if he never reached it again.

The following week was a blur of training, planning, and unexpected connection. Mariela met him on the track every other morning. She rarely spoke unless asked, but she listened carefully. Her starts grew sharper. Her breathing more controlled. She had a runner’s stubbornness and a beginner’s hunger, and watching her improve lit something in Jace that he hadn’t felt since college.

Other students trickled in too. Sometimes it was just questions—what to eat before a meet, how to shake off the nerves, whether shin splints ever went away. Sometimes they stayed to run drills. More often, they just wanted to talk. To feel like they mattered to someone who had worn their shoes.

One morning, while leading warmups, Carter asked the question everyone had been tiptoeing around.

“So, Coach—uh, Jace—are you, like, trying to compete again? Like... for real?”

Jace paused mid-stretch, considering the question. “Not exactly.”

“But you’re doing the 5K, right?”

“Yeah.”

“Why?”

It was a fair question. The group was quiet, waiting for the answer.

Jace stood, brushing dirt from his knees. “Because I spent too long sitting still,” he said. “Because I used to run from things. Now I want to run toward something. Even if I don’t know what it is yet.”

They didn’t say anything for a beat. Then Carter nodded. “That’s kind of cool.”

“Yeah,” Mariela added, surprising everyone. “It is.”

He spent more time in the evenings now with Lacey, usually after practice. Sometimes they sat in her small backyard drinking beer and reminiscing. Sometimes they didn’t talk at all. There was a comfort in the silence between them, in the easy rhythm of two people who had once been close enough to hurt each other and far enough now to let it heal.

One evening, as the sky turned to velvet, Lacey turned to him. “Do you think you’re going to be okay?”

He took a long sip of his drink. “I don’t know.”

“But you’re trying.”

“Trying feels like a start.”

She leaned her head on his shoulder, her voice soft. “You’ve changed.”

“People do.”

“No,” she said. “People get older. You’ve changed.”

He wasn’t sure how to reply. But her hand found his in the grass, and they sat like that until the mosquitoes drove them inside.

With each passing day, his training grew more disciplined. He logged each mile in a notebook. Not for metrics—he wasn’t trying to impress anyone—but to track the rhythm of his body. He paid attention to food again. To sleep. He stopped drinking beer, started eating real breakfasts. Every morning, before the sun came up, he ran the quiet streets of Cherry Falls while the world still slept.

And in that silence, the past stopped chasing him.

He no longer saw himself falling in slow motion at Nationals. He didn’t replay the phone call from Texas, the one where they pulled his scholarship. He didn’t think about the divorce, the shouting matches, the silences that came afterward. He didn’t hear the voice of his younger self asking what the hell went wrong.

He just ran.

The day of the community 5K arrived with no fanfare. Overcast skies. Damp grass. A smattering of spectators with coffee cups and folding chairs. It wasn’t a grand event, just a local tradition. But it felt monumental.

He arrived early, warming up quietly along the outskirts of the park. Mariela and a few of the others had come to watch. McKenna gave him a nod from the finish line. Even Drew was there, eating a doughnut and pretending not to be invested.

The gun cracked, and he launched forward.

The pace was fast at first. Young guys surged ahead, high on adrenaline. He let them go. He knew better than to sprint the first half-mile. He stayed steady. He listened to the ground. He watched the runners ahead of him—how their gaits shifted, how their arms tightened with fatigue.

One mile down. Two. His breath came ragged but controlled. He passed a few of the early leaders, their youthful energy burned out too soon. By mile three, only a handful remained ahead of him.

But he didn’t chase.

He just ran.

He crossed the finish line at twenty-one forty-two. Better than expected. Enough to make McKenna raise his eyebrows.

He doubled over, gasping, the world spinning slightly. But when he stood upright, hands on hips, he smiled.

Because this time, he wasn’t running from anything.

And it felt like freedom.

After the race, a quiet settled over Jace that he hadn’t expected. It wasn’t pride—at least not in the way he’d remembered it. There was no crowd roaring, no podium, no medal. Just a folded paper number pinned to his shirt, soaked with sweat, and a time scribbled in pencil on a whiteboard behind the community center. But as he walked through the group of milling runners, slapping hands and nodding to strangers who offered congratulations, he felt something unfamiliar: peace.

Lacey was waiting by the snack table, holding two cups of orange slices in one hand and a bottle of water in the other. She didn’t cheer, didn’t shout or clap. She just smiled when she saw him approach, a soft, knowing expression that said more than a thousand cheers would have.

“You finished,” she said, handing him the water.

“I did,” he replied, gulping it down between breaths.

“And?”

He thought about it. “It wasn’t about the clock.”

She nodded as if that’s exactly what she expected him to say. “You looked good out there. Like yourself.”

“I don’t know if I know who that is anymore.”

“You’re figuring it out.”

They found a bench near the edge of the park, away from the buzz of conversation and cleanup crews beginning to take down folding chairs and pack away leftover muffins. He sat heavily, legs aching, knees stiff. Lacey didn’t press him to talk, just sat beside him, quiet, their elbows brushing.

“I was scared,” Jace admitted after a few minutes. “Not of losing. Not of hurting myself. I was scared I’d feel nothing. That I’d cross the line and just… still be empty.”

“But?”

“But I didn’t.”

He turned to her. “It didn’t fix anything. My life’s still a mess. Still jobless, still living in a basement, still figuring out what I even want. But out there, I didn’t feel like a failure. I didn’t feel like a has-been.”

“You felt like a runner.”

He nodded. “Yeah. Like that was still mine. Even after all this time.”

Lacey rested her head on his shoulder. “That’s something.”

It was.

In the weeks following the race, things didn’t magically fall into place. There were no sudden job offers, no dramatic turns of fortune. The house still creaked in the cold mornings, his mom still asked when he planned to “get back out there,” and his bank account still frowned with each rent-free month. But something had shifted beneath the surface.

He started coaching officially—McKenna filled out the paperwork, cleared it with the school, and handed him a clipboard that smelled faintly of old sweat and permanent marker. The paycheck wasn’t much, but it didn’t matter. He showed up every morning before school and again in the afternoons. The kids called him “Coach Jace,” and the name stuck.

He poured himself into it. Not because he was trying to relive anything anymore, but because he knew what it meant to have someone believe in you. He saw himself in all of them—the eager, the frightened, the cocky, the quiet. Each one had a version of the same question behind their eyes: Am I good enough? And each day, he tried to help them find the answer for themselves.

Mariela started placing in the top three at local meets. Carter shaved half a second off his hundred-meter time. Even Darnell, now half-jokingly dubbed “The Freight Train,” started leading the warm-ups. The team had changed. And so had he.

There were bad days too. Days when the knee wouldn’t bend right, when his body reminded him of years spent ignoring doctor’s advice. Days when he woke up in a fog and couldn’t shake the weight on his chest. He still saw the scars—some visible, some buried deep—but he no longer let them steer.

One afternoon in late fall, Lacey met him after practice with two steaming cups of cider and a worn manila envelope.

“What’s this?” he asked, taking a sip.

“Mail came to my place,” she said. “Old habit. You still use me as your second address on some things.”

He opened the envelope. Inside was a letter from a small private college in northern Colorado. One of the assistant coaches had heard from McKenna about Jace’s work with the team and wanted to talk about an open assistant coaching position.

Jace read the letter twice, blinking slowly.

“They want an interview,” he said.

“I know.”

He looked at her, heart thudding.

“I didn’t send anything,” Lacey said quickly. “But Coach McKenna might’ve made a few calls.”

He held the paper like it might turn to ash. “It’s part-time. But it’s something.”

“It’s more than something. It’s a door.”

He folded the letter and slid it back into the envelope. “What if it doesn’t work out?”

“Then you try something else. But at least you’ll know.”

He let out a long breath, staring out at the empty track.

“I think I’m scared of wanting things again,” he admitted.

“You wouldn’t be human if you weren’t.”

They sat in silence again, watching the wind blow old leaves across the lanes.

The interview was set for the following Tuesday. Jace drove the two hours north in his beat-up sedan, fingers gripping the steering wheel tighter than necessary. The school was modest, nestled among pine trees and stone buildings that looked like they belonged in a novel. The head coach, a wiry man named Leon Patel, welcomed him with a handshake and a quiet intensity that Jace recognized instantly.

They didn’t talk much about his past. A few polite nods to his college record, a brief acknowledgment of his injury. The real focus was on now. On how he worked with young athletes. On his philosophy of development and failure and growth.

“What do you want to bring to our program?” Patel asked.

Jace thought for a moment. “I want to help kids understand that their worth isn’t tied to their time on the clock,” he said. “That running can be more than performance. That it can be identity. Healing. A way forward.”

Patel smiled. “We could use that.”

That night, on the drive home, the mountains were quiet silhouettes beneath a moonlit sky. Jace rolled down the window and let the cold air whip through the cabin. He didn’t know yet if he’d get the job. He didn’t know if Cherry Falls would always be home, or just the place he’d rebuilt himself.

But for the first time in a long while, he didn’t feel stuck in a chapter he couldn’t turn the page on.

He was moving forward.

Not fast. Not for glory.

But forward.

And sometimes, that was enough.

Chapter Three: Shadows and Stride

By mid-November, Cherry Falls began to freeze around the edges. Morning runs left Jace’s eyelashes frosted and his breath billowing in thick clouds. The track, often covered with a thin glaze of ice before sunrise, shimmered like a sheet of glass under the weak winter sun. The runners hated it, but they showed up anyway. He showed up too, sometimes before dawn, sometimes before even the maintenance staff had unlocked the gates. The solitude didn’t bother him. He liked the quiet discipline of cold mornings. It reminded him that improvement didn’t require comfort—it required consistency.

The coaching job at Northridge College was still in the air. Coach Patel had emailed to say the interview had gone well, but they were reviewing a couple of other candidates. Jace told himself not to hope too much, but the truth was that he checked his email twice as often now. He told no one about it. Not even Lacey. If disappointment came again, he wanted to meet it in private.

In the meantime, the high school team kept growing stronger. Mariela had become a quiet leader among the younger runners, her once-timid presence now marked with confidence and precision. Carter, now deep in winter conditioning, asked to train with Jace on Saturdays. Even Nia, the captain, began to defer to his input without the defensiveness she’d shown early on. What had begun as a reluctant return to the track was evolving into something deeper—something that resembled purpose.

Still, old habits returned in whispers. There were nights Jace couldn’t sleep, his mind replaying moments he hadn’t asked to remember. The injury. The hotel room. The call from Texas. The silence after the divorce papers had been signed. They drifted back like ghosts, not with malice but with melancholy. Even healing carried shadows. He’d learned not to run from them. Instead, he ran with them—each mile layered with memories, each stride an echo of who he used to be and who he was still becoming.

One Thursday afternoon, just as practice was winding down, Coach McKenna called Jace over to the edge of the bleachers, waving a sheet of paper with that familiar glint in his eye.

“Guess who’s been invited to speak at the state coaching symposium?” he said.

Jace blinked. “Me?”

McKenna smirked. “Don’t act so surprised. People are starting to notice. Your girl Mariela’s times dropped seven seconds in six weeks. That’s not normal.”

“That’s her work, not mine.”

“It’s both. And don’t pretend otherwise.”

The symposium was in Denver, a two-day event packed with clinics, panels, and coaches from around the state—some from major universities, others from tiny rural schools. McKenna had been invited too, and it didn’t take much arm-twisting for Jace to agree.

Still, as he drove toward the city that weekend, he couldn’t help but feel like an imposter. He’d spent the last decade away from this world. Who was he to stand among professionals who had never left it?

The event center was a converted hotel ballroom, the kind with thick carpet and lukewarm coffee. The energy was brisk, serious. People wore polo shirts embroidered with team logos, khakis, and name badges. Jace felt underdressed in his jeans and plain black hoodie, but no one seemed to care. His panel was a small one—“Rebuilding Confidence After Injury and Burnout.” Just a half hour.

When his name was introduced, a few heads turned. One woman in the second row leaned over to her colleague and whispered, “Is that the Cherry Falls guy? Weller?”

He stood at the podium, cleared his throat, and began.

“I’m not going to talk to you about technique. I’m not here to sell drills or conditioning programs. I’m here to talk about something most of us avoid—loss. Loss of performance. Loss of direction. Loss of self.”

A quiet fell over the room.

“I used to think success was permanent. That once you hit a mark—once you hit your PR or got the scholarship—you’d made it. But success is fragile. It evaporates when you stop feeding it. And I stopped feeding it. Not just the training, but the belief.”

He talked about Nationals. About the injury. About losing the scholarship and spending six years pretending he hadn’t once been someone worth watching. He talked about coming home. About failure. And how the most important race he ever ran was a local 5K with no prize and no crowd.

“I realized I didn’t need to reclaim the glory,” he said. “I needed to reclaim the why.”

When he finished, the applause was hesitant at first, then steady. He shook a few hands, took a few business cards. One coach from a school in Wyoming asked if he’d consider consulting on a new team. Another invited him to speak to their athletes in the spring.

As he left the ballroom, Jace felt the strangest thing: belonging. Not to the past. Not to a memory. But to a community he hadn’t realized was still waiting for him.

Back in Cherry Falls, the cold deepened. Snow began falling more regularly, blanketing the track in silence. Practices moved indoors—into the narrow gymnasium hallways, where runners did laps under flickering lights and dodged volleyball nets.

During one of these practices, while demonstrating form drills in the hallway, Jace felt a sharp tug in his hamstring. Not a tear—thank God—but enough of a warning shot that he limped for two days afterward.

Lacey drove him to urgent care despite his protests. The doctor gave him a soft wrap, some ibuprofen, and the predictable lecture about “knowing your age.”

“You think I don’t already know?” Jace muttered under his breath.

Lacey heard him. She smiled. “You’re not old. You’re just not bulletproof anymore.”

“That’s worse.”

But she helped him back into the car anyway, and when they pulled into his driveway, she didn’t leave. She made soup while he iced his leg. She curled up next to him on the couch and fell asleep against his shoulder during a rerun of some terrible detective show.

That night, for the first time in years, Jace didn’t dream about falling behind. He dreamt of a quiet track, of warm sunlight, and of someone waiting at the finish line with open arms.

Two days later, the email arrived.

The job was his.

Assistant Track Coach, Northridge College.

He sat at the kitchen table, phone in one hand, the letter open on his laptop. His mother watched from the stove, hands on her hips.

“You going to take it?” she asked, as if the answer wasn’t obvious.

He didn’t respond right away. He stared at the offer like it might vanish. There would be changes. He’d have to leave town. Find a place to live. Start over again—again.

Lacey walked in through the back door, holding two coffees.

“You saw it?” she said.

He nodded.

She handed him one of the cups. “So?”

“I don’t know.”

She smiled. “You do.”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “I’m scared.”

“So was I,” she said, “when I stayed here after everyone left. When I opened the bookstore. When I decided I didn’t need to be someone else’s dream anymore.”

He looked at her. “Will you be okay if I go?”

She didn’t answer right away. She took a sip of her coffee and then sat down beside him.

“I’ll be okay. But I’ll miss you.”

He reached for her hand. “I’ll miss you too.”

They didn’t talk for a while. The winter sun filtered through the kitchen window, casting soft shadows across the table. He looked back at the screen.

And this time, he didn’t hesitate.

He clicked “Accept.”

The weeks that followed felt like a blur pressed between long drives and cardboard boxes. Once the decision was made, the reality came fast. Paperwork. Emails. Housing searches. Farewell dinners. There was something almost comical in how mundane the transition felt, considering how significant it truly was. After all the soul-searching, pain, and slow rebuilding, Jace was finally leaving Cherry Falls—not in defeat this time, but with intention.

Northridge College wasn’t big. The campus was tucked into a quiet corner of the pine-backed hills just outside Silver Creek. Snow dusted the roofs and walkways, the air sharp with the smell of evergreens and woodsmoke. The track itself was modest, a six-lane oval behind the recreation center, partly buried under winter frost. It didn’t matter. Jace didn’t need the grandeur anymore. He needed work. He needed to show up. And, slowly, he was learning how to do that.

The head coach, Leon Patel, greeted him with the same calm professionalism he’d shown at the symposium. He introduced Jace to the team over lunch in the student union—a collection of faces that ranged from bright-eyed freshmen to fifth-year seniors who looked at every new coach with quiet skepticism.

“He’s a little older than most of you,” Patel said, cracking a smile as he stood beside Jace, “which means he probably knows twice as much and has pulled muscles you didn’t even know you had. So listen up.”

There were a few chuckles, a few raised eyebrows, but overall, the introduction went smoothly. Jace took it all in without ceremony. He wasn’t here to impress them. He was here to work. And, in time, maybe even belong.

His apartment was a small unit on the edge of campus—one bedroom, thin walls, and a view of the pine forest that dipped into the valley. He furnished it sparingly: a mattress on a metal frame, a desk near the window, a used couch from a thrift shop, and the same corkboard from his old basement in Cherry Falls. He pinned the 5K flyer to it again, even though the race was long past. Not as a trophy, but as a reminder. A mile marker. Proof that he'd taken a step.

The work at Northridge was more structured, but not less rewarding. The athletes here were hungry, driven. Some had been recruited, some walked on with something to prove. Jace found himself drawn to the ones who didn’t quite know how to believe in themselves yet. The ones who, like Mariela, still had the raw pieces but didn’t know how to put them together.

There was a girl named Jasmine who reminded him of his younger self—not in her speed, but in her relentless self-criticism. She ran middle distance and could never quite meet her own expectations. She’d finish a race with a solid time and still mutter under her breath about how she should’ve kicked earlier, or how she let the second corner eat her form.

“You know,” Jace told her one afternoon after she’d thrown her spikes against the fence post-practice, “there’s a difference between wanting to be better and beating the hell out of yourself.”

She frowned. “I don’t want to make excuses.”

“That’s not an excuse. That’s understanding your own limits. You’re not a machine.”

She looked away. “I just don’t want to waste it. My scholarship. This chance.”

He nodded. “Then run like you love it. Not like you owe it.”

She didn’t answer, but she picked up her spikes and carried them home instead of leaving them behind.

Back in Cherry Falls, life moved on without him, the way all towns do. Lacey sent him texts every couple of days—mostly short updates or blurry photos of snowfall clinging to the high school sign. She told him Mariela had set a new school record for the 800 meters. Carter had started talking about applying to college track programs. Coach McKenna still kept a bottle of antacids in his desk drawer and blamed it on “too many damn teenagers with attitude.”

They spoke on the phone sometimes too. Sometimes just for five minutes. Other times for an hour. It was different now—no longer the vague almost-romance that hovered just out of reach, but something softer. Something deeper.

One night, after a long session reviewing training footage with Coach Patel, Jace returned to his apartment to find a package waiting for him. Inside was a framed photo of him crossing the finish line at the 5K, a wide, weathered grin on his face. Behind him, the crowd—modest, scattered—blurred into trees and benches. Tucked behind the frame was a note in Lacey’s handwriting:

“This is who you are. Don’t forget.”

He set it on his desk beneath the corkboard.

By mid-February, the indoor season was in full swing. Jace traveled with the team to a meet two hours away, where he found himself pacing nervously before heats, checking runners’ laces and stretching bands like a man on a mission. It reminded him of his early days at Texas, but this time, he wasn’t the one about to hear the gun. He was the voice in their ear, the calm before the storm.

Jasmine qualified for finals. She ran with a fire he hadn’t seen in her before, keeping her form crisp even as fatigue pulled at her limbs. When she crossed the line, she looked over at him immediately. And though she didn’t smile, there was something in her eyes. A kind of clarity.

“That’s what it’s supposed to feel like,” she told him after.

He didn’t need to say anything. He just nodded.

Later that night, alone in his apartment, Jace opened a notebook and began to write again. Not training notes, not race strategies. Just thoughts.

"There’s no perfect race. Only the one you run. I’m still learning how to finish what I start. But I think, for the first time, I’m not afraid of what comes next."

He closed the notebook and leaned back, listening to the wind outside, the pines brushing against each other like slow applause. There was still more ahead. There would always be more—more miles, more setbacks, more ghosts. But for the first time, he was ready to face them.

Not with regret.

But with stride.

Chapter Four: Breaking the Tape

Spring arrived slowly in Silver Creek. The snow retreated inch by inch, uncovering browned grass and the skeletal remains of last year’s leaves. The track thawed in patches, until finally one morning, the entire oval was clear—slick in places, but usable. The first outdoor practice of the season brought with it a new kind of electricity, and Jace felt it before he even reached the field.

Runners spilled out from the locker rooms in layers of mismatched sweats and thermal shirts, laughing as they jogged the perimeter. The sound of their shoes on rubber, the call-and-response of stretching drills, even the tinny beat of someone’s portable speaker—it all made Jace feel like he had stepped into a waking memory. Not one from the past, but from a dream of what his life could’ve looked like if things had broken differently. And now, somehow, it had broken differently. Not through some miracle, but through work. Through persistence.

Coach Patel tossed him the clipboard before Jace even reached the infield. “You’re taking lead on starts today. Everyone’s rusty.”

Jace grinned. “Aren’t they always?”

The team had grown into him, or he into them. There was trust now. Familiarity. Even the seniors, initially cautious, now deferred to his advice without the wary glances of a few months ago. He wasn’t just the guy with the second chance anymore—he was Coach Weller. It still sounded strange in his head. But not unwelcome.

That morning, while coaching block starts, Jace caught himself demonstrating posture in a way that felt eerily automatic—like his body still knew the geometry of speed, even if the muscles weren’t quite built for it anymore. Jasmine watched him closely, her arms crossed, brow furrowed.

“You ever miss it?” she asked when the others were out of earshot.

He looked at her. “Miss what?”

“Running. Competing. The burn. All of it.”

“Sometimes,” he admitted. “But I don’t miss who I was when I thought that’s all I was good for.”

She nodded slowly. “That’s what I’m scared of. Like, what
