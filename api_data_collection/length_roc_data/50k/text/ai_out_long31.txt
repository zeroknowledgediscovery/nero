Whispers of Tansel Wood
Chapter One: The Spark in the Bramble

It was the way the wind moved through the brambles that gave her away. Not by sound, for sprites seldom made any, nor by sight, for even the keenest eyes would miss the slip of her shadow under leaf and thorn. But the breeze—yes, the breeze—stumbled over something just a heartbeat before it reached Old Harnen's boots, and he knew then she was near.

Old Harnen stooped, one knee creaking. He reached out, calloused fingers brushing the edge of a curling fern. “You don’t belong in these woods, little flicker,” he murmured. “But I won’t catch you if you don’t want catching.”

Nothing moved.

Then, just as he stood and turned back toward the mossy trail, a shimmer like frost on fire peeled away from the trunk of a squat ash tree. She flitted—no bigger than a pinecone, glowing with a strange, off-yellow light, flickering oddly as if unsure of what color to wear in the waking world. She trailed sparks like ink dropped into water, dissolving too soon to see clearly.

And she was laughing.

The sprite darted up and around Harnen’s head, looping twice before perching with a flutter of gossamer wings on the rim of his weather-beaten hat. “You walk like a boar with stones in its shoes,” she said, voice chime-like and yet rough around the edges, as though laughter had dulled its tune.

“I walk like a man who knows these woods,” Harnen grumbled, not unkindly. “What are you doing this far from Tansel Hollow, eh? Don’t you know the wards have faded since the Waking?”

The sprite blinked—eyes too large, too green. “Do you mean the old chalk circles? They’ve all been washed away. Rain doesn’t like lines, you know.”

“And you don’t belong here,” he said again.

“But I am here.” She tilted her head, the thin lines of her face catching golden light. “I’ve got a name now.”

“Have you.” He adjusted his hat, and she fluttered up briefly before settling again. “Well then, let’s hear it.”

“Elmira,” she said, though she whispered it like she wasn’t quite sure. “Elmira Briarwhisp.”

Harnen sucked on his teeth. “That’s no name given by the Hollow. Who named you, sprite?”

Elmira didn’t answer. Her light dimmed, just a shade.

The Hollow had long been a secret to men, hidden not by walls but by forgetting. A ring of ancient trees—sycamore, yew, and the ghost-pale ironbirch—encircled a glade where the old magicks still whispered in the moss. It had once thrummed with the breath of a dozen sprites, flitting in and out of the soft-lantern light of their fungus towers, their songs stitched into the wind. But now the Hollow was nearly silent.

Nearly.

Elmira, as she now chose to be called, hovered over the cracked basin of the central glade fountain. The water, once humming with aurora-light, now trickled dully, like it was embarrassed to still be alive. She poked at the surface with a stick.

“I named myself,” she muttered to no one. “Because nobody else did.”

“Names are weight, child,” said a low voice behind her, dry as shed bark. “You wear them long after the world forgets.”

She spun. “Elder Thiln.”

The old sprite, more bark than shimmer, stood hunched under the arc of a curling fern. He didn’t glow; he etched light, as if the shadows tried to pull him into themselves but failed. His wings were torn, one hanging limp.

“You shouldn’t be wandering into the human wood,” he said, hobbling closer. “Their dreams have teeth now. They don't see what we are. They see what they fear.”

“I wasn’t afraid,” she said.

“You should be.”

He reached into the moss and drew forth a thin blade of quartz. It caught no light, but it hummed softly. “There are things waking beyond the Hollow. And you’ve stirred them.”

Elmira frowned. “It was just one old man. He can barely bend without creaking.”

Thiln sighed, the kind of sigh that lives longer than its speaker. “He’s not the danger. But the moment you step beyond the chalk-ring, you become part of their story. And their stories are hungry.”

In the town of Wensgrove, just three days’ march west of the Hollow, a girl named Arlyn stared into a cup of dandelion tea and saw it swirl into the shape of a face. Not a real one—not clearly—but the outline of a cheek, the curl of a smile too wild to be human. She blinked, and it was gone.

“I’m not mad,” she said aloud.

“Hmm?” her brother Gereth looked up from mending a boot.

“I saw something.”

“You always see something.”

“No, really.” She set the cup down. “It looked like someone. Like… a girl, with leaves for hair.”

Gereth frowned. “You’ve been reading Gran’s books again.”

Arlyn didn’t deny it.

Their grandmother had been one of the last wardens of the old lore, keeper of the Songs Without Names and the Rules of Borrowed Fire. She died five winters ago, leaving behind stacks of leather-bound volumes that reeked of mildew and secrets. Their father had tried to burn them once. The flames hadn’t caught.

Now, Arlyn opened the thickest of the tomes again. The one with the pressed acorn on the cover.

“Sprites,” she whispered. “Said to carry the memory of the forest itself. Said to vanish when named. Said to awaken... when the veil weakens.”

She didn’t know why, but her chest ached when she read it. Like something old had turned over in her ribs.

That night, Elmira dreamed of a mountain split by song. A place where music bled from the stones and turned into rivers of light. A throne sat empty at its summit, built from wind and bark and the bones of birds.

In the dream, she sat there. And she burned.

But the fire did not consume. It whispered.

“Elmira,” it said. “You have been named. You have been chosen.”

She woke to the sound of the Hollow breaking.

Trees don’t scream. Not really. But the old ones groan when wounded, and the ironbirch, the eldest of all, cried out that dawn. Something had torn a wound through its bark, leaving black resin oozing like blood.

Thiln stood before it, tiny hand pressed to the trunk. “The wards,” he said. “Gone. The veil... thinner than mist.”

Elmira stepped closer. “I dreamed something.”

Thiln didn’t turn. “You are not ready.”

“I dreamed the throne.”

Now he looked. His eyes, usually dim with moss-glow, widened.

“You saw the Crown of Greenfire?”

She nodded.

He reached into his chest—not metaphorically, but truly, through a small opening in the bark-like plating of his ribs—and pulled out a splinter of goldglass. “Then it’s begun.”

“What has?”

“The Reckoning.”

Meanwhile, deep below Wensgrove, in a cavern no one remembered carving, a man with a crooked lantern stared at a wall of stone and whispered, “She has returned.” He was bald, robed in tatters, and smelled of soil turned over too many times. On the wall, a faint outline—part glyph, part tree, part open mouth—glowed with wet light.

Another voice behind him, this one calm and clear as cut ice, said: “Then we have only three moons left.”

“Three?”

“She lit the branch,” the ice-voice said. “That means the Hollow is bleeding. The sprite has touched the edge.”

The bald man shivered. “So the songs are true.”

“Some,” said the other. “Some are bait.”

The glyph pulsed once. Then again. Then faded.

“Tell the Order,” the voice said. “The Greenfire is rising.”

And far above them, in the quiet sky over the Hollow, a single leaf fell—out of season, against the wind, glowing faintly.

Elmira watched it land beside her foot. She picked it up, and it did not crumble.

It sang.

The song was so faint it could have been imagined, but Elmira knew better. It curled up from the veins of the leaf like threads of memory unraveling, and for a moment she was no longer standing in the Hollow. She was somewhere else—somewhen else—on a ridge where the trees burned with autumn though the air was winter-cold, surrounded by shapes that stood too still to be human. One figure turned, its eyes hollow, its skin carved from petrified ash.

Then she blinked, and it was just a leaf again. Just her, the quiet forest, and Thiln’s face twisted in a way she had never seen—fear and awe, mixed like oil and fire.

“Put it down,” he said quietly. “That leaf was not meant for you.”

“But it came to me.”

“All the more reason to be wary. The forest does not make choices lightly.”

She hesitated, but tucked the leaf into the woven reed pouch that dangled from her belt anyway. Thiln winced.

“That leaf belonged to the last Warden of the Crown. You cannot wear its weight without waking its memory.”

“I didn’t ask for it,” she muttered. “It came to me.”

“And that is worse.”

Far away in the town of Wensgrove, Arlyn dreamt of vines. They crawled from the cracks between her floorboards, writhing in slow, deliberate coils. Her bed lifted with them, tilting as the wooden arms reached for the ceiling. In her dream, the vines whispered her name—each syllable drawn out like a root curling through stone.

When she awoke, her arms were covered in dirt.

She sat bolt upright, brushing soil from her sheets. Her heart thundered. For a long moment, she said nothing. Then she climbed out of bed and pulled Gran’s book from its hiding place under the loose floor plank. It fell open—on its own—to the page she'd read the day before.

“When the root takes hold in flesh, and the veil thins, seek the Crown or be devoured.”

She traced the inked glyph beneath it—a spiral of thorns inside a circle. It looked disturbingly like the pattern her teacup had made.

Downstairs, the morning was soft and grey. Gereth had already left for the tannery, and the hearth smoldered low with last night’s coal. Arlyn slipped on her boots, slung a satchel over her shoulder, and stepped into the mist.

The road to the forest was not one she took often. It wound behind the orchard, through Old Mern’s goat pasture, and disappeared under a low arch of ivy. Gran had once told her the woods beyond weren’t natural. They shifted. Moved.

But Gran had also told her the sprites had vanished long before Arlyn was born.

Yet here she was, walking toward where the trees grew oldest, where her pulse beat louder with every step. As if something beneath her skin remembered a path she herself had never walked.

Elmira perched in the cradle of a drooping bellflower, her wings furled and her thoughts storming. She couldn’t shake the weight of the dream, the singing leaf, or the way Thiln had looked at her like she’d become something alien.

She didn’t feel different. Not really. Her light was the same. Her wings still buzzed faintly when she flexed them. But inside her—deep, in a place even she didn’t know how to name—something throbbed, like a forgotten promise waking up.

The forest around her was restless too. Small things scurried where they shouldn’t. A thistle plant bloomed in mid-spring with black petals. Moss curled backward on itself, showing its pale underbelly to the sky.

Something was wrong with the Hollow.

And with her.

Thiln had withdrawn after their argument, returning to the broken edge of the fountain to whisper his worries to the stones. The other sprites—those that remained—were silent, keeping to their nests in the boughs. Once, Elmira might have climbed and coaxed them out with jokes or tricks. But now… they watched her with wary eyes.

She was becoming other. That much was certain.

Back in Wensgrove, Arlyn reached the edge of the Hollow by accident—or at least, that’s what she told herself. The forest had grown dense, too fast. One minute she was ducking through brambles, and the next, she was standing in a clearing laced with silver mist. It curled around her boots like fingers, gentle but insistent. She could see only a few feet ahead, but she knew—somehow—that she had crossed into somewhere ancient.

She stepped forward, and the mist broke.

Before her rose a stone arch, half-swallowed by roots. In its center shimmered a membrane of air that bent light like glass over water.

She knew what it was without needing to be told: a veil.

Her breath caught. Gran’s book had spoken of these. Gates to other places—between the waking world and the Greenwoven. Between flesh and dream.

Without meaning to, her hand reached out and touched it.

The membrane trembled—once, twice—and then dissolved.

Elmira heard the hum first. A sharp, sudden note that rang through her bones like a plucked wire. She looked up sharply. The glade’s light dimmed, as if a cloud had passed overhead, though the sky remained clear. The air smelled like turning earth and dry parchment.

Thiln appeared beside her, panting. “The veil,” he gasped. “Someone passed through.”

Elmira’s wings flickered. “A sprite?”

He shook his head, his whole frame trembling. “Worse. A human.”

She didn’t wait. She took off.

The trees blurred past as she zipped through the brambles, following the scent of the open gate. It was like chasing a thunderclap—raw power lingered in the branches, in the crackling hush of the undergrowth. The Hollow hadn’t felt this alive in generations.

She found the girl by the old ironbirch—the one that bled.

And the girl… was touching its wound.

“Hey!” Elmira flared, her light blazing bright, her voice sharp. “What do you think you’re doing?”

Arlyn stumbled back, hand flying to her chest. “You’re… real,” she said, as though it was the only thing that mattered.

“Of course I’m real,” Elmira snapped. “You broke the veil.”

“I didn’t mean to. It just—opened.”

“No veil opens unless it wants to,” Elmira said, though she wasn’t sure that was true. She circled the girl, wings buzzing. “What are you?”

“I’m Arlyn. I live in Wensgrove.”

Elmira stared at her. There was something about her—an echo. A half-remembered song. She hovered closer. “Have you been dreaming of vines?”

Arlyn blinked. “Yes.”

“And trees that bleed?”

“Yes.”

Elmira hovered inches from her face. “Then you’re part of this. You’ve been called.”

“By what?”

Elmira didn’t answer. She didn’t know. But her pouch, where the leaf was tucked, had begun to glow.

Elsewhere, in the depths of the moss-choked ruin known only to the Order as the Rootvault, a voice rose in song.

Not melody. Not language.

A pulse.

And all through the ancient forest, every tree leaned ever so slightly toward the Hollow.

Toward the girl who had broken through.

Toward the sprite who bore the Crown’s first ember.

And beneath them, in the deep-black soil, something began to stir.

Something that remembered the old wars.

Something hungry.

Chapter Two: A Root in the Veil

The Hollow had never welcomed humans, not even in the old days when the veil between worlds hung thinner than a spider's breath and sprites danced openly on twilight roads. Now, as Arlyn stood beneath the wounded ironbirch with Elmira’s piercing gaze locked on her every move, the very ground seemed to tremble with unease. The moss had pulled back from her boots, revealing dark, glistening soil that pulsed faintly, like it had a heartbeat of its own. Above, the canopy stirred without wind.

“Don’t move,” Elmira said, her voice low and deliberate. “You’ve already done enough.”

Arlyn frowned. “I didn’t do anything. I was just—”

“You touched the wound,” Elmira interrupted. “That tree is older than Wensgrove. Older than your people’s stories. When its bark bleeds, the world listens. You touched it. Now it knows your name.”

“That’s impossible.”

“And yet here you are.”

The sprite hovered backward, arms crossed, wings slowly pulsing to keep her aloft. Her light had dulled slightly, a muddy hue flickering beneath the surface of her shimmer. Arlyn couldn’t tell if it was fear or anger—or something worse. Elmira seemed younger than Arlyn had expected a forest spirit to be. Not a child, exactly, but not the ancient, delicate thing the old books described either.

“What’s happening?” Arlyn asked, trying to keep her voice steady. “Why did the veil open for me?”

Elmira dropped to a low-hanging vine and perched like a bird. “I don’t know. That’s the worst part.”

“Don’t you live here? Aren’t you supposed to know everything?”

“I’m not like the others,” Elmira muttered. “I wasn’t born in the Hollow. Not really. I woke up here. No memory, no name, just… a shimmer. They said I was a mistake.”

Arlyn felt her breath catch. She had spent her entire life being told she was too curious, too strange, that her head was always in places it didn’t belong. Somehow, the way Elmira spoke—the tightness around her words—felt familiar.

“You named yourself, didn’t you?” Arlyn asked.

Elmira stiffened. “What of it?”

“I read about that,” Arlyn said. “Sprites are named by the forest. Only outcasts or… or reborn ones have to name themselves.”

That earned her a long stare. Then, to her surprise, Elmira laughed—not sweetly, not like bells or flutes, but like a hiccup of relief.

“You have been reading the old books.”

“Gran left them to me.”

Elmira cocked her head. “What was her name?”

“Branna Vey.”

Elmira froze. “The witch of the fifth grove?”

“She wasn’t a witch,” Arlyn said. “She was a historian.”

“Same thing.”

They fell silent. Somewhere beyond the glade, a branch cracked. Not a squirrel-snap, not a breeze-break. Heavier. Measured. Elmira turned in mid-air, her light brightening again as her senses sharpened.

“We need to leave,” she said.

“Why?”

“Because we’re being watched.”

Thiln crouched high in the canopy, hidden in the blue-vined yarrow that had woven itself into a small platform centuries ago. He had followed Elmira in silence, keeping to the air when possible, the branches when not. He watched the girl—this human, this Arlyn—with an intensity born of worry, yes, but also recognition.

She bore no mark of the old blood. No glow, no glyphs. But the way she had crossed the veil, how the ironbirch had bled when she arrived… it could not be coincidence. Too many signs were aligning. The Crown’s song was waking again. And if that song chose her...

He would have to speak to the Stonesoon. Even if it meant breaking the pact.

Thiln dropped from the tree, wings stiff, and melted into the darker parts of the Hollow, where roots formed tunnels and silence carried messages long before words could.

Elmira led Arlyn along a narrow path that hadn’t been a path until a moment before. The forest moved subtly around them, rearranging moss and branch to let them pass. Arlyn followed in silence, heart pounding, trying to memorize every detail—the upside-down lily clusters, the bark with spiraled ridges like fingerprint whorls, the sense that each step sank deeper into a dream.

They came to a clearing shaped like an eye, the center a shallow pool that reflected the sky with unsettling clarity. Elmira gestured for Arlyn to kneel beside it.

“This is the Seer’s Mirror,” she said. “Don’t touch the water. Just look.”

Arlyn leaned over the still surface.

At first, she saw nothing unusual—just her face, her wide eyes, a smear of dirt across her cheek. Then, the image shifted. The reflection became older, wilder—her hair twisted into bramble-wreaths, her skin lined with greenish veins like roots. Behind her, a throne carved from a single massive toadstool loomed.

She gasped and sat back, heart hammering.

“That’s what the Hollow sees in you,” Elmira said.

“That’s not me.”

“It might be.”

Arlyn looked up at her. “Do you see yourself differently too?”

Elmira didn’t answer.

Instead, she turned toward the edge of the glade, where vines had started to coil inward. “We have to go. This place draws attention.”

“Where are we going?”

“To someone who might have answers.”

They traveled deeper than Arlyn thought possible. The Hollow, from the outside, seemed no larger than a glade or two—maybe the size of a meadow. But within, it folded. Paths repeated. Trees stood in two places at once. Light changed too fast, then not at all. Arlyn stopped trying to track time.

Finally, they came to a gnarled hill that rose out of the earth like a blister. Its side was cracked, revealing a narrow entrance into dark. Elmira touched the moss above the opening and whispered something that didn’t sound like speech.

A warm breeze exhaled from the tunnel.

“Come on,” she said.

Arlyn hesitated, but followed.

Inside, the air was thick with root-smell and damp stone. Bioluminescent threads ran along the ceiling like stars caught in a net. The tunnel widened into a chamber hollowed into the base of a long-dead tree, its interior lined with bark that whispered faintly, like a hundred voices breathing.

At its center sat a figure.

He was taller than Elmira by a handspan, his wings sheared and bound with copper thread. His hair was moss-green, and his eyes glowed with a pale, fevered light. Carvings covered his skin—runes or scars, Arlyn couldn’t tell.

“Thiln,” Elmira said softly.

The figure didn’t move. “You brought her.”

“She needs to know.”

“She already knows,” Thiln said, opening his eyes fully. “She just hasn’t remembered yet.”

Arlyn stepped forward. “What do you mean?”

He studied her, gaze sharp as a blade. “You carry a seed of the Crown. It was buried generations ago, hidden in the bloodlines of those who turned away from the Green. The forest has called it forth in you.”

Arlyn shook her head. “That’s not possible. I’m just a—”

“No,” he said. “You were just a girl. Now, you’re a root of something old. And every root either grows or rots.”

He stood, and the chamber dimmed.

“You have seven days before the veil collapses completely. The old war is waking, and if you don’t learn how to wield the Crown’s gift, this time, the Hollow burns.”

Arlyn felt the world sway. Elmira’s hand caught her wrist.

“You’re not alone,” she said.

Arlyn looked at her, and for the first time since stepping into the forest, believed it.

Together, they turned toward the dark again, and walked deeper into the roots of fate.

The path beyond Thiln’s chamber grew narrower and stranger, spiraling downward like a burrowing worm made of lightless rock and root. Elmira led the way, the faint glow of her wings casting shadows that danced too deliberately across the walls. Arlyn followed closely behind, her thoughts scattered and loud, every heartbeat echoing with Thiln’s words—You carry a seed of the Crown.

She didn’t feel different. Her body hadn’t changed. She still remembered the taste of dandelion tea, the scratch of wool at her neck, the ache in her knees from crouching too long over a book. And yet… something in her blood responded to this place. To the Hollow. Like the deep roots of some old tree tugging upward inside her skin.

“Where are we going now?” she asked, her voice low to avoid disturbing the stillness.

“To the Stonewake,” Elmira said. “It’s where the Hollow remembers things too old for words. It may show you something the Seer’s Mirror didn’t.”

Arlyn tried to imagine how a place could remember, but then she glanced at the wall and saw the rock subtly reshaping itself—curling in patterns like writing half-finished—and decided not to ask.

After what felt like hours of walking, the tunnel opened abruptly into a vast chamber so wide and high it might have been the inside of a mountain. Pillars of fused bark and granite rose toward a ceiling veiled in mist. Strange lights blinked and moved far above, as if stars had wandered into the roots by mistake. At the center of the space lay a flat, obsidian-colored slab surrounded by concentric rings of moss and mushroom, their colors shifting in slow pulses.

Elmira gestured to the slab. “Lie down.”

Arlyn hesitated. “What if I see something I can’t understand?”

“You will. That’s the point.”

With slow, uncertain steps, Arlyn approached the stone and climbed atop it. It was warm—not unpleasantly so, but like a hearthstone that had been sitting by fire all night. The moment her back touched the surface, her body relaxed involuntarily, breath catching in her throat. The moss around the stone stirred.

Elmira stood at the edge of the nearest ring and closed her eyes. “Stonewake, listen. Let her root reach.”

The moss pulsed once, and then Arlyn fell inward.

It wasn’t sleep. It wasn’t waking either. The world fell away, then rebuilt itself in layered loops of memory and myth. She stood in a forest that was not the Hollow, yet somehow older, more wild. Trees towered impossibly tall, leaves glowing with silvery light, their trunks inscribed with songs that hummed softly beneath her feet. She was barefoot. She was younger. Or older. Or someone else.

Ahead, a figure waited. It wore a cloak made of antlered vines and eyes that flickered like candlelight.

“You’ve come late,” it said, and its voice was every wind she’d ever heard through her bedroom window.

“I don’t know who I am,” Arlyn replied.

“You are seed and soil both,” the figure said. “You are the echo of a pact, the second thorn on the same branch.”

“What pact?”

The figure did not answer. Instead, it held out its hand, and in its palm lay a shard of something too bright to be seen directly. Arlyn reached out, her fingers brushing the edge—

—and she was back.

The Stonewake exhaled, and the moss dimmed. Elmira was there, crouched at her side, eyes wide with tension.

“You spoke while you were dreaming,” she said. “You called me by another name.”

“What name?”

“Altheya.”

Arlyn sat up slowly. Her skin was damp with sweat. The stone beneath her heart still pulsed faintly.

“I think… I think I’ve been here before,” she whispered. “Not just today. Before my life. Before this life.”

Elmira didn’t speak for a long time.

Then, “The old legends say the first Crownbearer was not born but made. Woven from forest and flame, given form by choice. They say she wore three names—one for each life.”

“I saw something,” Arlyn said. “A crown made of thorn and fire. Not metal. It bled.”

“That was the first branch,” Elmira said, voice trembling. “And it was lost. Buried with the Warden who died sealing the veil. If it’s waking again…”

She trailed off. Neither needed to finish the sentence.

That night, they camped by the Weeping Hollow, a small spring nestled in the roots of three intertwined trees. The water was bitter, but Elmira drank without hesitation. Arlyn, hesitant, took only a sip and found it curiously sweet. The stars above the Hollow didn’t look like the ones from Wensgrove. They shifted when she wasn’t looking, forming symbols she couldn’t quite read.

“Do you miss them?” Arlyn asked as she stared upward.

“Who?”

“The other sprites.”

Elmira didn’t answer immediately. Her wings fluttered once, and she turned a pinecone over in her hands like a puzzle.

“They don’t see me as one of them,” she said at last. “Not really. I wasn’t born from bark and mist. I just… was. One day I blinked and the forest was around me. Thiln says I’m a ‘fault-light.’ A spark that wasn’t meant to catch.”

“That’s cruel.”

“It’s not cruelty if it’s true.”

“It can be both,” Arlyn said softly.

They sat in silence after that, the fire they’d coaxed from the moss casting long, lazy shadows. Arlyn found herself staring again at her hands. Nothing about them had changed—and yet she could feel the forest pressing close to her thoughts, as if waiting for her to say something only it would understand.

Elsewhere in the Hollow, deep below the twisted bone-roots of the Blacksythe Tree, Thiln stood before the Stonesoon—a creature more moss than form, its body a patchwork of lichen and old bark, its face hidden beneath a veil of roots.

“You spoke the name,” the Stonesoon rasped. “Altheya rises again.”

“She walks the Hollow already,” Thiln replied. “She touched the Mirror and the Wake. The Crown’s echo responds.”

“And the Order?”

“Moves. We are not the only ones who remember the war.”

The Stonesoon groaned—a sound not of pain, but of age made audible. “Then the time is near. The tree of ending stirs.”

Thiln stepped forward. “We need to prepare her. She does not understand what she carries.”

“No one does,” the Stonesoon said. “Not even the first Warden. The Crown makes kings of soil and monsters of root. If she wears it, she becomes the Hollow. If she refuses, the Hollow dies.”

“And Elmira?”

“She is the key that should not exist.”

“But she does exist.”

“Which makes her the most dangerous of all.”

At dawn, Arlyn woke to the sound of birds that didn’t sound like birds. They sang in harmonies too exact, notes layered like woven thread. Elmira was already up, crouched by the spring, sketching something into the dirt with a twig—a symbol, circular and fractured, like a sun cracked down the center.

“What’s that?” Arlyn asked as she stretched.

“A mark I saw in a dream,” Elmira said. “Same night you came through the veil. I’ve been seeing it since I named myself.”

“It’s familiar.”

Arlyn didn’t know why she said it. But it was true. The shape pulled at her mind, like an itch she couldn’t reach.

Elmira wiped it away quickly. “Come on. Thiln wants us to reach the Hollow’s edge before nightfall.”

“Why?”

“There’s something buried there. Something you’ll need, if you’re going to carry the Crown.”

“What is it?”

“A memory,” Elmira said. “But not yours.”

They reached the edge by dusk. Unlike the lush heart of the Hollow, the perimeter was lined with ash-blasted trees and silent pools where light bent the wrong way. It was a place of endings, not beginnings.

Elmira led Arlyn to a mound half-swallowed by bramble. Together they cleared the vines until a slab of wood was revealed, old and cracked, but with one unmistakable feature: the crown sigil carved deep in its center.

“This was hers,” Elmira whispered. “The first Warden. This is her grave.”

Arlyn knelt beside the slab. The moment her fingers touched the sigil, the world tilted.

She saw a battle—trees falling, fire spreading, sprites screaming. A woman with a crown of flame stood at the center, arms raised, singing a song that shattered the air. A tear rolled down her cheek as she fell backward into the earth, sealing the breach with her own breath.

Then Arlyn gasped and fell away from the vision.

Elmira caught her.

“She chose to die with the Hollow,” she said softly. “You might have to do the same.”

“I don’t want that.”

“No one ever does.”

They stared at the slab a moment longer. Then, without a word, they turned from the grave and walked back toward the Hollow’s heart—where war was already reaching through the roots.

The rain in the Hollow came without warning or sky. One moment the canopy filtered golden-green light, and the next it wept—not in drops, but in fine, whispering strands that glistened like thread. Arlyn held out her hand, watching the strange rainfall gather on her skin. It felt neither wet nor dry, not cold nor warm, but present, like the touch of something ancient and curious.

“It’s memory rain,” Elmira said, stepping carefully across a bridge made of woven roots. “The Hollow sheds it when it’s full.”

“Full of what?”

Elmira glanced back, her wings flickering. “Grief. Names. Things it hasn’t forgotten, but wishes it could.”

They had left the grave of the First Warden behind them, though Arlyn still felt its presence in her chest like a second heartbeat. She hadn’t spoken since waking from the vision at the gravesite. The images—fire, loss, the song that ended the war and the life that sang it—looped over and over in her head. She hadn’t been that woman, and yet the moment her fingers touched the sigil, it was as if the woman had opened a door and said, This is yours now.

Elmira slowed as they neared a clearing shaped like a broken wheel. Giant petals, each the size of a cartwheel, lined the rim of the glade, their insides pulsing faintly in time with the rain. At the center stood an obelisk made entirely of woven thorns, twisted into a lattice that almost looked like a cage.

“This is the Archive of Teeth,” Elmira said.

Arlyn frowned. “That sounds... unfriendly.”

“It is. But it listens.”

“What do you mean?”

“Every wound ever suffered in the Hollow leaves a mark here,” Elmira said, walking closer. “Physical, emotional—it doesn't matter. If it drew pain, it echoes here.”

“And you brought me here why?”

“Because the Crown is a thorn. It grows best in pain.”

Arlyn took a breath and stepped into the clearing. The petals quivered as she passed, and the thorn-obelisk let out a creaking groan, like wood trying to remember its first tree.

As she drew near, the air thickened. Words not spoken hung in the silence like dried herbs—too brittle to use, too dangerous to ignore. She reached out, one hand trembling.

And the Archive opened.

Not with a sound or a crack, but with feeling. Arlyn’s knees buckled as a rush of agony—not hers, but the forest’s—swept through her. She saw glimpses: a fire started by men in red coats, a grove razed to build a road that never lasted, a sprite crushed beneath a wheel, its glow snuffed like breath on glass. Thousands of tiny deaths, each remembered with exquisite detail.

And beneath all of them, the pain of the Warden’s final sacrifice. The Crown, abandoned. The veil, stitched shut by song and sorrow.

Elmira steadied her. “Don’t look too long,” she said. “The pain will keep you.”

“I saw… so much.”

“And that was only the shallow wounds. Deeper ones are locked in the Rootvault.”

Arlyn swallowed hard. “I think I understand now. Why it has to be me. Why the forest called me.”

Elmira’s expression softened for the first time. “Understanding doesn’t make it easier.”

“No. But it makes it necessary.”

Far from the Archive, in the ruins of a forgotten watchtower straddling the edge of Wensgrove, the Order of the Gloam assembled in silence. Ten figures stood in a circle, cloaked and masked, their faces hidden behind polished masks of bark and bone. In the center of their gathering, a basin of black sap bubbled faintly, emitting the smell of burnt root and dried blood.

“The girl has crossed,” said one—his voice deep, slow, carefully measured. “She walks the Hollow. The Thorn has taken root.”

“And the fault-light walks beside her,” murmured another, voice high and tremulous. “Unbound. Unnamed.”

“She is named,” corrected a third. “Elmira Briarwhisp.”

“That name was not given. It was taken.”

“Which makes her more dangerous.”

The leader raised a hand. “Enough. The crown must not rise again. The Thorn’s bloom would unravel the seal. The war would restart.”

“But the veil thins already,” said the tremulous one. “The Hollow cracks beneath its own remembering. Soon, it will fall.”

“Then we force their hand,” said the leader. “We move tonight.”

All ten stepped forward and dipped their hands into the basin.

The sap clung to them, binding fingers in black.

That night, as Arlyn and Elmira camped near the Hollow’s breath-tree—an enormous trunk that exhaled mist every few minutes like a sleeping beast—they were awoken by the sound of iron.

It clinked faintly, like a sword sheathed in bone.

Elmira snapped upright, light surging in alarm. “Run.”

Before Arlyn could ask why, the mist exploded inwards and something fast and sharp burst through the air between them. It struck the breath-tree, sending out a metallic shriek. A moment later, a second dart embedded in the moss beside Arlyn’s foot.

Figures emerged from the fog, cloaked and silent.

Elmira grabbed Arlyn’s wrist and pulled her back, her wings flaring in defense. “Run now.”

They darted into the woods, the Hollow shifting to shelter them. Branches bent to slow their pursuers. Roots pulled up to trip them. But the enemy had planned for this. Flames, cold and green, licked through the underbrush—fire that didn’t burn, but unwove.

“Nullfire,” Elmira hissed. “They brought nullfire.”

They reached the edge of a ridge and skidded to a halt. Below, a ravine opened, filled with thorn-fog and twisted saplings.

“No choice,” Elmira said.

She dove.

Arlyn hesitated—then jumped after her.

They fell through fog and landed hard among thorns that didn’t cut, but whispered. Arlyn sat up, dizzy, blood pounding in her ears. Above, their pursuers didn’t follow.

Elmira groaned. “They won’t come down here. The Hollow’s heart is too wild.”

Arlyn looked around. “Where are we?”

Elmira stood shakily, brushing off her tunic. “The Thornsoul. Deepest part of the forest. It's where the Hollow speaks clearest. And loudest.”

“And it brought us here.”

“Or… it wants something from us.”

They looked at one another—fear and resolve twin glimmers in their eyes.

Above them, the green fire crackled but could not cross.

Below them, something ancient waited.

And at Arlyn’s side, the pouch holding the leaf of song began to hum again.

The Thornsoul pulsed around them, a forest inside a forest, a second skin of the Hollow folded deep under its surface. Where the rest of the woods bore life in bark and moss, here everything whispered and watched. Vines moved of their own accord, curling along Arlyn’s boots like curious cats. Flowers opened not to light, but to breath. Even the trees seemed to lean in to listen to the sound of thought.

Elmira walked slowly, her light flickering uncertainly. She had not been here before, not this deep, not in this part of the Hollow where even sprites feared to tread. The ground was spongy with ancient decay, but no rot clung to it. It smelled of renewal, of something dying just to become again.

Arlyn stayed close behind, keeping one hand near the pouch where the leaf continued to vibrate softly. The hum rose and fell with her heartbeat now, as though the forest and her blood were trying to match rhythms.

“This place is alive,” she said.

Elmira nodded, then paused. “No… not just alive. It remembers. Everything that’s ever bled into the soil, it’s here. Feel that?”

A deep thrumming echoed beneath their feet. Not loud, not threatening. A breath in reverse. A memory growing.

They descended further into the hollowed basin where the Thornsoul coiled inward like a spiral. In its center stood a singular tree—black, barkless, and leafless, but radiating a deep luminescence from within its wood. Roots stretched up instead of down, threading through the air like veins. Its shape wasn’t quite right—crooked in places, shifting subtly as they stared.

“That’s the Heartwood,” Elmira whispered.

Arlyn approached it. “It’s beautiful.”

“It’s dangerous.”

“I know.”

Something in the tree pulsed when Arlyn stepped within arm’s reach. Not light. Not heat. Recognition.

And the leaf in her pouch burst into flame.

She yelped, reaching to pull it free, but there was no pain. The flame danced without heat, spiraling upward like smoke caught in wind. Elmira stepped back, eyes wide. The tree answered. A low hum rose from its core, vibrating the very ground.

Then, like a dream stitched from bark and sorrow, the air above the Heartwood twisted and formed an image—hazy, shifting, but slowly sharpening. A woman stood there. Not flesh, but light wrapped in the shape of memory. She was tall, crowned in thorn and fire, her robes formed from roots and fog. Her eyes, green as the Hollow’s oldest leaves, locked onto Arlyn.

“You are the second echo,” the woman said, her voice both inside and outside the world. “The Hollow remembers. The Thorn returns.”

Arlyn swallowed. “Who are you?”

“I was Altheya. I wore the Crown when it still bled freely. I sang the song that sealed the breach and gave my name to the soil. Now I remain only as breath, waiting for the branch to bloom again.”

Elmira stepped forward. “Is she a spirit?”

“No,” Arlyn said, softly. “She’s a root. Left behind.”

Altheya turned her gaze to Elmira. “And you… flicker-born. You should not be. And yet, you are.”

Elmira flinched, her wings tightening. “I didn’t ask to exist.”

“No. But you do. And that may make all the difference.”

The vision began to flicker.

“Listen closely,” Altheya said, her voice fracturing. “The Order of the Gloam seeks to cut the root of memory. They fear the Thorn’s return. They fear what you will become. They will strike the Hollow at its weakest—the Sourcepond, where the veil thins. You must go there. Find the Bloomstone. If it breaks, the forest’s mind will collapse. All this will unravel.”

Then she looked at Arlyn again. “The Thorn does not choose lightly. But when it chooses, it does not release.”

The image shattered into light and rain, and the Heartwood went silent.

For a long time, neither of them moved.

Then Elmira said, “We have to reach the Sourcepond before they do.”

Arlyn nodded, still trembling. “How far?”

“Three veils deep,” Elmira said. “We’ll have to cross the Stillgrove.”

“What’s that?”

Elmira grimaced. “A place where nothing moves. Not wind. Not time.”

“That sounds… awful.”

“It is.”

The path to the Stillgrove was not a path at all. It revealed itself in glimpses—a branch bent the wrong way, a stone warm when it should have been cold, a breath of air that smelled faintly of mint and ash. Elmira led with instinct, not direction, and Arlyn followed, half-blind, her body beginning to ache from more than just exertion.

The Hollow pressed in closer here. Trees grew twisted with memory. Petals held the shape of faces. Once, Arlyn thought she saw her father’s profile in the bark of a cypress. Another time, she heard Gran’s voice humming in the rustling leaves.

The forest was waking. Not in the way a creature wakes, but in the way a mountain remembers it once was flame.

Finally, they reached the edge of the Stillgrove.

It looked like the rest of the Hollow at first—verdant, dense, green—but not a single thing moved. No birds. No wind. The trees stood too straight, their branches frozen at unnatural angles. Leaves hung mid-fall, suspended in air as if trapped in sap.

Elmira held out an arm. “Don’t breathe too deeply.”

“Why not?”

“The air here carries memory that doesn’t belong to you. It’ll try to wear your shape.”

Arlyn stepped carefully into the grove, her skin prickling. The moment she entered, it was like she had walked into a painting. Her limbs felt heavier. Her thoughts moved slower.

Beside her, Elmira glowed faintly, her shimmer forcing the stillness back just enough to keep them moving.

“Why is this place like this?” Arlyn asked.

“It was the last battle,” Elmira said. “When Altheya sealed the veil. The energy twisted everything. Froze it.”

Arlyn reached out to touch a hanging leaf. As her finger brushed it, a rush of images flooded her—shouting, fire, blood, songs that cracked the sky—and she staggered backward.

Elmira caught her. “I told you. It remembers everything.”

They pushed on, deeper into the frozen green, until they reached the center of the Stillgrove.

There, surrounded by pillars of petrified light, floated a pool of water so still it reflected the underside of the leaves above it perfectly. In its center, resting atop a curved root, was the Bloomstone.

It looked simple—an oblong crystal the color of pressed heather, pulsing faintly with each breath Arlyn took. She stepped toward it instinctively.

Then the grove shuddered.

Something had entered.

Elmira cursed. “Too late.”

Figures emerged from between the trees—six cloaked in bark and bone, masks glinting dully in the half-light. They stepped without sound, but the Hollow screamed around them. The Stillgrove tried to resist their presence, but even time could not hold them back.

The lead figure spoke. “Arlyn of Wensgrove. Step away from the stone.”

“Who are you?” she demanded, voice shaking.

“We are the hands of forgetting,” the figure said. “We are the cut that heals. The war ended because we ended it. And we will not let it return.”

“You want to destroy the Bloomstone.”

“To prevent the Thorn from blooming again. The Hollow must sleep.”

Arlyn looked at the stone. Then at Elmira.

“No,” she said.

“Then you die with it.”

The Order moved as one.

Elmira raised her hands, vines erupting from the ground at her command. Arlyn felt something rise inside her—hot, wild, and sharp. Not rage. Not magic. Purpose.

She stepped into the pool.

The Bloomstone answered.

Light erupted—pure, ancient, green-and-gold like the Hollow’s first dawn. The Order staggered. Elmira cried out, shielding her eyes.

And Arlyn heard a voice—her voice, but older, deeper, singing a name that wasn’t hers but fit like skin.

The Order fell back. Their leader screamed as his mask cracked. The stillness broke. Leaves fell. The wind returned.

The grove exhaled.

And the Bloomstone bloomed.

Chapter Four: The Bloom and the Blade

The Bloomstone continued to pulse long after the battle had ended. Its glow was no longer faint or hesitant. Now it flared with living color, a rhythm that matched Arlyn’s heartbeat. Petals had formed around its base—delicate shapes of crystal and bark, blooming from the still water as if coaxed by her presence. The stone was no longer just a relic. It was alive again. And it had chosen.

Arlyn stood in the shallows of the pool, water lapping gently at her ankles, arms loose at her sides. Her chest heaved, not from exhaustion but from something deeper—an awareness, like her blood had begun to carry more than breath. The song she had heard was gone now, but it had left its mark, a warmth behind her sternum that pulsed in sync with the Bloomstone’s light.

Elmira approached cautiously, stepping over the withered vines that had lashed out during the skirmish. The bodies of the masked attackers—those who had not fled—lay motionless among the frozen underbrush. Their cloaks had begun to unravel, threads turning to ash as the Hollow rejected them.

“Are you hurt?” Elmira asked.

Arlyn shook her head slowly. “No. I don’t think so. But something’s changed.”

Elmira glanced at the Bloomstone. “You’re bound now. Fully.”

“To the Thorn?”

“To the Hollow. To its memory. You sang, Arlyn. That wasn’t a spell. That was a binding.”

Arlyn’s mind reeled. “I don’t know how I did it.”

“You didn’t need to. The Thorn remembers what you forgot.”

She stepped into the pool and knelt beside the newly formed petals, running a hand over one. It was warm to the touch. “The Crown is blooming again. That’s what this means.”

Arlyn’s voice was barely above a whisper. “And that means the war’s coming back.”

“Unless we stop it,” Elmira said. “Or finish it.”

Far to the west, where the Hollow met the sheer cliffs of the Ravelspine, the wind carried wordless songs into the sky. Old winds, old magic. The kind that remembered names not spoken since the first roots grew. In a ruin carved into the mountainside, the last Sentinel of the Green sat alone, eyes closed, fingers dipped in a shallow bowl of honeyed sap.

He had felt the Bloomstone stir.

“Too early,” he murmured. “Too soon.”

The rootbound scrolls at his side curled tighter, their sigils glowing faintly. A white bird perched nearby, its feathers like dry parchment. It tilted its head at him and blinked once.

“The Thorn sings again,” he said, not looking at it. “And a girl wears its tune.”

The bird let out a single, low note.

“Then it’s time,” the Sentinel said. “The Grovewardens must wake.”

Back in the Hollow, Arlyn and Elmira gathered what they could from the Stillgrove and began their journey toward the Veilrise—the last known place where the Thorn Crown had fully bloomed before it was hidden. The Hollow had changed around them. The stillness was broken now, and with it came movement. New vines grew in hours. Trees budded strange flowers in impossible colors. The forest stirred like something stretching after a long, uneasy sleep.

“The Bloomstone is only one piece,” Elmira said as they picked their way over a bridge of fallen branches. “The Crown wasn’t forged. It was grown. In pieces. Bloomstone. Rootblade. Veilbark. And the Song.”

Arlyn looked over. “You mean the song I sang?”

Elmira nodded. “That was only a thread. The full Song of the Thorn hasn’t been sung in an age. It needs all four pieces to be heard again.”

“So we find the rest.”

Elmira stopped suddenly. “You say that like it’s simple. But the Rootblade was lost in the War of Boughs. It sank into the Tarnmere, and no sprite has dared go near that water since.”

“We don’t have time for fear.”

“That’s the problem,” Elmira said, voice tight. “It’s not fear. It’s memory. That place remembers what it took. If we go there, it might remember us too.”

Arlyn placed a hand on her friend’s arm. “Then we remind it that we came to heal. Not to take.”

They didn’t speak again for a while, the forest muttering around them. The Hollow’s mood had changed since the Bloomstone bloomed. It wasn’t hostile, not exactly, but watchful. As if it wasn’t sure what kind of story was being written yet.

When they stopped to rest near a ring of lanternstalks—fungus that glowed in response to kindness—Arlyn examined the pouch where she had kept the leaf. It had burned away during the song, but left behind a faint stain on the fabric. She touched it absently, and images flared behind her eyes: hands raised in defiance, the sound of roots splitting stone, the terrible calm before sacrifice.

Elmira sat beside her, folding her legs neatly beneath her. “What do you remember when you close your eyes now?”

Arlyn thought. “I remember… both lives. Mine. Hers. But only pieces. It’s like trying to catch wind.”

Elmira’s wings flickered gently. “That’s how it started for Altheya, they say. Half a life remembered, half lived.”

“She must’ve felt so alone.”

“She wasn’t,” Elmira said. “But she thought she was. That’s what doomed her.”

Arlyn looked away, unsure what to say. The words sat heavy in her chest.

As they pressed on, the Hollow grew stranger. Time slipped. Paths repeated. Night crept in around midday. They encountered things that should not have existed: a fox with bark for fur, a brook that ran upward through a tree’s hollow trunk, a cloud of moths that murmured lullabies in the tongues of long-dead keepers. Arlyn found herself losing track of what was real and what was remembered.

But always, Elmira pulled her forward. Always, the path bent when she called it.

At the crest of a ridge covered in silver fern, they looked out over the horizon.

“There,” Elmira pointed. “That’s the Tarnmere.”

A lake, dark and unmoving, sprawled below them like spilled ink. No birds flew above it. No breeze touched its surface. At its
