Title: The House Next Door

Chapter One: The Fence Line

Maple Lane was the kind of street where everything looked too neat to be real. Lawns mowed to exact inches, porch lights timed to flicker on at twilight, and garbage bins aligned with military precision every Thursday morning. But beneath the surface—underneath the vinyl siding and flowerbeds of pink begonias—there was a slow, simmering unease.

It started, as most things do, quietly.

The Thompsons had lived at number 42 for seven years. Jacob Thompson was a software engineer, quiet and precise, with a beard that never quite matched the color of his thinning hair. His wife, Mara, ran a boutique bakery downtown. Their daughter, Ella, was in fifth grade, all elbows and awkwardness, trying hard to be invisible at school and home. To them, the house next door had always been vacant. No one came. No one went. The mailbox, though pristine, never bore a name.

Until May.

The moving truck arrived early in the morning. Jacob watched from his upstairs office window as men in blue coveralls hauled out a variety of mismatched furniture—some antique, some modern, and all out of sync. A piano with chipped keys. A velvet armchair. A stack of what looked like crates labeled in Cyrillic script. A woman emerged from the passenger seat of a small silver hatchback, her hair in a long dark braid down her back, sunglasses wide enough to hide her entire face.

Mara was the first to introduce herself. She took over a batch of lemon scones and rang the bell at number 40. No answer. The bell didn't chime. She knocked. Still nothing.

Later that evening, as the sun dipped behind the elms lining the street, the woman appeared again—this time in the backyard, barefoot, digging with a small hand shovel under the light of a citronella torch.

Jacob watched her for a long time. She didn’t notice him.

The next morning, there was a fence.

Not a new fence, exactly, but an extension—tall, wooden, and raw-smelling, stretching half the length of their shared property line. It hadn’t been there the day before. No sound of hammering, no scent of fresh-cut timber, just… suddenly, the fence.

Jacob went to investigate. Close up, he could see it was old wood, oddly aged, yet still wet at the base. It didn't match the existing fence in style or height.

“What’s she building?” Mara asked that night over dinner.

“A barrier,” Jacob said.

Ella stabbed at her broccoli. “Maybe she’s a witch.”

Mara frowned. “Don’t be rude.”

“She was digging with a spoon,” Ella added.

“Shovel,” Jacob corrected. “And don’t spy.”

“I wasn’t spying. I was in the treehouse.”

“Still,” he said, though his voice trailed into nothing.

By the weekend, the woman had a name. Or at least, a mailbox label: D. Kalinina.

No one saw her again for a week. No comings or goings. No lights on. Just the occasional scrape of metal against earth. Then came the dog. A massive animal, gray and wiry, with eyes like marbles and a bark that felt like it shook the siding.

Jacob didn’t like dogs.

He had a reason for it—a bite when he was six, from a neighbor’s boxer that had gone “playful” a little too hard. The scar still itched when he was nervous. Mara said it was psychosomatic. Jacob didn’t argue.

Ella, on the other hand, was fascinated. She named the dog “Bones” and whispered to it through the fence slats, even though it never responded.

Three weeks in, the neighborhood watch got involved. Mr. Hinshaw from across the street knocked on the Thompsons’ door with a clipboard and a practiced smile.

“We’re just concerned,” he said. “A new person on the block, strange hours, no community engagement…”

Jacob leaned in the doorway. “She’s not doing anything illegal.”

“We don’t know what she’s doing.”

“Then maybe leave her be.”

Mr. Hinshaw didn’t like that. He made a note on his clipboard.

Two nights later, Bones went missing. The barking stopped.

The silence was worse.

Ella cried at bedtime.

“I didn’t even get to pet him,” she said.

That night, Jacob dreamt of digging. Hands blistering as he clawed at dark soil, pulling up objects he couldn’t recognize—twisted things, broken bones, glass eyes. When he woke, Mara was gone from bed. He found her downstairs, looking out the window.

“She’s out there again.”

Jacob looked. D. Kalinina stood still as a statue in the backyard. No shovel this time. Just standing.

“She knows we’re watching,” Mara whispered.

Chapter Two: Echoes in the Garden

In the third week of June, Ella stopped going outside.

“She won’t even touch the swing,” Mara said. “She says it feels… watched.”

“Watched how?”

“I don’t know, Jacob. Just watched.”

Jacob started noticing little things. Tools going missing from the shed. A pile of feathers near the fence, all of them black and oily. The sound of music at odd hours—an old phonograph maybe, scratchy violin pieces that played and then looped.

Then, a note. Slipped under their front door. No envelope. Just:

“The fence is not for you. Do not look over it.”

Mara wanted to call the police. Jacob talked her down.

“She hasn’t threatened us. Not really.”

“Jacob—”

“We can’t prove it was her.”

“Who else would it be?”

She had a point.

The next day, the fence was higher. Two more boards, crude and uneven, added overnight. Ella said she saw the dog again, in a dream, lying under the apple tree in their yard.

“He said he was sorry,” she whispered to Jacob. “He said she made him dig.”

“Sweetheart, dogs don’t talk.”

“This one does.”

After Ella went to bed, Jacob poured a drink and stood at the window. The house next door was dark. Not empty. Never empty. But dark.

He stepped out into the yard, barefoot. The grass was cool. The air tasted metallic.

At the fence, he pressed his eye to a knothole.

Nothing.

Then a glint—something shiny buried in the soil. A coin?

He reached through the slats, fingertips brushing earth. Cold, hard.

Then a snap. Pain. Something bit him.

He jerked back. Blood on his knuckle. A small tooth-shaped cut.

The next morning, he found a coin on their doormat. Old. Russian, maybe? The date worn down. Mara threw it out. Jacob fished it back.

Things began to spiral.

First, the power flickered, but only in the upstairs hallway. Then Mara’s bakery oven refused to heat beyond 200°F. Jacob’s code at work was corrupted three times in a week. Small things. Minor things. But accumulating.

Mr. Hinshaw left a second note: “We’re having a neighborhood meeting. Attendance expected.”

The meeting was chaos. Everyone whispering rumors, half-formed theories.

“She practices old-world magic.”

“She’s ex-KGB.”

“She’s building a bunker.”

Jacob said nothing. Mara’s hands were clenched in her lap.

Ella drew pictures during the meeting. A dog. A woman with a long braid. A garden full of skulls.

That night, the dream came again. Jacob digging. But this time, he found a mirror. When he looked into it, he saw Bones. And Bones spoke.

“Don’t cross the fence.”

Jacob woke to the sound of hammering. He rushed to the window.

No one there.

But the fence was taller still.

Chapter Three: Crosswinds

By July, the heat had turned oppressive. The kind that made pavement bleed tar and cicadas drone like haunted machines. The fence at number 40 now stood at nearly ten feet—looming, overgrown with some type of vine that hadn’t been there the week before. Leaves dark as bruises, pulsing gently in the wind, though no wind moved.

Jacob had stopped working from home. He couldn’t focus. The dreams were worse. The same digging, the same mirror, but now, Mara was in them too—her eyes milked over, whispering in a language he didn’t recognize.

Ella wouldn’t leave her room.

The school had called. Summer reading was behind. The teacher sounded vaguely annoyed, as if Ella’s silence was a deliberate act of rebellion. Jacob didn’t explain. How could he? Their daughter now painted with only shades of gray and blue, smeared with fingers and rags.

One morning, the family awoke to find something left on their doorstep.

A cage.

Inside: three small bones and a bird feather.

Mara cried.

They didn’t call the police. Not anymore. Something unspoken hung between them—a realization too heavy to say aloud.

Kalinina was not just strange.

She was something else.

That afternoon, Jacob climbed into the attic and opened the crawlspace above the ceiling. Dust made his eyes burn, but he needed to see—needed proof that he hadn’t imagined it.

And there, nestled between the joists, was another coin.

Same shape. Same worn-down face. Except this one had blood on it.

He cleaned it. He didn’t tell Mara.

Later that week, the neighbors on the far end of Maple Lane—the Cartwrights—moved out without warning. One morning their car was gone, garage door ajar, trash bins overturned. House left unlocked. A for-sale sign planted crooked in the yard two days later.

“Something’s happening,” Mara said.

Jacob nodded.

They barely talked anymore. Just exchanged glances. Muted, huddled communication.

Then the treehouse burned down.

Jacob had been in the shower. Ella screamed—high, shrill, full of panic. He ran out soaked, soap still clinging to his chest.

Flames clawed up the ladder like orange fingers. No sound. No accelerant. Just fire, sudden and sure. The swing set melted into the grass.

And next to the ashes, on their lawn, the third coin.

That night, Jacob broke his promise.

He climbed the fence.

The top was slick. The vines moved as if sensing him, curling slightly toward his arms. He hoisted himself over and dropped, hitting the ground harder than he meant.

Silence.

The backyard was... different. Deeper somehow. As if it didn't exist entirely in this world. The grass was soft, almost damp. The smell of sulfur hovered in the air. A faint blue glow lit the perimeter. There was a garden—but not vegetables. Not flowers.

Bones. Arranged in circles. Runes carved into stones. A phonograph that turned by itself, playing a broken tune over and over.

And the dog.

Bones.

He sat at the far end, under the apple tree. Only it wasn’t an apple tree anymore—its bark was split open, and inside, something glistened. Red. Veined. Beating, slowly.

The dog looked at Jacob and whimpered.

“She’s here,” a voice said.

Jacob turned.

Kalinina stood beside the house, one hand on her braid, eyes black from corner to corner.

“You shouldn’t have come.”

He opened his mouth to speak. No words came.

“She’s not done with you.”

“Who?” he rasped finally.

Kalinina stepped closer.

“She doesn’t have a name. Not anymore. But she lives here. In this soil. She remembers your blood.”

Jacob backed away.

“I didn’t do anything.”

“But your house did. Before you. The man who built it—he took from her garden. He thought the bones were old myths. He took. And now it’s your debt.”

“I—what do you want?”

“She wants your daughter.”

Jacob lunged.

Too slow.

Everything spun. The grass shifted beneath his feet. The world tilted. He hit the ground hard, eyes swimming.

Kalinina’s voice echoed as if underwater.

“Go back over the fence, Mr. Thompson. And pray she forgets.”

He woke in bed.

His hands were dirty. Nails cracked. Clothes stiff with soil.

The next morning, the fence was gone.

Not just reduced.

Gone.

As if it had never been.

Just an open view of number 40’s backyard. Empty. Neat. Unremarkable.

The vines were gone. The garden—gone. The dog.

Gone.

Only the apple tree remained, healthy, blooming white flowers. Too white. Not a single blemish.

Ella asked where Bones went.

Jacob didn’t answer.

That night, Mara found him outside, staring into the yard.

“What did you see?”

“I don’t know,” he lied.

“Don’t lie to me.”

He looked at her. Her eyes were tired, sunken.

“I crossed the fence.”

She said nothing.

They didn’t speak again for hours.

But that night, they locked every door. Every window.

And still, something scratched at the glass.

A sound not like claws.

But like teeth.

Chapter Four: Old Roots

The air on Maple Lane changed. It was subtle—almost like the scent before rain, or the way pressure builds behind your ears before a storm.

Neighbors started fighting. Quietly, at first. Raised voices behind drawn curtains. Cars parked at odd angles, keys lost, packages stolen. Then louder. The MacNeils threw a brick through their own mailbox. Mr. Hinshaw started patrolling the block at night with a flashlight and a bat.

No one talked about the house.

Number 40 had gone silent.

Kalinina was never seen again. The windows remained dark. No smoke. No mail.

And yet, the grass never grew long.

Ella spoke less. Her drawings changed again—lines tighter, more deliberate. She painted the apple tree in charcoal and rust, always the same angle, always with a black smear in the center of the trunk.

Mara began sleeping downstairs.

Jacob didn’t ask why.

Then one morning, Ella vanished.

Just—gone.

No struggle. No note. No scream.

Her window was open. The curtains moved gently, though the air was still.

Mara collapsed.

Jacob ran to number 40.

He pounded the door.

No answer.

He went around back.

The garden had returned.

The bones had multiplied.

The dog was there, but only the head now—mounted on a stake, eyes glassy and unseeing.

Kalinina was nowhere to be found.

Only the tree remained, its branches gently creaking without wind.

He screamed Ella’s name.

Over and over.

And the tree bled.

From the split in its bark, something oozed—thick, black, alive.

It whispered.

Not in words. But in feelings. A beckoning.

And Jacob stepped forward.

Jacob didn’t tell Mara he had touched the fence, but the wound on his knuckle wouldn’t stop weeping. It didn’t sting exactly—it tingled, the way a limb does when it’s been asleep too long. At first, he assumed it was just a splinter or a scrape, maybe a spider bite from some hidden corner of the fence post. But by nightfall, a thin ring of red had begun to radiate outwards, and the skin around it looked bruised, almost like a bruise beneath glass. He kept the bandage fresh and said nothing.

The house next door sat silent as a tomb. D. Kalinina didn’t reappear for three days. When she did, it was with an old wicker basket hanging from the crook of her arm, filled with herbs and what looked like twine-bound scrolls. She moved slowly, barefoot again, her braid slightly undone, trailing behind her like a snake shedding skin. She stopped once, sensing—Jacob swore it—his eyes on her from behind the curtain. She didn’t turn. She didn’t wave. She only tilted her head as if listening to something distant, something deep underground. Then she went inside and closed the door.

That evening, Mara tried to break the tension with a barbecue in the backyard. The sun was still high, children’s laughter from a few yards down providing an odd soundtrack to the way she forced the skewers onto the grill rack. Jacob sat nursing a beer, watching the smoke rise and twist toward the fence, the strange fence that now felt more like a wall than a boundary. Ella refused to come outside at first, claiming a headache, but eventually appeared, pale and fidgeting. She stayed close to the door, barely picking at her food.

“Don’t look at it,” she whispered to no one in particular.

Mara overheard. “Don’t look at what, sweetheart?”

“The fence,” Ella said.

Jacob glanced at her. “What about the fence?”

“There’s something behind it,” she murmured, “that breathes when I’m not watching.”

Mara’s spatula clattered against the patio stones.

After dinner, they went through the motions—bathing Ella, reading her half a chapter from her old illustrated version of The Secret Garden, turning on the night light with the tiny moths etched in the plastic. But she didn’t sleep. At midnight, Jacob found her standing at the window, her small hand pressed against the glass.

“I hear him digging again,” she said.

“Who?”

“Bones.”

The name struck him like a whisper in the spine. “It’s just a dream,” he said, but she was already turning back to bed, pulling the blanket over her head.

The next day, the neighbors began to notice. Mr. Salazar, a retired dentist two houses down, commented during a brief exchange by the mailbox, “Odd one, that woman next door to you. Doesn’t even wave. And that fence—who builds something like that without a permit?” His tone was light, meant to carry the weight of a joke, but his eyes didn’t laugh. They lingered. Watching. Waiting.

Later that afternoon, the smell started. Faint at first, like damp earth with something sickly underneath. Jacob thought it might’ve been something in their crawlspace, maybe a dead raccoon, but he couldn’t find the source. It came strongest near the back corner of their yard, right along the fence where a patch of grass had turned a strange shade of yellow.

Mara sprayed the area with vinegar. It didn’t help.

That evening, Jacob found something nestled beneath the hedge: a tiny bundle of rags tied with twine. He picked it up, expecting trash, but it had weight. He unwrapped it slowly, carefully, and inside found a single tooth—gray and chipped—and what appeared to be a small, hand-drawn map with three “X”s marked in red ink. The paper was coarse, like parchment, the lines drawn in an erratic, looping style.

He buried it again without telling Mara.

On Tuesday, the dog returned. Not in body, but in sound. Low, guttural barking at exactly 3:12 a.m. Jacob sat up in bed, heart stuttering, and tiptoed to the window. Nothing. Stillness wrapped the street like gauze, all the homes dark and quiet. But the barking didn’t stop. It went on for thirteen minutes, then ceased mid-bark, like a thread cut. The silence afterward was a vacuum.

He couldn’t sleep after that.

Mara began locking the bedroom door at night, something she’d never done in all their years together. She didn’t explain why. She didn’t have to.

The next day, the fence had changed again. Where the boards had been simple pine before, they were now etched—dozens of fine lines running like veins, curling into sigils and odd curves that weren’t there before. When Jacob squinted at them, they seemed to shimmer slightly, like looking through hot air.

He didn’t cross the fence again.

But Ella did.

It happened on a Thursday, just after lunch. Mara had gone to meet a supplier. Jacob was working from home, distracted by a file that kept crashing his server. He looked up once, saw the door to the backyard open, and assumed it was the breeze. It wasn’t.

By the time he noticed she wasn’t inside, it had been nearly fifteen minutes. He raced outside, barefoot, scanning the yard.

“Ella!”

No answer.

He climbed into the treehouse, hoping for a better view. From that height, he could see the garden next door again. A blur of color. Movement. Shapes he couldn’t quite parse.

Then a voice.

“Daddy?”

He turned, nearly lost his balance. Ella was standing right below, at the base of the treehouse ladder, her face smudged with dirt, her hands trembling.

“Where were you?”

She didn’t answer.

He lifted her up and held her tightly. Her breath was shallow. When he carried her inside, she spoke again.

“She let me in.”

“Who?”

“The fence.”

Mara came home to find Jacob sitting on the floor beside Ella’s bed, his face slack with worry.

“She was gone,” he said.

Mara paled. “Gone where?”

“She won’t say.”

That night, Ella woke up screaming. The kind of scream that tears a parent in half. Jacob sprinted down the hall and found her curled at the foot of the bed, pointing at the window.

“There’s a face,” she cried, “watching me.”

Jacob threw the curtain back. Nothing.

But on the glass, barely visible unless the light hit just right—was a smudge in the shape of a hand. Small. Childlike.

The next morning, Mara left the house with Ella and didn’t come back until after dark.

Jacob didn’t blame her.

He spent the day pacing, checking locks, inspecting the fence.

At noon, he saw Kalinina again. She was sitting in a wooden rocking chair on the back porch of number 40, sipping from a chipped ceramic mug, watching him without blinking.

He didn’t wave.

He didn’t look away.

She raised the mug in a silent toast.

And smiled.

There was nothing human in it.

Chapter One: The Fence Line (Continued)

That night, the nightmares returned with cruel vividness.

Jacob wandered through a version of their backyard stretched unnaturally long, with fences that twisted upward into the sky like cathedral spires. At the far end was the treehouse, but it was wrong—larger, blackened, humming. And beneath it, the garden he had seen in brief glimpses over the fence, now glowing softly, ringed with thin poles that bore masks. The masks wept sap. Something moved beneath the soil, breathing like a giant lung. Ella stood at the center, barefoot, her eyes all pupil.

“She wants me,” she whispered.

Jacob reached out, but her skin cracked like old bark.

He awoke with a jolt, drenched in sweat. The bedroom light was off, but Mara was awake, sitting in the chair by the window. Her arms were wrapped around herself. The curtains were closed, and she had stacked a row of books against the windowsill.

“Do you hear it?” she asked, not turning.

“Hear what?”

“The scratching.”

Jacob said nothing. He did hear it. A soft rasp-rasp-rasp, like claws working at wood just beneath their floor.

“I think it’s under the house,” she said. “Something’s in the house now.”

He approached her slowly. “It’s not real, Mare.”

She turned then, and her eyes were wild. “Don’t tell me that. I saw her reflection. In the oven glass. She wasn’t behind me, Jacob. She wasn’t anywhere. But I saw her face.”

He knelt beside her. “We’ll fix this. I’ll talk to her. We’ll figure out what she wants.”

But even as he said it, he didn’t believe himself.

The next morning, the entire street buzzed with a strange, unspoken energy. Mailboxes slammed with too much force. Sprinklers ran even though it had rained the night before. And every household had their curtains drawn, even at midday. The air held a taste of metal and ozone. Something was coming.

Mara spent the morning baking without stopping—loaves, tarts, pastries, lined up like little soldiers across every counter. She didn’t speak unless prompted. Jacob watched as her hands moved automatically, almost possessed.

By noon, another package arrived.

It wasn’t delivered by mail.

It sat on their front stoop, unmarked and wrapped in wax paper, tied with twine.

Inside were four things:

    A thimble full of red sand.

    A small, brittle bird skull.

    A photo of Ella, black-and-white, her eyes crossed out in ink.

    A coin—different from the others. This one was square.

Mara locked herself in the bathroom. Jacob buried the package in the trash and poured bleach over it.

That evening, Kalinina came to the door.

She didn’t knock. She stood there, waiting, her braid coiled over her shoulder like a vine, her hands gloved.

When Jacob opened the door, she smiled that same expressionless smile.

“You’ve brought her near,” she said.

“Leave my family alone.”

“She’s already inside. I only open the way.”

He tried to slam the door, but she placed her hand against it. Her strength was impossible—immovable as stone.

“She comes for what was taken.”

“What are you talking about?”

Kalinina stepped back. “The tree grows on her grave. And the roots are thirsty.”

Then she left.

Jacob bolted the door. Nailed it shut for good measure.

That night, Ella spoke in her sleep.

“They’re coming through the walls,” she mumbled.

Mara and Jacob stood over her, watching as her fingers twitched and curled, mimicking the motion of someone digging.

In the hallway, a shadow passed by the nightlight.

Neither of them moved.

The next day, the fence was taller than the house.

And behind it, nothing but fog.

Chapter Two: The Garden That Wasn't There

Maple Lane was no longer quiet. The silence had changed character—what once had been the comfort of suburban stillness was now the pause before something unspeakable. Even the birds seemed to sense it; they no longer nested in the elms lining the sidewalk. The mornings brought only the distant whine of lawnmowers and the occasional whisper of wind through hollow, uneasy branches. What didn’t change was the house next door.

Number 40 remained locked in its own rhythm. Kalinina had not been seen again since that night at the door. Her windows stayed shuttered, her porch unswept. But there were signs—subtle, uncanny details that shifted like the eyes in a dream. A garden gnome appeared at the base of the apple tree, only it had no face. The mailbox had changed color. A small, antique mirror was nailed to the trunk of the tree, reflecting a sky that did not match the one above.

Jacob tried to hold on to a semblance of normalcy. He made coffee in the mornings, tried to read the paper, drove to work, and avoided looking at his own house as he pulled into the driveway each evening. Mara had grown colder, quieter. She no longer baked. Her tools lay untouched in a box by the fridge. She didn’t speak much to Jacob anymore, not unless it was about Ella.

Ella, who no longer slept.

At night, she would sit upright in bed, her eyes wide open but blank, speaking in a tongue that no one in the family recognized. It wasn’t gibberish. It had structure, rhythm. At times it even rhymed. Jacob had recorded her once on his phone and played it back the next day to a linguistics professor he found online. The man had emailed back within hours.

“Delete this. Do not contact me again.”

That had been three days ago.

Now, the recordings were gone from Jacob’s phone. Replaced by static.

He didn’t tell Mara.

On the fourth night of that week, the scratching returned, this time louder and constant. It came from beneath the kitchen floor, directly under the table where Ella used to do her homework. Jacob had tried to pretend it was a raccoon, maybe a possum, but each time he pressed his ear to the tile, he could hear the scrape of nails—not animal claws, but long, slow drags, as though someone were drawing lines with a broken fingernail.

Then the smell came back.

Not the sick-sweet odor of rot from before. This was colder, more ancient. It had weight, the kind that clung to the inside of your nose and tasted like stone and ash. Mara covered the vents. It didn’t help. She began sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of water in one hand and the TV remote in the other. It was always tuned to the Weather Channel. Jacob never asked why.

That Friday, Jacob called in sick and stayed home. He had a plan, though it was barely formed. He would dig—return to the place where he first touched the soil beyond the fence. He would find something solid, something real. He packed a flashlight, gloves, his old army surplus trench knife, and a small iron prybar.

He waited until noon.

The backyard was quiet. The sun burned dully behind thick clouds, and the light had the texture of pewter. The vines that had once covered the fence were gone again, replaced by an eerie nothingness—a kind of blank space that didn’t seem to reflect the house or the garden anymore.

Jacob walked to the back corner, right where Ella had once said “it breathes.” The grass there was brittle. Dry even after a week of rain. He kneeled, dug.

The soil came away in loose clumps, revealing something beneath.

Wood.

Old planks, gray with rot but unnaturally hard. Like petrified bone. He kept digging until he uncovered an edge—then another.

It was a hatch.

Jacob sat back, breathing hard.

He considered calling Mara. But he didn’t want to frighten her—not yet. Not until he knew what he was dealing with. He grabbed the prybar and wedged it beneath the edge.

The hatch shrieked as it opened. Not the sound of wood, but of metal long rusted. Below, darkness. A pit. The smell surged up to greet him, and this time he gagged.

Still, he dropped the flashlight in.

It landed softly, beam flickering, illuminating walls covered in carved sigils, and on the floor—bones.

Dozens of them.

Some human.

Some too small to be.

One of them wore a child’s shoe.

Jacob staggered back. He sat down hard, hands trembling. His brain struggled to process what he’d seen.

Then the flashlight winked out.

And something down there moved.

He slammed the hatch shut and backed away. The soil folded itself over the opening like a tongue hiding a secret. By the time he reached the patio, there was nothing to show for his digging but a patch of disturbed grass.

That night, Mara found him sitting at the dining table in the dark.

“You’re pale,” she said. “What did you find?”

He looked up at her. “She’s buried something in the yard. Something old.”

“Ella’s not eating,” Mara said. “She says food tastes like dust.”

“We need help.”

Mara nodded slowly. “But who do we call? The police? The church?”

He didn’t answer.

Later that evening, Jacob drove to the edge of town, to the only place he could think of.

Saint Ignatius Parish stood alone beside a dry creek bed, its paint faded and its steeple half-collapsed from last year’s lightning storm. Inside, Father Dorian still held Mass, though his congregation had dwindled to a half-dozen elderly women who never made eye contact.

Father Dorian listened to Jacob’s story without blinking. He poured two fingers of communion wine into a tin cup and handed it over.

“Do not cross into her house again,” he said. “Do not dig.”

“I already have.”

The priest nodded slowly. “Then you’ve invited her.”

“I didn’t mean to—”

“Intent is irrelevant. Her soil remembers. She’s older than the trees, older than the stones. Your daughter… she’s been marked.”

Jacob’s hands shook. “Is there a way to undo it?”

Father Dorian looked away. “Not without cost.”

When Jacob returned home, Ella was awake again. She sat in the center of the living room, surrounded by candles, none of which they owned. Mara was beside her, gently humming a lullaby Jacob didn’t recognize.

“She says the roots have reached the floorboards,” Mara said, not looking up.

Ella rocked slowly. “They’re growing through my dreams.”

Jacob turned to the window. Beyond the glass, the tree at number 40 swayed without wind. One of its branches had extended unnaturally far, tapping lightly against the siding of their house.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

He closed the curtain.

The next morning, the basement was filled with water. But there had been no rain.

And in the water, floating like a lily pad, was another coin. This one was warm to the touch. And it bore Ella’s initials.

Chapter Three: Roots in the Walls

The days that followed blurred into one long gray stretch. The sky didn’t change. The weather app claimed sun, but the clouds never parted. It was as if time inched forward grudgingly, dragging its feet through some invisible sludge that blanketed Maple Lane. Jacob stopped checking the calendar. Mara took down all the clocks. Ella, now mostly silent, drew symbols in the fogged windows and refused to explain what they meant. Her drawings were circular, coiled shapes that looped inward with jagged hooks on the ends, never the same twice, but somehow related. Like a language she had remembered in a dream.

Downstairs, the basement flooded again—clear water this time, but the walls wept with something darker. Jacob installed a sump pump and ran it constantly. Still, each morning he would find fresh puddles gathered near the corners, and once, a row of muddy footprints that stopped in front of the circuit panel and vanished.

He began to keep a hammer beside the bed. Not a gun. Not a knife. A hammer.

“You’re not sleeping,” Mara said one morning as he stared into his untouched cereal.

“You’re not eating,” he answered.

They didn’t speak for several minutes. It wasn’t silence borne of coldness; it was a silence they wore now, like clothing. Their voices felt like old possessions they no longer needed to use.

Jacob tried once more to contact someone—anyone outside the closed loop of Maple Lane. He emailed an old friend from college, a man now living in another state, far from the growing dread. He wrote the truth—or what he could of it—hoping it would look less insane in writing. He never received a response. Three days later, his laptop refused to boot, and when he took it to a repair shop in town, the technician plugged it in, frowned, and told Jacob it was blank. No files. Not even an operating system. Just darkness.

That same evening, someone knocked on the door.

Not the front door. The back.

Jacob froze.

So did Mara.

They stared at one another, neither moving, until the knock came again.

Soft.

Measured.

Jacob stood. He picked up the hammer.

He walked to the sliding glass door that looked out on the backyard, drew back the curtain.

No one.

But on the patio, scrawled in what looked like flour—or salt—was a message: BRING HER BACK.

The next morning, the mirror in their bathroom was covered in condensation, though no one had used the shower. Through the foggy sheen, a single handprint appeared slowly as Jacob watched. He didn’t clean it. He just closed the door and walked away.

Across the street, the Hinshaws had boarded their windows. Mr. Hinshaw now roamed the neighborhood at all hours, flashlight taped to a rifle, eyes bloodshot. He had once been the kind of man who invited everyone over for barbecues and ran for HOA president twice. Now he muttered to himself and glared at everyone as if the entire block had turned against him.

One night, Jacob watched him from the upstairs bedroom window.

Mr. Hinshaw stopped in front of number 40.

He aimed the flashlight at the house, standing in the middle of the street. Then he raised his rifle.

“No,” Jacob whispered.

The rifle cracked once.

Twice.

The first shot hit the siding. The second struck a window. Glass shattered.

The house didn’t react.

Mr. Hinshaw stood still, breathing hard.

Then he screamed.

Jacob could only describe it later as the sound of something being pulled out of a man by the roots. Mr. Hinshaw dropped the flashlight. His rifle fell. He clutched at his stomach, then his chest, then his eyes.

Something black trickled from his nose.

He collapsed in the road.

By the time Jacob got there, Hinshaw was still breathing—but barely. His hands clutched at the asphalt like he was trying to dig his way down through it.

“I saw her,” he rasped. “Inside the glass. Not her. Not the woman. The real one. The one behind.”

The ambulance came, but it wasn’t from town. No one recognized the EMTs. Their faces were pale and flat, like they hadn’t used their muscles in years. They took Mr. Hinshaw away and didn’t ask questions. They didn’t even turn on their sirens.

After that, no one talked about what happened.

The broken window at number 40 was repaired by morning.

No sound of construction. No ladder. No tools.

It was just whole again.

Ella began speaking to someone who wasn’t there. At first, it was soft enough that Jacob thought she was talking to herself. But the conversations grew longer. Her tone shifted depending on who she was addressing. Sometimes she was calm, even laughing. Other times she cried, argued, screamed in a voice not quite her own.

Mara began recording again, but the tapes—yes, she bought an old cassette recorder, afraid digital files would vanish like Jacob’s emails—came out blank.

Static. Every time.

One afternoon, Ella emerged from her room and handed Jacob a piece of paper.

It was a map.

Their house, the yard, the treehouse—all rendered in excruciating detail with red pencil lines tracing paths that led from room to room. There were symbols etched at various points: beneath the kitchen sink, behind the bookcase in the den, inside the crawlspace under the stairs.

“What is this?” Jacob asked.

“It’s where the roots are,” Ella said, eyes unblinking.

“They’re spreading.”

That night, Jacob and Mara pried up a floorboard beneath the sink.

They found a knot of what looked like fibers—too pale to be roots, too damp to be cords. They pulsed. Just slightly.

Jacob burned them with a lighter. The flame caught and hissed. Something in the walls thudded once, loud enough to rattle the dishes.

Ella screamed from upstairs.

By the time they reached her room, she was on the ceiling.

Not standing. Hanging.

Her feet hooked over the molding, back arched at an impossible angle, hands stretched downward toward them.

Her mouth was open, eyes rolled back.

Mara wept. Jacob moved without thinking. He climbed the dresser, pulled her down. The moment her feet touched the floor, she collapsed.

Later, she remembered none of it.

Jacob started staying awake. All night. Every night.

He sat in the hallway between their bedroom and Ella’s. He held the hammer and watched the walls breathe.

He saw the wallpaper bubble.

He heard whispers in the vents.

And once, when he closed his eyes for less than a minute, he opened them to find the hallway filled with fog and footprints leading to the attic.

He followed them.

In the attic, he found another coin.

This one was different—rectangular, made of something that looked like obsidian. No symbols, no words.

Just a single groove down the middle.

He left it there.

The next day, Ella didn’t speak.

Not a word.

She wrote a single sentence in her notebook and handed it to Mara at breakfast.

“She knows Daddy went into the ground.”

Jacob didn’t deny it.

He didn’t try.

The silence inside the house began to feel like another resident, one that listened and waited and judged. Jacob no longer tried to pretend things might return to normal. The basement now breathed. The corners of rooms twitched when no one looked directly at them. Objects shifted during the night—small things, at first: a shoe moved across the hallway, a drawer left ajar. But then larger signs appeared. A hairline crack crept across the living room ceiling, veining outward like lightning, and in the dead of night, it bled.

Jacob awoke to find a thin line of rust-colored fluid on the floor, trailing all the way from the crack to the hallway, where it vanished beneath Ella’s bedroom door. He followed it with numb steps, not knowing what he would do when he reached her, but when he opened the door, Ella was asleep. Peaceful. As if none of it had happened. Her hands were folded over her stomach and her mouth moved slightly, as if repeating a lullaby. On the wall above her bed, her drawings had changed again. No longer just symbols. Now, there were portraits.

Jacob recognized none of the faces, yet all of them felt familiar. Gaunt, hollow-eyed people with mouths stitched shut or open too wide. In the center of them all was the tree—the same crooked, unwholesome thing from the backyard. Its roots stretched through the bottom of the drawing like veins feeding into every face around it. And in one root, half hidden, Jacob saw his own profile. Or something that resembled it. Thinner. With deep-set eyes and a crooked mouth.

He stumbled back from the image and left the room without waking her.

Mara was in the kitchen, her eyes red from crying, her hands wrapped around a cup of black coffee that had long gone cold. She didn’t look up when he entered, but she spoke as though she’d been waiting for him.

“We need to leave,” she said. “We need to go now.”

Jacob nodded slowly, unsure of what he was agreeing to. “Where?”

“Anywhere,” she said. “We pack a bag, grab Ella, and we don’t stop driving until we can’t see this place in the rearview mirror.”

“What if it follows us?”

She shook her head. “No. It’s tied to this house. To the land. That’s what she wants.”

Jacob rubbed his temples. “And what does she want, exactly?”

Mara looked at him then, and her expression held a pain deeper than fear. “She wants us to plant her again.”

That stopped him. He sat down across from her, slowly, as if the motion itself might shatter what little control they still held. “What does that mean?”

“I’ve been reading,” she said. “I found something. Old folklore. Russian. Baltic. There are stories of a woman buried beneath trees. Not a witch. Not a ghost. Something older. They plant her to keep the ground safe, to keep the house from rotting. But if she’s disturbed…”

Jacob finished her sentence: “The house dies.”

“Everything dies,” she corrected.

They packed that afternoon. Clothes. Food. Ella’s favorite books. They left the TV on for noise and avoided looking at the basement door, which had begun to pulse softly at its frame. As if something behind it was breathing.

Jacob made sure to leave a note on the kitchen table: We’re sorry. We didn’t know. He didn’t know who it was for, but he felt compelled to write it.

They left as the sun began to fall behind the trees. Mara drove. Jacob held Ella’s hand in the back seat. She didn’t speak. She hadn’t spoken all day. Her lips were slightly parted and her eyes didn’t blink as much as they should have. When they reached the edge of town, a thick fog rolled across the road. It wasn’t like any fog Jacob had seen before—it shimmered faintly, as though laced with threads of gold and blue.

The car slowed.

Mara pressed the gas. Nothing.

The fog thickened.

Then the road looped.

They drove for twenty minutes and passed the same gas station three times.

Mara slammed her hand against the wheel. “No. No, no, no.”

Jacob leaned forward. “Turn around.”

They did.

But the fog was there, too. Behind them now. Wrapping around the trees like vines, draping from the power lines like cobwebs.

“Is it following us?” Mara whispered.

Jacob didn’t answer. He watched Ella instead.

She had turned her head toward the window and was smiling. Faint. Dreamlike.

“She says we can’t leave,” Ella murmured.

“Who?” Jacob asked, though he already knew.

Ella blinked slowly, and when she turned to look at him, her eyes were different. The blue was deeper now. Almost black at the edges.

“She doesn’t have a name,” she said. “Names are for people.”

Mara turned the car around again and drove toward home.

By the time they reached Maple Lane, the fog had dissipated. The street looked as it always had—neatly manicured lawns, trimmed hedges, porch lights flickering to life as the last of the daylight slipped away. But something had changed.

Every house on the street had their doors shut, their blinds drawn, their cars parked crookedly in driveways. The normal rhythms were broken. The Thompsons were not the only ones trapped.

Back inside, the house felt colder. Older.

The walls seemed to have shifted slightly. The hallway was narrower. The ceilings lower. The house was shrinking, drawing inward around the family like a closing fist.

Mara turned off all the lights. “She doesn’t like it when it’s too bright.”

Jacob sat in the kitchen with a flashlight and stared at the floorboards. He could hear something moving beneath them again. Not digging. Not scratching. Crawling.

Ella stood in the doorway and said, “She’s in the roots now. She’s waking up.”

The next morning, Jacob found a package on the porch.

Wrapped in burlap. Bound in old rope. No address.

Inside was a wooden box filled with dirt.

And in the dirt, a tooth.

Too large to be human.

And beneath it, a seed.

Still wet with something dark.

He buried it in the backyard.

He didn’t tell Mara.

Chapter Four: The Night Orchard

The seed took root almost instantly.

Jacob planted it beneath the apple tree, in the same patch of disturbed soil where he had unearthed the hatch. He used his bare hands, fingers stiff with the cold, though the day itself was warm. As soon as he covered the hole, the wind stopped. The birds that had been chirping from somewhere unseen fell silent. The air grew heavier. The branches above him stilled, then creaked in protest, shifting as though the tree had awakened from a long and bitter sleep.

He stood and wiped his hands on his jeans, but the dirt didn’t come off. It had a cling to it, like ash or dried blood. He heard the back door open behind him.

Mara’s voice was sharp and frayed. “What did you do?”

He didn’t turn to face her. “I think I gave her what she wanted.”

Mara stepped into the yard barefoot, her arms crossed tightly against her chest. “You don’t know that.”

“No,” he admitted. “But we couldn’t run. We tried. We’re bound to her now. Maybe we always were.”

She looked toward the house next door. Its windows remained empty, glass reflecting only that gray-green tint of old water. “She’s still watching us.”

“I know.”

They stood there, silent as the air around them seemed to thicken. Beneath the soil, something twitched—Jacob felt it under his feet, a subtle shiver, a pulse. He stepped back.

That night, the orchard grew.

It was Ella who saw it first. She had woken from a deep sleep and walked downstairs without saying a word, drawing the curtains aside in the living room. The backyard had changed.

One tree had become three.

Three became six.

By the time Jacob and Mara joined her at the window, a forest had taken root where once there had been grass. Trees with pale trunks and twisting limbs stood packed tightly together, their leaves darker than anything natural, glistening with a wet sheen. They swayed in the still air as if dancing to some rhythm that hadn’t yet begun. No roots had been visible above ground. It was as if they had simply risen in full, not grown but arrived.

Jacob opened the door and took a step outside.

He didn’t recognize the yard anymore. It no longer sloped gently toward the fence. The land was flatter, broader, stretching deeper into a space that shouldn’t exist. The fence itself was gone. The neighbor’s house—number 40—had vanished entirely. All that remained was the orchard.

The smell was sweet, like rotting fruit.

“I don’t want to go out there,” Mara said behind him.

“We might not have a choice,” Jacob said.

That night, the house shrank again. It was gradual, but noticeable. The hallway from their bedroom to Ella’s room was half the length it once had been. The kitchen table was now pressed against the wall. The doors scraped the floorboards when they opened. The walls pulsed slightly, as if reacting to breath.

The next morning, the orchard had grown to the edge of the porch.

Ella stood at the threshold, watching the trees without blinking.

“She’s walking through the trees now,” she said. “Looking for the one that knows her name.”

“What does that mean?” Jacob asked, kneeling beside her.

“She had a name once,” Ella said. “But it was buried with her body. That’s why she’s angry.”

Mara knelt on the other side, placing a hand on Ella’s shoulder. “Who told you this?”

“I just know. I hear it in the floor.”

That evening, Jacob found a door in the pantry.

Not a door that had been there before.

It was narrow, crooked, built into the plaster as though someone had tried to hide it. When he opened it, he found a stairwell that descended into the dark, far deeper than the basement. The air that poured up from it was wet and sharp with decay. There was no light switch. Just a single candle placed in a wrought-iron holder affixed to the wall.

He closed it. He didn’t tell Mara.

Not that night.

Instead, he wandered outside, into the orchard.

The trees groaned as he passed between them. The deeper he went, the colder it became, until his breath rose in front of him like steam. The moon was high, yet no light filtered through the canopy. The branches wove together like a net.

Then he saw the figure.

It wasn’t Kalinina.

It was something taller. A silhouette that shimmered faintly. She—or it—stood between two trees, her face hidden by strands of hair that moved independently of the wind. Her arms were long, her skin paper-thin, etched with glyphs. She raised a hand and pointed.

Jacob turned.

Behind him, another tree stood—thicker than the others, its bark pulsing faintly, a low red glow seeping from a crack that ran down its trunk. A name was carved there, crudely.

MARA.

He ran.

Branches clawed at his arms. The orchard moaned around him. Roots erupted beneath his feet. He fell twice before the porch came into view, and when he finally reached the door, it slammed shut on its own.

Inside, the house was colder than before. The lights flickered, then died.

Mara met him in the hall. “You saw her.”

Jacob nodded.

“She’s naming the trees,” Mara whispered. “One by one.”

That night, Ella began coughing in her sleep. It wasn’t a normal cough. Each sound felt too heavy, like it carried weight. When Jacob entered her room, he found blood on the pillow. She opened her mouth to speak, and a sliver of wood dropped from between her lips.

They took her to the emergency room.

Doctors found nothing.

By the time they returned, the orchard had reached the front lawn.

The neighbors didn’t answer their doors. Not that Jacob expected them to. Most of them had stopped being visible. Lights were on, but the windows held nothing but curtains. At least one house had begun to look abandoned altogether. The lawn overgrown, a car unmoved, mail overflowing from the box. No one on Maple Lane said anything. The street was full of shadows now.

Back inside, the house had changed again.

The pantry door was gone. In its place was a wall. Smooth. Seamless.

But the sound remained.

That same dragging sound—something large moving beneath the floor. Jacob placed his ear to the tile and heard breathing again. Slower. Heavier. Like lungs filled with dirt.

Later that night, Ella drew a new picture.

The tree at the center. Dozens of figures hanging from its branches.

And above it, the house. Their house. With roots growing from the foundation into the earth.

Written beneath the drawing, in her blocky handwriting, were four words:

“We live in her.”

In the days that followed, sleep became impossible. Jacob tried to keep track of time by marking the walls, but the pencil lines faded within hours, smudged out by something unseen. The clocks stopped working altogether. They ticked erratically, hands spinning backwards for minutes before freezing mid-motion. Sometimes, in the silence, the family would hear a soft bell chime from somewhere deep within th
