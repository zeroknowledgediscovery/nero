There is a door to inner room on the left, and a door to open air on the right. Window at back and a frame with a half-finished piece of tapestry. There are also a large press and heavy oak chest near the back wall. The place is neat and clean but bare. Lavarcham, woman of fifty, is working at tapestry frame. Old Woman comes in from left._  OLD WOMAN. She hasn’t come yet, is it, and it falling to the night?  LAVARCHAM. She has not. . . (_Concealing her anxiety._) It’s dark with the clouds are coming from the west and south, but it isn’t later than the common.  OLD WOMAN. It’s later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  LAVARCHAM. — _more anxiously._ — The gods send they don’t set eyes on her — (_with a sign of helplessness_) yet if they do itself, it wasn’t my wish brought them or could send them away.  OLD WOMAN. — _reprovingly._ — If it wasn’t, you’d do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  LAVARCHAM. Who’d check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you’d see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  OLD WOMAN. The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn’t she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don’t know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roasting her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  [_She looks out._  LAVARCHAM. Is she coming from the glen?  OLD WOMAN. She is not. But whisht — there’s two men leaving the furze — (_crying out_) it’s Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor’ll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  LAVARCHAM. — _settling room hastily._ — Are they close by?  OLD WOMAN. Crossing the stream, and there’s herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they’ll set eyes on her at all?  LAVARCHAM. You will not. Would you have him see you, and he a man would be jealous of a hawk would fly between her and the rising sun. (_She looks out._) Go up to the hearth and be as busy as if you hadn’t seen them at all.  OLD WOMAN. — _sitting down to polish vessel._ — There’ll be trouble this night, for he should be in his tempers from the way he’s stepping out, and he swinging his hands.  LAVARCHAM. — _wearied with the whole matter._ — It’d be best of all, maybe, if he got in tempers with herself, and made an end quickly, for I’m in a poor way between the pair of them (_going back to tapestry frame._) There they are now at the door.  [_Conchubor and Fergus come in._  CONCHUBOR AND FERGUS. The gods save you.  LAVARCHAM. — _getting up and courtesying._ — The gods save and keep you kindly, and stand between you and all harm for ever.  CONCHUBOR. — _looking around._ — Where is Deirdre?  LAVARCHAM. — _trying to speak with indifference._ — Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she’s gathering new life I’ve a right not to heed her, I’m thinking, and she taking her will.  [_Fergus talks to Old Woman._  CONCHUBOR. — _stiffly._ — A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  LAVARCHAM. — _more uneasily._ — She’s used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn’t let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  FERGUS. — _cheerfully._ — She’s right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, (_he takes a wallet from under his cloak_) and I’ll count out what we’ve brought, and put it in the presses within.  [_He goes into the inner room with the Old Woman._  CONCHUBOR. — _sitting down and looking about._ — Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  LAVARCHAM. The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn’t wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain. The silver skillets and the golden cups we have beyond locked in the chest.  CONCHUBOR. Bring them out and use them from this day.  LAVARCHAM. We’ll do it, Conchubor.  CONCHUBOR. — _getting up and going to frame._ — Is this hers?  LAVARCHAM. — _pleased to speak of it._ — It is, Conchubor. All say there isn’t her match at fancying figures and throwing purple upon crimson, and she edging them all times with her greens and gold.  CONCHUBOR. — _a little uneasily._ — Is she keeping wise and busy since I passed before, and growing ready for her life in Emain?  LAVARCHAM. — _dryly._ — That is a question will give small pleasure to yourself or me. (_Making up her mind to speak out._) If it’s the truth I’ll tell you, she’s growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you’ll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it’s wilfuller she’s growing these two months or three.  CONCHUBOR. — _severely, but relieved things are no worse._ — Isn’t it a poor thing you’re doing so little to school her to meet what is to come?  LAVARCHAM. I’m after serving you two score of years, and I’ll tell you this night, Conchubor, she’s little call to mind an old woman when she has the birds to school her, and the pools in the rivers where she goes bathing in the sun. I’ll tell you if you seen her that time, with her white skin, and her red lips, and the blue water and the ferns about her, you’d know, maybe, and you greedy itself, it wasn’t for your like she was born at all.  CONCHUBOR. It’s little I heed for what she was born; she’ll be my comrade, surely.  [_He examines her workbox._  LAVARCHAM. — _sinking into sadness again._ — I’m in dread so they were right saying she’d bring destruction on the world, for it’s a poor thing when you see a settled man putting the love he has for a young child, and the love he has for a full woman, on a girl the like of her; and it’s a poor thing, Conchubor, to see a High King, the way you are this day, prying after her needles and numbering her lines of thread.  CONCHUBOR. — _getting up._ — Let you not be talking too far and you old itself. (_Walks across room and back._) Does she know the troubles are foretold?  LAVARCHAM. — _in the tone of the earlier talk._ — I’m after telling her one time and another, but I’d do as well speaking to a lamb of ten weeks and it racing the hills. . . . It’s not the dread of death or troubles that would tame her like.  CONCHUBOR. — _he looks out._ — She’s coming now, and let you walk in and keep Fergus till I speak with her a while.  LAVARCHAM. — _going left._ — If I’m after vexing you itself, it’d be best you weren’t taking her hasty or scolding her at all.  CONCHUBOR. — _very stiffly._ — I’ve no call to. I’m well pleased she’s light and airy.  LAVARCHAM. — _offended at his tone._ — Well pleased is it? (_With a snort of irony_) It’s a queer thing the way the likes of me do be telling the truth, and the wise are lying all times.  [_She goes into room on left. Conchubor arranges himself before a mirror for a moment, then goes a little to the left and waits. Deirdre comes in poorly dressed, with a little bag and a bundle of twigs in her arms. She is astonished for a moment when she sees Conchubor; then she makes a courtesy to him, and goes to the hearth without any embarrassment._  CONCHUBOR. The gods save you, Deirdre. I have come up bringing you rings and jewels from Emain Macha.  DEIRDRE. The gods save you.  CONCHUBOR. What have you brought from the hills?  DEIRDRE. — _quite self-possessed._ — A bag of nuts, and twigs for our fires at the dawn of day.  CONCHUBOR. — _showing annoyance in spite of himself._ — And it’s that way you’re picking up the manners will fit you to be Queen of Ulster?  DEIRDRE. — _made a little defiant by his tone._ — I have no wish to be a queen.  CONCHUBOR. — _almost sneeringly._ — You’d wish to be dressing in your duns and grey, and you herding your geese or driving your calves to their shed — like the common lot scattered in the glens.  DEIRDRE. — _very defiant._ — I would not, Conchubor. (_She goes to tapestry and begins to work._) A girl born the way I’m born is more likely to wish for a mate who’d be her likeness. . . . A man with his hair like the raven, maybe, and his skin like the snow and his lips like blood spilt on it.  CONCHUBOR. — _sees his mistake, and after a moment takes a flattering tone, looking at her work._ — Whatever you wish, there’s no queen but would be well pleased to have your skill at choosing colours and making pictures on the cloth. (_Looking closely._) What is it you’re figuring?  DEIRDRE. — _deliberately._ — Three young men and they chasing in the green gap of a wood.  CONCHUBOR. — _now almost pleading._ — It’s soon you’ll have dogs with silver chains to be chasing in the woods of Emain, for I have white hounds rearing up for you, and grey horses, that I’ve chosen from the finest in Ulster and Britain and Gaul.  DEIRDRE. — _unmoved as before._ — I’ve heard tell, in Ulster and Britain and Gaul, Naisi and his brothers have no match and they chasing in the woods.  CONCHUBOR. — _very gravely._ — Isn’t it a strange thing you’d be talking of Naisi and his brothers, or figuring them either, when you know the things that are foretold about themselves and you? Yet you’ve little knowledge, and I’d do wrong taking it bad when it’ll be my share from this out to keep you the way you’ll have little call to trouble for knowledge, or its want either.  DEIRDRE. Yourself should be wise, surely.  CONCHUBOR. The like of me has a store of knowledge that’s a weight and terror. It’s for that we do choose out the like of yourself that are young and glad only. . . . I’m thinking you are gay and lively each day in the year?  DEIRDRE. I don’t know if that’s true, Conchubor. There are lonesome days and bad nights in this place like another.  CONCHUBOR. You should have as few sad days, I’m thinking, as I have glad and good ones.  DEIRDRE. What is it has you that way ever coming this place, when you’d hear the old woman saying a good child’s as happy as a king?  CONCHUBOR. How would I be happy seeing age coming on me each year, when the dry leaves are blowing back and forward at the gate of Emain? And yet this last while I’m saying out, when I see the furze breaking and the daws sitting two and two on ash-trees by the duns of Emain, Deirdre’s a year nearer her full age when she’ll be my mate and comrade and then I’m glad surely.  DEIRDRE. — _almost to herself._ — I will not be your mate in Emain.  CONCHUBOR. — _not heeding her._ — It’s there you’ll be proud and happy and you’ll learn that, if young men are great hunters, yet it’s with the like of myself you’ll find a knowledge of what is priceless in your own like. What we all need is a place is safe and splendid, and it’s that you’ll get in Emain in two days or three.  DEIRDRE. — _aghast._ — Two days!  CONCHUBOR. I have the rooms ready, and in a little while you’ll be brought down there, to be my queen and queen of the five parts of Ireland.  DEIRDRE. — _standing up frightened and pleading._ — I’d liefer stay this place, Conchubor. . . . Leave me this place, where I’m well used to the tracks and pathways and the people of the glens. . . . It’s for this life I’m born, surely.  CONCHUBOR. You’ll be happier and greater with myself in Emain. It is I will be your comrade, and will stand between you and the great troubles are foretold.  DEIRDRE. I will not be your queen in Emain when it’s my pleasure to be having my freedom on the edges of the hills.  CONCHUBOR. It’s my wish to have you quickly; I’m sick and weary thinking of the day you’ll be brought down to me, and seeing you walking into my big, empty halls. I’ve made all sure to have you, and yet all said there’s a fear in the back of my mind I’d miss you and have great troubles in the end. It’s for that, Deirdre, I’m praying that you’ll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you’ll not find, with any other, the like of what I’m bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  DEIRDRE. I cannot go, Conchubor.  CONCHUBOR. — _taking a triumphant tone._ — It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn’t you liefer be my comrade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  DEIRDRE. You don’t know me and you’d have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I’m a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I’m too long taking my will, and it’s that way I’ll be living always.  CONCHUBOR. — _dryly._ — Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  DEIRDRE. — _now pleadingly._ — Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn’t it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn’t much I’m asking.  CONCHUBOR. It’s much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I’m a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I’m the King of Ulster. (_He gets up._) I’ll call Fergus, and we’ll make Emain ready in the morning.  [_He goes towards door on left._  DEIRDRE. — _clinging to him._ — Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It’s one year I’m asking only.  CONCHUBOR. You’d be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. (_Calling._) Fergus! Fergus! (_To Deirdre._) Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. (_Calling._) Fergus!  [_Deirdre springs away from him as Fergus comes in with Lavarcham and the Old Woman._  CONCHUBOR. — _to Fergus._ — There is a storm coming, and we’d best be going to our people when the night is young.  FERGUS. — _cheerfully._ — The gods shield you, Deirdre. (_To Conchubor._) We’re late already, and it’s no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly pathways when the floods are rising with the rain.  [_He helps Conchubor into his cloak._  CONCHUBOR. — _glad that he has made his decision — to Lavarcham._ — Keep your rules a few days longer, and you’ll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  LAVARCHAM. — _obediently._ — Your rules are kept always.  CONCHUBOR. The gods shield you.  [_He goes out with Fergus. Old Woman bolts door._  LAVARCHAM. — _looking at Deirdre, who has covered her face._ — Wasn’t I saying you’d do it? You’ve brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  DEIRDRE. — _with agitation._ — It wasn’t I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  LAVARCHAM. He’d have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you’d be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  DEIRDRE. — _terrified with the reality that is before her._ — Are there none can go against Conchubor?  LAVARCHAM. Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  DEIRDRE. Would Fergus go against him?  LAVARCHAM. He would, maybe, and his temper roused.  DEIRDRE. — _in a lower voice with sudden excitement._ — Would Naisi and his brothers?  LAVARCHAM. — _impatiently._ — Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it’s folly that we’re talking, for if any went against Conchubor it’s sorrow he’d earn and the shortening of his day of life.  [_She turns away, and Deirdre stands up stiff with excitement and goes and looks out of the window._  DEIRDRE. Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  LAVARCHAM. — _looking at her curiously._ — The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I’m thinking, we’ve seen these years gone by.  DEIRDRE. — _tearing open the press and pulling out clothes and tapestries._ — Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  LAVARCHAM. What ails you?  DEIRDRE. — _gathering up a dress._ — Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we’ve no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I’m going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  LAVARCHAM. Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  DEIRDRE. — _gathering her things together with an outburst of excitement._ — I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor’ll make me a queen, I’ll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I’ll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.  [_She goes into room. Lavarcham and Old Woman look at each other, then the Old Woman goes over, looks in at Deirdre through chink of the door, and then closes it carefully._  OLD WOMAN. — _in a frightened whisper._ — She’s thrown off the rags she had about her, and there she is in her skin; she’s putting her hair in shiny twists. Is she raving, Lavarcham, or has she a good right turning to a queen like Maeve?  LAVARCHAM. — _putting up hanging very anxiously._ — It’s more than raving’s in her mind, or I’m the more astray; and yet she’s as good a right as another, maybe, having her pleasure, though she’d spoil the world.  OLD WOMAN. — _helping her._ — Be quick before she’ll come back. . . . Who’d have thought we’d run before her, and she so quiet till tonight. Will the High King get the better of her, Lavarcham? If I was Conchubor, I wouldn’t marry with her like at all.  LAVARCHAM. Hang that by the window. That should please her, surely. When all’s said, it’s her like will be the master till the end of time.  OLD WOMAN. — _at the window._ — There’s a mountain of blackness in the sky, and the greatest rain falling has been these long years on the earth. The gods help Conchubor. He’ll be a sorry man this night, reaching his dun, and he with all his spirits, thinking to himself he’ll be putting his arms around her in two days or three.  LAVARCHAM. It’s more than Conchubor’ll be sick and sorry, I’m thinking, before this story is told to the end.  [_Loud knocking on door at the right._  LAVARCHAM. — _startled._ — Who is that?  NAISI. — _outside._ — Naisi and his brothers.  LAVARCHAM. We are lonely women. What is it you’re wanting in the blackness of the night?  NAISI. We met a young girl in the woods who told us we might shelter this place if the rivers rose on the pathways and the floods gathered from the butt of the hills.  [_Old Woman clasps her hands in horror._  LAVARCHAM. — _with great alarm._ — You cannot come in. . . . There is no one let in here, and no young girl with us.  NAISI. Let us in from the great storm. Let us in and we will go further when the cloud will rise.  LAVARCHAM. Go round east to the shed and you’ll have shelter. You cannot come in.  NAISI. — _knocking loudly._ — Open the door or we will burst it. (_The door is shaken._)  OLD WOMAN. — _in a timid whisper._ — Let them in, and keep Deirdre in her room tonight.  AINNLE AND ARDAN. — _outside._ — Open! Open!  LAVARCHAM. — _to Old Woman._ — Go in and keep her.  OLD WOMAN. I couldn’t keep her. I’ve no hold on her. Go in yourself and I will free the door.  LAVARCHAM. I must stay and turn them out. (_She pulls her hair and cloak over her face._) Go in and keep her.  OLD WOMAN. The gods help us.  [_She runs into the inner room._  VOICES. Open!  LAVARCHAM. — _opening the door._ — Come in then and ill-luck if you’ll have it so.  [_Naisi and Ainnle and Ardan come in and look round with astonishment._  NAISI. It’s a rich man has this place, and no herd at all.  LAVARCHAM. — _sitting down with her head half covered._ — It is not, and you’d best be going quickly.  NAISI. — _hilariously, shaking rain from his clothes._ — When we’ve had the pick of luck finding princely comfort in the darkness of the night! Some rich man of Ulster should come here and he chasing in the woods. May we drink? (_He takes up flask._) Whose wine is this that we may drink his health?  LAVARCHAM. It’s no one’s that you’ve call to know.  NAISI. Your own health then and length of life. (_Pouring out wine for the three. They drink._)  LAVARCHAM. — _very crossly._ — You’re great boys taking a welcome where it isn’t given, and asking questions where you’ve no call to. . . . If you’d a quiet place settled up to be playing yourself, maybe, with a gentle queen, what’d you think of young men prying around and carrying tales? When I was a bit of a girl the big men of Ulster had better manners, and they the like of your three selves, in the top folly of youth. That’ll be a story to tell out in Tara that Naisi is a tippler and stealer, and Ainnle the drawer of a stranger’s cork.  NAISI. — _quite cheerfully, sitting down beside her._ — At your age you should know there are nights when a king like Conchubor will spit upon his arm ring, and queens will stick their tongues out at the rising moon. We’re that way this night, and it’s not wine we’re asking only. Where is the young girl told us we might shelter here?  LAVARCHAM. Asking me you’d be? We’re decent people, and I wouldn’t put you tracking a young girl, not if you gave me the gold clasp you have hanging on your coat.  NAISI. — _giving it to her._ — Where is she?  LAVARCHAM. — _in confidential whisper, putting her hand on his arm._ — Let you walk back into the hills and turn up by the second cnuceen where there are three together. You’ll see a path running on the rocks and then you’ll hear the dogs barking in the houses, and their noise will guide you till you come to a bit of cabin at the foot of an ash-tree. It’s there there is a young and flighty girl that I’m thinking is the one you’ve seen.  NAISI. — _hilariously._ — Here’s health, then, to herself and you!  ARDAN. Here’s to the years when you were young as she!  AINNLE. — _in a frightened whisper._ — Naisi!  [_Naisi looks up and Ainnle beckons to him. He goes over and Ainnle points to something on the golden mug he holds in his hand._  NAISI. — _looking at it in astonishment._ — This is the High King’s. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  LAVARCHAM. — _jumping up with extreme annoyance._ — Who says it’s Conchubor’s? How dare young fools the like of you — (_speaking with vehement insolence_) come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? (_Very bitterly._) Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  NAISI. — _very soberly._ — Is the rain easing?  ARDAN. The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  NAISI. — _still cheerfully._ — Open the door and we’ll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  [_Deirdre comes in on left royally dressed and very beautiful. She stands for a moment, and then as the door opens she calls softly._  DEIRDRE. Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  NAISI. — _transfixed with amazement._ — And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  DEIRDRE. It is with me you’ve spoken, surely. (_To Lavarcham and Old Woman._) Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many things for Naisi only.  LAVARCHAM. — _overawed by her tone._ — I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  DEIRDRE. — _to Ainnle and Ardan._ — Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  AINNLE. We’ll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we’ll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  [_They all go out except Deirdre and Naisi._  DEIRDRE. — _sitting in the high chair in the centre._ — Come to this stool, Naisi (_pointing to the stool_). If it’s low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  NAISI. — _sitting down._ — You are Fedlimid’s daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  DEIRDRE. Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  NAISI. It’s a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  DEIRDRE. It isn’t many I’d call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.  NAISI. It’s for that you called us in the dusk?  DEIRDRE. — _in a low voice._ — Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  NAISI. — _pulling himself together and beginning to draw back a little._ — Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  DEIRDRE. — _softly._ — This night I have the best company in the whole world.  NAISI. — _still a little formally._ — It is I who have the best company, for when you’re queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  DEIRDRE. I will not be queen in Emain.  NAISI. Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  DEIRDRE. It’s for that maybe I’m called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it’s a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it’s for a short space only.  NAISI. — _very distressed._ — And we’ve a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  DEIRDRE. You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. (_More quickly._) I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn’t we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. (_She stands up and walks away from him._) I’m a long while in the woods with my own self, and I’m in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. (_She comes to him and puts her hands on his shoulders._) Isn’t it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of ourselves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?  NAISI. Yet it’s a poor thing it’s I should bring you to a tale of blood and broken bodies, and the filth of the grave. . . . Wouldn’t we do well to wait, Deirdre, and I each twilight meeting you on the sides of the hills?  DEIRDRE. — _despondently._ — His messengers are coming.  NAISI. Messengers are coming?  DEIRDRE. Tomorrow morning or the next, surely.  NAISI. Then we’ll go away. It isn’t I will give your like to Conchubor, not if the grave was dug to be my lodging when a week was by. (_He looks out._) The stars are out, Deirdre, and let you come with me quickly, for it is the stars will be our lamps many nights and we abroad in Alban, and taking our journeys among the little islands in the sea. There has never been the like of the joy we’ll have, Deirdre, you and I, having our fill of love at the evening and the morning till the sun is high.  DEIRDRE. And yet I’m in dread leaving this place, where I have lived always. Won’t I be lonesome and I thinking on the little hill beyond, and the apple-trees do be budding in the spring-time by the post of the door? (_A little shaken by what has passed._) Won’t I be in great dread to bring you to destruction, Naisi, and you so happy and young?  NAISI. Are you thinking I’d go on living after this night, Deirdre, and you with Conchubor in Emain? Are you thinking I’d go out after hares when I’ve had your lips in my sight?  [_Lavarcham comes in as they cling to each other._  LAVARCHAM. Are you raving, Deirdre? Are you choosing this night to destroy the world?  DEIRDRE. — _very deliberately._ — It’s Conchubor has chosen this night calling me to Emain. (_To Naisi._) Bring in Ainnle and Ardan, and take me from this place, where I’m in dread from this out of the footsteps of a hare passing.  [_He goes._  DEIRDRE. — _clinging to Lavarcham._ — Do not take it bad I’m going, Lavarcham. It’s you have been a good friend and given me great freedom and joy, and I living on Slieve Fuadh; and maybe you’ll be well pleased one day saying you have nursed Deirdre.  LAVARCHAM. — _moved._ — It isn’t I’ll be well pleased and I far away from you. Isn’t it a hard thing you’re doing, but who can help it? Birds go mating in the spring of the year, and ewes at the leaves falling, but a young girl must have her lover in all the courses of the sun and moon.  DEIRDRE. Will you go to Emain in the morning?  LAVARCHAM. I will not. I’ll go to Brandon in the south; and in the course of a piece, maybe, I’ll be sailing back and forward on the seas to be looking on your face and the little ways you have that none can equal.  [_Naisi comes back with Ainnle and Ardan and Old Woman._  DEIRDRE. — _taking Naisi’s hand._ — My two brothers, I am going with Naisi to Alban and the north to face the troubles are foretold. Will you take word to Conchubor in Emain?  AINNLE. We will go with you.  ARDAN. We will be your servants and your huntsmen, Deirdre.  DEIRDRE. It isn’t one brother only of you three is brave and courteous. Will you wed us, Lavarcham? You have the words and customs.  LAVARCHAM. I will not, then. What would I want meddling in the ruin you will earn?  NAISI. Let Ainnle wed us. . . . He has been with wise men and he knows their ways.  AINNLE. — _joining their hands._ — By the sun and moon and the whole earth, I wed Deirdre to Naisi. (_He steps back and holds up his hands._) May the air bless you, and water and the wind, the sea, and all the hours of the sun and moon.   CURTAIN    ACT II.  _Alban. Early morning in the beginning of winter. A wood outside the tent of Deirdre and Naisi. Lavarcham comes in muffled in a cloak._  LAVARCHAM. — _calling._ — Deirdre. . . . Deirdre. . . .  DEIRDRE. — _coming from tent._ — My welcome, Lavarcham. . . . Whose curagh is rowing from Ulster? I saw the oars through the tops of the trees, and I thought it was you were coming towards us.  LAVARCHAM. I came in the shower was before dawn.  DEIRDRE. And who is coming?  LAVARCHAM. — _mournfully._ — Let you not be startled or taking it bad, Deirdre. It’s Fergus bringing messages of peace from Conchubor to take Naisi and his brothers back to Emain.  [_Sitting down._  DEIRDRE. — _lightly._ — Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  LAVARCHAM. Their like would go any place where they’d see death standing. (_With more agitation._) I’m in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that’ll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I’m silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  DEIRDRE. — _more anxiously._ — Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn’t it a hard thing they’ll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  LAVARCHAM. — _impressively._ — It’s a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he’ll not go back to Emain — for good faith or bad faith — the time Conchubor’s keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It’s that would save you, surely.  DEIRDRE. — _without hope._ — There’s little power in oaths to stop what’s coming, and little power in what I’d do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  LAVARCHAM. — _aggressively._ — Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I’m pointing you a way to save Naisi, you’ll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  DEIRDRE. — _a little haughtily._ — Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  LAVARCHAM. — _breaking out in anger._ — Naisi is it? I didn’t care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It’s to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. (_Starting up with temper._) Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.  DEIRDRE. — _sharply._ — Let you end; such talking is a fool’s only, when it’s well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn’t I would live after him. (_With distress._) It’s well you know it’s this day I’m dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; (_with emotion_) or the time I’ve been stretched in the sunshine, when I’ve heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  LAVARCHAM. — _not fully pacified._ — And yet you’ll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  DEIRDRE. I’ve dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It’s lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I’m asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will tomorrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that’s gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you’re dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  LAVARCHAM. If it’s that ails you, I tell you there’s little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. (_Passionately._) There’s little hurt getting old, saving when you’re looking back, the way I’m looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. (_Going to Deirdre._) Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day’ll come you’ll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I’d have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  DEIRDRE. It’s little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I’ll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there’s Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  LAVARCHAM. — _despairingly._ — I’m late so with my warnings, for Fergus’d talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. (_With reproach._) You’ll not stop him this day, and isn’t it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. (_Overcome with trouble; gathering her cloak about her._) Don’t think bad of my crying. I’m not the like of many and I’d see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I’m destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  [_Owen comes in quickly, rather ragged, bows to Deirdre._  OWEN. — _to Lavarcham._ — Fergus’s men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  LAVARCHAM. — _looking at him with dislike._ — Yourself’s an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I’ll go and give my word that’s wanting surely.  [_Goes out._  OWEN. — _to Deirdre._ — So I’ve found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  DEIRDRE. I’ve heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  OWEN. — _who has been searching, finds a loaf and sits down eating greedily, and cutting it with a large knife._ — The full moon, I’m thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool’s wife and he not away in his head?  DEIRDRE. — _absently._ — It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there’s civility in speech with queens.  OWEN. It’s a long while, surely. It’s three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you’re seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.  DEIRDRE. — _beginning to fold up her silks and jewels._ — Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  OWEN. — _derisively._ — If they’re a short space there aren’t many the like of you. Wasn’t there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she’d meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, (_leaning towards her_) are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  DEIRDRE. — _very quietly._ — Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throwing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It’s a heartbreak to the wise that it’s for a short space we have the same things only. (_With contempt._) Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man’s a fool and talker.  OWEN. — _sharply._ — Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor’s a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I’d liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It’s a poor thing to be so lonesome you’d squeeze kisses on a cur dog’s nose.  DEIRDRE. Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  OWEN. — _vehemently._ — There are none like you, Deirdre. It’s for that I’m asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  DEIRDRE. I will go where Naisi chooses.  OWEN. — _with a burst of rage._ — It’s Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you’ll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep’s eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she’d scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. (_With a sad cry that brings dignity into his voice._) Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it’s a poor thing to see a queen’s nose reaching down to scrape her chin.  DEIRDRE. — _looking out, a little uneasy._ — Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  OWEN. I’ll go so, for if I had you seven years I’d be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. (_Muffles himself in his cloak; with a sort of warning in his voice._) I’ll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn’t my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You’ve no answer? . . . . It’s because Naisi killed him. (_With curious expression._) Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snoring, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I’m doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  [_He goes out, and in a moment Naisi and Fergus come in on the other side._  NAISI. — _gaily._ — Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  DEIRDRE. — _greeting Fergus._ — He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  FERGUS. It’s a sunny nook you’ve found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  DEIRDRE. — _with keenness._ — They’ve answered? They would go?  FERGUS. — _benignly._ — They have not, but when I was a young man we’d have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it’s in a short while they’ll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there’s no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always.  NAISI. — _gruffly._ — It’s true, surely. Yet we’re better this place while Conchubor’s in Emain Macha.  FERGUS. — _giving him parchments._ — There are your sureties and Conchubor’s seal. (_To Deirdre._) I am your surety with Conchubor. You’ll not be young always, and it’s time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes’ wives. It’s little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you’d best come this night, for you’d have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, “I am in Ireland, surely.”  DEIRDRE. It isn’t pleasure I’d have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  FERGUS. — _almost annoyed._ — Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? (_He gets parchments from his cloak and gives them to Naisi. More gently._) It’s easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman (_taunting her a little_) could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you’d have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn’t it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  DEIRDRE. — _turning away a little haughtily._ — I leave the choice to Naisi. (_Turning back towards Fergus._) Yet you’d do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you’ll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  [_Goes into tent._  FERGUS. It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. (_He watches till he is sure Deirdre cannot hear him._) Listen now to what I’m saying. You’d do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you’ll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You’re here years and plenty to know it’s truth I’m saying.  [_Deirdre comes out of tent with a horn of wine, she catches the beginning of Naisi’s speech and stops with stony wonder._  NAISI. — _very thoughtfully._ — I’ll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I’ve been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I’ve a dread upon me a day’d come I’d weary of her voice, (_very slowly_) and Deirdre’d see I’d wearied.  FERGUS. — _sympathetic but triumphant._ — I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre’s seen your dread and she’ll have no peace from this out in the woods.  NAISI. — _with confidence._ — She’s not seen it. . . . Deirdre’s no thought of getting old or wearied; it’s that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  [_Deirdre drops the horn of wine and crouches down where she is._  FERGUS. That humour’ll leave her. But we’ve no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  NAISI. I’ll not go, Fergus. I’ve had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor’s seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We’ll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It’s that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  FERGUS. — _gathering up his parchments._ — And you won’t go, surely.  NAISI. I will not. . . . I’ve had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there’s a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk’s brought me ease, and I see we’re as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we’ll be so ever and always, though we’d live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.  FERGUS. — _with anger._ — Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  NAISI. You’ll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  FERGUS. — _bitterly._ — It isn’t much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  [_He goes, Naisi turns towards tent and sees Deirdre crouching down with her cloak round her face. Deirdre comes out._  NAISI. You’ve heard my words to Fergus? (_She does not answer. A pause. He puts his arm round her._) Leave troubling, and we’ll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  [_Crosses and sits down._  DEIRDRE. — _in a very low voice._ — With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. (_She turns and clings to him._) The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  NAISI. We’ll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn’t Fergus’s talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  DEIRDRE. It isn’t to great deeds you’re going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn’t it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  NAISI. I’ve said we’d stay in Alban always.  DEIRDRE. There’s no place to stay always. . . . It’s a long time we’ve had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It’s a long time we’ve had, but the end has come, surely.  NAISI. Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  DEIRDRE. There’s reason all times for an end that’s come. And I’m well pleased, Naisi, we’re going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it’s you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  NAISI. If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it’s right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we’ll be safe always.  DEIRDRE. — _broken-hearted._ — There’s no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it’s in the quiet woods I’ve seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  NAISI. — _still more eagerly._ — Come away, Deirdre, and it’s little we’ll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  DEIRDRE. — _clearly and gravely._ — It’s this hour we’re between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn’t it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  NAISI. — _his voice broken with distraction._ — If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  DEIRDRE. — _shaking her head slowly._ — There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It’s for that there’s nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It’s for that we’re setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.  NAISI. — _giving in._ — You’re right, maybe. It should be a poor thing to see great lovers and they sleepy and old.  DEIRDRE. — _with a more tender intensity._ — We’re seven years without roughness or growing weary; seven years so sweet and shining, the gods would be hard set to give us seven days the like of them. It’s for that we’re going to Emain, where there’ll be a rest for ever, or a place for forgetting, in great crowds and they making a stir.  NAISI. — _very softly._ — We’ll go, surely, in place of keeping a watch on a love had no match and it wasting away. (_They cling to each other for a moment, then Nais
