Chapter One: The Return of Ember

The sky above the eastern range was cloudless, the kind of pale, blue stretch that made the world seem wider than usual. A brittle wind combed the dried grass, making it hiss and whisper like it carried secrets from the valley below. Atop a bluff, where the land flattened into the open sweep of the Harper ranch, a lone horse appeared. Ember—chestnut and white-spotted, her mane tangled with burs—trotted nervously into view, reins trailing behind her like limp ribbons, saddle askew.

Mara Harper stood on the porch with a bucket in hand, her boots dusty from the morning’s work. She blinked once, twice, the breath snagging in her chest. Ember shouldn’t be alone. Her brother, Eli, had taken her out early that morning to scout the northern fence line. He wouldn’t have let her go unless something had gone wrong.

The horse clomped across the packed dirt yard, sides heaving, flanks flecked with sweat and burrs. One stirrup was broken. Mara dropped the bucket. The water sloshed, forgotten.

“Dad!” she shouted into the house. “Dad, Ember’s back!”

Inside, a chair scraped against wood. Benjamin Harper stepped out, his face pale beneath his weather-beaten skin. He didn’t ask questions. He just walked straight past his daughter and ran a hand down Ember’s neck, whispering softly to calm her. Then he pulled himself into the saddle despite the broken stirrup.

“Get the rifle and ride south,” he said without looking at Mara. “Find Joe. Bring him to the north ridge. Tell him Eli’s missing.”

Mara’s voice trembled. “You don’t think—?”

“Go.”

She did.

The sun was higher now, casting long bars of heat across the road as Mara galloped toward the Miller ranch. Joe Miller wasn’t family by blood, but he was as close to kin as the Harpers had. A friend of Eli’s since they were boys, Joe worked the neighboring land and rode like he was born in the saddle.

When she found him in the barnyard, elbow-deep in a tractor engine, Joe didn’t hesitate. He dropped the wrench and reached for his rifle.

“Let’s go,” he said. “Lead the way.”

The northern ridge was rough land, thick with scrub oak and rabbitbrush, the kind of place a man could vanish into without a trace. When they found Eli’s tracks, it was only because Benjamin knew every inch of that land—knew his son’s bootprint, even the way his horse moved when scared.

They found the first sign just below the ridge crest: scuffed earth, broken brush, and then—a dark stain in the dust. Blood. Not a lot, but enough.

Joe knelt beside it. “No sign of a body.”

Mara looked away, blinking fast. “That doesn’t mean—he could be hurt, hiding.”

Benjamin didn’t speak. He was staring at something else, just past the blood—a set of unfamiliar tracks. Boot prints, larger than Eli’s. And something else.

“Someone else was here,” he murmured. “And they were dragging something.”

They didn’t find Eli that day.

They searched until dark and returned with grim faces and silent mouths. Mara didn’t sleep that night. She sat on the porch, Ember tethered nearby, the horse’s quiet shifting the only sound besides the wind.

She knew something was wrong—something deeper than a simple accident. Her brother didn’t fall off horses. He didn’t run from fights. If he was gone, it wasn’t by choice.

The next morning, the sheriff came.

“Got a call from a trapper up near Tangle Creek,” he said, thumbing through a small notebook. “Said he saw a campfire two nights ago. Claimed someone was singing. Strange kind of song—said it wasn’t English. Maybe Slavic.”

Benjamin frowned. “That’s not Eli.”

“No, but he said the man wasn’t alone. Saw a younger fella tied up. Said he looked injured.”

Mara’s heart stopped.

The trail to Tangle Creek was overgrown and narrow, running along a snaking gorge filled with black water and mosquito hum. The further in they rode, the quieter the woods became—no birdsong, no wind. Just silence.

It was late afternoon when they found the camp.

A smoldering firepit. Bones—animal, mostly, though not all. Torn cloth. A tin plate with strange markings carved into the rim. And a smell—bitter, iron-rich, like old blood.

Joe kicked through the remains. “They were here. Not long ago.”

“Look,” Mara said.

Near a tree, tied to the bark with a strip of twisted leather, hung something small and terrible: Eli’s hat. The inside was soaked with blood.

The sheriff ordered a wider search. Rangers were called in. Dogs. Drones. Nothing turned up. Weeks passed. Then months.

Eli Harper became a name whispered in town like a ghost story. People said he'd run off. Others said he'd been taken by wolves. But Mara never stopped believing he was alive.

She started to dream—strange dreams of a forest thick with black trees and silver light, of voices calling her name in a tongue she didn’t understand. She began to hear things, too. Whispers, especially at dusk. Once, she found Ember standing at the barn door, eyes wide, snorting at nothing.

Then came the letter.

It arrived without a stamp. No return address. Just her name—“Mara Harper”—in thick, uneven handwriting.

Inside was a single sentence.

“Your brother is not dead, but the price for his life must be paid.”

And beneath it, drawn in black ink, the symbol she’d seen carved into the tin plate at the camp.

A circle. A line. And a single, staring eye.

Benjamin stared at the symbol for a long time before finally speaking. His voice was low, like it hurt him to use it. “I’ve seen this before,” he said, turning the page slightly, careful not to smudge the ink. “Not recently. Years ago. Up north, before we ever came to Harper Valley. There was a man—something off about him. Always kept to himself, never bought supplies, never traded stock. Claimed to be a healer, but folks whispered other things. He used to paint this same damn mark on the rocks by his shack. And one day, he just vanished.”

Mara glanced at Joe, hoping for disbelief in his eyes. But he looked grim. Thoughtful. “You saying this is the same man?”

Benjamin shook his head. “I’m saying whatever he was part of, it didn’t stay behind.”

They kept the letter hidden, even from the sheriff. Benjamin didn’t trust the law to understand. Joe agreed, for once more out of instinct than reason. The three of them began meeting in the old storm cellar behind the barn, a place no one ever went. Mara laid the letter on the center of the worktable each night, staring at the circle and the line and the eye as if the shape would rearrange itself into meaning.

That meaning came two weeks later, when the dreams started getting worse.

Mara saw a man standing on a stone outcrop beneath a sky with no stars. His eyes were covered by cloth, but he could still see her. He lifted his hands, palms upward, and spoke in a language that scraped like claws across her spine. Each time she woke, sweating, gasping, she remembered one word more than the night before. By the fourth night, she could say it out loud.

“Anzelim.”

Joe looked up sharply when she said it. “Say that again.”

“Anzelim.”

He grabbed a book from the corner—some dusty old tome on folk legends and frontier tales, one of the many things his grandfather left him. He flipped through the pages, muttering, until he stopped on a passage written in dense, cramped script.

“Here,” he said, pointing. “This is from some diary in the 1800s. A miner near Crag Hollow. He wrote about a ‘man in black robes who lives beyond the stone gate, whose name is Anzelim, the Price-Gatherer.’ Says he makes deals. Brings people back from death. For a cost.”

Benjamin’s voice was cold. “What kind of cost?”

Joe looked back at the book, then at Mara. “It doesn’t say.”

The next morning, they found the circle burned into the ground behind the barn. No fire, no signs of trespassing. Just scorched earth, and in the center, a single object.

Eli’s pocketknife.

The same one he carried everywhere. The same one that Benjamin had given him when he turned sixteen. The wooden handle was cracked. The blade was rusted and stained with something that didn’t look like mud.

That night, Mara made her decision.

She saddled Ember. Packed a bag. Took her brother’s knife and the letter. Left a note on the kitchen table, one that simply read: “I have to find him.”

She rode north, into the hills where the creek cut sharp between rock walls and the wind moved like breath through the pines. At first, she saw nothing unusual. No signs of camps, no footprints, no strange symbols. But the forest changed subtly as the day wore on. The light grew colder, more silver than gold. The air held the scent of ash and moss. The birds stopped singing.

By the time dusk fell, she found the clearing.

It was circular, perfectly so, rimmed with stones that were too smooth, too round to be natural. In the center, a slab of dark granite jutted from the ground, polished and cold. On it, the same symbol again—circle, line, eye—carved deep into its surface.

Mara stepped into the circle. The wind died. Everything fell still. For the first time, she heard her own heartbeat like a drum in her ears.

“I’m here,” she whispered. “I got your letter. You said he’s alive. Where is he?”

The shadows deepened. The trees seemed to lean inward. Then, a voice—not from any direction, but from everywhere at once.

“Will you pay the price?”

She turned, searching the clearing, hand on Eli’s knife. “What price?”

“A life for a life.”

“No,” she said quickly. “There has to be another way.”

Silence.

Then the voice again, slower this time.

“You have called. The debt has been acknowledged. He lives, but your place is now written.”

Mara took a step back. “What does that mean?”

There was no answer. The air in the clearing seemed to twist. The granite slab pulsed once, faintly, like a heartbeat. And then the world returned to normal—wind whispering, insects chirping, the light back to its natural hue.

The clearing was empty.

Mara left the forest with more questions than answers, but something had changed. She knew it even before she reached home.

Eli was back.

He was sitting on the porch, barefoot and dirty, wrapped in one of Benjamin’s old coats. His eyes were sunken. He looked thinner, like something had drained the color out of him. But he was alive.

When he saw her, he didn’t smile. He only looked at her with the kind of expression a man wears when he's seen something too large to explain.

“You shouldn’t have done it,” he said.

Mara dropped to her knees beside him. “I had to. I couldn’t let you die out there.”

Eli shook his head slowly. “You don’t understand. It’s not over. It’s just started.”

That night, the valley felt different. As if some new breath had stirred beneath the hills, whispering through the brush like teeth gnashing under soil. Eli wouldn’t speak more of what he’d seen, only that he wasn’t alone in that other place. That there were others, like him. Returned. Changed.

Mara dreamed again.

Only this time, she wasn’t alone in the dream. Eli stood beside her in that starless place. And behind them, just at the edge of darkness, eyes watched.

Dozens of them.

And then she heard the word again.

Anzelim.

But this time, she wasn’t the one saying it.

Eli slept most of the next day, or at least appeared to. He lay on the cot in the barn’s side room, the one they used in summer when guests stayed over. His breathing was shallow, but regular. Mara brought him water, broth, old blankets. He said little. He flinched at sudden noises, avoided eye contact, and more than once she caught him staring out the window at nothing, pupils wide and lost.

Joe came by in the late afternoon. He said nothing at first, just leaned against the post and watched Mara hanging laundry, her hands working mechanically.

“He say anything new?” he asked eventually, voice low.

She shook her head. “No. Just that he’s not the same. Keeps telling me not to ask questions. But he won’t stop watching the woods.”

Joe took off his hat, rubbed his neck, glanced toward the barn. “It’s like he’s still... partway gone.”

“I don’t think he ever really left wherever he was,” she murmured.

That night, Mara sat beside Eli’s bed, listening to the chorus of crickets outside and the low shifting of animals in the dark. He hadn’t moved for hours, not since sundown. She reached for his wrist, gently—his skin felt clammy, his pulse faint but present. Then suddenly, his hand clamped around her arm with terrifying force.

“Don’t go to the creek,” he rasped, eyes still closed. “Not even in the day. Don’t follow the singing.”

“What singing?”

But his grip relaxed, his breathing slowed again, and he sank back into silence.

The next morning brought fog—thick and low, rolling in from the north like smoke from a hidden fire. Mara had lived in Harper Valley all her life and never seen anything like it. The ground felt damp, even though it hadn’t rained. The dogs refused to go outside. The cows stood in stiff clusters, staring in the same direction—east, toward the line of trees behind the property.

Joe arrived before noon, pale and unsettled.

“You see the fields?” he asked without preamble.

“No.”

“Corn’s gone sour. All of it. Black inside. Like it rotted from the roots.”

They drove out to check, and sure enough, the soil was ruined. Flies buzzed thick over husks that collapsed at the slightest touch. Mara bent down, pulled back a leaf, and found something scrawled in the dirt beneath it—lines carved with what looked like a claw. A circle. A line. And a crude eye.

Joe swore under his breath. “It followed him back.”

Mara stood, fists clenched. “You think I don’t know that?”

Back at the ranch, Benjamin had taken to pacing. He was always calm, even in storms or fires, but now he paced like a man caught inside a narrowing ring. He didn’t speak much, but the look in his eyes—he knew. Something ancient and wrong had entered their lives, and there was no closing the door behind it.

That evening, as they gathered on the porch to talk, a sound rose from the creek bed—faint at first, but rising in waves. A voice. Thin and lilting. Female.

It sang no melody they knew, no words from any tongue they could place, but it was unmistakably music. It twisted in the wind like it belonged to the earth itself.

Eli sat upright in bed and screamed.

By the time Mara reached him, he’d collapsed again, eyes wide and unseeing. He muttered over and over: “She’s awake... she’s awake... she’s seen me now…”

Mara held his head in her lap, trying to quiet him, but his body trembled like he was being pulled in two.

Benjamin entered, rifle in hand, and looked at his daughter grimly. “It’s not done with us.”

“I know.”

They posted a watch that night, all three taking shifts. Joe sat out by the barn with a lantern and his shotgun. Mara waited by Eli’s bedside, the old revolver her father kept in the kitchen tucked in her waistband. And Benjamin circled the house, every hour on the hour, boots crunching the gravel like a heartbeat against the stillness.

At 3:17 a.m., the cows broke the fence.

They found them in the field at dawn—twenty-three head, all clustered in a circle around a dead tree near the south ridge. They stood unmoving, eyes glazed, coats damp with frost that hadn’t fallen from the sky. One calf lay dead in the center of the ring, bloodless, its body unmarked.

Carved into the bark of the dead tree above it was the now-familiar symbol, but this time, something new had been added. Beneath the eye was a name.

Mara.

She said nothing. Simply turned and walked back toward the house.

By the time she reached the porch, she was shaking.

The next day, she went into town—ostensibly for supplies, but in truth, to see a woman she hadn’t visited since she was twelve.

Miss Ada ran the little curiosities shop on Pine Street, tucked between the post office and an antique store no one ever seemed to enter. Most people thought she was senile, but the older folk spoke of her differently. With caution. With a little fear.

The bell over the door jingled faintly as Mara entered. Dust hung thick in the air. Old books and faded jars lined every shelf.

Ada sat behind the counter, eyes milky and distant, yet fixed on her as if she’d been expecting her all along.

“You brought it back,” she said without greeting.

Mara stepped forward. “You know what this is?”

Ada leaned forward, her breath wheezing through chapped lips. “The eye that watches. The hunger that waits. The deal that cannot be undone. Oh, girl... you didn’t just bring back your brother.”

“I need to stop it.”

“You can’t. Not alone. You’re already marked.”

“Then what do I do?”

Ada reached below the counter and drew out a thin book, bound in old leather, the cover cracked and flaking. She opened it to a page near the middle, revealing a sketch—crude, but unmistakable. The stone circle in the forest. The same eye.

“There’s a second circle,” she said. “A mirror to the first. The Price-Gatherer takes through one and gives through the other. The only way to break the cycle is to enter through the second and return the taken soul. Not just the body. The soul.”

Mara stared. “Where is it?”

Ada’s eyes closed. “That I don’t know. But he’ll show you. Eventually. The one you brought back. That’s the price of knowing. He sees now. He’ll lead you.”

Mara left with the book in her pack and a chill in her bones that wouldn’t melt under any sun. When she got back, Eli was gone again.

No note. No trail. Ember remained in the stable, untouched.

Only a smear of dirt on the floorboards led out the back door.

And carved into the frame, three words in unfamiliar script.

We Begin Now.

Chapter Two: The Second Circle

The morning after Eli vanished for the second time, the valley felt as if it were holding its breath. The fog had lifted, but the light was still wrong—washed out and pale, as though the sun hung behind a veil. The birds that normally filled the trees with chatter had gone silent again, and even the wind held back, leaving the air thick and unmoving.

Mara stood at the back door where Eli had disappeared, staring at the message carved into the frame. The three words etched into the wood—We Begin Now—looked deeper than they should have been. As if something not made of flesh had used a tool older than knives. She reached out, touched the letters, and felt a pulse—soft and faint, like the whisper of a breath over bare skin.

Behind her, Benjamin stood silent, shotgun slung over his shoulder. He’d aged ten years since Eli first went missing. The lines on his face had sunk deeper, the hollows beneath his eyes darkened to bruises. But his hands were steady.

“We search the south ridge first,” he said. “Joe’s already headed that way.”

Mara nodded, but her thoughts were tangled, caught on Ada’s words and the book now hidden under a loose board in her room. There was a second circle. A mirror. And if Eli was gone again, then she would have to find it—before the thing that had taken him decided to collect on the deal they had barely begun to understand.

They found nothing on the ridge.

No tracks, no broken brush, no blood. Joe returned at sundown, face tight, hands clenched. “It’s like he vanished into smoke.”

Mara didn’t sleep that night. She sat in her room, reading Ada’s book by lantern light. The pages were filled with fragmented entries, notes scrawled in cramped handwriting, diagrams half-erased by age. The Second Circle, it said, lay “where water forgets its name and the land can no longer speak.” Another page spoke of gates that do not open but instead remember, and names that once spoken cannot be reclaimed.

The writing was maddening, like trying to understand a dream long after waking.

One passage stuck with her. It had been underlined in a trembling hand:

“Do not trust the voice that wears your loved one’s face. It is not him, but the shadow of the debt.”

She closed the book slowly. Whatever Eli was now—whatever had come back wearing his voice—it might not be the brother she remembered.

Three nights later, she heard singing again.

This time it came from the barn.

It was soft at first, barely more than a hum, but it grew louder as she crept through the dark house and pushed open the screen door. The moon hung low and yellow, distorted by thin clouds. A lantern swung faintly from the barn’s outer beam, though no one had lit it.

The voice inside was unmistakably Eli’s. But he was singing in the same language she had heard in the dreams—the scraping, backward-tongued language of the man with the blindfolded eyes. The notes didn’t rise or fall like a melody; they circled, repeating, spiraling inward like water down a drain.

She stepped inside, heart pounding.

There was no one there.

But the loft door hung open. A shadow moved above.

She climbed the ladder quietly, one rung at a time. Her fingers ached from gripping the wooden sides. When her head cleared the top, she saw him.

Eli stood at the far edge of the loft, facing the open window. His arms were raised, fingers spread wide, his body swaying like he stood in a wind that wasn’t there. His voice never broke, never faltered.

“Eli,” she whispered.

He stopped.

The silence hit like a gunshot.

Slowly, he turned.

And for a moment—just a blink—his face wasn’t his.

His features shifted, elongated, his mouth stretched too wide. His eyes bled shadow like ink running from a page. Then it was gone. He was Eli again. Pale. Tired. Quiet.

“You shouldn’t have followed me,” he said, voice hoarse.

“What are you doing?”

“I have to keep the connection. If I stop, it will close. If it closes, it’ll come for you instead.”

She crossed the loft quickly, gripping his arms. “We’ll find the second circle. We’ll end it.”

He shook his head. “You don’t understand. It’s not just a place. It’s a wound. You don’t find it by walking. You find it by bleeding.”

The next day, Mara rode out alone.

She followed no map, just instinct, guided by the same unease that had grown like a knot in her stomach since Ember returned alone. Her path wound through the old east grove, past the rusted remains of the Anders homestead—long abandoned, but still standing like a skeleton in the trees.

Beyond it, the land changed.

It grew quieter. Heavier. The colors dimmed, as though the world had been drained of contrast. She dismounted and walked Ember on foot, leading the mare through tangled brush until they reached the river.

Or what was left of it.

The once wide Harper River was now a thin trickle, barely more than a creek, its bed dry and cracked in places. The banks were littered with bones—animal, mostly, but some... some too large to be deer.

Then she saw it.

Half-buried in the silt, beneath the bent limbs of a dead willow, lay stone.

A perfect circle, just like the one in the northern woods.

But this one was different.

It wasn’t part of the forest. It was set into the earth itself, flat and wide, etched with deeper carvings. Symbols she hadn’t seen before. They weren’t just eyes now. They were mouths. Dozens. Open. Screaming.

She stepped toward it.

The air thickened.

Her ears popped.

And then a sound tore through her mind—not heard, but felt.

Come in.

She dropped to her knees.

Blood ran from her nose.

Above her, the trees began to twist.

And beneath her hands, the stone began to warm.

She awoke in her bed.

Sunlight poured through the windows. Birds chirped.

Eli sat beside her, one hand wrapped tightly around hers.

“You found it,” he said.

“I don’t remember getting back.”

“You didn’t. It brought you back.”

Mara tried to sit, winced. Her head felt split in two. Her throat was raw.

Eli reached into his pocket and held something out.

It was her necklace—the silver one their mother had given her years ago. She hadn’t worn it in weeks.

“I found this lying on the stone,” he said. “It was the only thing left behind.”

She touched the chain. It was cold.

“I have to go back,” she whispered.

He didn’t answer.

Because he knew it too.

The second circle wasn’t just a doorway.

It was a question.

And Mara had already begun to answer.

The following days passed in a haze of silence and preparation. Mara stayed close to the house, though her mind was already elsewhere—down at the dried-out riverbed, beneath the willow tree, standing again before the circle she now knew was a gate. The second gate. She still bore the faint mark of it: a small welt on her palm where her fingers had brushed the stone. It pulsed faintly in the dark, a dull throb like a second heartbeat.

She tried to speak of it with her father, but Benjamin had grown cautious, quieter than before. He did not tell her not to go—he simply sharpened his tools, cleaned the rust from his rifle, and started sleeping fully clothed, as if waiting for the wrong kind of visitor to arrive.

Joe was the only one who would talk to her without flinching.

“You’re going to try to enter that thing, aren’t you?” he asked one night on the porch. He was chewing on a blade of grass, watching the far hills, eyes narrow and unreadable.

“I have to. It’s the only way this ends.”

“You don’t know that. What if it’s a trap?”

“It already is,” she said, and held up her hand. The mark glowed faintly under the starlight. “And I’m already in it.”

He sighed and leaned back, the old chair creaking beneath his weight. “Then at least let me come with you.”

Mara shook her head. “You’re not marked. You can’t pass through. It won’t open for you.”

Joe’s mouth twisted like he was chewing something bitter. “So what, I just wait here while you walk into a nightmare?”

She didn’t answer, and that silence told him everything.

That night, Eli dreamed again.

He woke screaming, drenched in sweat, skin cold to the touch. His voice cracked when he tried to speak, so Mara brought him water and waited, crouched beside the bed like she had when they were children during thunderstorms.

“She’s closer now,” he said eventually. “She’s coming through.”

“Who?”

“The Singer. The one who marked the trees. The one who called you with my voice. She’s been waiting at the gate. But now... now she’s moving.”

Mara frowned. “Moving where?”

Eli turned his head slowly, looked her dead in the eye.

“To you.”

That morning, they found the Miller ranch abandoned.

Joe’s house stood empty, doors swinging open, chairs overturned, the fire still warm in the hearth. No blood. No signs of struggle. Just gone.

But outside, beside the barn, they found the symbol again—carved into the ground, burned into the grass. And beside it, something worse.

Joe’s boots.

Upright. Untouched. Still laced.

And inside them, his feet.

The legs had been severed at the shin, cleanly, almost surgically. There was no blood on the grass, only a dark residue that soaked into the soil like ink spilled from a broken pen. Mara vomited in the field and fell to her knees. Benjamin stood silent, jaw tight, rifle raised and ready though there was nothing to shoot.

“We bury what we can,” he said.

They said no more about it.

Later that day, Mara prepared to return to the circle.

Eli followed her silently into the barn and stood near as she packed the saddle bags. He held something in his hand—a strip of old canvas tied into a crude pouch.

“What’s that?” she asked.

“From the other side,” he said. “A gift. I don’t know what it does, but I’ve kept it close ever since I came back. It listens to things. I think maybe it remembers the way home.”

Mara took it carefully. It was warm, vibrating faintly.

“You’ll need it if you’re going to find her,” Eli added. “And if she finds you first...”

He trailed off, but the meaning hung heavy in the air.

She left just before dusk.

Riding Ember once again down the same overgrown trail, she reached the riverbed faster this time. The trees bent away from her path now, not with welcome, but recognition. They knew her. She was no longer just a visitor.

The stone circle remained where she had found it, but something had changed.

It was no longer half-buried. The earth around it had shifted, peeled back as if some great hand had scooped away the soil. It stood exposed now, gleaming darkly in the fading light.

The carvings pulsed faintly.

The mouths were open wider.

And this time, there was no invitation.

Just expectation.

Mara approached slowly, each footstep heavier than the last. Her breath caught when she reached the center. The stone vibrated under her boots. The air grew thick. Her skin prickled. She drew the canvas pouch from her coat and held it aloft.

Nothing happened.

Then everything did.

The world inverted.

The wind screamed in reverse.

The trees bent backward like straw in a gale.

Light fractured and bent and vanished.

And Mara fell forward into the stone.

The forest on the other side wasn’t a forest at all.

It was a memory of one.

A pale imitation, gray and flickering, trees made from shadow and echo, not bark or leaf. The ground beneath her boots felt like ash. Every sound she made echoed as if she were walking inside a cavern too vast to see.

The air smelled like burnt paper and wet stone.

The sky above her was blank.

No stars.

No moon.

Only a smooth, endless canvas of darkness.

She took one step forward, then another. The gate behind her had vanished. There was no trail.

But there was singing.

Soft. Distant. Pulling.

She followed it, gripping Eli’s pouch tightly.

For a long time, nothing changed. The trees remained the same, their shapes like repeated brushstrokes in a broken painting. But eventually, she found something new.

A mirror.

Tall, narrow, standing upright in the middle of the path with no frame and no reflection.

Only a shimmer.

She stepped closer, and the surface rippled like disturbed water.

Then it spoke.

But not aloud.

Do you seek to undo the bargain?

Mara stared into the non-reflection.

“I seek my brother’s soul.”

The body is not the soul. You must go deeper.

“What is the price?”

The mirror pulsed.

You already carry it. But others must pay as well.

Behind her, something moved.

She turned and saw them.

Shadows shaped like people—dozens—walking in slow, steady lines, heads bowed, features unfinished. She recognized none of them until she saw the last.

Joe.

Or something wearing his shape.

His legs ended in black smoke. His eyes were sewn shut.

He walked past her without recognition.

And one by one, they entered the mirror.

The surface swallowed them without a sound.

She called after him. “Joe! Joe, it’s me!”

But he didn’t turn.

Only paused, and from his mouth came a sound like weeping. Then he was gone.

The mirror rippled once more and went still.

Mara turned back to the path and continued, her legs aching, her thoughts heavier than before.

Whatever waited ahead was no longer just about Eli.

This place—this second circle—it had its own rules. Its own laws. Its own debts.

And it remembered everything.

Chapter Three: A Debt Remembered

The ground beneath Mara’s boots shifted with each step, softening into a grainy sludge that shimmered like crushed glass under a bloodless sky. Her breath no longer formed mist in the air; instead, it vanished soundlessly, absorbed by the atmosphere like water into sand. She stopped briefly beneath the twisted limbs of a tree that resembled iron more than wood. From a distance it might have passed as natural, but up close, the bark pulsed subtly, like skin bearing a heartbeat just below the surface.

She had not eaten since arriving—had not felt hunger. Her thirst had vanished too. But something else gnawed at her, something deeper than body: a quiet urgency that thrummed just beyond comprehension, as if her soul were being stretched thin across an invisible frame. The Singer's voice still drifted ahead of her, that same high, winding melody that had haunted the fields and twisted Eli’s dreams. But it was closer now, louder, full of suggestion and longing.

Time had no shape in the Second Circle. Whether hours had passed or days, Mara could not say. The sky never changed. The trees remained still, frozen in place as if they had never been meant to move. Eventually, she emerged into a clearing where the light—or whatever passed for it in this world—grew brighter without a source.

In the center stood a well.

It was built of stones blackened by age, its edges worn smooth by the hands of too many visitors. The rim was scorched with the now-familiar sigil—circle, line, eye—but this time it was different. A fourth mark had been added: a downward arc beneath the eye, like a mouth yawning wide.

Mara approached cautiously, peering into the black.

No bottom. No reflection. Just a weightless abyss.

A voice spoke behind her.

“You don’t belong here.”

She turned fast, hand instinctively dropping to her side where, for once, there was no weapon. But the figure who stood at the edge of the clearing didn’t move. He was tall and wrapped in a tattered coat that might once have been military issue, now mottled with ash and threadbare at the seams. His eyes were covered by a strip of cloth, stained at the edges. And when he smiled, it was with a mouth too wide for his face.

“You’re not the first,” he said, tilting his head like a curious bird. “But you may be the last.”

Mara took a breath that didn’t fill her lungs. “Who are you?”

“I had a name once. Gave it away for a promise. It didn’t pay out.” He tapped his temple. “Now I remember everything but myself.”

“You’re the one Eli saw,” she said. “In his dreams. The blind man. The speaker.”

“Blind only to what I once was,” he murmured. “I see everything else now. Especially you, Mara Harper.”

The name in his mouth chilled her.

“You know who I am?”

“You're a knot that won’t untangle. A thread that won’t burn. You pulled your brother back, and now you must balance the weight.”

“I want to break the bond.”

His smile faded.

“You think it breaks like a stick?” he asked softly. “No. It decays like rot. It spreads. Even if you cut it out, the infection stays.”

Mara stepped toward him. “There’s a second circle. This place. This one. I was told if I passed through, if I brought back his soul—really brought it back—I could end the bargain.”

“That’s the lie the Circle tells,” he said, and turned toward the well. “But lies can still be used. They just cost more.”

She followed his gaze.

“What is this well?”

“It’s not a well. It’s a mouth. It’s where memory goes when it’s no longer wanted. Where names are undone.”

Mara’s grip tightened around the pouch Eli had given her.

“What happens if I go in?”

He laughed, sharp and sudden. “You won’t. Not yet. You haven’t bled for it.”

She stepped back.

“Then tell me where the Singer is.”

The blind man’s smile returned, thin and humorless.

“She’s behind the next gate. She waits for you as all debts do. But if you find her, you’ll wish she had waited longer.”

He turned to leave.

“Wait—what’s your name now?” Mara called.

He paused, hand resting against one of the iron-bark trees.

“No one here has names,” he said. “Only debts.”

Then he was gone.

The path beyond the clearing narrowed, and the light dimmed again. With each step, Mara felt the Singer’s melody grow clearer. Not louder, but sharper. It pulled not just on her ears, but on her thoughts. She began to recall things that had never happened—dreams she'd never had, people she'd never met. Her mother’s face, young and alive, calling her by a different name. Eli’s voice, but from a childhood they hadn’t shared.

Memories were being overwritten.

She pressed the pouch tighter to her chest.

Finally, she reached the gate.

Unlike the circle she’d passed through before, this one stood upright—a tall stone archway flanked by two pillars of bone. The bone was white, veined faintly with pulsing light, and each bore thousands of tiny carvings. Names, she realized. Some familiar. Some ancient. Some hers.

Beneath the arch, a curtain of water shimmered, falling from nothing and into nothing, vanishing before it could wet the ground.

She took a deep breath and stepped through.

The world shifted again.

She stood now in a wide chamber, its ceiling arched like a cathedral and hung with threads of glowing silver. Each thread dangled a mask—stone, porcelain, leather, glass—every shape and style imaginable, each with a name etched into its forehead.

In the center stood the Singer.

She was not what Mara expected.

No monstrous creature, no horned goddess. Just a woman. Barefoot, draped in rags that moved like smoke, her skin pale and scarred, her hair falling to her waist like tangled thread. Her face was empty of features—no eyes, no nose, no mouth.

But she sang.

The sound came from nowhere and everywhere, from above and within. It was beautiful and unbearable. Mara stumbled forward, pressing her palms to her ears.

“Stop!” she shouted, but the sound only grew richer.

The Singer turned her faceless head, as if sensing the disruption, and the song quieted.

“I came for my brother,” Mara said.

The Singer stepped forward and lifted one hand. In her palm sat a flickering orb—small, pale blue, and filled with swirling mist.

It was warm.

It was alive.

Eli.

Mara reached out, heart thundering.

Then the Singer clenched her fist and the light blinked out.

“No!” Mara screamed. “You can’t!”

A second voice spoke now, cold and soft.

He is not yours. You brought him back broken. Now he belongs to me.

“I will pay the debt,” Mara said, chest heaving. “You want a soul? Take mine. Take it and let him go.”

The Singer tilted her head.

You do not offer what is not already claimed. You are marked. You are promised.

“I refuse the promise.”

You cannot refuse what has been spoken in your name.

Mara fell to her knees.

From the shadows behind the Singer, more figures emerged—others who had bargained, who had entered and failed. Some had no faces. Some bore their own names carved into their chests. One of them wore Eli’s features—but it was not him. Not anymore.

Mara clutched the pouch, heart breaking.

Then the pouch split open.

And light poured out.

The Singer recoiled.

The orb reappeared.

Whole.

Mara lunged, grabbing it with both hands.

The masks above screamed in a chorus of splintering glass.

The Singer screamed too, but without a mouth, it was a sound that tore the sky.

Mara turned and ran.

And the Second Circle opened its jaws.

Mara didn’t remember falling, but she remembered landing.

She struck the ground with a jarring thud that knocked the wind from her lungs. Her hands, still clutched around the orb of light, burned with cold. Grass pressed against her palms. Real grass—wet, rough, familiar. Not ash or shadow. Above her, the sky stretched wide and blue, and the sun—an actual sun—glared down from behind a veil of morning clouds.

She was home.

Somewhere past the trees, a crow cawed. In the far-off fields, she thought she heard the low sound of cattle. For a moment, she simply lay there, dazed, breathing in the scent of real dirt, real air, real life. The pain in her chest, her legs, her head—everything hurt in a way she could recognize. It grounded her. It meant she was whole again.

She sat up slowly, every joint stiff. The orb she had carried was gone.

In its place was Eli.

He lay on his side nearby, curled into himself like a child sleeping through a storm. He was breathing—shallow, ragged, but steady. The color had returned to his skin, and though dark circles ringed his eyes, they were the eyes she remembered: sharp, restless, full of questions he hadn’t dared ask aloud.

She crawled over to him and placed a hand on his cheek.

He stirred.

“Mara?”

“I’m here.”

He blinked slowly, then sat up with a grunt, glancing around in confusion. “Did we…? Is this real?”

“I think so,” she said. “We’re back.”

The trees around them were familiar. This was the eastern edge of their property, near the old Miller trailhead. They weren’t far from home. But there was something strange about the place—not wrong, exactly, just… unsettled. The air still felt thick, like a storm had passed through recently, leaving everything a little too quiet.

Eli tried to stand and stumbled. Mara caught his arm.

“I’ve got you,” she said.

He nodded. “Thank you.”

They made their way back slowly, half-walking, half-leaning on each other. Ember, miraculously, found them before they reached the barn. The horse stepped from the woods as if she’d been waiting all along, eyes wide but calm. She pressed her nose to Mara’s shoulder and let them mount without fuss.

The ride home was silent.

Not for lack of words, but because neither knew where to begin.

Benjamin was in the barn when they arrived.

He didn’t speak as he helped Eli down, nor did he ask where they’d been. He only looked at them, once, with a mix of exhaustion and something unreadable, then turned and led them inside. He had soup ready, and warm blankets, and a bottle of something older than Mara that he poured into a tin mug and handed to his son without ceremony.

Mara didn’t ask how he’d known they’d return today. She suspected he hadn’t known—only hoped. Hoped hard enough that he’d never stopped preparing.

After Eli fell asleep on the couch, Benjamin sat beside the fireplace and finally spoke.

“I dreamed of your mother last night.”

Mara looked up. “What?”

“She was younger than when I met her. Her hair was short. She was barefoot. Said nothing, but smiled at me like she’d forgiven something I didn’t know I’d done.”

“That’s... strange timing.”

Benjamin sipped his drink. “Everything’s strange now.”

Mara sat across from him, fingers laced together. “It’s over.”

He didn’t answer immediately. The fire crackled between them, filling the pause.

“No,” he said. “It’s not.”

She felt it too.

Though the second circle had closed behind her, and Eli had returned whole, the land hadn’t settled. The trees still bent subtly toward the creek. The wind whispered in foreign rhythms. And the shadows—especially at dusk—moved in ways they hadn’t before.

“It won’t be like before,” Mara said.

“No,” Benjamin agreed. “But at least now we know what we’re dealing with.”

Do we? she wanted to ask. Because what she’d seen inside that world defied understanding. The Singer. The masks. The well that wasn’t a well. And the man without a name who had warned her too late.

Still, the truth remained simple: the debt had not vanished. It had only been traded, passed forward like an old coin in a forgotten hand.

Eli recovered faster than she expected.

By the second week, he was walking unaided. By the third, he was helping mend the fence near the north ridge. He didn’t talk much about what he remembered—only fragments. “The voices didn’t sleep.” “There were doors behind the doors.” “Every step felt like I was stepping out of myself.”

Mara didn’t press. She knew the cost of remembering.

She still dreamed of the mirror. Of Joe. Of the names carved in bone.

She knew the Singer wasn’t dead.

Creatures like that didn’t die.

They changed shape. Changed names. Waited.

One evening, Eli walked out to the old circle by the creek—the place where it had all started—and returned with something clenched in his fist.

It was a feather.

Black, glossy, perfect.

And attached to it, barely noticeable, a red thread wound tightly near the quill.

He didn’t say anything, just handed it to her and walked away.

Mara stood there a long time, turning the feather over in her hands.

A warning.

Or maybe a reminder.

That not all debts are paid in full.

Chapter Four: Threads Left Uncut

Spring arrived in Harper Valley with rain that tasted of iron and thunder that never echoed. The fields turned green, but the animals were restless. Birds nested later than usual. The chickens refused to roost. A fox was found near the edge of the property with its eyes missing, but no wounds anywhere else. Benjamin buried it without comment, but Mara noticed the way he sharpened every tool in the shed that night, the lantern burning in his window long after the house had gone dark.

Eli, for his part, tried to settle back into ranch life, but there was a hollowness to him that no one could quite mend. He worked hard—harder than he needed to—but his laughter was forced, his smiles brief, and every so often, he would flinch at nothing, as though hearing something just behind his ear. Once, Mara caught him speaking in a low murmur behind the barn, his back to her. When she called out, he turned and smiled, too quickly.

“There was a bird,” he said. “Just talking to a bird.”

But there had been no bird.

And the air had smelled faintly of burning wool.

Mara didn’t press him. She had her own unease to carry.

The feather he’d given her was now wrapped in cloth, buried in a drawer beneath her bed. Every night she swore she could hear it rustle softly, even when the windows were closed. More than once, she dreamt of the Singer again—not the whole of her, just fragments. A hand with too many joints. A song whistled through cracked teeth. A mask, cracked down the middle, still wet with tears.

In those dreams, she was never alone.

Joe stood beside her in many of them, though his eyes remained stitched shut and his boots left no prints. He said nothing, only stood still, and waited.

One night, Mara woke with the knowledge that Joe’s name was gone from the Miller mailbox.

She rode out the next morning and found it to be true. The rusted red box that once read J. Miller now bore only a smear of paint. Even his house, still standing, seemed less real—washed of color, softened at the edges, like a fading photograph left too long in the sun. No one in town mentioned him anymore. Not as if they’d forgotten—but as if he had never existed.

When Mara asked the sheriff about him directly, the man frowned.

“Miller?” he said. “Can’t recall a Miller family round here.”

“But Joe—Joseph Miller. He lived just down past the old fence line—”

“I know that stretch,” the sheriff interrupted. “Used to be a sheep farm there. Burned down in ’83. Nothing left but the bones of a silo. Never was a Miller, though.”

He offered her a patronizing smile, the kind folks gave to the young when they talked too fast about ghosts.

Mara rode home sick with the knowledge that something had rewritten the world around her. She was still here—but pieces of her past had been snipped, erased as cleanly as footprints swept from sand.

At night, she began returning to the circle by the creek.

It had closed, yes—visibly, physically—but Mara wasn’t convinced it was truly sealed. The trees leaned inward now in a way they hadn’t before, as if forming a frame around the hollow where the stone had been. The grass never grew back. The air there always hung heavier.

She started leaving offerings.

Nothing elaborate. A button from her mother’s coat. A sliver of bone she found near the chicken coop. A single black stone shaped like an eye.

At first, nothing changed. Then, one morning, she found a coin there.

It was old. Worn flat. No face, no stamp, no year.

But she knew it hadn’t been hers.

That same day, Eli caught her heading out and blocked her path.

“I saw what you’ve been doing,” he said. “You can’t open it again.”

“I’m not trying to open it,” she lied.

“You’re feeding it.”

She said nothing.

He reached into his pocket and pulled something out—a second pouch, nearly identical to the one he had given her weeks ago. It was singed at the corners, stained with something dark.

“This showed up on my bed this morning,” he said. “With my name stitched into the side. I didn’t sew it. Did you?”

“No.”

“I think it’s a warning.”

“From who?”

He looked past her, toward the creek.

“From me. The me I left behind.”

A week later, the dreams returned in force.

Not the surreal fragments of the Second Circle, but something worse. More real. More physical. She could feel wind on her face. Smell damp wood. Taste iron on her tongue.

She stood again at the well of unnames.

But this time, she wasn’t alone.

A girl stood at the edge, barefoot, wearing a dress Mara recognized from a photograph that had never been taken. Her face was hidden beneath a curtain of hair.

“I know you,” Mara said.

The girl nodded.

“You’re me,” she whispered.

And the girl looked up, smiled, and said:

“I’m what you’ll be if you keep going.”

Then the ground opened.

Mara fell through.

And when she woke, the name Mara Harper no longer tasted right in her mouth.

Benjamin grew ill not long after.

A sudden fever, no warning. His skin blistered with pale red patches that no doctor could identify. The clinic in town suggested he had contracted something from the livestock, but Mara knew better. This wasn’t illness. This was corrosion. A slow unraveling.

At night, he spoke in fevered riddles. Sometimes he called her by her name. Other times, he used words that were not English, not anything she could recognize. More than once, he murmured “Anzelim” in his sleep. And once, just before sunrise, he turned toward her with milky eyes and said:

“She’s in the water now.”

Mara left his bedside and walked to the well behind the barn—their real well, the human one, the one her grandfather had dug in the 1930s.

The water was black.

No reflection.

No sound.

Just the faint smell of rotting leaves.

She dropped a pebble into it.

There was no splash.

Only a whisper.

“One more.”

That night, Mara made a decision.

She returned to the creek with the coin she had found.

Not as a gift.

But as an offering.

She laid it in the center of the scorched earth and whispered her name.

Nothing happened at first.

Then the ground trembled. The trees bent further.

And the circle opened—not visibly, but audibly.

A sound like a slow breath taken in reverse passed through her, and she knew the threshold was thinning again. The Second Circle had not closed.

It had only waited.

Waited for a second name.

A second soul.

A second thread to cut.

The next morning, Mara awoke to silence—not the peaceful kind that comes before dawn, but the stillness of a house holding its breath. The sound of birds was gone. No wind creaked through the eaves. The cattle di
