THE TALE OF BALEN   I   In hawthorn-time the heart grows light, The world is sweet in sound and sight, Glad thoughts and birds take flower and flight, The heather kindles toward the light,    The whin is frankincense and flame. And be it for strife or be it for love The falcon quickens as the dove When earth is touched from heaven above    With joy that knows no name.  And glad in spirit and sad in soul With dream and doubt of days that roll As waves that race and find no goal Rode on by bush and brake and bole    A northern child of earth and sea. The pride of life before him lay Radiant: the heavens of night and day Shone less than shone before his way    His ways and days to be.  And all his life of blood and breath Sang out within him: time and death Were even as words a dreamer saith When sleep within him slackeneth,    And light and life and spring were one. The steed between his knees that sprang, The moors and woods that shone and sang, The hours where through the spring’s breath rang,    Seemed ageless as the sun.  But alway through the bounteous bloom That earth gives thanks if heaven illume His soul forefelt a shadow of doom, His heart foreknew a gloomier gloom    Than closes all men’s equal ways, Albeit the spirit of life’s light spring With pride of heart upheld him, king And lord of hours like snakes that sting    And nights that darken days.  And as the strong spring round him grew Stronger, and all blithe winds that blew Blither, and flowers that flowered anew More glad of sun and air and dew,    The shadow lightened on his soul And brightened into death and died Like winter, as the bloom waxed wide From woodside on to riverside    And southward goal to goal.  Along the wandering ways of Tyne, By beech and birch and thorn that shine And laugh when life’s requickening wine Makes night and noon and dawn divine    And stirs in all the veins of spring, And past the brightening banks of Tees, He rode as one that breathes and sees A sun more blithe, a merrier breeze,    A life that hails him king.  And down the softening south that knows No more how glad the heather glows, Nor how, when winter’s clarion blows Across the bright Northumbrian snows,    Sea-mists from east and westward meet, Past Avon senseless yet of song And Thames that bore but swans in throng He rode elate in heart and strong    In trust of days as sweet.  So came he through to Camelot, Glad, though for shame his heart waxed hot, For hope within it withered not To see the shaft it dreamed of shot    Fair toward the glimmering goal of fame, And all King Arthur’s knightliest there Approved him knightly, swift to dare And keen to bid their records bear    Sir Balen’s northern name.  Sir Balen of Northumberland Gat grace before the king to stand High as his heart was, and his hand Wrought honour toward the strange north strand    That sent him south so goodly a knight. And envy, sick with sense of sin, Began as poisonous herbs begin To work in base men’s blood, akin    To men’s of nobler might.  And even so fell it that his doom, For all his bright life’s kindling bloom And light that took no thought for gloom, Fell as a breath from the opening tomb    Full on him ere he wist or thought. For once a churl of royal seed, King Arthur’s kinsman, faint in deed And loud in word that knew not heed,    Spake shame where shame was nought.  “What doth one here in Camelot Whose birth was northward?  Wot we not As all his brethren borderers wot How blind of heart, how keen and hot,    The wild north lives and hates the south? Men of the narrowing march that knows Nought save the strength of storms and snows, What would these carles where knighthood blows    A trump of kinglike mouth?”  Swift from his place leapt Balen, smote The liar across his face, and wrote His wrath in blood upon the bloat Brute cheek that challenged shame for note    How vile a king-born knave might be. Forth sprang their swords, and Balen slew The knave ere well one witness knew Of all that round them stood or drew    What sight was there to see.  Then spake the great king’s wrathful will A doom for six dark months to fill Wherein close prison held him, still And steadfast-souled for good or ill.    But when those weary days lay dead His lordliest knights and barons spake Before the king for Balen’s sake Good speech and wise, of force to break    The bonds that bowed his head.    II   In linden-time the heart is high For pride of summer passing by With lordly laughter in her eye; A heavy splendour in the sky    Uplifts and bows it down again. The spring had waned from wood and wold Since Balen left his prison hold And lowlier-hearted than of old    Beheld it wax and wane.  Though humble heart and poor array Kept not from spirit and sense away Their noble nature, nor could slay The pride they bade but pause and stay    Till time should bring its trust to flower, Yet even for noble shame’s sake, born Of hope that smiled on hate and scorn, He held him still as earth ere morn    Ring forth her rapturous hour.  But even as earth when dawn takes flight And beats her wings of dewy light Full in the faltering face of night, His soul awoke to claim by right    The life and death of deed and doom, When once before the king there came A maiden clad with grief and shame And anguish burning her like flame    That feeds on flowers in bloom.  Beneath a royal mantle, fair With goodly work of lustrous vair, Girt fast against her side she bare A sword whose weight bade all men there    Quail to behold her face again. Save of a passing perfect knight Not great alone in force and fight It might not be for any might    Drawn forth, and end her pain.  So said she: then King Arthur spake: “Albeit indeed I dare not take Such praise on me, for knighthood’s sake And love of ladies will I make    Assay if better none may be.” By girdle and by sheath he caught The sheathed and girded sword, and wrought With strength whose force availed him nought    To save and set her free.  Again she spake: “No need to set The might that man has matched not yet Against it: he whose hand shall get Grace to release the bonds that fret    My bosom and my girdlestead With little strain of strength or strife Shall bring me as from death to life And win to sister or to wife    Fame that outlives men dead.”  Then bade the king his knights assay This mystery that before him lay And mocked his might of manhood.  “Nay,” Quoth she, “the man that takes away    This burden laid on me must be A knight of record clean and fair As sunlight and the flowerful air, By sire and mother born to bear    A name to shame not me.”  Then forth strode Launcelot, and laid The mighty-moulded hand that made Strong knights reel back like birds affrayed By storm that smote them as they strayed    Against the hilt that yielded not. Then Tristram, bright and sad and kind As one that bore in noble mind Love that made light as darkness blind,    Fared even as Launcelot.  Then Lamoracke, with hardier cheer, As one that held all hope and fear Wherethrough the spirit of man may steer In life and death less dark or dear,    Laid hand thereon, and fared as they. With half a smile his hand he drew Back from the spell-bound thing, and threw With half a glance his heart anew    Toward no such blameless may.  Between Iseult and Guenevere Sat one of name as high to hear, But darklier doomed than they whose cheer Foreshowed not yet the deadlier year    That bids the queenliest head bow down, The queen Morgause of Orkney: they With scarce a flash of the eye could say The very word of dawn, when day    Gives earth and heaven their crown.  But bright and dark as night or noon And lowering as a storm-flushed moon When clouds and thwarting winds distune The music of the midnight, soon    To die from darkening star to star And leave a silence in the skies That yearns till dawn find voice and rise, Shone strange as fate Morgause, with eyes    That dwelt on days afar.  A glance that shot on Lamoracke As from a storm-cloud bright and black. Fire swift and blind as death’s own track Turned fleet as flame on Arthur back    From him whose hand forsook the hilt: And one in blood and one in sin Their hearts caught fire of pain within And knew no goal for them to win    But death that guerdons guilt.  Then Gawain, sweet of soul and gay As April ere he dreams of May, Strove, and prevailed not: then Sir Kay, The snake-souled envier, vile as they    That fawn and foam and lurk and lie, Sire of the bastard band whose brood Was alway found at servile feud With honour, faint and false and lewd,    Scarce grasped and put it by.  Then wept for woe the damsel bound With iron and with anguish round, That none to help her grief was found Or loose the inextricably inwound    Grim curse that girt her life with grief And made a burden of her breath, Harsh as the bitterness of death. Then spake the king as one that saith    Words bitterer even than brief.  “Methought the wide round world could bring Before the face of queen or king No knights more fit for fame to sing Than fill this full Round Table’s ring    With honour higher than pride of place: But now my heart is wrung to know, Damsel, that none whom fame can show Finds grace to heal or help thy woe:    God gives them not the grace.”  Then from the lowliest place thereby, With heart-enkindled cheek and eye Most like the star and kindling sky That say the sundawn’s hour is high    When rapture trembles through the sea, Strode Balen in his poor array Forth, and took heart of grace to pray The damsel suffer even him to assay    His power to set her free.  Nay, how should he avail, she said, Averse with scorn-averted head, Where these availed not? none had sped Of all these mightier men that led    The lists wherein he might not ride, And how should less men speed?  But he, With lordlier pride of courtesy, Put forth his hand and set her free    From pain and humbled pride.  But on the sword he gazed elate With hope set higher than fear or fate, Or doubt of darkling days in wait; And when her thankful praise waxed great    And craved of him the sword again, He would not give it.  “Nay, for mine It is till force may make it thine.” A smile that shone as death may shine    Spake toward him bale and bane.  Strange lightning flickered from her eyes. “Gentle and good in knightliest guise And meet for quest of strange emprise Thou hast here approved thee: yet not wise    To keep the sword from me, I wis. For with it thou shalt surely slay Of all that look upon the day The man best loved of thee, and lay    Thine own life down for his.”  “What chance God sends, that chance I take,” He said.  Then soft and still she spake; “I would but for thine only sake Have back the sword of thee, and break    The links of doom that bind thee round. But seeing thou wilt not have it so, My heart for thine is wrung with woe.” “God’s will,” quoth he, “it is, we know,    Wherewith our lives are bound.”  “Repent it must thou soon,” she said, “Who wouldst not hear the rede I read For thine and not for my sake, sped In vain as waters heavenward shed    From springs that falter and depart Earthward.  God bids not thee believe Truth, and the web thy life must weave For even this sword to close and cleave    Hangs heavy round my heart.”  So passed she mourning forth.  But he, With heart of springing hope set free As birds that breast and brave the sea, Bade horse and arms and armour be    Made straightway ready toward the fray. Nor even might Arthur’s royal prayer Withhold him, but with frank and fair Thanksgiving and leave-taking there    He turned him thence away.    III   As the east wind, when the morning’s breast Gleams like a bird’s that leaves the nest, A fledgeling halcyon’s bound on quest, Drives wave on wave on wave to west    Till all the sea be life and light, So time’s mute breath, that brings to bloom All flowers that strew the dead spring’s tomb, Drives day on day on day to doom    Till all man’s day be night.  Brief as the breaking of a wave That hurls on man his thunderous grave Ere fear find breath to cry or crave Life that no chance may spare or save,    The light of joy and glory shone Even as in dreams where death seems dead Round Balen’s hope-exalted head, Shone, passed, and lightened as it fled    The shadow of doom thereon.  For as he bound him thence to fare, Before the stately presence there A lady like a windflower fair, Girt on with raiment strange and rare    That rippled whispering round her, came. Her clear cold eyes, all glassy grey, Seemed lit not with the light of day But touched with gleams that waned away    Of quelled and fading flame.  Before the king she bowed and spake: “King, for thine old faith’s plighted sake To me the lady of the lake, I come in trust of thee to take    The guerdon of the gift I gave, Thy sword Excalibur.”  And he Made answer: “Be it whate’er it be, If mine to give, I give it thee,    Nor need is thine to crave.”  As when a gleam of wicked light Turns half a low-lying water bright That moans beneath the shivering night With sense of evil sound and sight    And whispering witchcraft’s bated breath, Her wan face quickened as she said: “This knight that won the sword—his head I crave or hers that brought it.  Dead,    Let these be one in death.”  “Not with mine honour this may be; Ask all save this thou wilt,” quoth he, “And have thy full desire.”  But she Made answer: “Nought will I of thee,    Nought if not this.”  Then Balen turned, And saw the sorceress hard beside By whose fell craft his mother died: Three years he had sought her, and here espied    His heart against her yearned.  “Ill be thou met,” he said, “whose ire Would slake with blood thy soul’s desire: By thee my mother died in fire; Die thou by me a death less dire.”    Sharp flashed his sword forth, fleet as flame, And shore away her sorcerous head. “Alas for shame,” the high king said, “That one found once my friend lies dead;    Alas for all our shame!  “Thou shouldst have here forborne her; yea, Were all the wrongs that bid men slay Thine, heaped too high for wrath to weigh, Not here before my face today    Was thine the right to wreak thy wrong.” Still stood he then as one that found His rose of hope by storm discrowned, And all the joy that girt him round    Brief as a broken song.  Yet ere he passed he turned and spake: “King, only for thy nobler sake Than aught of power man’s power may take Or pride of place that pride may break    I bid the lordlier man in thee, That lives within the king, give ear. This justice done before thee here On one that hell’s own heart holds dear,    Needs might not this but be.  “Albeit, for all that pride would prove, My heart be wrung to lose thy love, It yet repents me not hereof: So many an eagle and many a dove,    So many a knight, so many a may, This water-snake of poisonous tongue To death by words and wiles hath stung, That her their slayer, from hell’s lake sprung,    I did not ill to slay.”  “Yea,” said the king, “too high of heart To stand before a king thou art; Yet irks it me to bid thee part And take thy penance for thy part,    That God may put upon thy pride.” Then Balen took the severed head And toward his hostry turned and sped As one that knew not quick from dead    Nor good from evil tide.  He bade his squire before him stand And take that sanguine spoil in hand And bear it far by shore and strand Till all in glad Northumberland    That loved him, seeing it, all might know His deadliest foe was dead, and hear How free from prison as from fear He dwelt in trust of the answering year    To bring him weal for woe.  “And tell them, now I take my way To meet in battle, if I may, King Ryons of North Wales, and slay That king of kernes whose fiery sway    Doth all the marches dire despite That serve King Arthur: so shall he Again be gracious lord to me, And I that leave thee meet with thee    Once more in Arthur’s sight.”  So spake he ere they parted, nor Took shame or fear to counsellor, As one whom none laid ambush for; And wist not how Sir Launceor,    The wild king’s son of Ireland, hot And high in wrath to know that one Stood higher in fame before the sun, Even Balen, since the sword was won,    Drew nigh from Camelot.  For thence, in heat of hate and pride, As one that man might bid not bide, He craved the high king’s grace to ride On quest of Balen far and wide    And wreak the wrong his wrath had wrought. “Yea,” Arthur said, “for such despite Was done me never in my sight As this thine hand shall now requite    If trust avail us aught.”  But ere he passed, in eager mood To feed his hate with bitter food, Before the king’s face Merlin stood And heard his tale of ill and good,    Of Balen, and the sword achieved, And whence it smote as heaven’s red ire That direful dame of doom as dire; And how the king’s wrath turned to fire    The grief wherewith he grieved.  And darkening as he gave it ear, The still face of the sacred seer Waxed wan with wrath and not with fear, And ever changed its cloudier cheer    Till all his face was very night. “This damosel that brought the sword,” He said, “before the king my lord, And all these knights about his board,    Hath done them all despite.  “The falsest damosel she is That works men ill on earth, I wis, And all her mind is toward but this, To kill as with a lying kiss    Truth, and the life of noble trust. A brother hath she,—see but now The flame of shame that brands her brow!— A true man, pure as faith’s own vow,    Whose honour knows not rust.  “This good knight found within her bower A felon and her paramour, And slew him in his shameful hour, As right gave might and righteous power    To hands that wreaked so foul a wrong. Then, for the hate her heart put on, She sought by ways where death had gone The lady Lyle of Avalon,    Whose crafts are strange and strong.  “The sorceress, one with her in thought, Gave her that sword of magic, wrought By charms whereof sweet heaven sees nought, That hither girt on her she brought    To be by doom her brother’s bane. And grief it is to think how he That won it, being of heart so free And perfect found in chivalry,    Shall by that sword lie slain.  Great pity it is and strange despite That one whose eyes are stars to light Honour, and shine as heaven’s own height, Should perish, being the goodliest knight    That even the all-glorious north has borne. Nor shall my lord the king behold A lordlier friend of mightier mould Than Balen, though his tale be told    Ere noon fulfil his morn.”    IV   As morning hears before it run The music of the mounting sun, And laughs to watch his trophies won From darkness, and her hosts undone,    And all the night become a breath, Nor dreams that fear should hear and flee The summer menace of the sea, So hears our hope what life may be,    And knows it not for death.  Each day that slays its hours and dies Weeps, laughs, and lightens on our eyes, And sees and hears not: smiles and sighs As flowers ephemeral fall and rise    About its birth, about its way, And pass as love and sorrow pass, As shadows flashing down a glass, As dew-flowers blowing in flowerless grass,    As hope from yesterday.  The blossom of the sunny dew That now the stronger sun strikes through Fades off the blade whereon it blew No fleetlier than the flowers that grew    On hope’s green stem in life’s fierce light. Nor might the glory soon to sit Awhile on Balen’s crest alit Outshine the shadow of doom on it    Or stay death’s wings from flight.  Dawn on a golden moorland side By holt and heath saw Balen ride And Launceor after, pricked with pride And stung with spurring envy: wide    And far he had ridden athwart strange lands And sought amiss the man he found And cried on, till the stormy sound Rang as a rallying trumpet round    That fires men’s hearts and hands.  Abide he bade him: nor was need To bid when Balen wheeled his steed Fiercely, less fain by word than deed To bid his envier evil speed,    And cried, “What wilt thou with me?”  Loud Rang Launceor’s vehement answer: “Knight, To avenge on thee the dire despite Thou hast done us all in Arthur’s sight    I stand toward Arthur vowed.”  “Ay?” Balen said: “albeit I see I needs must deal in strife with thee, Light is the wyte thou layest on me; For her I slew and sinned not, she    Was dire in all men’s eyes as death, Or none were lother found than I By me to bid a woman die: As lief were loyal men to lie,    Or scorn what honour saith.”  As the arched wave’s weight against the reef Hurls, and is hurled back like a leaf Storm-shrivelled, and its rage of grief Speaks all the loud broad sea in brief,    And quells the hearkening hearts of men, Or as the crash of overfalls Down under blue smooth water brawls Like jarring steel on ruining walls,    So rang their meeting then.  As wave on wave shocks, and confounds The bounding bulk whereon it bounds And breaks and shattering seaward sounds As crying of the old sea’s wolves and hounds    That moan and ravin and rage and wail, So steed on steed encountering sheer Shocked, and the strength of Launceor’s spear Shivered on Balen’s shield, and fear    Bade hope within him quail.  But Balen’s spear through Launceor’s shield Clove as a ploughshare cleaves the field And pierced the hauberk triple-steeled, That horse with horseman stricken reeled,    And as a storm-breached rock falls, fell. And Balen turned his horse again And wist not yet his foe lay slain, And saw him dead that sought his bane    And wrought and fared not well.  Suddenly, while he gazed and stood, And mused in many-minded mood If life or death were evil or good, Forth of a covert of a wood    That skirted half the moorland lea Fast rode a maiden flower-like white Full toward that fair wild place of fight, Anhungered of the woful sight    God gave her there to see.  And seeing the man there fallen and dead, She cried against the sun that shed Light on the living world, and said, “O Balen, slayer whose hand is red,    Two bodies and one heart thou hast slain, Two hearts within one body: aye, Two souls thou hast lost; by thee they die, Cast out of sight of earth and sky    And all that made them fain.”  And from the dead his sword she caught, And fell in trance that wist of nought, Swooning: but softly Balen sought To win from her the sword she thought    To die on, dying by Launceor’s side. Again her wakening wail outbroke As wildly, sword in hand, she woke And struck one swift and bitter stroke    That healed her, and she died.  And sorrowing for their strange love’s sake Rode Balen forth by lawn and lake, By moor and moss and briar and brake, And in his heart their sorrow spake    Whose lips were dumb as death, and said Mute words of presage blind and vain As rain-stars blurred and marred by rain To wanderers on a moonless main    Where night and day seem dead.  Then toward a sunbright wildwood side He looked and saw beneath it ride A knight whose arms afar espied By note of name and proof of pride    Bare witness of his brother born, His brother Balan, hard at hand, Twin flower of bright Northumberland, Twin sea-bird of their loud sea-strand,    Twin song-bird of their morn.  Ah then from Balen passed away All dread of night, all doubt of day, All care what life or death might say, All thought of all worse months than May:    Only the might of joy in love Brake forth within him as a fire, And deep delight in deep desire Of far-flown days whose full-souled quire    Rang round from the air above.  From choral earth and quiring air Rang memories winged like songs that bear Sweet gifts for spirit and sense to share: For no man’s life knows love more fair    And fruitful of memorial things Than this the deep dear love that breaks With sense of life on life, and makes The sundawn sunnier as it wakes    Where morning round it rings.  “O brother, O my brother!” cried Each upon each, and cast aside Their helms unbraced that might not hide From sight of memory single-eyed    The likeness graven of face and face, And kissed and wept upon each other For joy and pity of either brother, And love engrafted by sire and mother,    God’s natural gift of grace.  And each with each took counsel meet For comfort, making sorrow sweet, And grief a goodly thing to greet: And word from word leapt light and fleet    Till all the venturous tale was told, And how in Balen’s hope it lay To meet the wild Welsh king and slay, And win from Arthur back for pay    The grace he gave of old.  “And thither will not thou with me And win as great a grace for thee?” “That will I well,” quoth Balan: “we Will cleave together, bound and free,    As brethren should, being twain and one.” But ere they parted thence there came A creature withered as with flame, A dwarf mismade in nature’s shame,    Between them and the sun.  And riding fleet as fire may glide He found the dead lie side by side, And wailed and rent his hair and cried, “Who hath done this deed?”  And Balen eyed    The strange thing loathfully, and said, “The knight I slew, who found him fain And keen to slay me: seeing him slain, The maid I sought to save in vain,    Self-stricken, here lies dead.  “Sore grief was mine to see her die, And for her true faith’s sake shall I Love, and with love of heart more high, All women better till I die.”    “Alas,” the dwarf said, “ill for thee In evil hour this deed was done: For now the quest shall be begun Against thee, from the dawning sun    Even to the sunset sea.  “From shore to mountain, dawn to night, The kinsfolk of this great dead knight Will chase thee to thy death.”  A light Of swift blithe scorn flashed answer bright    As fire from Balen’s eye.  “For that, Small fear shall fret my heart,” quoth he: “But that my lord the king should be For this dead man’s sake wroth with me,    Weep might it well thereat.”  Then murmuring passed the dwarf away, And toward the knights in fair array Came riding eastward up the way From where the flower-soft lowlands lay    A king whose name the sweet south-west Held high in honour, and the land That bowed beneath his gentle hand Wore on its wild bright northern strand    Tintagel for a crest.  And Balen hailed with homage due King Mark of Cornwall, when he knew The pennon that before him flew: And for those lovers dead and true    The king made moan to hear their doom; And for their sorrow’s sake he sware To seek in all the marches there The church that man might find most fair    And build therein their tomb.    V   As thought from thought takes wing and flies, As month on month with sunlit eyes Tramples and triumphs in its rise, As wave smites wave to death and dies,    So chance on hurtling chance like steel Strikes, flashes, and is quenched, ere fear Can whisper hope, or hope can hear, If sorrow or joy be far or near    For time to hurt or heal.  Swift as a shadow and strange as light That cleaves in twain the shadow of night Before the wide-winged word takes flight That thunder speaks to depth and height    And quells the quiet hour with sound, There came before King Mark and stood Between the moorside and the wood The man whose word God’s will made good,    Nor guile was in it found.  And Merlin said to Balen: “Lo, Thou hast wrought thyself a grievous woe To let this lady die, and know Thou mightst have stayed her deadly blow.”    And Balen answered him and said, “Nay, by my truth to faith, not I, So fiercely fain she was to die; Ere well her sword had flashed on high,    Self-slain she lay there dead.”  Again and sadly Merlin spake: “My heart is wrung for this deed’s sake, To know thee therefore doomed to take Upon thine hand a curse, and make    Three kingdoms pine through twelve years’ change, In want and woe: for thou shalt smite The man most noble and truest knight That looks upon the live world’s light    A dolorous stroke and strange.  “And not till years shall round their goal May this man’s wound thou hast given be whole.” And Balen, stricken through the soul By dark-winged words of doom and dole,    Made answer: “If I wist it were No lie but sooth thou sayest of me, Then even to make a liar of thee Would I too slay myself, and see    How death bids dead men fare.”  And Merlin took his leave and passed And was not: and the shadow as fast Went with him that his word had cast, Too fleet for thought thereof to last:    And there those brethren bade King Mark Farewell: but fain would Mark have known The strong knight’s name who had overthrown The pride of Launceor, when it shone    Bright as it now lay dark.  And Balan for his brother spake, Saying: “Sir, albeit him list not break The seal of secret time, nor shake Night off him ere his morning wake,    By these two swords he is girt withal May men that praise him, knights and lords, Call him the knight that bears two swords, And all the praise his fame accords    Make answer when they call.”  So parted they toward eventide; And tender twilight, heavy-eyed, Saw deep down glimmering woodlands ride Balen and Balan side by side,    Till where the leaves grew dense and dim Again they spied from far draw near The presence of the sacred seer, But so disguised and strange of cheer    That seeing they knew not him.  “Now whither ride ye,” Merlin said, “Through shadows that the sun strikes red, Ere night be born or day be dead?” But they, for doubt half touched with dread,    Would say not where their goal might lie. “And thou,” said Balen, “what art thou, To walk with shrouded eye and brow?” He said: “Me lists not show thee now    By name what man am I.”  “Ill seen is this of thee,” said they, “That thou art true in word and way Nor fain to fear the face of day, Who wilt not as a true man say    The name it shames not him to bear.” He answered: “Be it or be it not so, Yet why ye ride this way I know, To meet King Ryons as a foe,    And how your hope shall fare.  “Well, if ye hearken toward my rede, Ill, if ye hear not, shall ye speed.” “Ah, now,” they cried, “thou art ours at need What Merlin saith we are fain to heed.”    “Great worship shall ye win,” said he, “And look that ye do knightly now, For great shall be your need, I trow.” And Balen smiled: “By knighthood’s vow,    The best we may will we.”  Then Merlin bade them turn and take Rest, for their good steeds’ weary sake, Between the highway and the brake, Till starry midnight bade them wake:    Then “Rise,” he said, “the king is nigh, Who hath stolen from all his host away With threescore horse in armed array, The goodliest knights that bear his sway    And hold his kingdom high.  “And twenty ride of them before To bear his errand, ere the door Turn of the night, sealed fast no more, And sundawn bid the stars wax hoar;    For by the starshine of to-night He seeks a leman where she waits His coming, dark and swift as fate’s, And hearkens toward the unopening gates    That yield not him to sight.  Then through the glimmering gloom around A shadowy sense of light and sound Made, ere the proof thereof were found, The brave blithe hearts within them bound,    And “Where,” quoth Balen, “rides the king?” But softer spake the seer: “Abide, Till hither toward your spears he ride, Where all the narrowing woodland side    Grows dense with boughs that cling.”  There in that straitening way they met The wild Welsh host against them set, And smote their strong king down, ere yet His hurrying horde of spears might get    Fierce vantage of them.  Then the fight Grew great and joyous as it grew, For left and right those brethren slew, Till all the lawn waxed red with dew    More deep than dews of night.  And ere the full fierce tale was read Full forty lay before them dead, And fast the hurtling remnant fled And wist not whither fear had led:    And toward the king they went again, And would have slain him: but he bowed Before them, crying in fear aloud For grace they gave him, seeing the proud    Wild king brought lowest of men.  And ere the wildwood leaves were stirred With song or wing of wakening bird, In Camelot was Merlin’s word With joy in joyous wonder heard    That told of Arthur’s bitterest foe Diskingdomed and discomfited. “By whom?” the high king smiled and said. He answered: “Ere the dawn wax red,    To-morrow bids you know.  “Two knights whose heart and hope are one And fain to win your grace have done This work whereby if grace be won Their hearts shall hail the enkindling sun    With joy more keen and deep than day.” And ere the sundawn drank the dew Those brethren with their prisoner drew To the outer guard they gave him to    And passed again away.  And Arthur came as toward his guest To greet his foe, and bade him rest As one returned from nobler quest And welcome from the stormbright west,    But by what chance he fain would hear. “The chance was hard and strange, sir king,” Quoth Ryons, bowed in thanksgiving. “Who won you?” Arthur said: “the thing    Is worth a warrior’s ear.”  The wild king flushed with pride and shame, Answering: “I know not either name Of those that there against us came And withered all our strength like flame:    The knight that bears two swords is one, And one his brother: not on earth May men meet men of knightlier worth Nor mightier born of mortal birth    That hail the sovereign sun.”  And Arthur said: “I know them not But much am I for this, God wet, Beholden to them: Launcelot Nor Tristram, when the war waxed hot    Along the marches east and west, Wrought ever nobler work than this.” “Ah,” Merlin said, “sore pity it is And strange mischance of doom, I wis,    That death should mar their quest.  “Balen, the perfect knight that won The sword whose name is malison, And made his deed his doom, is one: Nor hath his brother Balan done    Less royal service: not on earth Lives there a nobler knight, more strong Of soul to win men’s praise in song, Albeit the light abide not long    That lightened round his birth.  “Yea, and of all sad things I know The heaviest and the highest in woe Is this, the doom whose date brings low Too soon in timeless overthrow    A head so high, a hope so sure. The greatest moan for any knight That ever won fair fame in fight Shall be for Balen, seeing his might    Must now not long endure.”  “Alas,” King Arthur said, “he hath shown Such love to me-ward that the moan Made of him should be mine alone Above all other, knowing it known    I have ill deserved it of him.”  “Nay,” Said Merlin, “he shall do for you Much more, when time shall be anew, Than time hath given him chance to do    Or hope may think to say.  “But now must be your powers purveyed To meet, ere noon of morn be made To-morrow, all the host arrayed Of this wild foe’s wild brother, laid    Around against you: see to it well, For now I part from you.”  And soon, When sundawn slew the withering moon, Two hosts were met to win the boon    Whose tale is death’s to tell.  A lordly tale of knights and lords For death to tell by count of swords When war’s wild harp in all its chords Rang royal triumph, and the hordes    Of hurtling foemen rocked and reeled As waves wind-thwarted on the sea, Was told of all that there might be, Till scarce might battle hear or see    The fortune of the field.  And many a knight won fame that day When even the serpent soul of Kay Was kindled toward the fiery play As might a lion’s be for prey,    And won him fame that might not die With passing of his rancorous breath But clung about his life and death As fire that speaks in cloud, and saith    What strong men hear and fly.  And glorious works were Arthur’s there, That lit the battle-darkened air: But when they saw before them fare Like stars of storm the knight that bare    Two swords about him girt for fray, Balen, and Balan with him, then Strong wonder smote the souls of men If heaven’s own host or hell’s deep den    Had sent them forth to slay.  So keen they rode across the fight, So sharp they smote to left and right, And made of hurtling darkness light With lightning of their swords, till flight    And fear before them flew like flame, That Arthur’s self had never known, He said, since first his blast was blown, Such lords of war as these alone    That whence he knew not came.  But while the fire of war waxed hot The wild king hearkened, hearing not, Through storm of spears and arrow-shot, For succour toward him from King Lot    And all his host of sea-born men, Strong as the strong storm-baffling bird Whose cry round Orkney’s headlands heard Is as the sea’s own sovereign word    That mocks our mortal ken.  For Merlin’s craft of prophecy, Who wist that one of twain must die, Put might in him to say thereby Which head should lose its crown, and lie    Stricken, though loth he were to know That either life should wane and fail; Yet most might Arthur’s love avail, And still with subtly tempered tale    His wile held fast the foe.  With woven words of magic might Wherein the subtle shadow and light Changed hope and fear till fear took flight, He stayed King Lot’s fierce lust of fight    Till all the wild Welsh war was driven As foam before the wind that wakes With the all-awakening sun, and breaks Strong ships that rue the mirth it makes    When grace to slay is given.  And ever hotter lit and higher, As fire that meets encountering fire, Waxed in King Lot his keen desire To bid revenge within him tire    On Arthur’s ravaged fame and life: Across the waves of war between Floated and flashed, unseen and seen, The lustrous likeness of the queen    Whom shame had sealed his wife.  But when the woful word was brought That while he tarried, doubting nought, The hope was lost whose goal he sought And all the fight he yearned for fought,    His heart was rent for grief and shame, And half his hope was set on flight Till word was given him of a knight Who said: “They are weary and worn with fight,    And we more fresh than flame.”  And bright and dark as night and day Ere either find the unopening way Clear, and forego the unaltering sway, The sad king’s face shone, frowning: “Yea,    I would that every knight of mine Would do his part as I shall do,” He said, “till death or life anew Shall judge between us as is due    With wiser doom than thine.”  Then thundered all the awakening field With crash of hosts that clashed and reeled, Banner to banner, shield to shield, And spear to splintering spear-shaft, steeled    As heart against high heart of man, As hope against high hope of knight To pluck the crest and crown of fight From war’s clenched hand by storm’s wild light,    For blessing given or ban.  All hearts of hearkening men that heard The ban twin-born with blessing, stirred Like springtide waters, knew the word Whereby the steeds of storm are spurred    With ravenous rapture to destroy, And laughed for love of battle, pierced With passion of tempestuous thirst And hungering hope to assuage it first    With draughts of stormy joy.  But sheer ahead of the iron tide That rocked and roared from side to side Rode as the lightning’s lord might ride King Lot, whose heart was set to abide    All peril of the raging hour, And all his host of warriors born Where lands by warring seas are worn Was only by his hands upborne    Who gave them pride and power.  But as the sea’s hand smites the shore And shatters all the strengths that bore The ravage earth may bear no more, So smote the hand of Pellinore    Charging, a knight of Arthur’s chief, And clove his strong steed’s neck in twain, And smote him sheer through brow and brain, Falling: and there King Lot lay slain,    And knew not wrath or grief.  And all the host of Orkney fled, And many a mother’s son lay dead: But when they raised the stricken head Whence pride and power and shame were fled    And rage and anguish now cast out, And bore it toward a kingly tomb, The wife whose love had wrought his doom Came thither, fair as morning’s bloom    And dark as twilight’s doubt.  And there her four strong sons and his, Gawain and Gareth, Gaherys And Agravain, whose sword’s sharp kiss With sound of hell’s own serpent’s hiss    Should one day turn her life to death, Stood mourning with her: but by these Seeing Mordred as a seer that sees, Anguish of terror bent her knees    And caught her shuddering breath.  The splendour of her sovereign eyes Flashed darkness deeper than the skies Feel or fear when the sunset dies On his that felt as midnight rise    Their doom upon them, there undone By faith in fear ere thought could yield A shadowy sense of days revealed, The ravin of the final field,    The terror of their son.  For Arthur’s, as they caught the light That sought and durst not seek his sight, Darkened, and all his spirit’s might Withered within him even as night    Withers when sunrise thrills the sea. But Mordred’s lightened as with fire That smote his mother and his sire With darkling doom and deep desire    That bade its darkness be.  And heavier on their hearts the weight Sank of the fear that brings forth fate, The bitter doubt whose womb is great With all the grief and love and hate    That turn to fire men’s days on earth. And glorious was the funeral made, And dark the deepening dread that swayed Their darkening souls whose light grew shade    With sense of death in birth.    VI   In autumn, when the wind and sea Rejoice to live and laugh to be, And scarce the blast that curbs the tree And bids before it quail and flee    The fiery foliage, where its brand Is radiant as the seal of spring, Sounds less delight, and waves a wing Less lustrous, life’s loud thanksgiving    Puts life in sea and land.  High hope in Balen’s heart alight Laughed, as from all that clamorous fight He passed and sought not Arthur’s sight, Who fain had found his kingliest knight    And made amend for Balen’s wrong. But Merlin gave his soul to see Fate, rising as a shoreward sea, And all the sorrow that should be    Ere hope or fear thought long.  “O where are they whose hands upbore My battle,” Arthur said, “before The wild Welsh host’s wide rage and roar? Balen and Balan, Pellinore,    Where are they?”  Merlin answered him: “Balen shall be not long away From sight of you, but night nor day Shall bring his brother back to say    If life burn bright or dim.”  “Now, by my faith,” said Arthur then, “Two marvellous knights are they, whose ken Toward battle makes the twain as ten, And Balen most of all born men    Passeth of prowess all I know Or ever found or sought to see: Would God he would abide with me, To face the times foretold of thee    And all the latter woe.”  For there had Merlin shown the king The doom that songs unborn should sing, The gifts that time should rise and bring Of blithe and bitter days to spring    As weeds and flowers against the sun. And on the king for fear’s sake fell Sickness, and sorrow deep as hell, Nor even might sleep bid fear farewell    If grace to sleep were won.  Down in a meadow green and still He bade the folk that wrought his will Pitch his pavilion, where the chill Soft night would let not rest fulfil    His heart wherein dark fears lay deep. And sharp against his hearing cast Came a sound as of horsehoofs fast Passing, that ere their sound were past    Aroused him as from sleep.  And forth he looked along the grass And saw before his portal pass A knight that wailed aloud, “Alas That life should find this dolorous pass    And find no shield from doom and dole!” And hearing all his moan, “Abide, Fair sir,” the king arose and cried, “And say what sorrow bids you ride    So sorrowful of soul.”  “My hurt may no man heal, God wot, And help of man may speed me not,” The sad knight said, “nor change my lot.” And toward the castle of Melyot    Whose towers arose a league away He passed forth sorrowing: and anon, Ere well the woful sight were gone, Came Balen down the meads that shone,    Strong, bright, and brave as day.  And seeing the king there stand, the knight Drew rein before his face to alight In reverence made for love’s sake bright With joy that set his face alight    As theirs who see, alive, above, The sovereign of their souls, whose name To them is even as love’s own flame To enkindle hope that heeds not fame    And knows no lord but love.  And Arthur smiled on him, and said, “Right welcome be thou: by my head, I would not wish me better sped. For even but now there came and fled    Before me like a cloud that flies A knight that made most heavy cheer, I know not wherefore; nor may fear Or pity give my heart to hear    Or lighten on mine eyes.  “But even for fear’s and pity’s sake Fain were I thou shouldst overtake And fetch again this knight that spake No word of answering grace to make    Reply to mine that hailed him: thou, By force or by goodwill, shalt bring His face before me.”  “Yea, my king,” Quoth Balen, “and a greater thing    Were less than is my vow.  “I would the task required and heard Were heavier than your sovereign word Hath laid on me:” and thence he spurred Elate at heart as youth, and stirred    With hope as blithe as fires a boy: And many a mile he rode, and found Far in a forest’s glimmering bound The man he sought afar around    And seeing took fire for joy.  And with him went a maiden, fair As flowers aflush with April air. And Balen bade him turn him there To tell the king what woes they were    That bowed him down so sore: and he Made woeful answer: “This should do Great scathe to me, with nought for you Of help that hope might hearken to    For boot that may not be.”  And Balen answered: “I were loth To fight as one perforce made wroth With one that owes by knighthood’s oath One love, one service, and one troth    With me to him whose gracious hand Holds fast the helm of knighthood here Whereby man’s hope and heart may steer: I pray you let not sorrow or fear    Against his bidding stand.”  The strange knight gazed on him, and spake: “Will you, for Arthur’s royal sake, Be warrant for me that I take No scathe from strife that man may make?    Then will I go with you.”  And he Made joyous answer: “Yea, for I Will be your warrant or will die.” And thence they rode with hearts as high    As men’s that search the sea.  And as by noon’s large light the twain Before the tented hall drew rein, Suddenly fell the strange knight, slain By one that came and went again    And none might see him; but his spear Clove through the body, swift as fire, The man whose doom, forefelt as dire, Had darkened all his life’s desire,    As one that death held dear.  And dying he turned his face and said, “Lo now thy warrant that my head Should fall not, following forth where led A knight whose pledge hath left me dead.    This darkling manslayer hath to name Garlon: take thou my goodlier steed, Seeing thine is less of strength and speed, And ride, if thou be knight indeed,    Even thither whence we came.  “And as the maiden’s fair behest Shall bid you follow on my quest, Follow: and when God’s will sees best, Revenge my death, and let me rest    As one that lived and died a knight, Unstained of shame alive or dead.” And Balen, wrung with sorrow, said, “That shall I do: my hand and head    I pledge to do you right.”  And thence with sorrowing heart and cheer He rode, in grief that cast out fear Lest death in darkness yet were near, And bore the truncheon of the spear    Wherewith the woful knight lay slain To her with whom he rode, and she Still bare it with her, fain to see What righteous doom of God’s might be    The darkling manslayer’s bane.  And down a dim deep woodland way They rode between the boughs asway With flickering winds whose flash and play Made sunlight sunnier where the day    Laughed, leapt, and fluttered like a bird Caught in a light loose leafy net That earth for amorous heaven had set To hold and see the sundawn yet    And hear what morning heard.  There in the sweet soft shifting light Across their passage rode a knight Flushed hot from hunting as from fight, And seeing the sorrow-stricken sight    Made question of them why they rode As mourners sick at heart and sad, When all alive about them bade Sweet earth for heaven’s sweet sake be glad    As heaven for earth’s love glowed.  “Me lists not tell you,” Balen said. The strange knight’s face grew keen and red “Now, might my hand but keep my head, Even here should one of twain lie dead    Were he no better armed than I.” And Balen spake with smiling speed, Where scorn and courtesy kept heed Of either: “That should little need:    Not here shall either die.”  And all the cause he told him through As one that feared not though he knew All: and the strange knight spake anew, Saying: “I will part no more from you    While life shall last me.”  So they went Where he might arm himself to ride, And rode across wild ways and wide To where against a churchyard side    A hermit’s harbour leant.  And there against them riding came Fleet as the lightning’s laugh and flame The invisible evil, even the same They sought and might not curse by name    As hell’s foul child on earth set free, And smote the strange knight through, and fled, And left the mourners by the de
