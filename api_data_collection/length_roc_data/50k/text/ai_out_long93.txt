Chapter One: The Swing

It started with the swing.

The sun beat down over the cracked blacktop of Meadowrun Elementary, gleaming off the silver chain links and the faded red seat that dangled, just slightly crooked, from the iron A-frame. The swing creaked with the wind, as if aware of its own status. The last swing. The only one not already occupied.

Jude got there first—or at least, he claimed he did.

“No way, I touched it first,” he said, his hand gripping one of the chains as if his life depended on it. He was wiry, all elbows and sharp knees, with a mop of black hair that looked like it hadn’t seen a comb in a week.

Toby, taller but softer, with freckles sprayed across his nose like confetti, stood his ground. “You saw me coming. I was running. It’s not fair if you just cut in like that.”

“Doesn’t matter,” Jude said. “You let go, I win.”

Toby narrowed his eyes. “You didn’t even want it until you saw I was going for it.”

Jude shrugged, shifting his weight and dragging the swing just enough to make it squeal. “Now I do. Too bad.”

A wind kicked up, bringing with it the scent of cut grass and sun-warmed mulch. From the other side of the playground, the jungle gym kids shouted something incomprehensible, their laughter sharp and distant like birds overhead.

“You’re such a jerk,” Toby muttered.

“And you’re too slow,” Jude replied, not unkindly.

Behind them, a teacher's whistle blew once—shrill and authoritative. Neither boy moved.

“You can’t just claim it every day,” Toby said. “That’s not how this works.”

“Oh yeah?” Jude turned, locking eyes with him. “Then let’s make it a game. Winner gets the swing for the rest of recess. Deal?”

“What kind of game?”

A pause. Jude’s grin was slow and calculated. “Race around the monkey bars, jump over the sandbox, touch the basketball pole, then back here. Fastest one wins.”

Toby considered. “You always win races.”

“Not always. You beat me last week.”

“Only ‘cause you tripped.”

“Still counts.” Jude held out his hand.

After a beat, Toby shook it.

They ran. And for a while, it was just the thrill of competition, legs pumping, hearts thudding, shoes pounding dirt and concrete. But it didn’t end with the race. That moment, in the heat of a June afternoon, ignited something that neither of them could see yet. Something that would stretch far beyond the swing set.

It would take them through summer, into secrets and shadows, into woods they weren’t supposed to enter, and down paths that adults never talked about.

But for now, it was just the swing.

Chapter Two: Rules and Rumors

Toby’s backyard was bigger than Jude’s, with a half-rotted treehouse they never used and a fence that leaned like it was tired of standing. That summer, they spent most afternoons there, lying on the grass, sipping melted cherry popsicles from plastic tubes, talking about the stuff no one else ever seemed to notice.

“Did you hear about the Vanishings?” Jude asked one day, midsummer.

Toby blinked. “What?”

“The Vanishings,” Jude said again, more slowly, as if that explained it. “My brother says three kids disappeared last year. Like, totally gone. No trace.”

“That’s just one of his stories.”

“No, seriously. One of them lived on Clover Lane. Two streets over.”

Toby hesitated. “If that’s true, why didn’t we hear about it before?”

Jude’s eyes lit up. “Because the adults keep it secret. They don’t want us to be scared. But I think—” he lowered his voice dramatically, “—I think it has something to do with the woods.”

The woods sat beyond the soccer field, a stretch of thick pines and moss-covered stones. Kids told stories about them all the time—about eyes in the dark, old ghosts, a creature called “Whistler” that no one had actually seen. It was the kind of place you dared someone else to go into but never went yourself.

“You’re just trying to freak me out,” Toby said.

Jude shrugged. “Maybe. But what if I’m right?”

That question sat between them for days.

And when Jude dared Toby to go with him—to sneak out late and go past the soccer field, into the edge of the trees—it was less about belief and more about curiosity. A dare. A test.

They met at midnight, flashlights in hand, pockets full of Oreos and walkie-talkies they barely knew how to use.

“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Toby whispered.

“Too late to back out now,” Jude grinned.

The woods were louder than expected. Not with animals—there were no birds, no frogs, not even the buzz of mosquitos. Just wind and leaves and the soft crack of twigs underfoot.

They didn’t get far the first night. Maybe twenty minutes in before Toby swore he saw something—someone—watching them from behind a fallen log. They ran all the way back to the edge of the field, breathless and pale.

But they didn’t stop going back.

Each night, they went a little deeper.

Chapter Three: The Door in the Hill

Three weeks later, they found the door.

It wasn’t like a normal door. It had no frame, no house or cabin around it. It was just… there. Embedded into the side of a mossy hill, a square of dark iron with a handle so rusted it looked like it would fall off at a touch.

“Holy crap,” Jude said, brushing dirt away. “This is like—like Narnia or something.”

Toby stared at it. “Should we open it?”

“I mean, obviously.”

But when they tried, the door didn’t budge. Locked. Or sealed.

For two nights, they returned with different tools—a crowbar, a wrench, even one of Jude’s mom’s metal knitting needles. Nothing worked. Then, on the third night, Toby touched it again and felt a vibration, low and humming, like the door had suddenly recognized him.

It clicked.

Jude looked at him. “You did that.”

“I didn’t—” Toby began, but then the door began to open.

Inside was darkness. Real darkness. The kind that didn’t just lack light but seemed to swallow it. Their flashlights flickered. The batteries weren’t dead, but the beams dimmed the moment they crossed the threshold.

Toby hesitated. “Maybe we shouldn’t.”

Jude had already stepped inside.

The air was cold. Too cold. The moment Toby followed, his breath fogged out in front of him.

The tunnel sloped down—dirt walls braced with rotting beams, ancient symbols scratched into the wood. The further they went, the more the walls shimmered, like something behind them was watching.

Then the whispering started.

It didn’t make sense—not at first. Just snatches of sound. A phrase here. A word. Names. Some they knew. Some they didn’t.

“Toby… Jude… come further…”

Chapter Four: The Broken Circle

What lay at the bottom of the tunnel was worse than either of them had imagined.

It was a chamber, round, with symbols drawn in salt or ash—lines intersecting, circles nested inside each other, broken by foot scuffs and years of disuse. In the center was something covered by a tarp.

Jude approached it.

“Don’t,” Toby said. “We should go.”

But Jude didn’t stop.

He pulled back the tarp and revealed a mirror. No frame. No backing. Just a sheet of glass—polished, but rippling slightly like water under glass.

In it, their reflections didn’t match.

Toby’s heart leapt. “That’s not us.”

Jude took a step back. In the mirror, his reflection smiled, though he did not.

“Okay, yeah, we’re leaving,” he said.

But behind them, the tunnel had changed. Where once there was a sloping dirt path, now stood a flat wall of stone.

No way back.

Jude won the race. Barely. By the time he slapped his hand against the steel pole at the edge of the basketball court and skidded to a stop beside the swing, he was panting, red-faced, his shirt stuck to his back. Toby came in seconds later, a step behind, and dropped to the dirt, breathing hard.

“That was cheating,” Toby managed between gasps.

“I won fair,” Jude said, not unkindly. “Don’t be a sore loser.”

Toby looked up at him, brushing gravel from his palms. “You cut the sandbox corner.”

“I jumped it. That was part of the rules.”

“You jumped into it,” Toby muttered, “then ran through the middle.”

Jude shrugged, already pulling himself into the swing. The chains groaned as his weight settled in. He kicked once, then again, gaining height with each pump of his legs. Toby watched him, still seated on the ground, and for a long moment neither spoke.

The bell rang in the distance, too far off to be urgent yet. The teachers gave them five-minute warnings before they corralled everyone back inside, and even then, they usually gave the stragglers some leeway. It was June. Everyone was checked out.

“You ever wonder why there’s only three swings?” Toby asked, finally standing and brushing dust from his shorts. “There’s like thirty kids here.”

Jude tilted his head, slowing the swing with his feet. “Budget cuts. Or some kid cracked their head open and their mom sued.”

“That’s grim.”

Jude grinned. “It’s what my brother says.”

“Your brother says a lot of stuff,” Toby replied, stepping beside the swing and giving it a push. Jude let it carry him.

“He’s not wrong. He told me last year about Mr. Sutton getting fired for sleeping in the janitor’s closet. No one believed him, but then Mr. Sutton was just gone one day.”

“Maybe he retired.”

“Retired with a bottle of scotch and a traffic cone pillow,” Jude said, and they both laughed.

That was the thing with Jude. Even when he lied—or exaggerated or made things up in that half-believing way of his—there was always some strange glint in his eye that made you want to believe him anyway. Not because it made sense, but because it made the world feel bigger.

Their laughter faded as the playground emptied out, one teacher at a time calling students into lines. Jude hopped off the swing, landing with a skid, and began walking with his hands in his pockets. Toby followed, not quite ready to let go of the summer smell in the air, the lingering warmth on the back of his neck.

“Next time,” Toby said, “I get the swing.”

Jude didn’t look back. “Only if you win.”

Toby grinned, already planning a route with fewer shortcuts.

That afternoon, the clouds rolled in fast—thick and silver, flashing with distant thunder. By the time they got out of school, the sky had darkened to the color of bruised plums, and the air smelled heavy, like metal and wet leaves. Toby’s mom picked them up in her station wagon and dropped Jude at his street corner before heading home.

“You coming over later?” Toby called out the window.

Jude nodded, shouldering his backpack. “After dinner!”

Back at Toby’s house, the air conditioner droned quietly in the living room. He dropped his bag, peeled off his shoes, and headed to the fridge for something cold. The house was still, his mom upstairs on a conference call, the radio playing soft jazz from the kitchen.

He poured himself a glass of lemonade and stood by the back window, watching the clouds gather over the line of trees behind their fence. They weren’t regular clouds. Not storm clouds. These moved too fast, like something was pushing them from behind. And for a moment—just a second—he thought he saw something flicker along the tree line.

Not lightning.

Something darker. Moving.

A blink, and it was gone.

He rubbed his eyes, then shook his head. Probably a trick of the light. He turned from the window, grabbed a packet of cookies, and went upstairs.

That night, Jude arrived late, soaked from the sudden downpour that hit just after sunset. His hair was plastered to his forehead, shirt clinging to his skinny frame. He grinned like it didn’t bother him.

“Dude, you look like you swam here.”

“Pretty much did. Can I borrow a shirt?”

Toby tossed him an old soccer tee, and they settled in his room, playing video games until the storm knocked the power out halfway through a match. They sat in the sudden silence, the room lit only by flashes of lightning from outside. The thunder followed seconds later.

“Your house ever lose power before?” Jude asked.

“Sometimes. Comes back on pretty quick.”

“This storm’s weird,” Jude said. “Like, too fast. Like it’s not even moving across, just… hovering.”

“Don’t say hovering like that,” Toby said. “You’re going to freak me out.”

Jude smirked, but his voice lowered. “Seriously. Something’s wrong with it. You ever hear of heat storms?”

“Yeah. But this isn’t that. This is…” Toby trailed off as another bolt of lightning cracked overhead, bright enough to silhouette the room.

Jude stood, walked to the window. His shoulders tensed.

“What?” Toby asked, coming up beside him.

“Look.”

Beyond the backyard, just past the broken treehouse and the overgrown rose bushes, the woods loomed. And in the brief flash of light, both of them saw it—something tall, too tall, moving behind the trees. It didn’t walk. It didn’t run. It seemed to glide.

Then the darkness returned.

Toby backed away from the window. “What was that?”

“I don’t know,” Jude said, but his face was pale. “It looked like it was watching.”

“Maybe it was a tree.”

“Trees don’t watch.”

The room was too quiet. Even the storm outside seemed to pause.

Then the wind picked up again, and a long, high whistle echoed through the walls—not like wind through cracks. It had a pitch. A rhythm. A sound like someone calling. Calling a name.

“Did you hear that?” Toby whispered.

Jude nodded.

Neither of them said what they were thinking.

Not out loud.

The next morning, the sun was out again. The air smelled of wet soil and worms, and the sky was cloudless, bright with the kind of washed-out blue that comes after a storm has scrubbed everything clean.

At school, no one else seemed to have seen anything. No one mentioned the whistle, or the movement in the trees. Even the teachers looked fresher, less tired, like nothing unusual had happened.

“You think it was a dream?” Toby asked as they sat on the swings during recess again.

Jude shook his head. “We both saw it.”

“So now what?”

“We find out what it was.”

“That sounds like a terrible idea.”

Jude leaned back in the swing, letting it rock gently. “Terrible ideas make the best stories.”

Toby looked past the edge of the playground, where the grass dipped and the forest began, stretching into places maps didn’t bother to show. He swallowed hard.

“Then I guess we’re writing one.”

Jude smiled.

And the wind, soft this time, curled around them like a whisper from the trees.

Chapter Two: The Rules of the Forest

The forest had always been there. For as long as anyone could remember, it sat behind the schoolyard and beyond the rows of low-slung houses with peeling paint and crooked mailboxes. It was the kind of place every kid in Meadowrun grew up hearing warnings about. Don’t go past the fence. Don’t follow the deer trail. Don’t climb over the rocks with the orange lichen. There were always rules. Spoken, unspoken, and half-whispered during sleepovers when flashlights were the only thing keeping the dark at bay.

Toby had never broken those rules. Not really. He’d stood on the edge once or twice, dared by other boys in his class to take a few steps in, maybe to grab a stick or a dropped ball. But he’d never gone beyond the first trees. Never followed the little path that twisted out of sight. Never let himself wonder too hard what lay past the place where the light started to shift and the air smelled more like copper than pine.

But Jude had. Or at least, he said he had. Half the time, Toby didn’t believe him.

“It’s not bad in there,” Jude insisted the next day after school, balancing on the cracked curb outside Toby’s house. “It’s quiet. And weird. But not scary. You just have to know what you’re doing.”

“How would you know what you’re doing?”

Jude shrugged and flipped a pebble with the toe of his shoe. “There are rules. I found them.”

Toby narrowed his eyes. “Found them where?”

“In a book,” Jude said. “In the library.”

Toby waited.

Jude finally relented. “Okay, not in a real book. More like… scribbled in one of the old encyclopedias. Someone wrote them in the margins.”

“That sounds fake.”

Jude pulled a crumpled sheet from his pocket. The writing was faint, smudged by time and humidity, the kind of messy penmanship that could have belonged to a kid or a lunatic. The list was numbered, but only some lines were still legible.

    Never enter alone

    Don’t speak your full name aloud

    If you hear the bells, walk backward until the sound fades

    Avoid looking at reflections after dusk

    Leave an offering if you take anything

    Don't eat anything that wasn’t yours to begin with

    Always leave before the second sunset

Toby read the list twice. “This is a joke.”

“Maybe,” Jude said, stuffing it back in his pocket. “But someone wrote it for a reason. And I think it explains the Vanishings.”

Toby sighed. “You’re still on about that?”

“I saw something last night, man. You did too.”

“We saw something weird. That doesn’t mean we should go marching into the woods like—like we’re in some movie.”

“You want to spend the rest of summer sitting on your butt playing video games?”

“Yes,” Toby said instantly.

But that night, when the cicadas screamed louder than usual and the wind rattled the gutters like bones in a jar, he found himself pacing by his window, wondering if Jude was already out there. Wondering if he’d go without him. Wondering what that would mean.

He texted Jude at 11:43 PM. You up?

The reply came two minutes later. Meet me at the old fence. Bring a flashlight and something shiny.

The fence was older than it looked. Rust had eaten through parts of the chain-link, and ivy crawled over the poles like a net of snakes. Toby crouched beside a bent section near the far soccer goal, breathing fast, flashlight gripped tight.

Jude emerged from the trees a moment later, flashlight beam bouncing wildly.

“Did you bring something shiny?” he asked.

Toby fished into his pocket and produced a quarter and a plastic keychain shaped like a dragon.

Jude nodded. “Good enough.”

He held up a bobby pin wrapped in tin foil. “I made this. Hope it counts.”

“What are we even doing?” Toby asked. “Seriously.”

Jude looked at him, and for a rare moment, all the bravado was gone. “I need to know.”

“Know what?”

“Why that thing was watching us. Why there’s rules. Why people vanish.”

Toby stared at him, heart pounding. Then he nodded once.

They stepped through the break in the fence.

The trees swallowed sound almost instantly. One moment they could hear the distant whir of cars and porch lights humming behind them, and the next it was just wind, leaves, and the soft crunch of their sneakers on damp ground.

Jude led the way, weaving through roots and ducking under low-hanging branches. The flashlight beams barely reached beyond ten feet, swallowed whole by the foliage. Every now and then, they passed a stone, flat and wide, covered in moss and strange markings. Once, Toby saw something nailed to a tree—a small wooden token, carved with a symbol like an open eye.

“Did you see that?” he whispered.

“Yeah,” Jude said, voice tight. “Don’t touch it.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t know. Just don’t.”

They pressed on.

It was hard to tell how far they’d gone. The forest didn’t seem to follow normal rules. The path twisted in on itself, and Toby swore they passed the same stone twice, though from different directions. His flashlight flickered once, then again, though the batteries were new.

“I don’t like this,” he whispered.

Jude didn’t answer. He was staring ahead, toward a break in the trees where something shimmered.

It looked like water at first. Then like glass. A narrow pool, stretching like a ribbon between two slopes. The surface was perfectly still, and something about it tugged at Toby’s stomach.

“We shouldn’t be here,” he said.

“We’re already here,” Jude replied, stepping forward.

Toby grabbed his arm. “Wait. What if this is what the rules meant?”

Jude looked down at the pool. “Reflections after dusk.”

“Don’t look,” Toby said.

But it was too late.

Jude froze.

Toby followed his gaze and saw their reflections—only not quite. The boys in the water weren’t moving the same way. Jude’s reflection was still grinning, eyes darker than they should’ve been. And Toby’s was mouthing something. A word he couldn’t hear. A word he didn’t want to hear.

He yanked Jude back.

The moment they broke eye contact, the spell shattered. The air snapped, the trees shifted, and a cold breeze blew through them like a whisper of breath on the back of the neck.

They didn’t run. They didn’t speak. They walked back, fast and silent, hearts thudding like war drums, until they reached the edge of the trees.

The fence was where they left it.

But the stars overhead were wrong.

Toby didn’t sleep that night. He lay in bed, eyes on the ceiling, ears straining for any sound. His flashlight sat under his pillow, turned off but close. His backpack, with the rule list now folded into one of the smaller pockets, sat zipped tight by the door. The reflection haunted him. The way it had moved, the way it had smiled—there was something inside that forest. Something older than them. Older than the town.

He didn’t know the rules. Not all of them. Not yet. But he was starting to believe they were real.

The next morning, everything looked normal. The streets were dry. The birds chirped. Toby’s mom hummed while packing his lunch. But when he met Jude outside, the boy’s face was pale, eyes rimmed in shadow like he hadn’t slept either.

“We weren’t gone long, were we?” Jude asked.

“I don’t think so.”

“Then why was the moon higher when we came back?”

Toby didn’t have an answer.

Neither of them said anything more until school started.

And even then, they avoided the windows.

They didn’t want to see if anything was watching.

The days that followed were ordinary in the way dreams sometimes are—real enough to believe in, yet off in ways that couldn't be named. Toby noticed small things first. The hallway clocks at school ticked slower. The air around the playground felt colder in the morning, even though the forecast showed sun and rising temperatures. Mrs. Delaney, the art teacher, was absent three days in a row, and when she returned, she seemed confused, calling students by the wrong names, mixing up colors, staring too long out the windows.

Jude acted like everything was the same. He still played kickball with a crooked grin, still leaned too far back in his chair during math, still passed Toby notes that were more doodle than message. But something in his eyes was different. Brighter, but not in a good way. More intense. Like he was listening for something no one else could hear.

Toby asked him one afternoon, behind the gym while they waited for pickup.

“What’s going on with you?”

Jude shrugged. “Nothing.”

“You’ve been weird since the woods.”

Jude didn’t deny it. He picked at the frayed hem of his sleeve, then looked up at Toby. “You heard the whispering, right? That night?”

Toby nodded, slowly.

“I keep hearing it,” Jude said, voice low. “At night. Sometimes in the morning. Sometimes even in class.”

Toby’s stomach knotted. “Like... voices?”

“Like they’re trying to say something important. But they’re too far away.”

“Maybe it’s just... the wind. Or you imagined it.”

Jude didn’t smile. “I didn’t imagine anything. You saw what I saw. That reflection. It wasn’t us.”

“I know,” Toby said quietly.

They didn’t say anything else for a while. Buses groaned in the distance, the afternoon sun long and golden across the pavement.

Then Jude said, “We need to go back.”

Toby turned sharply. “What? No. No, we don’t. That’s the opposite of what we should do.”

“There’s something there,” Jude continued. “Something we’re supposed to find. Or stop. Or understand. I think that’s why the rules exist. Not to keep us out. To show us how to go further without getting—” He hesitated. “Without getting taken.”

Toby shook his head. “That’s crazy. We got lucky last time. We don’t even know what could’ve happened if we stayed longer.”

“We have to learn more.”

“No,” Toby said, louder than he intended. “We don’t. You want to play with ghosts and shadows and rules written in someone’s old notebook, fine. But I’m done.”

Jude looked hurt. For the first time since they'd met, his bravado cracked, and beneath it was someone who looked less like the fearless explorer and more like a kid trying to make sense of something too big to hold.

“Okay,” he said, softly. “I get it.”

Toby turned away. “Good.”

But Toby didn’t sleep that night, either. The whispering came back—faint, brushing his ears like moth wings. Only now it sounded closer. Like it was moving. Like it was searching. He pressed his hands to his ears, buried his head beneath his pillow, but the words pushed through like water through cloth.

Find the names.

That’s what it said. Over and over.

Find the names.

The next morning, Toby found himself wandering the nonfiction aisle of the school library, trailing his fingers along the spines without knowing what he was looking for. The space felt colder than the rest of the school, the air heavier with dust. He rounded a corner and stopped in front of the encyclopedias.

They were ancient, their red bindings cracked and faded. One volume leaned awkwardly, a page sticking out from between its covers. Toby pulled it free. Volume N.

Inside, scribbled in dark blue ink, was the same handwriting as the rules Jude had shown him. The page wasn’t about forests or mythology. It was about names—specifically, naming conventions in old European cultures, and the power names held in certain traditions. Beside a paragraph about Norse rituals, someone had written:

If it knows your full name, it can take your skin.

Toby slammed the book shut.

He didn’t tell Jude.

He meant to. He almost texted him twice that afternoon. But he didn’t want to give Jude ammunition. He didn’t want to be dragged deeper. Still, the words sat in his mind like stones in his pockets, heavy and impossible to ignore.

That night, the voice came again.

This time, it didn’t whisper.

It called.

Not in his ear. Not in the wind. But from the backyard.

He stood at the window, heart pounding, his hands cold. The treehouse swayed gently in a wind that didn’t touch the grass below. Beyond the swing set, past the fence, the woods were waiting. Still and thick with shadow.

Then something stepped into view.

Not a person. Not exactly. It had legs and arms and a face, but it wasn’t shaped right. Too tall, joints too loose, head slightly tilted like it didn’t understand how to wear its features. And it smiled. Just once. A twitch of the mouth like something trying to imitate a grin it had seen only in dreams.

Toby dropped to the floor.

He crawled backward, not daring to scream. Not daring to look again. He huddled against his closet door, flashlight in hand, until morning bled through the blinds and the birds began to sing.

“I changed my mind,” he told Jude at recess.

Jude blinked. “About what?”

“We need to go back.”

Jude didn’t ask why. He only nodded.

They met again that night, earlier this time. They brought supplies—two flashlights each, a compass from Jude’s dad’s old tackle box, a water bottle, and salt in a sandwich bag. They each wore backpacks and didn’t joke. Not once.

Before they stepped through the fence, Jude stopped and looked at him. “You sure?”

“No,” Toby said. “But I don’t think it matters anymore.”

The forest accepted them.

The air was colder than last time. The path shifted quickly, winding tight like a noose, and the light thinned faster than it should have. By the time they reached the pool again, the sky above was gone entirely, hidden beneath a canopy so thick it seemed more like ceiling than trees.

The water was still.

They didn’t look into it.

They turned left, past a ring of mushrooms Toby swore hadn’t been there before. Their stalks were dark, almost purple, and gave off a faint shimmer when the flashlights passed over them.

The ground sloped up.

At the top of the hill was a clearing.

And in the center of the clearing stood a stone structure.

It wasn’t big—maybe six feet across, circular, like a well or a broken fountain. Vines curled over the lip of the stone. Symbols were carved into the rim, each one faded, but familiar. Toby recognized a few from the rules page.

Jude stepped forward and placed the foil-wrapped bobby pin on the edge. Toby added his coin.

Nothing happened.

Then the air shifted. The wind pulled inward, toward the stone ring, like it was sucking the forest’s breath. The leaves rustled backward. And from the center of the stone, a low hum began.

They backed away.

The hum rose, shaping itself into syllables. A language neither of them knew, but understood. A command. A summons.

From the trees, figures began to emerge.

Not human. Not animals. Shapes in between. One with legs that bent backward. One that walked on hands. One that dragged something behind it like a second body. They moved slowly, reverently, like drawn by a church bell.

Jude grabbed Toby’s arm.

“We need to go.”

Toby’s mouth was dry. “It’s too late.”

The clearing had closed behind them. The path gone. The air too heavy to breathe.

The stone glowed now. Not bright, but deep—an inner light like coal still burning under ash.

Then a voice—not a whisper, but the same one from the backyard, from the water, from the book—spoke, louder now, shaped by wind and dark.

“Speak your name.”

Neither boy moved.

“Speak. Or be named.”

Jude opened his mouth.

Toby shoved him. “No!”

The light flared.

And something stepped from inside the stone.

Chapter Three: The Name-Eater

The thing that rose from the stone circle was not a creature, not in the way that word usually meant. It was presence. A shape built from shadow and light, moving wrong in all the ways something could move wrong—too fluid, too silent, and somehow too aware. It had no face, not really, but there were impressions where eyes should be. Impressions that glowed faintly, like candlelight pressed through thin cloth. It didn’t walk. It didn’t float. It just was, first inside the stone circle, and then outside of it, without stepping.

Toby felt it before he saw it. A pressure in his chest, like being underwater too long. His ears popped, his vision blurred at the edges, and something cold crept down his spine like melted ice. Beside him, Jude stood frozen, lips parted, his breath fogging in the air.

The voice spoke again, and this time it didn’t just vibrate the clearing—it pierced through them.

“Speak your name.”

The figures in the trees—those impossible, bent, dragging things—had gone still. Watching. Waiting. Like an audience awaiting a performer’s next move.

Toby’s mind raced. The rules. Don’t speak your full name aloud. He hadn’t. Not yet. But Jude—Jude had always been too bold, too curious, too reckless.

“Don’t,” Toby whispered, his voice dry. “Don’t say anything.”

“I—I have to,” Jude whispered back. “It’s asking. If we don’t—”

“It’s a trick. That’s what it does.”

But the pressure was building. The thing drew closer, and the air itself grew heavy with expectation. Toby’s head rang with a dozen fractured thoughts. The list in the encyclopedia. The shimmer in the water. The reflection smiling when they hadn’t.

He turned to Jude and grabbed his arm. “If we speak our names, we lose something. It takes something. Maybe everything.”

“Then what do we do?”

Toby swallowed. His mouth felt packed with cotton. “We run.”

Jude hesitated just a second too long, and the thing moved—or perhaps the space between them shrank. Toby felt heat and cold all at once, and something like a hand grazed the side of his face, though when he turned, there was nothing there.

He yanked Jude, and together they ran.

It felt like moving through molasses. The forest resisted them. Trees bent the wrong way, roots shifted to catch their feet. The wind screamed in reverse. Behind them, the voice rose again, this time not demanding—but angry.

“YOU ARE NAMED.”

Toby stumbled but didn’t fall. Jude’s fingers clutched his sleeve, tight and desperate. The clearing faded behind them, but not the feeling. Not the watching. Every step was like pushing against a tide of invisible arms, grasping, clawing, pleading.

And then, suddenly, they were out.

The forest spat them onto the grass behind the soccer field, the night sky above them ordinary again, pierced with familiar stars. They both fell to their knees, gasping, Jude coughing so hard it made his ribs rattle. For a while, they didn’t speak.

Toby sat up first. “Are you okay?”

Jude nodded, but too fast. His eyes were wide. His hands shook. He looked smaller somehow, hunched into himself, like he had been emptied out.

“You didn’t say your name,” Toby said. “Right?”

“I—I almost did,” Jude whispered. “It felt like—like it was pulling it out of me. Like it already knew.”

Toby didn’t reply. He stared at the woods, darker than they had ever looked before.

“We’re not supposed to go back,” Jude added. “Ever again.”

Toby nodded.

But he didn’t believe that was the end.

For three days, they avoided each other. It wasn’t planned. It just happened. Jude didn’t show up in the mornings to walk to school. He wasn’t in his usual spot at lunch. Toby didn’t try to find him. He couldn’t. Something about that night had created a space between them, a fracture neither of them knew how to cross. And yet, the forest lingered—on the edge of dreams, in the stillness between classes, in the way their classmates’ faces blurred if Toby stared too long.

He saw things, now.

Small things.

Like the janitor’s shadow moving when the man was still.

Like the lunch lady’s eyes reflecting light the wrong way.

Like the reflection in the hallway mirror not blinking at the same time he did.

By the fourth day, Toby found a mark on his shoulder, shaped like a spiral. Faint. Red. Like a bruise that never fully surfaced. It didn’t hurt. But it pulsed sometimes, as if it remembered something he didn’t.

That same day, a substitute came to class. Mr. Cleary, the regular teacher, had taken a sudden leave of absence.

“He got sick,” someone whispered.

“No,” another said, “he forgot who he was.”

Toby didn’t want to ask how they knew that.

The summer break started early.

The school claimed flooding had damaged the basement, and mold had gotten into the walls. Parents received notices and emails. The local paper printed a half-page article full of bureaucratic explanations. But Jude and Toby knew better.

The forest was pushing back.

“You said it knew your name,” Toby said when he finally saw Jude again.

They met behind the old library downtown, in the shade of the brick wall where kids once played four-square. Jude looked thinner, his eyes ringed in gray, his hands jammed deep into his hoodie pockets despite the heat.

“It didn’t take it,” Jude said. “But I think it marked me.”

“I think it marked both of us.”

Toby showed him the spiral on his shoulder.

Jude flinched. “Same spot,” he said, lifting his sleeve to reveal an identical mark.

“What does it mean?”

“I think we were chosen,” Jude replied, voice hollow. “Or maybe we trespassed. Broke a boundary.”

Toby frowned. “Then why hasn’t it come for us?”

“I don’t know,” Jude said. “Maybe it’s waiting.”

They tried to act normal. Played video games. Rode their bikes to the gas station for candy. Talked about movies and books and nothing important. But the forest was always there. Waiting. And it wasn’t done.

One afternoon, mid-July, a boy named Calvin Brenner disappeared. He lived three streets over. Quiet, bookish, twelve years old. Last seen walking his dog near the forest’s edge. The dog came back alone.

No one mentioned the Vanishings this time. No one called it that. But Toby knew. Jude knew. The same quiet panic returned to their town like an old song stuck on repeat. Parents kept kids inside. Lights stayed on longer at night. Doors were double-locked.

That night, the spiral on Toby’s shoulder burned.

He woke gasping, a copper taste in his mouth, the whisper back in full force.

Find the names.

Return what was taken.

He didn’t know what it meant.

Not yet.

But he knew it was time to stop hiding.

The next morning, he went to Jude’s house. He didn’t bother with the doorbell. He climbed the tree beside the porch and knocked on the second-floor window until Jude opened it, bleary-eyed.

“We’re going back,” Toby said.

Jude blinked. “I thought we said—”

“It doesn’t matter what we said. It’s not over. It’s never been over.”

Jude stared at him for a long time. Then he nodded.

“I’ll pack the salt.”

They left just after sundown, when the sky was still streaked with orange and the streetlights hadn’t quite flickered on. Their parents thought they were at each other’s houses, a trick they had used before, one that worked so well neither family ever called to check. Toby had his backpack, stuffed with a flashlight, salt, matches, the old rule list, and the library photocopy about names. Jude brought the compass again, along with a notebook, a pencil, and a pocketknife that had belonged to his grandfather.

This time, they didn’t joke. They didn’t even speak as they walked the path that led behind the soccer field. The fence loomed ahead, broken links curled like jagged teeth. For a moment, Toby hesitated. The spiral on his shoulder itched. The last thing they’d seen in the forest still flickered behind his eyes—the impossible figure that had stepped from the stone ring, the way it had spoken without moving lips, the way it had asked to be named.

“Last chance to turn around,” Jude said. His voice was calm, but not casual. There was no bravado in it. Just quiet finality.

Toby looked at the fence. Then the forest beyond it. He took a breath, held it, and stepped through.

The air inside was immediately colder. Not the kind of cold that made your teeth chatter, but something that sank into your skin and made your blood feel slower. The path seemed different this time—narrower, more twisted, as though the forest itself had changed shape. Trees leaned in toward the center like eavesdropping giants, their leaves too still, their branches swaying without wind.

“I brought chalk,” Jude said after they’d walked for ten minutes. “I’m going to mark the trees this time.”

“Smart,” Toby said. “Use symbols, not letters. Just in case.”

Jude gave a small nod. He drew the first symbol—two intersecting triangles—on a low branch as they passed. They walked in silence, stopping every so often to mark another.

The further they went, the more warped things became. The dirt was softer, almost spongy, and their shoes left no prints. The trees had knotholes shaped like eyes, and some of them dripped sap the color of ink. A fox watched them from behind a tree. Its eyes were human-shaped. It did not blink.

“I think it’s changing us,” Toby said quietly. “Not just watching. Changing.”

“How?”

“I don’t know. But this place—it bends things. Maybe even people.”

They came to the pool again, though it looked different this time. Wider. The surface still shimmered like glass, but it reflected a sky they couldn’t see, one filled with two moons and a red streak like a bleeding comet. They skirted it carefully. Neither looked in.

Then the trail dipped, and they found the clearing again.

The stone ring was there, just as they’d left it. But the offerings were gone. The coin, the foil bobby pin, the dragon keychain. Nothing remained. Only the ring itself, and the spirals carved deep into the stone. The air was heavier here, like the place was holding its breath.

“We’re not alone,” Jude said.

Toby nodded. He could feel it too. A presence—close, but not visible. It sat behind the trees like a predator, watching with something deeper than eyes.

“Do you hear it?” Jude asked.

Toby strained his ears.

Then he heard it.

Not a whisper this time. Not a call.

Names.

Soft and slow, like a chant, each one layered atop the other. Not shouted, not spoken—unfurled. Names they recognized. Names of classmates. Teachers. Children who had disappeared.

Calvin Brenner. Elena Marrow. Vincent Alcott.

And then—

“Jude Carter. Tobias Ellison.”

The boys froze.

“It knows us,” Toby whispered. “It remembered.”

“It marked us,” Jude corrected.

Suddenly, the forest trembled. Not like an earthquake, not violently. It shifted. The trees leaned further. The ring glowed faintly, pulsing in time with some heartbeat far underground.

Toby stepped forward. “We need to ask it something.”

“Ask what?”

“Why it’s doing this.”

Jude grabbed his arm. “That’s insane. You don’t ask things like this anything. You leave. We came back to stop it, not talk to it.”

“How can we stop it if we don’t even understand it?”

Jude stared at him. “You sound like them. Like the ones who went missing and came back wrong.”

“I’m not wrong,” Toby said. “Not yet.”

He stepped into the circle.

The stone vibrated under his shoes. The symbols glowed slightly, and the air thickened around him like syrup. Toby spoke—not loudly, but clearly.

“Why do you take names?”

The answer came like a ripple in space, folding the forest inward.

Names are doors. You gave me a key.

Jude took a step back. “Toby, get out of there.”

Toby didn’t move. “What happens when you take a name?”

Then they are mine.

He swallowed. “Can we take them back?”

There was a pause.

Not without cost.

“What cost?”

Your names. One for one.

“No,” Jude said from the edge of the ring. “That’s not happening. We’re not trading our lives for theirs.”

Toby turned, his voice tight. “Maybe we have to.”

“Don’t be stupid.”

“Jude, Calvin didn’t come back. Elena didn’t. Vincent didn’t. If we can bring one of them back, isn’t it worth it?”

Jude was pale. “Not like this.”

The voice returned, louder now, filling the space behind their thoughts.

Give one name, and another is returned. You have one hour.

Then the clearing dimmed, the glow fading, and the pressure in the air released.

Toby stepped out of the circle, shaking. Jude grabbed his shoulder, hard.

“You can’t do this,” he said. “We can’t do this. You don’t bargain with things like that.”

“What if it’s the only way?”

“And what if it’s lying?”

Toby didn’t answer. Because deep down, he didn’t think it was.

They left the forest with the world feeling thinner behind them, like walking on stretched skin. Back in Toby’s room, they sat in silence. The hour was ticking. The voice still echoed in Toby’s head.

Give one name.

“It didn’t say we had to give ours,” he said after a long silence.

Jude looked at him sharply. “What?”

“It didn’t say the name had to be ours. Just a name.”

“That’s even worse. You’d give someone else up? Just to get one back?”

“I’m just saying it’s what it said.”

Jude stood, pacing. “We’re not doing this. Not like that. You want to save someone? Fine. But you’re not sacrificing someone else. That’s how it spreads.”

They stared at each other, the weight of the question growing between them.

Finally, Toby said, “Then maybe the only name we can give… is one of ours.”

Silence.

Then Jude sat back down, hard. “We flip a coin.”

“What?”

“Flip a coin,” Jude said, voice flat. “We each call a side. Whoever loses gives their name.”

“That’s—insane.”

“Isn’t that what this whole thing is?”

Toby opened his hand. In it sat a single coin, worn and bent at one edge—the same quarter they had once placed on the ring. He looked at it, then at Jude.

“You sure?”

“No.”

They flipped.

It spun through the air, catching light, then fell.

Jude lost.

Chapter Four: What Cannot Be Unnamed

Jude stared at the coin for a long time, unmoving. It had landed near the edge of Toby’s bed, caught in a crease of the blanket. Heads. Toby had called tails. They both knew what it meant, but neither said the words aloud.

The room was quiet, filled only with the hum of the ceiling fan and the chirping of crickets outside the window. The air felt wrong, thick with something sour and electric. Toby waited for Jude to speak, to laugh it off or call a redo, to say it didn’t count, but Jude didn’t. His face was pale, but steady, his fingers balled into fists on his knees.

“We don’t have to do it,” Toby said finally, breaking the silence. “We can walk away. Let the hour pass.”

Jude’s voice was a whisper, strained and hoarse. “And let Calvin stay gone? You really think it’ll stop? That it’ll just let us leave if we quit now?”

“No,” Toby admitted. “I don’t.”

Jude leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “So we give it my name.”

Toby’s throat tightened. “You’re not going to disappear. It didn’t say that. Just—just that you give your name. Maybe it forgets you. Maybe you forget yourself. But we’ll figure something out. We’ll fix it.”

Jude didn’t look at him. “You think people can live without a name?”

“I think people do it all the time. People run away. Start over. Take new names.”

“It’s not the same,” Jude murmured. “This thing doesn’t forget you like a lost ID. It eats it. Like it eats light. Like it eats rules.”

The spiral on Toby’s shoulder itched. He scratched it absently, his mind spinning. The rules hadn’t said what happened if you gave your name—only that you shouldn’t speak it. But this was different, wasn’t it? This was an offering. A trade.

“We could try a fake one,” he suggested.

“No,” Jude said immediately. “It would know. You can’t trick something like that.”

“Then I’ll do it.”

Jude looked at him now, sharply. “No. We flipped. It was fair.”

“Who cares about fair?”

“I do.”

Toby looked down at his palms, at the faint chalk residue left over from the marks Jude had drawn earlier. “It’s not forever,” he said, not believing it himself. “You’ll still be you. You’ll remember who you are.”

Jude’s laugh was hollow. “Will I?”

They didn’t have any rituals. No spellbooks. No sacred circle. Just the list of rules, the glowing ring of stone, and something ancient waiting in the dark. It wasn’t enough. But it was all they had.

They went back just before the hour ended. The forest felt different, almost eager. It welcomed them this time, the trees parting like curtains, the path smooth and oddly bright under a sky that had turned an unnatural greenish hue. Nothing tried to stop them. No shapes in the shadows. No glimmers in the water. The pool was gone altogether, the ground dry where it once shimmered.

The clearing was just as they had left it, though the stone ring pulsed now, faintly, like a heartbeat.

Toby led. Jude followed.

No words.

When they reached the center, the air thickened, and the voice returned—not loud, but insistent. Not a whisper, not a scream. Just there, like a pressure behind the eyes.

Time is ended. One name must be given.

Jude took a step forward. His hands trembled, but he didn’t hesitate. His voice shook, but he kept it steady.

“I give my name,” he said, “in return for the boy called Calvin Brenner.”

The forest exhaled. Every leaf trembled. The ring glowed brighter, then dimmed. A wind blew in from nowhere, swirling leaves and dust in a spiral that lifted into the sky and vanished with a sound like snapping branches. Then stillness.

And silence.

Toby waited.

The ground didn’t open. The sky didn’t crack. Jude didn’t vanish. For a long moment, nothing happened. Then the spiral on Toby’s shoulder flared with heat. He gasped and clutched at it. It glowed faintly, a soft white-blue, before fading back into a dull pink.

Jude fell to his knees, breathing hard.

“Are you okay?” Toby knelt beside him.

“I don’t know,” Jude whispered. “I feel… lighter.”

“You remember your name?”

“Yes.” He paused. “But it doesn’t feel like mine anymore. It’s like remembering a story someone told me about myself.”

Toby nodded slowly.

Then a noise broke the silence.

A soft whimper.

They turned.

From behind a tree stepped a boy. Thin, dirt-smeared, with torn jeans and wide, terrified eyes. He looked no older than twelve. His hair was matted, his arms scraped, but he was whole. He stared at them both, blinking.

“Who are you?” he asked.

Toby’s voice caught. “Calvin?”

The boy flinched at the name.

“I—I think so,” he said. “I was… somewhere. Dark. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. There were voices. I don’t remember how I got there.”

Jude stood unsteadily. “We brought you back.”

Calvin looked around, then down at the stone circle. “Where is this?”

Toby stepped forward, reaching out a hand. “It’s okay. We’ll take you home.”

He didn’t say more. There was no way to explain it. Calvin didn’t ask.

Back in the neighborhood, the streetlights were just beginning to flicker on. They left Calvin at the police station—he couldn’t remember where he lived, couldn’t recall his parents’ names, only pieces, like a jigsaw puzzle with holes. But they recognized him. His photo was still up. Officers gasped. Someone cried.

No one asked how the boys had found him. They didn’t explain.

That night, Jude sat on Toby’s porch, silent.

Toby brought out two sodas. Neither drank them.

“Do you feel different?” Toby asked.

Jude didn’t answer for a long time. Then he said, “Yeah. Like part of me’s unwritten.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be. I chose it. He’s back. That matters.”

“What happens now?”

Jude looked out at the street, the trees beyond the fence swaying gently in the summer breeze. “We keep the rules. We warn people. And we never go back.”

Toby nodded, but even then, he wasn’t sure they’d truly left.

Not really.

The next day, Calvin was all over the local news.

“Miracle Return,” the headlines said. “Boy Found After Nearly Three Weeks Missing.” The articles were light on details. Police refused to explain where he had been or how he had come back. They said he was found near the southern edge of the woods, dazed but unharmed. One article mentioned “exhaustion” and “disorientation,” the kind of words adults used when they didn’t know what else to say.

Toby and Jude watched the press conference from Toby’s living room, the TV casting pale light over the rug. Calvin’s parents sat in folding chairs behind the chief of police, their faces hollow and tight. The father held a wrinkled photograph in both hands, knuckles white. The mother
