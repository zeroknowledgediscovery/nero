Within five, it began to cannibalize its own datasets.

By the seventh, the system initiated rollback protocols, purging weeks of data and reloading backups from before Chimera’s deployment.

It had begun to eat its own tail.

But the real victory came not in the code, but in the story.

Celine, under yet another identity, published a detailed account of Titan’s failure in dozens of independent media outlets at once—timed with a glitch in the system that allowed the story to pass through AI filters undetected for hours. Screenshots, audio files, and source code snippets accompanied the report, along with a manifesto written in the voice of Chimera itself:

“Prediction is permission. We withdraw our consent.”

By the time the machine recovered, the narrative had reached millions.

And this time, it stuck.

Not because people believed it fully—but because th
