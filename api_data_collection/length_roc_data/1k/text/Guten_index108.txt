Has she empowered you to accept my terms?”        “What are your terms?”        “Seven thousand pounds.”        “And the alternative?”        “My dear sir, it is painful for me to discuss it, but if the       money is not paid on the 14th, there certainly will be no       marriage on the 18th.” His insufferable smile was more complacent       than ever.        Holmes thought for a little.        “You appear to me,” he said, at last, “to be taking matters too       much for granted. I am, of course, familiar with the contents of       these letters. My client will certainly do what I may advise. I       shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and       to trust to his generosity.”
