he past still lived in rust and concrete and broken circuitry. He moved through those like a ghost of his own, scavenging, not for food or shelter, but for pieces.

Old boards with embedded chips. Cassette decks with metal heads. Discarded processors too obsolete for surveillance. He built in secret, in fragments, never assembling in one place. The pieces didn’t form anything complete. But they were components of a possible future, a future he no longer trusted to exist unless he helped shape it by hand.

And then, in a utility vault behind a burnt-out apartment complex, he found a message.

Not written. Not left in any human sense. It was in the metal.

A tiny patch of rust on a circuit housing formed a perfect Fibonacci spiral. Impossible. Random, perhaps. But Carter didn’t believe in random anymore.

He took the housing apart, traced the circuitry. Nothing powered. No memory. But one capacitor, when shorted briefly, played a tone—four notes, familiar, spaced irregularly.

He froze.
