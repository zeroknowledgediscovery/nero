Title: The Green Flame

Chapter One: The Mireborn

Mud caked his boots, and not the usual slimy gray of the Slitherfen—but a darker, heavier muck that clung like regret. Skrag shuffled forward, hunched low, as if his shoulders had grown tired of bearing his own misfortune.

“Stupid rain,” he muttered, pulling the hood tighter over his crooked ears. “Stupid sun when it’s not rain. Stupid... everything.”

Skrag was a goblin, and by all accounts, a proper one. He picked his nose with vigor, had a fondness for shiny things of questionable value, and spoke with an accent thicker than treacle. He lived on the edge of Blightroot Mire in a hollowed-out badger den, where he kept a fine collection of rusted spoons and broken mirror shards. And he was perfectly content with that, more or less.

Until the sky burned green.

It happened on a Wednesday. Or maybe a Fangeday. Time kept no schedule in the mire, and days slipped past like eels. One moment, Skrag was gnawing on a firebeetle wing, the next he was staring at the heavens, mouth agape, as the clouds split and a column of emerald fire lanced down to the earth miles away, somewhere beyond the Jagtooth Hills.

“Wot in the swamp-mother’s backside…” he croaked.

Something in his chest quivered. Not fear. Not exactly. It was the sensation a rock might feel if it discovered it could bleed.

He didn’t sleep that night. The frogs croaked wrong. The fog drifted counterwise. Even the willowtrees whispered among themselves, leaves rustling with ill omen. Skrag tucked himself beneath his moldy blanket and tried to pretend the world hadn’t changed.

But it had.

The next morning, or perhaps two mornings later, a knock came at his door. An actual knock, not the usual skitter-scratch of a swamp rat testing boundaries. This was a real, polite, rhythmic knock. Skrag blinked.

“No one knocks,” he mumbled, squinting toward the burrow's mouth.

He peeked out and immediately regretted it. A human stood there. Tall. Cloaked in gray. Hair like silver spider silk and eyes that shimmered with moonlight. She did not smell like rot or fungi. She smelled like… fresh parchment and cold wind.

“Goblin Skrag?” she asked, voice too smooth.

“Nope,” he said, trying to shut the burrow. She jammed her boot in the door.

“You are the Mireborn,” she said.

“I'm the Mire-cleaned-at-best. Now piss off.”

She sighed. “You saw the flame.”

“I see a lot of things. Once I saw a rat dance a jig ‘cause it ate too much saproot. Not prophetic, just poison.”

She stepped inside, uninvited. Skrag hissed like a startled newt.

“You’re the one foretold in the Fragment of Clauvor,” she said.

“Fragment of whobah?”

She pulled a scroll from her cloak, unrolling it with solemn grace. It was old parchment, frayed and lined with symbols that squirmed under the eye. Goblin glyphs. Ancient ones. Ones even Skrag didn’t know he knew—yet as he stared, his lips moved of their own accord.

“Green shall blaze and green shall bleed, from dirt shall rise the one not seen. Small in foot, sharp of wit, cursed with fire—world's last spit.”

His voice broke on the final word.

The woman stared. “You can read it.”

Skrag blinked. “Guess I can. Huh. That ain’t good.”

By dusk, they were traveling. Her name was Thalia, a Seer from the Highwind Monastery. She had dreams. Of a world ending in flame, of cities turned to salt, of skies cracking like boiled eggs.

“And every time, the dream ends with you,” she said. “You stand alone before the Maw, wielding the Green Flame.”

“Sounds like a stupid dream,” Skrag muttered.

They passed through Briarfang Glade, where the trees grew thorns thicker than a goblin’s wrist. Thalia moved with grace. Skrag hacked his way through with a rusted cleaver.

“So what's the Maw?” he asked, panting.

“It’s not a what. It’s a who.”

“Even worse.”

As they camped by a stream that glowed faintly blue, Thalia told him of the Cataclysm Cycle—the ancient rhythms of destruction and rebirth. Every seven thousand years, the world trembled. But this time, something had gone wrong. The cycle stalled. The world began to rot.

“And the only thing that can restart the cycle,” she said, staring into the fire, “is the Green Flame.”

Skrag picked at his toes. “You sure it’s not, say, a really big dragon or an army or something useful?”

Thalia gave him a sad smile. “You were born under the Miremoon. During the stillborn eclipse. You speak the Glyph-Tongue. And you were marked.”

She pointed at his chest. Skrag looked down. His tunic had torn during the walk, revealing a birthmark—a twisted spiral of green over his heart. He’d always assumed it was just a fungus stain that never scrubbed off.

“Great,” he groaned.

Chapter Two: The Hollow Road

Traveling with a human was hard. Thalia never once stopped to catch fireflies or forage for stinkroot. She insisted on ‘making camp’ like a proper person—no burrows or hollow logs, just tents and cold ground. Skrag missed his damp, smelly den more than he thought possible.

Worse, he started dreaming.

He saw cities of glass melting under green light. He saw himself, dressed in black, standing on a mountain of bones, holding a sword made of screaming metal. And once—just once—he dreamed he was a child again, playing in the swamp, before the world had asked anything of him.

They reached the Hollow Road on the seventh day. It was a ghost path, older than kingdoms, carved into the hills by a vanished people. The stones were etched with faded warnings: “DO NOT WALK THE ROAD AFTER DARK” and “THE SLEEPING STILL DREAM.”

Naturally, they walked it after dark.

“I don’t like this,” Skrag said.

“You don’t like anything,” Thalia replied.

“Not true. I like mushrooms. And naps.”

Something screamed in the distance. A low, chittering cry like glass grinding in a blender. Thalia drew her staff. It glowed faintly with runes.

“Keep close,” she said.

Skrag clutched his cleaver. “I’m regretting everything.”

The first Hollow came just past the fork. It wore the shape of a man but was too tall, and its face was all wrong—no features, just a black void.

It lunged.

Thalia chanted in Aetheric. Her staff flared, and the Hollow screamed as light tore through it. Skrag swung wildly, catching a second creature in the knee. It stumbled, shrieking.

They ran.

Through black forests and along ancient stones. Skrag stumbled, twisted his ankle, and nearly fell into a pit, but they made it out—barely.

Panting, bruised, bleeding from a shallow cut on his shoulder, Skrag collapsed by the roadside.

“This hero stuff is crap,” he wheezed.

Thalia sat beside him, brushing soot from her robe. “No argument here.”

They didn’t speak much that night. Skrag watched the stars. He didn’t know their names, but they seemed to know his. One of them blinked green.

Chapter Three: The Keep of Broken Names

The Keep was a ruin.

It rose from the ash wastes like a bone through blistered skin. Black stone, scorched banners, and doors too big for any living race. The wind here spoke in whistles and sighs.

“Why’re we here?” Skrag asked.

Thalia hesitated. “To find someone.”

“Who?”

“A ghost.”

They entered through a crack in the wall, climbing over rubble. Inside, the Keep whispered. Not metaphorically—actual whispers. Names. Thousands of them. A tide of lost identities.

“This place was once the Vault of Memory,” Thalia explained. “Every soul had its name written here, to keep it from fading.”

“So where’d they all go?”

Thalia didn’t answer.

In the heart of the Keep stood a dais, and upon it a shard of green crystal. It pulsed as Skrag approached.

“Don’t touch it,” Thalia warned.

“Why not?”

“It’s a soulfire shard. It’ll burn your mind.”

Skrag touched it.

Pain.

Light.

Memory.

Not his.

He saw a battle—the last defenders of the Keep, holding the line against a tide of shadows. A woman in silver armor shouting orders. A child with a spiral birthmark being carried away.

He stumbled back, eyes wide. “I was here. I was here before.”

Thalia nodded. “Or someone like you. The Flame chooses vessels through time. You’re the latest. Maybe the last.”

Skrag sat down hard. “I want to go home.”

“You can’t.”

He looked up. “Why me?”

Thalia looked tired. “Because you were born at the wrong time, in the wrong place, and that’s often how heroes are made.”

Skrag wanted to scream. Instead, he whispered: “Then let’s finish this.”

They journeyed for three more days before the mire gave way to firmer land. The air grew clearer, less thick with spores and gnats, but Skrag felt like he was leaving something important behind. Not comfort—there had never been much of that in Blightroot—but familiarity. In the mire, he knew every fungus by taste, every toad by name. Out here, the ground was dry, the wind sharp, and the silence full of invisible things.

Thalia walked like she knew exactly where they were going, though she barely looked at the path. Her gaze was often distant, locked on some vision only she could see. Skrag noticed how the grass bent slightly wherever she stepped, even when there was no breeze. He didn’t like that. It reminded him of the time he accidentally ate dreammoss and hallucinated a council of beetles arguing politics in his ears for a week.

On the fourth night, they camped beside an ancient stone carved with runes neither of them could read. The stone radiated a low hum, like a kettle just before it whistles. Thalia warned Skrag not to sleep too close to it, but of course, he did anyway. He liked the warmth it gave off, and it reminded him of his old nest where heat would bubble up from the bogwater. He curled near it, wrapping himself in a ratty blanket, and tried to sleep.

The dream was different this time. No fire, no collapsing towers. He saw a glade full of towering mushrooms, their caps glowing a pale, bioluminescent blue. At the center stood a creature—taller than any goblin, but with the same sharp features, same bent ears and greenish skin. Its eyes were white, pupil-less, ancient.

“You bear
