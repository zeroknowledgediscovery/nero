BLOOD CURRENT: A NOVEL
By Anonymous
CHAPTER ONE: THE FLICKERING LIGHTS OF ELDERVALE

The hum of overhead wires whispered through the gray, dusk-lit streets of Eldervale, a town stitched together by rusted nails and the secrets of its older residents. It was a place where streetlamps flickered just enough to make you believe you’d seen someone in the corner of your eye. A town forgotten by the rest of the world, barely held together by sagging power lines, and, lately, by the skilled hands of a solitary electrician named Lucien Vale.

Lucien arrived when the town was on the brink of losing power entirely. The storms had battered the region mercilessly for weeks. The local grid — a patchwork of outdated transformers and cable systems — groaned with age. No one remembered who had hired him. No contracts had been signed. One day, Lucien simply appeared, tool belt slung across his black coat like a sash of bones, boots streaked with crimson clay, and a voice soft as a vinyl record played on an old Victrola.

He was polite, efficient, quiet. Too quiet, perhaps. The townsfolk whispered of how he always seemed to show up before the outages, not after. That he fixed things faster than seemed possible. That animals avoided him. That his eyes never quite reflected light the way they should.

He lived in the abandoned substation at the edge of the woods — the one everyone used to dare each other to enter as kids, before it had been shut down due to "unspecified electrical hazards." Since Lucien moved in, the building glowed at night with a strange, bluish tint, as though a pocket of aurora had settled in the trees.

“G’mornin’, Mr. Vale,” said Maureen Blight, catching him outside the bakery one damp morning. She offered him a steaming cup of black coffee, the kind laced with chicory that the old folk liked.

Lucien took the cup gently, his long fingers brushing hers. Cold. “Thank you, Maureen. I’ll have the cables behind your oven checked this week. You’re getting those brownouts again.”

She nodded. “You always know when things are about to go wrong, don’t ya?”

He gave her the ghost of a smile. “It’s a feeling.”

Inside his workshop, the air was filled with a chorus of quiet buzzing, like a nest of hornets made of copper and glass. Wires crawled across every wall, dripping from the ceiling like vines. Voltage meters pulsed softly, tuned not just to electricity — but to something else. Something deeper.

Lucien was old. Older than the bones of Eldervale, older than the electrical grid he now maintained like a parish priest tending to an ailing church. Born in smoke and blood during the age of gaslight and guillotines, he had moved through history like a shadow, living off the currents of human industry and the literal current flowing through copper veins.

Electricity was life, after all.

His thirst was not like others of his kind. He had evolved. Adapted. Where once he had fed upon blood alone, now he could siphon the life from the electromagnetic fields of mankind’s devices. The nervous hum of transformers nourished him; the spark of a broken bulb whetted his appetite.

But there were rules. Ancient ones. Binding ones.

He could not enter a home uninvited. He could not cross running water unless disguised. And above all — he could not feed directly from a person, lest he lose himself in the old hunger. He had learned these rules through loss. Through failure. Through the charred remains of places he once called home.

On the night of the solstice, the storm rolled in like a prophecy.

Lightning split the sky with crackling venom. The winds howled down the mountains and whipped the trees into a frenzy. The town’s power surged, failed, blinked back, and failed again.

Lucien was already on the move.

He emerged from the substation wrapped in a long, oilskin coat, face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. In his gloved hands, he carried his modified voltage gauge — a meter crossed with something more arcane, etched with runes invisible unless seen through ultraviolet light.

“Time’s wrong,” he murmured, looking at the swirling dials. “Something’s pulling at the grid.”

A scream tore through the rain. Not a human one.

He ran.

At the edge of the lumber yard, he found the creature. Tall, gaunt, soaked with the stink of ozone and old blood. It crouched near a splintered power pole, long claws wrapped around a sparking transformer. Its eyes — bright white, like halogen lamps — flicked toward Lucien.

“You don’t belong here,” he said, voice barely audible over the rain.

The thing hissed. “You feed from the stream. We feed from the source.”

Lucien felt the buzz of a hundred volts ripple through his teeth. “You’ll burn this town.”

“They’re cattle. Let them burn.”

With a twist of his wrist, Lucien activated the rod.

Lightning arced from the storm into the rod’s tip, redirected into a sigil inlaid along the handle. The creature shrieked as the bolt hit it, shuddering and convulsing. It wasn’t destroyed — not entirely. But it fled, scorched and angry, into the shadows.

Lucien knelt by the damaged transformer. It was bleeding. Not oil. Not coolant. Something darker. More ancient. He touched the slick liquid and hissed.

“Too early,” he said. “Something’s waking them.”

The town council met three days later in the old post office, under flickering lights that never quite settled into full brightness.

“Mr. Vale,” said Councilman Durran, a man who wore his hat indoors and never took his eyes off anyone he spoke to. “There’s concern. You've been seen walking near the children’s school at night.”

Lucien blinked. “The wiring in that building is unstable. I was inspecting it.”

“You don’t work for the power company.”

“I never said I did.”

Durran’s lips twitched. “Still. People talk. We’ve had five disappearances this month. Cattle. Pets. And now…” He slid a photograph across the table. A blurry image of something vaguely humanoid, hunched over a power line.

Lucien didn’t look at it. “That’s not me.”

“You know what it is?”

“I know what it isn’t.”

Durran’s eyes narrowed. “Who are you, really?”

Lucien leaned forward, enough that the bulbs above flickered. “I’m the only thing keeping this town from going dark forever.”

A week passed.

A girl named Elsie Bramble went missing.

She had been playing near the creek, her boots found the next day resting neatly on a rock.

Lucien stood by the water’s edge, staring at the place the grass had been flattened.

He smelled it. The echo of the thing that had attacked the transformer. Stronger now. It was feeding. Growing.

And somewhere, in the current that hummed beneath Eldervale, he felt it: a signal, distorted, intermittent, screaming in frequencies only he could hear.

It wasn’t just one of them anymore.

They were gathering.

He would have to choose — protect the town that distrusted him, or feed the storm that would cleanse it.

And already, he was getting thirsty.

Lucien didn’t sleep, not in the human sense. When the sky paled toward dawn, and the air grew thick with the scent of wet leaves and ash, he retreated into his sanctuary beneath the substation. The chamber beneath was hidden by rusted floor panels and a tangle of coiled conduit no maintenance worker would dare disturb. Down there, the hum was different. Deeper. Ancient. Machines lined the walls, machines no modern blueprint could account for — brass filigreed dials, vacuum tubes filled with viscous liquid, copper caskets of something pulsing slowly like restrained hearts.

He stood before a cracked mirror. Not out of vanity — his kind didn’t reflect clearly, and he preferred it that way — but because the glass was old, coated with silver. It showed more than his face. In the mirror’s tarnished surface, he saw a flicker of the town’s pain. The dreams of sleeping children tangled with radio waves. The stuttering of misaligned signals from transistor radios left on in kitchens. All of it poured into the mirror’s depths, and in that maelstrom of whispers, he heard one voice cutting through like static on a dead channel.

Elsie.

She wasn’t gone, not yet. Trapped. Drifting. Pulled somewhere half-between the electromagnetic and the biological. Her mind cried out across the copper veins of Eldervale, faint and fragmented, but real.

Lucien’s jaw tightened. There were other rules at play now, older than the ones about thresholds and blood. Something had changed. He could feel it in the walls of his hideout, feel it in the way the air tasted metallic, as if a charge was suspended in every molecule.

By midday, the clouds had thickened again, low and yellowed like bruises pressed against the sky. Lucien climbed onto the roof of the old substation, his boots echoing against the rusted sheet metal. He lit a cigarette — not out of habit, but to test the wind. The smoke curled strangely, pulled downward rather than up. That confirmed it. The pull wasn’t from the mountains or the creek. It was subterranean. Something was building under the town.

He looked east toward the orphanage. It had been closed for years, the red brick walls half-consumed by ivy, the windows boarded up and tagged by local teens with spray paint and crude sigils they didn’t understand. But Lucien remembered the building when it had power. He had rewired it himself, back when he first arrived in Eldervale. The wiring there had always been strange — a different architecture, a different feel. It wasn’t municipal. It was ritualistic.

And it was active again.

The locks on the orphanage had rusted through, but someone had wedged a new chain through the handles. Someone cared enough to keep it sealed — or cared enough to keep something inside. Lucien didn’t bother with finesse. He wrapped one gloved hand around the chain and focused, his fingertips tingling with current. The links hissed and popped apart, molten metal spitting onto the concrete like angry bees.

Inside, the air was stale but charged. The wallpaper peeled in long yellow strips, the floorboards sagged
