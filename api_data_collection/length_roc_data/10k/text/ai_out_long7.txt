Title: A Contract of Stars

Chapter One: The Arrangement

The rain hammered the windows with a rhythmic persistence, each drop like a silent reminder that this was not the life either of them had imagined.

"You're late," said Cecily, her voice edged with more annoyance than concern, her slender fingers wrapped around a mug of steaming tea she had no intention of drinking. She sat with perfect posture in the antique chair by the fire, the flickering light casting a warm glow on her porcelain skin.

Caleb Walker, tall, disheveled, and exuding a careless charm that made most women ignore the tardiness, didn’t bother with excuses. He stepped inside, shaking the rain from his coat like a stray dog and hanging it on the brass rack beside the door.

“I’m here, aren’t I?”

She gave him a withering look but said nothing.

They had met only three times before, each instance orchestrated with clinical efficiency by their respective lawyers. A deal. A paper. A signature. Marriage as strategy. Cecily Langston needed stability in name and appearance to claim her inheritance; Caleb needed a way out of his mountain of debt. The arrangement suited them both—on paper.

“You remember the conditions?” she asked, finally setting the mug down with a click.

Caleb crossed the room, dragging a chair to sit across from her, his long legs sprawling inelegantly. “No sex, no romance, no scandals. You get your money, I get mine. Two years, then we go our separate ways. Simple.”

It was not simple. Nothing ever was.

Cecily studied him, wondering again if she had chosen too recklessly. He was a former photojournalist turned failed travel writer, with a reputation for unpredictability and an unfortunate affection for expensive whiskey.

“You’re not to bring anyone here,” she said, emphasizing each word. “This is my home. I don’t care who you entertain elsewhere, but this house is off-limits.”

He smirked. “You think I have a parade of lovers lining up for a piece of this mess?”

“Just be discreet.”

He leaned forward, his eyes catching the firelight. “What about you?”

“I don’t need lovers,” she said coldly. “I have ambition.”

They signed the final documents that night, the rain now a whisper against the roof. The house—her late grandmother’s estate in Sussex—loomed around them like a haunted thing, every creak a secret.

The next morning, Caleb found Cecily already dressed, her long dark hair tied back, her heels echoing in the marble hallway. She handed him a schedule.

“There are appearances to maintain. Events. We’ll need to be seen together. I’ve highlighted the important ones.”

He whistled low. “You’re serious about this.”

“I’m serious about everything.”

Chapter Two: The Wedding and the Stranger

The wedding was a quiet affair—civil, quick, and nearly joyless. A judge in a grey office. Two signatures, one stiff kiss on the cheek, and a photograph that would later be framed in gold and hung in the drawing room to complete the illusion.

Cecily wore cream silk and didn’t smile. Caleb wore a wrinkled navy suit and sunglasses inside.

Afterward, they went to a restaurant neither had chosen. She ordered a salad; he ordered three drinks.

“So this is married life,” he said, swirling the amber liquid in his glass.

“Stop drawing attention,” she hissed. “We’re still in the public eye.”

But the only person who noticed was a woman at the bar—red-lipped, sharp-eyed, and far too interested.

Caleb caught her gaze and quickly looked away.

“You know her?” Cecily asked, noticing the flicker in his expression.

“No.”

She didn’t believe him, but she didn’t press. Later, she would remember that woman.

Chapter Three: Echoes of the Past

They lived as strangers, passing in the hallway, speaking only when necessary. Caleb occupied the east wing. Cecily the west.

Sometimes, at night, she heard him moving—soft footsteps across creaking wood, a door opening, the sound of a bottle uncorking. He was restless. Always had been.

One evening she found him in the garden, staring at the stars. He didn’t turn as she approached.

“You used to photograph war zones,” she said, unexpectedly.

He glanced at her. “I did.”

“Why’d you stop?”

He shrugged. “The world got tired of bleeding.”

She sat beside him, careful not to let their bodies touch. “And now you’re here.”

“Married to a stranger with a prettier house than most embassies I’ve slept in.”

For a moment, she almost smiled.

Chapter Four: The Rules Bend

The first crack appeared on a Wednesday in March.

They had to attend a charity gala in London. She wore navy velvet; he wore a tux that fit surprisingly well. They posed for photographs, hands linked, smiles tight.

But inside, under the crystal chandeliers, something shifted.

“You clean up well,” Cecily admitted over champagne.

“So do you,” he said, and meant it.

They danced, for appearance, she told herself. For show. But the way his hand settled on her waist and the way she leaned slightly into him—those weren’t rehearsed.

Later, in the car, silence hung between them like heavy smoke.

“Don’t read into it,” she said.

“I won’t if you won’t.”

Chapter Five: Entanglements

Caleb began writing again. Essays. Letters. Mostly unsent.

Cecily began dreaming—of doors that wouldn’t open, of voices calling her name.

One day, she caught him on the phone. The red-lipped woman’s name was Mara. His voice dropped when he said it, soft like a secret.

“Old friend,” he explained when he saw her.

She nodded, but didn’t believe it.

The next week, she called her lawyer. “If I were to dissolve the agreement early—”

He warned her. It would jeopardize the inheritance. Appearances must be maintained.

So she stayed. And watched. And waited.

And sometimes, at night, she stood outside his door, hand raised, too afraid to knock.

Chapter Six: Breakage

It was a letter that did it.

She found it in his drawer—addressed to Mara, unsent.

"I never meant to stay. But she surprises me, Mara. Not in ways that make sense, but in ways that matter."

Cecily read it twice.

When Caleb came home that night, she was waiting.

“I found your letter.”

He froze. “I didn’t send it.”

“But you wrote it.”

He didn’t deny it.

“What are we doing, Caleb?”

He looked tired, more real than she’d ever seen him. “Surviving.”

She stepped closer. “I don’t want to survive. I want to live.”

They stood too close. Her hand brushed his.

This was not the arrangement.

But then again, neither were they.

The first real argument came before the end of their first week as husband and wife. It was over a vase—specifically, a seventeenth-century Delft ceramic with tiny blue windmills etched along the base, which Caleb knocked over while trying to hang one of his framed photographs in the hallway. Cecily found him on the floor, kneeling amidst the shattered pieces, an expression of genuine remorse on his face, though she suspected more from surprise than guilt.

“That vase was an heirloom,” she said, her tone glacial, though her hands trembled at her sides. “My grandmother brought it back from Amsterdam in 1954.”

Caleb stood, brushing his palms against his jeans. “I didn’t do it on purpose. I was trying to—” He waved at the bare wall, where a crooked nail now jutted out uselessly. “I thought this place needed something less... dead.”

“You don’t get to decide that,” she snapped, stepping closer. “This is my home. You live here by agreement, not by right.”

He studied her for a moment, eyes narrowing just slightly. “You think I don’t know that?”

A silence grew between them, thick and charged. She held his gaze, refusing to blink. The air smelled of dust and ceramic powder and something unspoken.

He turned and walked away, his shoulders tense beneath his thin sweater, and didn’t say another word. That night, he didn’t come back to the house until long after midnight. She heard the front door creak open, heard his footsteps stumble through the foyer, and imagined the scent of whiskey on his breath.

The next morning, the pieces of the vase were gone. In their place, she found a new one—a cheap imitation, glossy and bright, with a tag from a tourist shop in Brighton still attached to the base. It was petty, perhaps, but it made her laugh. Just once.

**

The estate, once vibrant under her grandmother’s care, had grown stagnant over the years. Cecily had inherited it with little more than a whisper from the lawyers and a sealed envelope from the old woman’s private desk. Inside was a photograph: her grandmother in her youth, smiling beside a man Cecily didn’t recognize, a house much like this one in the background. On the back, in faded ink, were five words: “Everything worth having costs something.”

She hadn’t known what that meant at the time. She still wasn’t sure.

Caleb, despite his lack of refinement, slowly began making himself useful. He fixed the leaky pipe in the conservatory, patched a crack in the library’s ceiling, and trimmed back the ivy choking the eastern façade. He never asked permission, and she never offered thanks. Still, it surprised her, how capable he was, how his hands—scarred and weathered—seemed to know the language of tools and old wood.

One afternoon she found him in the garden again, sleeves rolled to his elbows, dirt under his fingernails.

“You could hire someone to do that,” she said, standing on the stone steps in her usual pressed trousers and blouse, arms crossed loosely.

He didn’t look up. “I don’t like people in my space.”

“It’s my space,” she reminded him.

He paused then, looking up with a half-smile. “Then why are you out here?”

She didn’t answer, and he went back to work.

That night, at dinner—a formality they had begun observing once a week—they sat across from one another in the small dining room that looked out over the orchard. The air between them was less strained than usual.

“Do you miss it?” she asked suddenly, surprising even herself.

“Miss what?”

“Photography. Your work.”

Caleb chewed slowly, then wiped his mouth with a linen napkin. “Ever
