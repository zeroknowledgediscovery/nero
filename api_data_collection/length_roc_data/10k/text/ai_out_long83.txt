Chapter One: The Stranger on the Porch

The rain had started hours ago, a quiet drizzle at first, barely audible against the rustling dry leaves that carpeted the narrow front yard. By evening, it had swelled into a full-downpour, a heavy curtain of water that blurred the world outside the small bungalow on Taylor Avenue. Streetlamps flickered yellow halos into the night, casting the sidewalk into strange, shifting shadows.

Carmen wiped her hands on the hem of her hoodie and glanced through the peephole. The figure standing outside had been there for five solid minutes, unmoving. Just the outline of a woman — maybe mid-thirties, hard to say in the dim light — standing still under a red umbrella. Carmen's heart thudded. She glanced back down the hall. The twins were still on the couch, heads bowed over their tablets, the blue glow painting their faces like ghosts.

“Stay here,” she called, her voice unsteady. She unlocked the door and opened it just a crack.

“Can I help you?”

The woman looked up. She was soaked, despite the umbrella, with dark curls plastered to her forehead and cheeks flushed from the cold. There was something brittle in her eyes, something almost wild.

“You don’t know me,” the woman began, “but I—I need to ask you for something.”

Carmen tightened her grip on the door.

“You have the wrong house.”

“No,” the woman said quickly. “I know it’s strange. I know how it looks. But please—hear me out.”

A car passed, hissing through the wet street, and for a moment neither of them spoke.

“My name’s Lydia.” She paused. “I don’t have any family left. And I don’t have time. I need someone to take care of my kids.”

Carmen’s stomach dropped. The door started to close instinctively, but Lydia reached forward—not threatening, just a hand out, trembling.

“Please. Just listen for a minute.”

Carmen hadn’t meant to let her in. She would tell herself that for weeks, for months after. But Lydia had said “kids,” plural, and something about that had cracked open a hollow place inside Carmen that she hadn’t touched in years.

The living room was dim and warm, a contrast to the cold rain outside. Carmen made tea without asking, the way you do when you’re stalling, and Lydia sat on the edge of the couch like she was afraid it would bite her.

“They’re asleep. In the car,” Lydia said quietly.

“You left your kids in the car?”

“I needed to know if you’d even open the door first.” She didn’t flinch under Carmen’s stare. “I didn’t come here randomly. I’ve been watching. You’ve got your own—what are they, twins?”

Carmen didn’t answer.

“You keep them fed. You don’t yell in the yard. You walk them to school when it’s warm. I’ve seen enough bad to know when something’s… less bad.”

“That’s not exactly a glowing review.”

Lydia cracked a ghost of a smile. “It’s all I’ve got. Look—this isn’t a forever thing. Just… a few days. I can’t explain. I need to go somewhere, and I can’t take them with me.”

“Then take them to a shelter. Or the police.”

“They’d separate them.”

Carmen sipped her tea and didn’t reply.

Lydia reached into her coat and pulled out an envelope. Thick. Sealed with tape. She dropped it on the coffee table.

“There’s money in there. Enough for food. Rent for a few weeks if you want. I’ll be back. I swear it.”

“Do you even know who I am?”

“No,” Lydia said. “But I know how you look at your own kids. And I know I’ve run out of other options.”

Carmen stood under the awning watching the car’s brake lights fade into the rainy distance. She couldn’t believe she was doing this. Her brain screamed at her to call someone, to report it, to fix it the right way.

Instead, she opened the backseat and peered in.

The boy stirred first—dark-haired, maybe six, with a streak of dried blood on his cheek. The girl was younger, maybe four, curled around a stuffed fox like it was her only lifeline.

“Hi,” Carmen whispered. “I’m—uh—I’m Carmen. Let’s get you inside.”

The boy looked at her with open distrust, but didn’t fight. The girl didn’t wake up at all, just whimpered as Carmen lifted her.

She carried them both through the rain, wondering what the hell she’d just signed up for.

By morning, it was clear nothing about Lydia's story was going to be easy.

The boy’s name was Micah. He wouldn’t tell her the girl’s name at first, just said “she’s my sister.” He watched everything, didn’t cry, didn’t smile. Carmen recognized the look. It was the same one she’d seen in the mirror after her ex left.

She gave them cereal. Found old clothes from the twins’ smaller years. Called in sick from work.

That night, after her kids were asleep, Carmen opened the envelope Lydia had left.

There was cash. A lot of it. A crumpled photo of the two children in front of a worn-down house. And a note.

Don’t try to find me. Don’t trust anyone who asks about them. Keep them safe. Especially from the man with the silver wristwatch. - L

Carmen stared at the note for a long time. The handwriting was messy. Uneven. Rushed.

Then she turned off the light and went to bed with a kitchen knife under her pillow.

Over the next few days, the strangers became less strange. Carmen’s twins, Zoe and Ella, adapted quickly—too quickly, Carmen thought sometimes. They liked the idea of new playmates, even if Micah hardly ever spoke. The little girl, whose name turned out to be Rowan, followed Carmen everywhere. Watched her like a shadow. Flinched if someone raised their voice, even on TV.

Then came the knock at the door.

Not hard. Not loud. But deliberate.

Carmen froze in the hallway. Micah immediately pulled Rowan behind him, toward the kitchen.

Through the peephole, she saw a man in a gray suit. Bald. Tall. Calm. On his left wrist, a silver watch gleamed in the sunlight.

She didn’t answer.

The man waited. Knocked once more. Then left.

When she opened the door a crack, a white card lay on the mat. No name. Just an address. No message.

She burned it in the sink.

Carmen tried calling shelters. Schools. Missing persons lines. Nothing. No one matching Lydia’s description. No police reports on Micah or Rowan. No trace.

She asked Micah once, carefully, who the man with the silver watch was.

He looked her dead in the eyes and said, “He’s the reason Mommy ran.”

That night, she pushed the couch against the front door.

Weeks passed. The money lasted longer than she expected. Zoe and Ella went back to school. Carmen took up part-time remote work again. Micah started talking a little. Rowan laughed once, then not again for a long time.

Then one day, Carmen opened her email and found a message with no sender.

Subject line: “You can’t keep them hidden.”

And the only thing in the body of the message was:

You’re not the only one watching.

She stared at it for a long time before slamming the laptop shut.

That night, Lydia came back.

Bleeding.

And not alone.

Carmen hadn’t locked the door. She didn’t know why—habit maybe, or foolish hope—but when the knob turned just after midnight and the hinges gave a soft creak, she was already awake on the couch, heart thudding under the too-thin blanket. The living room lamp threw a pale glow across the floor, highlighting every slow footstep.

Lydia stepped inside, limping, her left hand clutching her side. Her coat was soaked through, stuck to her skin, and blood had begun to dry in thick patches along the seam near her ribs. Her hair hung loose in wild tangles, and her eyes darted toward the hallway.

“They okay?” she croaked.

“They’re asleep,” Carmen said, getting to her feet.

Lydia gave a slow nod and then collapsed onto the couch, gasping. Carmen knelt beside her without thinking. “What happened?”

“I didn’t have time,” Lydia said, wincing as she tried to sit up straighter. “They found me. I got away, but not clean.”

“I should call someone. A doctor—”

“No. No hospitals. Please.”

There was a desperate edge in Lydia’s voice that left no room for argument. Carmen hesitated, then went to fetch a towel and a bottle of peroxide from under the bathroom sink. The blood was mostly superficial—shallow cuts, bruising along the ribs, some deeper gouges on her back. She worked quickly and quietly, the sting of antiseptic sharp in the air.

“They sent someone here,” Carmen said at last, not looking up. “Tall guy. Bald. Silver watch.”

Lydia’s entire body went rigid.

“Did he talk to the kids?” she asked.

“No. Just left a card on the mat. Blank except an address.”

Lydia exhaled, low and rough. “Then we’ve got time. Not much, but some.”

“You said a few days,” Carmen said. “It’s been two weeks.”

“I know. I didn’t think they’d be that fast. Thought I had more time to throw them off.”

Carmen threw the bloodied towel in the laundry basket and sat across from her. “Who are you, Lydia? Who’s after you?”

Lydia looked at her for a long moment. Then she leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper.

“They think I stole something. But I didn’t. I only found it.”

“Found what?”

“Proof. Names. Transfers. It was buried—old records from a place I used to work. A facility upstate. A private contractor, supposedly medical, but really just another front for them. The whole thing was a shell game. Illegal testing. Disappearing people. Kids.”

Carmen’s skin prickled.

“I was a data clerk. They didn’t think I mattered. But I saw things. I made a copy of a few files. Thought maybe I’d take it to the press. Then I realized people who tried that had a tendency to vanish.”

“And you had kids.”

“Exactly,” Lydia said. “Micah was born while I was still there. Rowan came after. Once I saw what they did to the others—children—God, I couldn’t risk staying. So I ran.”

Carmen was silent. She wanted to doubt it, needed to for her own sanity, but something in Lydia’s eyes told her it wasn’t a fantasy. The kind of fear that lived in the bones.

“You think they want the kids?”

“I think they want silence,” Lydia said. “And my kids are the only leverage they need.”

In the days that followed, Carmen felt the ground beneath her life shift in
