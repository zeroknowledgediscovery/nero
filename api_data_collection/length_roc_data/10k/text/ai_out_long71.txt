Chapter One: The Thumping Wall

The first time Isaac heard it, he thought it was the pipes. Not unheard of—old buildings in East Ridge had a reputation. His apartment, 3B, rattled when the heater kicked on in winter and groaned from the ceiling when the wind blew just right. But this was different. The noise was sharp, rhythmic. Not quite banging, not quite knocking. A hollow, deliberate thump, like a fist striking drywall once every few seconds. Then silence.

Then again. Thump. Pause. Thump.

It was two in the morning. He sat up in bed, pulse already racing before his thoughts caught up. He glanced at the clock, then at the pale rectangle of the window, where the city beyond glowed a dim orange through the dirty pane. The sound wasn’t coming from outside.

Next door—Apartment 3C.

Isaac had lived in 3B for nearly five months. The neighbor in 3C was a mystery. A man, he thought, although he'd never been certain. The apartment had been quiet for most of the time he’d lived here. No music, no shouting, no footsteps or plumbing sounds. Once or twice, he thought he’d caught a glimpse of someone entering the unit late at night—tall, always in a coat regardless of weather, key ready before they reached the door. Not unusual for the city, and not the sort of thing Isaac usually paid attention to. But something about 3C had always felt... thin. Like the walls of that unit weren’t quite as real as the rest of the building.

Tonight, the wall between them seemed suddenly much too close.

He got out of bed, padded over in bare feet, and pressed his ear against the drywall. It was cold. For a moment, nothing—then again:

Thump.
Pause.
Thump.

Then a new sound: a scrape, something dragging. Wood on wood? Metal? Hard to tell. Isaac's breath fogged slightly against the paint as he leaned in further, trying to discern any hint of speech or movement.

Nothing.

Then, abruptly, a low voice—muffled, too distorted to make out words, but unmistakably a voice. Male. Then a second, higher, faster, anxious. Two voices, one calm, one afraid. He jerked back, heart in his throat.

The noise stopped.

The next morning, Isaac stared at the wall while eating cereal, spoon hovering just above the bowl. In the daylight, the idea of hearing voices through the wall seemed ridiculous. He had been dreaming. Or maybe his neighbor had a television on late. Yeah. A film, maybe something weird and atmospheric.

But it hadn't sounded like a film. It had sounded close. Like the speakers were pressed directly to the wall—or like the people themselves were standing right on the other side.

The cereal went soggy. He let the spoon sink.

That evening, after work, he stood outside 3C’s door for a full minute before knocking. The hallway was narrow and painted in a strange shade of green, the kind that always looked slightly wet. A fluorescent bulb flickered above. He knocked. Lightly at first. Then again.

No answer.

He leaned in, tried to listen.

Silence.

He waited another moment, then turned to leave. As he did, a sound came from within—not the thumping, not even a voice. Just the creak of a floorboard. A single footstep, slow and deliberate.

He froze.

“Hello?” he called. “Sorry to bother—just... heard something last night. Everything okay in there?”

Nothing.

Then, just as he was about to leave, a reply—faint, dry, low.

“I’m fine.”

That was it. Three syllables, nothing more.

Isaac stood frozen for another beat. Then turned and walked quickly back to his apartment, not stopping until the lock clicked shut behind him.

He didn't sleep well that night. He dreamt of walls that pulsed like skin, of doors that opened without knobs. In the dream, he stood in his hallway while the building stretched around him, reshaping itself floor by floor. From behind the door of 3C, someone whispered his name. Not once. Repeated, over and over, gaining pitch with each pass. He awoke covered in sweat, the thumping echo still ringing in his ears.

Two days passed without incident. He told himself it had been nothing—a weird night, a sleep-deprived overreaction. He focused on work, ate dinner in front of his laptop, and tried not to glance too long at the shared wall. But on the third night, it began again.

The same rhythm. Thump. Pause. Thump.

He turned off his lights and sat in the dark, listening.

No voices this time, but the dragging sound returned, followed by something new—a wet noise, soft and awful. Like fabric being pulled from mud.

He stood, unable to sit still anymore, and grabbed his phone.

Recording might help. Proof. Evidence.

He pressed record and moved toward the wall, holding his breath.

The noise stopped.

Then, through the drywall, a sharp sound—like fingernails raking slowly down the inside of the wall. His recording captured it: a dry scrape, unmistakable. He yanked the phone away from the wall, and the sound stopped instantly.

The next morning, he went to the building manager.

Carlos was older, tired-looking, and mostly interested in things that didn’t involve tenant complaints. Still, when Isaac mentioned odd noises from next door, Carlos frowned.

“3C?” he asked. “You sure?”

Isaac nodded. “Yeah. Weird banging, dragging stuff, voices. It’s... I don’t know, something’s off.”

Carlos scratched his chin. “We don’t have anyone on file for 3C.”

Isaac blinked. “What?”

“No lease signed. Not for a while. Last one was three years ago, some guy—forgot his name. Paid six months in cash, left after a week. Since then? Nothing.”

“But someone’s living there.”

Carlos shrugged. “Not according to our books.”

Isaac returned home unsettled. The hallway felt darker. The door to 3C looked unchanged, but now he saw it differently—not as a neighbor’s entrance, but as a sealed gate. A lid on something buried.

He didn’t sleep that night. Not deeply. But at some point, he must’ve drifted off.

He woke to knocking.

Not on his door.

On the inside of his wall.

Five sharp knocks. Close. Then silence.

He approached the wall slowly, dread thick in his throat. As he neared, the knocks repeated, then paused.

Then a voice.

Not muffled. Not distant.

Clear.

Right next to his ear.

“Let me in.”

Isaac stumbled back, heart pounding.

Then he did something he hadn’t intended—he knocked back. Three quick raps.

For a moment, nothing.

Then from the other side:

Knock.
Knock.
Knock.

In perfect response.

Isaac stood frozen, hand still raised.

He hadn’t imagined it. Something—someone—was on the other side.

And they were listening.

Isaac barely slept the rest of that night. He spent the early hours pacing his small living room, glancing at the wall between units every few minutes as if it might open or bleed or speak. The silence after the final knock was even worse than the noise—it hung thick and expectant, like the pause in a horror film before the scream. At one point, near dawn, he caught himself pressing his fingers lightly against the drywall again, waiting for a pulse.

He laughed. A short, raw sound. Then stopped when he heard something shift beyond the wall.

No more knocks came, but the silence felt charged.

By seven a.m., he’d showered, dressed, and gathered a backpack full of excuses to stay out: laptop, charger, a novel he hadn’t touched in months, and a granola bar. He left without looking back at the hallway door.

The city helped. For a while.

He worked from a café downtown, a place with soft jazz playing and too many windows. He kept checking his phone, replaying the voice he’d recorded the night before. It was faint, but clear:

“Let me in.”

He couldn’t decide what chilled him more—that the voice seemed to be asking, or that it knew he was there to hear it.

By midday, he debated showing the recording to someone. Police? Ridiculous. What would he say—there’s a ghost in my wall? A squatter whispering bedtime requests? Maybe the landlord again, but Carlos had barely blinked before. It was just as likely he’d think Isaac was pulling a prank.

In the end, he did nothing.

He stayed out until the sun was gone, dinner eaten on a bench in the park, watching strangers walk dogs and argue on phones and live lives that didn’t brush against hidden voices or knocking walls.

Still, the thought of his apartment waited for him, coiled and patient.

He came back just after nine, gripping the doorknob to 3B longer than necessary before pushing inside. The air felt wrong. Too still, like the apartment had been holding its breath while he was gone.

Everything looked the same—sofa, shelves, dishes in the sink—but the atmosphere was off-kilter. He crossed the living room slowly, paused near the wall that bordered 3C. Nothing. No sounds. No knocks. No whispers.

He waited. And waited longer.

Eventually, convinced he was just worked up from no sleep and too much caffeine, he turned on a movie and tried to relax. Horror, of all things. Something vintage. He liked the way the grain softened everything, even the fear.

It was almost midnight when the picture on the screen began to glitch—just a flicker at first. He thought it might be his streaming service acting up. But then it happened again. And again. Until, instead of the film, the screen went white.

Then black.

Then the sound came.

Not from the movie.

From the wall.

A voice again, clearer this time. No distortion, no drywall to muffle it.

“You’re awake.”

He turned slowly, the remote slipping from his fingers.

The voice wasn’t just near. It was in the room.

He checked the window—closed. The hallway—empty. But the air felt thick again, humid, and humming.

He stared at the wall. No voice followed. No repetition.

Only that single sentence, left hanging.

He picked up his phone, pressed record again, and whispered, “Who are you?”

At first, nothing.

Then a sound, like breath.
Then—

“I remember you.”

He dropped the phone.

The voice wasn’t threatening. It wasn’t kind either. It was full of something else.

Recognition.

The next morning, Isaac stayed home.

It wasn’t a decision he made—he just
