The public has already learned those particulars       of the crime which came out in the police investigation, but a       good deal was suppressed upon that occasion, since the case for       the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not       necessary to bring forward all the facts. Only now, at the end of       nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those missing links       which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. The crime was       of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to me       compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the       greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life.       Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I       think of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy,       amazement, and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind. Let       me say to that public, which has shown some interest in those       glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and       actions of a very remarkable man, that they are not to blame me       if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I should have       considered it my first duty to do so, had I not been barred by a       positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn       upon the third of last month.        It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes       had interested me deeply in crime, and that after his       disappearance I never failed to read with care the various       problems which came before the public. And I even attempted, more       than once, for my own private satisfaction, to employ his methods       in their solution, though with indifferent success. There was       none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald       Adair. As I read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a       verdict of willful murder against some person or persons unknown,       I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss which the       community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes. There       were points about this strange business which would, I was sure,       have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police       would have been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by       the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal       agent in Europe. All day, as I drove upon my round, I turned over       the case in my mind and found no explanation which appeared to me       to be adequate. At the risk of telling a twice-told tale, I will       recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the       conclusion of the inquest.        The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of       Maynooth, at that time governor of one of the Australian       colonies. Adair’s mother had returned from Australia to undergo       the operation for cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her       daughter Hilda were living together at 427, Park Lane. The youth       moved in the best society—had, so far as was known, no enemies       and no particular vices. He had been engaged to Miss Edith       Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by       mutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it       had left any very profound feeling behind it. For the rest, the       man’s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his       habits were quiet and his nature unemotional. Yet it was upon       this easy-going young aristocrat that death came, in most strange       and unexpected form, between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty       on the night of March 30, 1894.        Ronald Adair was fond of cards—playing continually, but never for       such stakes as would hurt him. He was a member of the Baldwin,       the Cavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs. It was shown that,       after dinner on the day of his death, he had played a rubber of       whist at the latter club. He had also played there in the       afternoon. The evidence of those who had played with him—Mr.       Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran—showed that the game       was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards.       Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more. His fortune was       a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way affect       him. He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he       was a cautious player, and usually rose a winner. It came out in       evidence that, in partnership with Colonel Moran, he had actually       won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting, some       weeks before, from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral. So much for       his recent history as it came out at the inquest.        On the evening of the crime, he returned from the club exactly at       ten. His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a       relation. The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front       room on the second floor, generally used as his sitting-room. She       had lit a fire there, and as it smoked she had opened the window.       No sound was heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the hour of       the return of Lady Maynooth and her daughter. Desiring to say       good-night, she attempted to enter her son’s room. The door was       locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to their cries       and knocking. Help was obtained, and the door forced. The       unfortunate young man was found lying near the table. His head       had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but       no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room. On the table       lay two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in       silver and gold, the money arranged in little piles of varying       amount. There were some figures also upon a sheet of paper, with       the names of some club friends opposite to them, from which it       was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make       out his losses or winnings at cards.        A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the       case more complex. In the first place, no reason could be given       why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside.       There was the possibility that the murderer had done this, and       had afterwards escaped by the window. The drop was at least       twenty feet, however, and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay       beneath. Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of       having been disturbed, nor were there any marks upon the narrow       strip of grass which separated the house from the road.       Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had       fastened the door. But how did he come by his death? No one could       have climbed up to the window without leaving traces. Suppose a       man had fired through the window, he would indeed be a remarkable       shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound. Again,       Park Lane is a frequented thoroughfare; there is a cab stand       within a hundred yards of the house. No one had heard a shot. And       yet there was the dead man and there the revolver bullet, which       had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so inflicted       a wound which must have caused instantaneous death. Such were the       circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery, which were further       complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said,       young Adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had       been made to remove the money or valuables in the room.        All day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit       upon some theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that       line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be       the starting-point of every investigation. I confess that I made       little progress. In the evening I strolled across the Park, and       found myself about six o’clock at the Oxford Street end of Park       Lane. A group of loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a       particular window, directed me to the house which I had come to       see. A tall, thin man with coloured glasses, whom I strongly       suspected of being a plain-clothes detective, was pointing out       some theory of his own, while the others crowded round to listen       to what he said. I got as near him as I could, but his       observations seemed to me to be absurd, so I withdrew again in       some disgust. As I did so I struck against an elderly, deformed       man, who had been behind me, and I knocked down several books       which he was carrying. I remember that as I picked them up, I       observed the title of one of them, _The Origin of Tree Worship_,       and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile,       who, either as a trade or as a hobby, was a collector of obscure       volumes. I endeavoured to apologize for the accident, but it was       evident that these books which I had so unfortunately maltreated       were very precious ob
