Title: Ashes of the Fallen

Chapter One: The Cracked Mirror

Rain fell in a slow, steady rhythm against the cobblestone streets of Delharrow, painting the ancient city in shades of grey. The gutters overflowed, sweeping away leaves, grime, and the silence that had hung for weeks over its narrow alleyways. Smoke twisted up from a dozen chimneys, curling and merging with the clouds above like forgotten dreams exhaled in despair. Beneath a crooked eave at the edge of Ash Market, a man stirred.

He wasn’t much to look at. Coat too large, eyes too dark, beard tangled like the brambles that clawed at the city’s crumbling walls. His name was Elias Vane—once a captain of the Royal Guard, once a man feared and revered across the realm. Now? Just another shadow.

“Captain?” came a voice, hesitant and brittle.

Elias flinched. That title was a dagger. He turned slowly, eyes narrowing until he saw her—little Clara Bell, no older than twelve, lantern in hand, flame flickering with each gust of wind. She had a bruise on her cheek, fresh, and wore no shoes.

“I’m no captain,” Elias muttered, dragging himself to his feet. He leaned heavily on a cane, though he needed it more for memory than support. “Go home.”

Clara sniffled. “Don’t got one.”

“Then find a better alley.”

She didn't leave. Just stood there in the rain, as if she knew something he didn’t. Elias grumbled, turned away, and limped off toward the old bridge where the beggars kept their watch and the drink flowed in hidden bottles. But the girl’s stare clung to his back like guilt.

The days in Delharrow bled together like bruises on skin. Elias haunted the corners of taverns and the underside of bridges, clutching at the past like a talisman he hated but couldn’t throw away. He saw them sometimes—ghosts in the faces of passersby. Men he’d led into the fire. Women whose homes he’d shattered in the name of the King’s Peace.

The truth was simpler: Elias had killed too many to ever be clean again.

But redemption, like rot, creeps in unseen.

“Found this,” Clara said a week later, dropping a torn parchment into his lap. They were sitting in an abandoned stable, firelight dancing on rotted wood. Elias looked at it with bleary eyes. A map. No, a wanted poster.

“Darian Cross,” he murmured.

“You know him?”

He did. Once, they had sworn the same oaths. Cross was the one who broke them first.

“Where’d you get this?”

“Stole it off a merchant’s wagon. They’re offering two hundred crowns for his head.”

Elias studied the paper for a long while. Cross was more than a bounty. He was the last living link to everything Elias had destroyed—and the one man who could testify that Elias hadn’t committed the Blackgate massacre. That had been Cross’s work, though the world remembered it differently.

“Why’d you bring this to me?”

Clara shrugged. “You looked like someone who needed a reason.”

A bitter laugh escaped him. “What makes you think I want to clear my name?”

She didn’t answer. Didn’t need to.

Elias found his sword buried under floorboards in a burned-out chapel. The blade was chipped, the hilt wrapped in decaying leather, but it still felt right in his hand. He named it Silence, for that was what it had always brought.

He and Clara traveled light—her with a small satchel of stolen bread and marbles, him with the sword and an ache in his knees. They followed whispers across the provinces: Cross had been seen in Haventown, then Wyr’s End, then beyond the Great Scar.

At each stop, Elias encountered pieces of his past—survivors of campaigns, tavern songs about his betrayal, monuments to dead soldiers whose eyes he still saw in dreams.

In Wyr’s End, they found a man with no ears and a dozen scars across his chest.

“You were with Vane,” Elias said, staring him down.

The man looked up, wide-eyed. “No. I was with Cross. But I saw you—at Blackgate. You tried to stop it.”

Elias’s heart stuttered.

“You ran toward the fire. He… he turned the archers on your own men.”

So the truth was still alive, buried in broken men and forgotten places. It was more than Elias had hoped for. He left the man with a coin and a whispered thanks.

In time, Clara grew to handle a knife well enough to skin rabbits and fend off drunken hands. She rarely smiled. Elias had taken to calling her “little soldier,” though she’d never fought in any war but hunger. Sometimes she asked him what he would do if he caught Cross. He never answered directly.

“Will you kill him?”

She asked it one night as they camped by the ruins of Fallow Bridge, where the crows outnumbered the people.

“I don’t know,” Elias said. “He deserves worse. But maybe I do, too.”

She didn’t say anything. Just curled up beside the fire, back to him. Elias sat awake for hours, listening to the wind whistle through broken stones.

They found Cross in the city of Brathmoor, hiding behind a title—Lord Darian of the Eastern Reach. He’d grown fat, slick with coin and favor. The people loved him; he’d funded orphanages, rebuilt half the town square. But his eyes, when they locked with Elias’s across the crowd, were the same cold steel.

Elias didn’t draw his blade that day. Not in the open. Not while Clara clung to his coat and the crowd mistook him for a vagrant.

“I need to think,” he whispered.

That night, Elias dreamt of fire. Of Blackgate. Of screaming. His own voice echoing through the flames: No! Stand down! And Cross, laughing.

When he woke, Clara was gone.

He found her in Cross’s manor, bloody knife in hand, face pale.

“I tried,” she said, shaking. “I couldn’t. I saw his eyes. He looked like you.”

Guards were shouting now. Elias pulled her close, blade drawn. They fought their way out, blood on the walls, Clara sobbing.

Later, as dawn broke over the hills outside Brathmoor, Elias held her hand in silence.

“I don’t want revenge,” he said finally. “Not anymore. I want truth. And I want you to have a better world.”

“Then we make one,” she said, voice ragged.

By the time the sun rose fully, Cross had fled. But Elias no longer chased him for redemption. He chased him for justice.

And for Clara.

This was no longer a tale of one broken man. It was a story being rewritten, line by jagged line.

Chapter Two: Blood and Oaths

Elias stood beneath the gallows tree, the noose above swaying gently in the wind like some perverse pendulum measuring guilt. Clara sat on a nearby rock, chewing a strip of dried venison and watching him with the same expression she always did when he slipped too far into memory—half worry, half annoyance.

He rubbed the twisted scar across his wrist, a relic from the war against the Fane Rebellion. A dozen years and still the flesh remembered. The oak tree here in Dredmoor’s Hollow had once held thirty rebels. Now only silence remained, and a few shattered bones buried in the dirt. It wasn’t the rebels he remembered, though—it was the orders. "No survivors," the general had said. And Elias, ever obedient, had complied.

Until Cross.

“Any signs?” Clara asked, tossing a stone toward the base of the tree.

Elias shook his head. “Cross didn’t come this way.”

“Then why are we here?”

He looked down the slope toward the ruins of a small village barely visible through the morning fog. “Because this is where the lies started.”

In the old village tavern, now roofless and taken over by moss and squirrels, Elias found what he didn’t know he’d been seeking—a journal, weather-worn and mostly illegible. Tucked in the eaves, wrapped in oilskin. The name on the cover was “Lareen Vane.” His wife.

He froze.

Clara knelt beside him. “That hers?”

He nodded. Hands shaking, he opened to a still-legible page.

    Elias says he can’t sleep. The screams won’t stop. He drinks more now, but I see him flinch when the wind howls like a dying man. I told him to leave the Guard. He laughed. Said you don’t walk away from blood like that. You drown in it, or learn to breathe.

He closed the journal and slipped it into his coat.

“Come on,” he said, voice hoarse. “We have to go.”

They traveled east toward the Erengate Mountains, past rivers swollen with spring melt and forests teeming with wild dogs. In the town of Harneswell, a guard recognized Elias.

“You’re the Blackgate butcher,” the man spat, hand on his blade.

Elias didn’t fight. He let them bind his hands and drag him through the mud. Clara screamed at them, kicked one in the shin. It took three guards to pry her off.

The jail was damp, cold, full of the kind of silence that whispers things no one wants to hear.

“I’m trying,” Elias said aloud, though no one was listening. “I’m trying to fix it.”

Later that night, a man came to see him. Tall, thin, with hair like ink and eyes that didn’t blink enough. He wore robes instead of armor, which somehow made him more threatening.

“You’re Elias Vane,” he said. Not a question.

“I am.”

“I’m Magistrate Talven of the Circle. We’ve been watching.”

Elias raised an eyebrow. “That meant to scare me?”

Talven tilted his head. “You’re a piece on the board, Captain. Some want you dead. Others want to use you. The Circle prefers clarity. Kill Cross. Bring us proof. Your name is cleared.”

Elias scoffed. “You think I care about a name?”

“No,” Talven said, standing. “But that girl traveling with you? Clara? She does. And if you fail, she’ll hang beside you.”

He left the door unlocked.

Clara met him at the edge of town, a knife in one hand and his pack in the other. “Next time you get arrested, I’m charging bail.”

“Deal.”

“Where now?”

Elias looked at the horizon. “South. There's an old friend there. If he’s still alive, he’ll know where Cross went.”

“You have friends?”

He smirked. “One. And he owes me a favor.”

The road south was less a road and more a series of potholes strung together by memories. They camped in the wreckage of old battlefields, ate under the stars, and told stories neither of them believed.

“Why’d you join the Guard?” Clara asked once.

Elias hesitated. “Because I thought I could protect people.”

“Did you?”
