Chapter One: The Crack in the Glass

Eleanor Sharpe had always trusted the night. It blanketed her town like an old, familiar quilt—patchy in places, but warm enough. The darkness came with the same rhythm each evening: porch lights flickering on, the whir of air conditioners quieting as temperatures dropped, dogs barking distantly, then silence. And yet, that Tuesday evening, something felt wrong.

It started with the window. The one in the hallway outside her bedroom.

She noticed it around 10:17 p.m., on her way back from brushing her teeth. The hallway was dim, lit only by the soft glow of a nightlight plugged in near the floor. She didn’t stop at first, not until she caught a sliver of movement—or the absence of it. A shadow that shouldn’t have shifted the way it did. She paused. Stepped back.

The window looked normal enough. Double-paned, a little dusty on the inside where she hadn’t cleaned in a few weeks. But there was a crack. Thin, almost invisible, like a silver thread sewn into the glass. She crouched, squinting. It hadn’t been there yesterday.

Eleanor pressed her finger lightly to the glass. Cold. She could feel the tiny ridge where the fracture began, trailing down like a vine. It wasn’t a stress crack. It was precise, deliberate, and curved oddly, like something had etched it with intent.

She stood, heart pacing faster than before. The house was old—1919, Victorian, inherited from her grandmother and full of quirks. She’d grown up in it, left for a few years, then moved back in after the accident. But never once in all those years had the glass cracked on its own.

The phone in her pocket buzzed. A message from Ethan.

    “You left the light on in the garage. Want me to swing by?”

She stared at the message for a moment. Ethan Grant, her former neighbor turned occasional companion. His texts always came like that—casual, like he was walking beside her, still holding on to the comfortable pretense that they were only friends.

    “Don’t bother,” she typed. “Just noticed something weird. I’ll check it out.”

    “Weird?”

She hesitated.

    “Window. Looks like someone touched it.”

    “Inside or outside?”

She didn’t answer right away. Instead, she walked to the front door, turned the deadbolt slowly, and stepped out onto the porch. The night air hit her like a slap—damp and heavy with the scent of wet earth. She circled the side of the house, her phone flashlight held low.

The grass was slick with dew, and her bare feet slipped once on the mossy edge of the pathway. She steadied herself on the side rail, then turned the light upward.

The window was five feet off the ground. And there—just beneath it—were two smudges on the white siding. Dark, crescent-shaped. Fingerprints.

Her breath caught.

    “Outside,” she finally typed.

Then, after a second:

    “Someone was here.”

The next morning, Eleanor sat across from Ethan at Cassidy’s Café, a place that pretended to be rustic but smelled too clean to be authentic. He stirred his coffee with the slow precision of someone avoiding eye contact.

“So... nothing else happened?”

“No,” Eleanor said. “But I didn’t sleep.”

“You check the locks?”

“All of them.”

Ethan looked up finally, his brows knit together. “You call the sheriff?”

“No.”

“Why the hell not?”

Eleanor sipped her tea. It had gone lukewarm. “Because there’s nothing to report. A cracked window and a few smudges? They’d write me off like everyone else.”

He frowned. “You mean—”

“I mean like my sister. Like Dr. Ramos. Like everyone who thought I imagined the voice in the basement.”

That shut him up.

The voice. Two years ago, after her return to the house, Eleanor had heard a low, droning hum beneath the floorboards. Late at night. Faint. Sometimes rising like music, sometimes clicking like bones. She’d recorded it, once. Played it for Ethan. But the sound never came through.

He’d tried to believe her.

He really had.

“I think it’s connected,” she said now, softly. “The crack. The prints. The sound before. I think someone’s watching me.”

“Why would they?”

She didn’t answer. Not directly. Instead, she glanced out the café window toward the hills that curved at the edge of town. St. Veil was a quiet place, tucked between two ridgelines, built around an old ironworks that had gone bust decades earlier. Half the homes were historical, the other half barely standing. Nothing happened here. Not since the Deacons disappeared.

Ethan followed her gaze. “You still thinking about them?”

“Their house is four blocks from mine.”

“They vanished ten years ago.”

“And their windows were cracked, too.”

He paused. Then said, quietly, “That’s a hell of a reach.”

“Maybe. But I’m going to find out.”

That afternoon, Eleanor visited the town archive—a cluttered back room in the municipal building that smelled like glue and mildew. Agnes O'Malley, the part-time librarian-slash-historian, raised an eyebrow as Eleanor entered.

“Back again?”

“I need files from 2015. The Deacon family. Police reports, if you’ve got them.”

Agnes pursed her lips. “You know most of that stuff’s gone.”

“Gone?”

“Sheriff Barnes had a flood in the evidence room. Or so he said. Funny how water damage only hits certain files.”

Eleanor didn’t smile. “Do you have anything left?”

Agnes stood and shuffled into the back. After a few minutes, she returned with a plastic binder, its spine torn.

“This is all I’ve got. Clippings. Notes from their neighbor. Old Mr. Cordell.”

“Thank you,” Eleanor said, already flipping through the pages.

The clippings were yellowed, the ink blurred in places. But one note caught her attention—a scribble in ballpoint pen, dated two days before the Deacons vanished.

    “Saw someone in their backyard again. Tall. Didn’t move right. Just stood there. Looking.”

Another note, undated:

    “Mira said her window cracked again. Always the same one.”

Eleanor’s stomach turned.

She took a photo of the page and closed the binder. On her way out, she stopped by the sheriff’s office. The clerk at the front desk, a girl named Jenny who looked barely twenty, didn’t even glance up.

“Can I speak with Sheriff Barnes?” Eleanor asked.

“He’s out.”

“Where?”

“Field call.”

“Does he still keep the damaged files?”

Jenny finally looked at her. “What files?”

“The ones from 2015. The Deacons.”

Jenny’s lips thinned. “You should go, Miss Sharpe.”

Eleanor left, but the unease followed her. By nightfall, the house felt colder. She locked every window, every door, but couldn’t shake the feeling that she’d missed something.

At 2:14 a.m., she woke to a sound.

A tap.

Then another.

She sat up, listening.

Tap.

Tap.

It came from the hallway.

She rose, heart thudding, and crept toward the door. The tapping stopped. She reached for the handle, pulled it open slowly.

Silence.

Then—

Crack.

She turned.

The window.

The glass had split again, a second line branching from the first like a jagged root.

And in the faint moonlight, pressed against the outside of the window, was a single eye.

Watching her.

Unblinking.

Eleanor stumbled backward, her heel catching on the rug as her shoulder slammed into the doorframe. The eye vanished. Just like that—gone, like a hallucination. She blinked several times, heart hammering in her chest, and staggered toward the window, not even realizing she’d picked up the old fireplace poker from beside her bedroom door. She pressed her face to the glass, squinting into the moonlit yard.

Nothing.

No movement. No footprints on the grass. No lingering shadow or silhouette. Just the garden, still and silver under the waning moon, and the dense row of hedges that lined the far end of the yard.

But she knew what she saw. That eye wasn’t a trick of the light. It had been pale—unusually pale—and too round. Almost lidless. And close, impossibly close, like it had been pressed flat against the glass without leaving any breath or fog.

Her skin prickled. She stood there for what must’ve been ten minutes, straining to hear something—anything—beyond the frantic thudding of her pulse. Nothing came. She finally exhaled and backed away from the window, never once turning her back to it.

Sleep was no longer an option.

The next morning arrived slow and grey, the sun caught behind clouds that threatened rain. Eleanor sat at the kitchen table with an untouched bowl of oatmeal in front of her and the poker still clutched in one hand. Her phone was on the table, the screen showing a half-finished message to Ethan. She’d tried to describe the eye. Deleted it. Tried again. Deleted that, too. There was no way to explain it without sounding completely mad.

The knock at the door startled her so badly she nearly dropped the poker. She stood and crossed the foyer cautiously. Through the peephole: Ethan.

He didn’t wait for an invitation. “You look like hell.”

“Thanks,” she muttered, stepping aside.

He took one look at the poker in her hand and raised an eyebrow. “Planning to joust someone?”

“I saw something last night.”

“You said that before.”

“No, Ethan. I saw someone. Or something. It was staring at me through the hallway window. The crack got worse. It looked... wrong. The eye. It wasn’t human.”

He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. “El, I want to believe you. You know I do. But you’re talking like this is a ghost story.”

“I know what I saw.”

He was quiet for a moment. Then: “Let me look at the crack.”

They walked down the hall together. Ethan crouched near the window, running his finger gently along the lines in the glass. The second crack branched out like a sharp 'Y', jagged and nearly symmetrical. “This is weird,” he murmured. “Too clean for pressure stress. You sure nothing hit it?”

“I’d have heard it.”

“You said the eye was right here?”

She nodded.

He looked outside, scanned the yard. “We should put up cameras. Just to be sure. I’ve got some spares at home. Motion-triggered. One for the back, one for the hall.”

“You think it’ll come back?”

“I think we shouldn’t wait to fi
