Chapter One: The Shadow in the Orchard

My father used to speak of his brother only in slivers, as if the memories were too sharp to hold all at once. He would sit on the back porch when the sun dipped low and turned the apple orchard gold, the trees casting long lines of shadow like bars across the lawn. He’d light his pipe but often forget to smoke it, and then he’d say:

“You know, your uncle Eli could catch a fish with just his hands. Like some sort of river spirit.”

Then he’d stare off toward the treeline as if waiting for someone to emerge. But no one ever did.

It wasn’t until after he died that I realized I didn’t know whether Eli was alive or not.

My name is Silas Ward. I’m twenty-seven, a stonemason by trade, and I came back to the family farmhouse in Wren Hollow, Vermont, three weeks after my father passed, summoned by a voicemail from the lawyer who handled his will.

“He’s left you something unusual,” the man had said. “You’ll want to come in person.”

So I came, not knowing what to expect, not expecting much. My father had always been a man of silence, the kind who carried pain like a relic in his chest, untouched but precious. Our relationship was measured in working hours and nods, a language of few words and many pauses. I’d left at eighteen and hadn’t returned until the funeral.

Now the house stood quiet, paint peeling in soft curls from the windowsills, the orchard overgrown but still bearing sour fruit. There was something timeless about the place, like it had been waiting for something—or someone.

I met the lawyer, Elias Lark, in the parlor. A tall, skeletal man with thin silver-rimmed glasses and a cough that rattled in his throat like loose change.

“He left you this,” Elias said, handing me a wooden box. Cedar, with a latch that had nearly rusted shut. “And a letter. I advise you read it before anything else.”

Inside the box were four items: an old photograph of two boys standing in front of the orchard—one clearly my father, the other smiling like he knew a secret—a faded map of the local area with strange symbols drawn in red ink, a silver key, and a black stone, smooth and flat like a river rock but warm to the touch.

The letter was short, written in my father’s jagged hand.

Silas,

I tried to forget him. God knows I tried. But the past doesn’t lie still, not in this house.

If you’re reading this, you’re old enough to understand.

Find Eli. He’s still out there. I know it. He never really left.

Follow the map. Use the key. Don’t trust what you see.

-R.W.

The key was the size of my palm, old and heavy, the teeth oddly shaped—too angular for any door I could imagine. It left a faint metallic scent on my fingers, not iron or brass, something older, something more like blood.

I spent the night in my childhood room, the one with the sloped ceiling and the scratched desk. The wallpaper still peeled in the corners. That night I dreamed of a boy in the orchard, digging with his hands. Not digging for something—digging to something.

The next morning, I walked the land with the map. Most of the markings matched local landmarks: the well house, the split oak, the creek that curved around the back of the orchard. But one mark stood out—drawn not on land but beyond it, on a patch that was just blank space.

There was a note scrawled beside it: “Hollow Tree. ¼ mile north of split oak. Only opens after dusk.”

I waited until the sun began to sink, then followed the path through the orchard. The trees seemed to lean closer the deeper I went. The split oak had grown since I last saw it—two trunks from one base, its bark like wrinkled skin.

Past it, the ground changed. The soft hush of grass gave way to damp moss and roots that curled like fingers. I nearly missed the tree—a massive, gnarled thing with a hollow trunk wide enough for a man to slip through.

The key fit into a rusted iron fixture hidden behind a flap of bark. When I turned it, something clicked deep inside the tree.

The air changed.

I stepped into the hollow, expecting the back of the tree. Instead, I stepped out again—into a different orchard.

Same trees, same hill, but the sky was wrong—too red, like a fire just beyond the horizon. And there were no birds. No wind. Just silence.

A figure stood by the treeline, tall and lean, with a hat pulled low.

“Silas,” he said. “You took your time.”

I didn’t answer at first. My throat was dry.

“Eli?”

He smiled. It was the same smile from the photo.

“More or less.”

That was when I realized I hadn’t crossed into a hidden part of the land.

I’d crossed into somewhere else entirely.

Chapter Two: The Red Orchard

The place beyond the hollow tree was a mirror with its colors reversed. The trees bore no fruit, only dark leaves that whispered in a wind I couldn’t feel. The ground was soft and too warm, like skin. I followed Eli—if that’s who he was—through the orchard in silence.

“You’re wondering where we are,” he said eventually.

I nodded.

“It doesn’t have a name,” he said. “Not one you’d understand. It’s old. Older than towns, older than maps.”

“How did you—how did he lose you?”

Eli glanced at me, his eyes catching a flicker of red light. “He didn’t. He gave me up.”

I stopped walking.

“That’s not true.”

Eli tilted his head, birdlike. “Isn’t it? Ask yourself why he never told you. Why he never came looking.”

“He left a map.”

“Now,” Eli said. “But not when it mattered.”

I didn’t know how to argue with that.

He led me to a clearing where the trees opened in a perfect circle. At its center was a stone table, smooth and black, not unlike the one in the box.

“This is what it’s all about,” Eli said, touching the stone with reverence. “This is where they chose.”

“Chose what?”

“Who stays. Who goes. Who remembers.”

There was something written on the stone in a script that shimmered and shifted. My eyes couldn’t hold it; the words slipped away every time I tried to fix them in place.

“You were meant to come sooner,” Eli said. “But time doesn’t move here the same.”

He looked older than in the photo—much older than he should have been.

“You’ve been trapped here?”

“Not trapped. Bound. There’s a difference.”

I felt the weight of the key in my pocket.

“And you want me to free you.”

“No,” Eli said. “I want you to take my place.”

The silence in that orchard was not the kind of silence you find in the early morning, nor the hush before a storm. It was the kind of silence that pressed against your skin, that got into your ears and dulled your heartbeat. I followed Eli, if he was indeed Eli, through the strange mirror of my childhood orchard, trying not to look too long at the trees. Their bark writhed subtly, and some of the trunks appeared to have faces pressed into them, as if the trees had swallowed people long ago and the imprint of their final moments had been frozen in wood.

Eli walked with an easy grace, but his boots didn’t make a sound on the earth. That unsettled me more than anything. When I stepped, leaves crunched and twigs snapped beneath me. But when he walked, there was nothing. No echo, no weight. Just movement.

He led me past a row of trees that had been hollowed out. Inside each cavity, something shimmered faintly—images, maybe, or memories. I caught one glimpse of my father, younger than I’d ever seen him, sitting beside a river with a boy I now understood to be Eli. They laughed together, splashing water, oblivious to the watching world. But the vision faded as I passed, and when I looked back, there was only blackness.

“Why are you showing me this?” I asked, my voice sounding damp in the heavy air.

“Because this place is made of memory,” Eli said, not turning. “And memories rot, if they’re not tended to.”

At the edge of the orchard stood a house that hadn’t been there before. It resembled the farmhouse back home but in the way a dream resembles the real world—similar in structure but wrong in proportion. The shutters hung at odd angles. The door was too tall, the porch too wide. A faint light glowed in the upper window.

“You remember it like this,” Eli said. “That’s why it looks this way.”

I stopped at the porch steps. “Is this your doing?”

He shook his head. “This place listens. It builds from what’s inside you. I’ve tried to change it, but it’s stubborn. It wants truth.”

I hesitated, but Eli gestured for me to follow, and I did. The floorboards creaked under me but not under him. Inside, the house was furnished with pieces from my past—a green corduroy couch we’d thrown out when I was twelve, the cuckoo clock my father had smashed in a fit of anger one winter, the table with the burn marks from when Eli—if the stories were true—had left a lantern too close to the wood.

Everything was dusty, as though it had been waiting a long time.

Eli sat across from me in the living room, long legs folded beneath him, fingers steepled like he was about to give a sermon. I had a thousand questions, but they choked in my throat. All I could manage was, “How long have you been here?”

He tilted his head, considering. “Time is… different here. I think it’s been years for you. For me, it’s felt like a lifetime.”

“What is this place, really?”

He hesitated before answering. “It’s where things that aren’t supposed to exist… end up. Where people go when they’re forgotten but not gone. A place outside of time, outside of death.”

“You died?”

“I changed.”

That wasn’t an answer, not really. But in that moment, I believed him. His skin was pale but not sickly. His eyes held no madness. There was sadness, yes. And something sharper—regret, maybe. Or guilt.

He looked at the stone I’d placed on the table between us. “That was mine once. You brought it back.”

“I don’t know what it is.”

“It’s a seed,” he said. “From the first orchard. The one that came before this world.”

I blinked. “You’re not making any sense.”

“I know.” His voice was kind, almost apologetic. “But you will understand. There are things your father never told you. He was trying to protect you.
