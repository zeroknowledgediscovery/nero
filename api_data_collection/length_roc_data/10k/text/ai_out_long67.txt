Chapter One: The Echoing Halls

The hallway stretched on farther than it should have. Pale bulbs flickered overhead, casting weak cones of yellow light on the scuffed linoleum floor. Mason Graves stopped for the third time, staring at a door that looked exactly like the one he had passed moments ago. Room 23B. The brass numbers were dull and crooked, as though they had been hastily screwed in and forgotten.

He rubbed his eyes and turned around. The corridor was empty behind him. Silent. No humming of air conditioners. No distant chatter. Just his own breathing and the dull ache of confusion beginning to pulse in his temples.

“This is ridiculous,” Mason muttered.

He was in the East Wing of Beckford Memorial Hospital, where his mother had spent her final days. He’d walked these halls countless times, visiting her after chemotherapy sessions, bringing her favorite magazines, holding her fragile hand. And yet now—months after her passing—he’d come back to retrieve a forgotten keepsake from her old room, only to find himself disoriented in a place he once knew better than his own apartment.

Room 23B.

He reached out to touch the doorknob, hesitated, then turned it.

The room inside was dim, though afternoon sunlight should have poured through the windows. The curtains were closed tight, as if sealed. The bed was neatly made, the sheets tucked with military precision. No sign of use, no dent in the pillow. A pale green recliner sat in the corner, the same one where Mason had fallen asleep during those long, sterile evenings. His mother’s pink cardigan still hung from the backrest.

He stepped inside.

“Mason,” a voice whispered.

He froze. His skin tightened. It wasn’t a hallucination—he knew her voice, brittle and velvet at once.

“Mom?”

The room was empty. But the smell—soft lavender and old medicine—was thick, cloying. He moved toward the recliner, picked up the cardigan, and brought it to his face. It still held her scent. Maybe that’s what triggered the voice. A memory. A phantom echo.

The door slammed shut behind him.

He whirled around. No one. He tried the knob. It was locked.

“Is this a joke?” he called out, the sharpness in his voice failing to cover the tremor.

The light overhead buzzed, then dimmed further. A low groan came from behind the wall, like the building was settling—but deeper, more guttural.

Mason backed away from the door, heart thumping.

Then, a knock.

Soft. From the inside of the closet.

He stared.

It came again.

Three gentle raps.

He moved slowly, his breath ragged. He didn’t want to open it. Every instinct screamed at him to leave, but the door was locked and the air felt thicker by the second.

He reached for the knob.

Opened it.

Nothing inside. Just hangers and a few worn hospital gowns.

But then a cold wind blew past him, lifting the hem of one gown. Something whispered from within the folds.

He couldn’t make it out. A language? Or just noise?

He stepped back—and saw something new.

A photograph on the floor.

He knelt, picked it up. It was of him and his mother, from a year ago. Christmas. She was wearing a red scarf, eyes hollowed from treatment but smiling. He remembered this photo—but not this copy. There was writing on the back.

“Find me before the others do.”

Mason’s stomach turned. He turned the photo back over, examining it. The handwriting was hers. He was certain.

But how?

Suddenly, the lights blinked off.

Complete darkness swallowed the room.

And when they came back on—he wasn’t in 23B anymore.

He stood in the hospital lobby.

Except, it wasn’t the lobby. Not exactly. It looked like it, but aged. Dust coated the reception desk. The plastic plants were dry and crumbling. A calendar on the wall read January, 1989.

His heart slammed against his ribs. This had to be a breakdown. A stroke. A seizure. Something.

Footsteps echoed behind him. He turned.

A man in a nurse’s uniform—early '80s style, crisp white with a paper cap—stood watching him.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” the man said.

“I— I’m just trying to get to my mother’s room.”

“She’s not here,” the nurse said, stepping closer. “Not yet. Not again.”

“What does that mean?”

But the man only smiled. His teeth were yellowed, long. Wrong.

And then, in a blink, he was gone.

Mason stumbled backward, hitting the desk. He turned to bolt for the exit, but the doors were sealed with rusted chains, a padlock so old the metal looked like bone.

What the hell was happening?

He grabbed the nurse’s logbook from the desk, leafing through pages. Names. Dates. But then he saw it—his mother’s name. Elaine Graves.

Admitted: January 12th, 1989.

No. That couldn’t be. She would have been in her twenties then.

He turned another page. And saw his own name.

Mason Graves. Birth: July 8th, 1990. Deceased: Unknown.

The book fell from his hands.

He backed away slowly, only to find the layout of the lobby had changed behind him. Hallways were in the wrong place. Doors missing.

He was somewhere else now. Not the hospital. Or not just the hospital.

And yet somehow, it was still familiar.

From childhood dreams. Fuzzy recollections. A hallway that bent in impossible ways. A room with a hundred clocks, none ticking. A sound—low and steady—of someone breathing just out of sight.

He staggered forward, searching for any anchor to reality.

A chime rang.

Soft and melodic.

The intercom buzzed to life.

“Paging Dr. Winters. Code Veil. Paging Dr. Winters. Code Veil.”

The voice was wrong. It was two voices speaking in sync. Male and female, overlapped. Slightly out of phase.

Mason pressed his hands against his ears, but the sound passed through him, vibrating his teeth.

Then silence.

Then the floor shifted.

Tiles buckled beneath him, revealing wooden boards beneath the linoleum, old and wet with something black. He stepped back just as a hand pushed up through the cracks.

Small. Delicate.

His mother’s.

“Mason,” it whispered again.

He reached forward—despite everything—because if there was a chance, any chance at all that she was alive, or trapped, or...

Fingers touched.

And he was pulled downward.

He woke up coughing, gasping for air.

Darkness again. But different. Warmer. A candle flickered beside him. He was lying on a bed. A cot, really. The walls were stone.

A woman sat across from him, back to a low-burning stove.

She turned.

It was her. Elaine. A younger version.

“Mom?” he croaked.

She nodded, smiling faintly.

“You found the first echo,” she said. “But they know you’re here now.”

“What is this place?”

“A fracture. Between times. Between truths. I thought I could hide here. But they’re always watching.”

Mason tried to sit up. His head ached.

“I don’t understand any of this.”

“You will. But you have to remember. The real room. The one that doesn’t exist.”

He stared at her, but her face was already fading, like smoke in sunlight.

“No, no, don’t go—”

“You’ll find me,” she whispered. “Just don’t trust your own memory. It lies. They use it.”

And she vanished.

The candle blew out.

And the breathing, just behind his ear, returned.

Mason groped blindly in the dark, heart hammering as he felt along the edges of the cot. The breathing grew louder, rasping and close, but when he swung his arm toward it, nothing met his hand but cold air. He scrambled upright, the stone floor rough beneath his bare feet. The flicker of candlelight was gone, but a faint glow now traced the seams between stones on the opposite wall—greenish, phosphorescent, like bioluminescent mold crawling from the cracks. He stepped toward it, arms extended, fingers brushing the uneven wall. The glow pulsed beneath his touch, and without warning, a low vibration hummed through the stone. Something was alive behind it.

A sound, like a sigh, moved through the room. The wall gave way under his palm, peeling back like flesh, revealing a narrow corridor beyond—walls of sinew and brick, floor slick with condensation. He didn’t want to go in, but there was nowhere else to go. He ducked inside, the air thick and mineral, tinged with a sour smell he couldn’t place. As he moved forward, the passage behind him closed again, swallowing the room and his mother’s ghost with it.

The corridor narrowed, and his shoulders brushed wet stone. Ahead, a dim orange light glowed like sunset through fog. He turned a corner and nearly stumbled over a set of stairs—twisting downward into a spiraling abyss. He hesitated at the top, listening. There was music below. A faint lullaby. Off-key, slowed down like a dying cassette tape.

He descended.

The stairwell curved in a perfect spiral, deeper and deeper, until the air grew warm and heavy with moisture. He began to hear other sounds—the clatter of metal trays, the whir of old machines, distant voices murmuring things he couldn’t make out. At last, he stepped into another room.

It was enormous. Circular. The ceiling arched high above him like a cathedral dome, crisscrossed by pipes and dangling wires. Dozens of beds lined the walls, each one occupied by a figure under pale green sheets. Nurses moved among them silently, dressed in outdated uniforms, faces hidden by surgical masks that looked sewn on.

One nurse turned toward him.

“Subject 27,” she said. Her voice was muffled, robotic. “You’re not due for reintroduction.”

“I’m not—” he started to say, but she was already walking past him.

He approached one of the beds. The man lying in it was motionless, eyes open, staring at nothing. Electrodes were attached to his temples, and a metal crown circled his head—pulsing faintly with blue light. A screen beside the bed displayed images shifting rapidly: photographs, words, brief flickers of color and faces. Mason caught a glimpse of himself as a child, playing in his mother’s apartment. Then it was gone.

“What is this place?” he asked.

“Memory farm,” someone said behind him.

He turned to see a woman leaning against one of the pillars. She wore a long gray coat and her dark hair was streaked with wh
