Chapter One: Knock

The knock came at 5:47 a.m.

A low, deliberate thump against the wood — not frantic like a neighbor’s emergency, not casual like a delivery. This was the kind of knock designed to wake up the dead or, at least, make the living wish they were. Behind the door, the hall light was off, but in the hallway beyond it, a long, thin streak of pale yellow slanted across the floor from a streetlamp fighting the dawn. It trembled when the second knock came.

Inside the apartment, Loren Fielding blinked against the groggy veil of sleep and sat upright. Her sheets had tangled around her legs, binding her as if she’d been wrestling her dreams. A muffled third knock followed — louder. More persistent.

She reached for her phone. No messages. No missed calls. The knock came again.

“Hold on!” she called, her voice catching on the dry morning air.

She padded barefoot across the cold floor, each step toward the door raising her pulse. From the peephole, she saw two figures: one tall and built like a lamppost, the other shorter and broader, with a badge clipped to his jacket. They didn’t look like the type to sell magazines or ask about salvation.

She opened the door slowly, a crack at first.

“Loren Fielding?” the shorter officer asked, his tone neutral, well-practiced. His partner’s eyes scanned the hallway behind her.

“Yeah,” she replied, pulling her robe tighter around her waist. “What’s this about?”

“I’m Detective Harlan, this is Officer Weiss. We’d like to ask you a few questions about a Mr. Calvin Reeve.”

Loren blinked. The name didn’t land. Not at first.

“I don’t—Who?”

“Calvin Reeve. You may know him through your work at Halcyon Tech.”

“I haven’t worked there in six months,” Loren said, a frown curling her lips. “Why would I know—wait. He’s the guy from third floor, right? I saw him around. We weren’t friends.”

“We believe he was last seen entering this building yesterday morning,” Harlan said. “Security footage confirms it. He didn’t come back out.”

That landed.

“Wait, what are you saying?” she asked.

“We’re asking if we can take a look inside your apartment,” Weiss cut in, his voice softer but more insistent.

“You think he’s in here?”

“It’s standard,” Harlan said.

“Do you have a warrant?”

“No,” Weiss said. “We’re asking voluntarily. We won’t enter if you say no.”

Loren hesitated. The apartment behind her was a mess of coffee mugs, design notebooks, and half-completed wireframes. But it was just that — a mess. Nothing criminal. Nothing… dead.

“Fine,” she said, stepping aside. “But I want to know what’s going on.”

They entered briskly but respectfully. Harlan walked straight toward the bedroom, while Weiss hung back, scanning the walls, the coffee table, the shelves.

“Reeve’s sister reported him missing,” Weiss said. “She hadn’t heard from him in three days. Last ping on his phone was at 6:12 a.m. yesterday, right outside this building.”

“I don’t know him. I’ve never spoken to him,” Loren said.

“He listed you as a project contact in his internal files. An audit log shows you accessed a shared development branch with his credentials last Thursday.”

“I had permissions. Everyone on the team did,” she replied quickly. “I haven’t used them in months.”

Weiss tilted his head. “Mind if I check your laptop?”

“It’s broken,” she lied.

He raised an eyebrow but said nothing.

A minute later, Harlan returned. “Nothing,” he said. “No signs of entry, struggle, or, well — anything.”

“So can someone tell me what’s happening?” Loren asked again, her nerves raw now. “Is he…?”

“We’re trying to find out,” Harlan said. “If anything comes back to you — even a memory, a message — you contact us immediately.”

They left without another word.

By 7:30, Loren had reboiled the same kettle twice. Her hands were unsteady as she poured coffee, and the bitter heat did nothing to steady her. Reeve — Calvin Reeve. Now that she thought about it, he’d always seemed off. Quiet. Overworked. The kind of person who watched without blinking, always one beat behind the room. She’d shared a code review session with him once. He’d typed like a machine.

She tried to remember the last time she saw him. Months ago? Longer? Why would he name her? Why here?

She opened her laptop despite the lie, plugging in the cracked power cord, its frayed insulation hissing a little. It booted with a groan. A folder sat on the desktop labeled “AUX_BACKUP_OLD.” She didn’t remember creating it. She clicked.

Inside: a series of videos.

Each file was timestamped between 1:03 a.m. and 4:17 a.m. the night before.

And every single one of them was labeled: “LOREN_CAM.”

Chapter Two: The Missing Line

The first video showed her sleeping.

At first, Loren thought it might’ve been from her own webcam — she’d left it on once during a long debugging session — but then she noticed the angle. The camera was perched near the ceiling, looking down like a vulture. The lens wobbled slightly, as if whoever was holding it had shifted their grip.

Her stomach turned. She clicked the next file.

More footage. Her sleeping. A rustle of sheets. Then, at 2:19 a.m., the shape of a man entered the frame. Tall. Slender. He stood at the foot of her bed for a long moment, then stepped out of view.

Her mouth went dry. The third video had no audio, but it showed the same man entering her small kitchenette, looking directly at the camera — and then, impossibly, removing it.

Her eyes scanned the room now, searching for holes, seams, unnatural gaps in the walls or shelves.

There was one behind the bookshelf.

Shaking, she pulled the shelf aside. Behind it, hidden in the shadow of a vent cover, she found a small wireless camera. The battery light was dead.

She ripped it out, barely suppressing the scream climbing up her throat.

She didn’t go to the police. Not yet. Something about it didn’t fit. If they’d searched her place and not found the camera, who had? Who put it there? And why would Reeve have access to this — unless he wasn’t the intruder?

Unless he was the victim.

At 9:12 a.m., she logged back into her old Halcyon account. Her credentials were expired, but someone had left a trace — a dev branch tagged “ECHO//ROOT.”

Inside, nothing looked like code. It was text. Thousands of fragments. Logs, screenshots, bits of internal chat transcripts. Most of them were from Reeve. A few were hers — including things she didn’t remember ever typing.

    l.fielding: if it breaks, it breaks. we let it.

    c.reeve: it’s watching. i think it’s learning.

    l.fielding: let it.

She stared at the lines, reading and rereading. They were dated from two weeks after she left Halcyon.

There was no way she wrote them.

Unless…

The camera.

The footage.

The clone.

She reached out to the only person she still trusted from Halcyon: June Han, her old QA lead. June had always been sharp — and paranoid. If anyone else had seen what Reeve had hidden, it would be her.

She texted: “Need to meet. URGENT. EchoRoot. You know it?”

The reply came two minutes later.

    who gave u that name?

Loren stared at the screen.

Then came another message:

    meet me tonight. 10:30. lake storage. dock 6.

    come alone.

And finally:

    if i see anyone else with you, you’re already dead.

Loren didn’t shower. She didn’t eat. She sat in the living room under a pale tangle of morning light with her laptop on her knees and the unease settling in like mildew. The files were still open, the cursor blinking near the filename of the last video she’d played. “LOREN_CAM_0417.” That was the last one in the sequence. She didn’t know whether to be relieved or terrified that there weren’t more. There had been no sound, no speech, no identifiable features of the man in the video other than his height and shape, and the unnerving stillness with which he moved. It was like watching a puppet guided by something too deliberate, too practiced. Human bodies had noise—anxious ticks, shifting weight, hesitations. This man had none.

The camera. The dev logs. The police. It all felt too orchestrated to be coincidence. And yet, there was a gaping hole in her memory where context should’ve been. She knew she’d never accessed those files after leaving Halcyon. She’d quit on bad terms—burnt out, angry, convinced the company was hollowing her out like so many others. Reeve hadn’t been part of her life. He was background noise. A ghost on the other side of cubicle walls.

So how did he have her code logs?

She slid open her desk drawer and pulled out a tiny, plastic USB marked “BUGFIX_legacy.” It was from her last day at Halcyon, a backup she'd kept out of paranoia. She hadn’t looked at it since. Plugging it in, she let the folders populate, then dug through the directories: src > obj > deprecated > echo_tree. There it was again. Echo.

But this time the folder was empty—until, five seconds later, the files began populating one by one. Dozens. Hundreds. A crawl of file names zipped past her eyes like ants. It wasn’t just text. There were video logs, audio clips, even database dumps.

She clicked the first one.

It was a screen recording. Hers. Dated eight months ago. In it, she was working late at Halcyon, clicking through a private Git branch that she didn’t remember creating. She looked tired. Her posture was off. Her hands moved across the keyboard fluidly, but the commands she typed didn’t make sense. Terminal commands that didn’t correspond to any known systems. A terminal window flashed briefly:

RUN::ECHO::MEMTRACE[ALL]

Her recorded self didn’t pause. She just hit enter. The screen flickered, turned black, then returned to normal as if nothing had happened.

But Loren felt it. That weight in her chest—the unshakable sense that something irreversible had been triggered.

She closed the video. Her breaths came fast now. Shallow.

Her phone buzzed. It was a number she didn’t recognize. Area code from the city.

“Hello?”

“Miss Fielding,” came a voice—male, older, low like a worn violin string. “I suggest yo
