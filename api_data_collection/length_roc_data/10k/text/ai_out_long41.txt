Title: Wired for Bread

Chapter One: Sparks and Spatulas

Julian Trent had always been a man of habits. By day, he wore thick rubber gloves, toted around a voltmeter and a tool belt heavy with screwdrivers and pliers, fixing faulty wiring across the rust-tinged boroughs of Easton. He worked for Myler & Sons Electrical Services, a small, three-man operation with peeling van decals and an answering machine that still clicked and whirred when messages were left. Julian was thirty-eight, wiry, with calloused hands and a thin line of grime always shadowing his fingernails, no matter how hard he scrubbed. He was also the best electrician in the company by a mile—not that it was a hard race to win.

But at night, Julian became someone else.

He would return to his apartment on Pickering Street—third floor walk-up, squeaky banister, a doormat that simply read “Zap!”—kick off his steel-toed boots, and head straight for the kitchen. There, beneath the harsh light of a flickering overhead bulb, he would tie a worn apron around his waist. The apron was white once, now speckled with decades of flour and grease stains. In its center, faded pink embroidery spelled out “Flour Power.”

“Okay, my crusty little beasties,” he would mutter to his sourdough starters—three bubbling jars lined up along the counter like watchful, gelatinous sentinels. “Let’s make some magic.”

Julian baked. Not cookies, not cakes, not dainty tarts or trendy gluten-free nonsense. He baked bread. Real bread. The kind with crusts that cracked like thunder when sliced and crumbs so tender they made grown men weep. His specialty was a rosemary-olive boule that he swore could stop wars.

No one knew.

Not Glenn, his loudmouth boss who thought “yeast” was something you caught. Not his ex-wife Dana, who once threatened to throw his rye batards out the window if he didn’t “start being more present.” Not even Miss Lolly, the nosey widow who lived across the hall and had been trying to get into Julian’s apartment under various pretenses for years.

It was his secret world. A sacred place where the wires didn’t short and no one asked him to crawl into damp basements to fiddle with breaker boxes full of spider carcasses.

That Thursday started like any other. Rain tapped against the van’s windshield as Julian rolled down Milltown Avenue, humming something off-tempo, his breath fogging the glass. Glenn was already chewing in his ear through the walkie clipped to the dash.

“Julian, you get the call from the Holtz place? Power's out in the east wing—probably another damn squirrel chewin’ the lines again. Bring a long ladder.”

“Copy,” Julian muttered, taking a left down Hamber Lane.

The Holtz estate was a sprawling Tudor monstrosity on the edge of town, all gables and ivy and fountains shaped like lions spitting into koi ponds. He had been there once before, fixing an ancient fuse panel in the guesthouse. Mrs. Holtz had offered him tea and then asked, without irony, whether he could rewire a chandelier with Swarovski crystals without turning the lights “too yellow.”

This time, it was the kitchen.

“Right this way, Mr. Trent,” said Mrs. Holtz, leading him through the tiled halls in fuzzy mules that whispered against the floor. “The breaker trips whenever we use the convection oven. It's simply ghastly.”

Julian crouched, inspected the wiring, clicked his tongue.

“You’ve got a neutral arc right here,” he said, pointing with his flashlight. “Probably overloaded the circuit with too many high-draw appliances.”

“Oh, yes,” she said. “You see, we had a new baker start on Monday—young girl from New York, knows all about organic sourdough. She uses that oven like it’s a religion.”

Julian paused.

“A baker?”

“Yes. We’re converting one of the wings into a café. The Holtz Hearth, we’re calling it.”

Julian blinked. Something tugged in his chest—an odd flutter, like a switch had been flicked.

He finished the job in under an hour and was washing his hands in the butler’s sink when he heard a voice behind him.

“You the electrician?”

She stood with a tray of freshly scored loaves, her apron smudged with flour and arms dusted like she’d been caught in a blizzard. Her hair was cropped short, dyed the color of ripe peach skin, and there was a faint crescent of dough at her jawline.

“Yeah,” Julian said. “Just got the oven sorted. Shouldn’t trip the panel anymore.”

She sniffed. “Thank god. I’ve been half-baking my baguettes all week.”

He chuckled despite himself. “Tragedy.”

She held out a hand. “I’m Mira.”

“Julian.”

There was a pause. Mira tilted her head.

“You bake?” she asked.

The question caught him off guard. “Why do you ask?”

“You smell like fresh proofing. Not yeast—like… fermentation. And your shirt’s got flour at the hem. Rookie mistake.”

Julian flushed. “Maybe.”

She grinned. “You should come by sometime. We’re opening next month, but I’m here most nights. Testing recipes.”

He hesitated. Then nodded.

“Maybe I will.”

Chapter Two: Conductive Heat

Julian did go. The next Thursday. And the one after. At first, it was excuses—a ‘quick check on the wiring’ or ‘just making sure the breaker held.’ But Mira wasn’t fooled. She greeted him with smirks and dusted aprons, flinging puns like dough in a pizza shop.

“You’re electrically inclined, but thermally devoted,” she teased once, as they kneaded side by side. Julian couldn’t deny it.

It became ritual. They’d bake late into the evening, trading techniques, shaping loaves, arguing over hydration ratios and the ethics of machine-kneading.

“Hand work is soul work,” Julian insisted, palms sticky with dough.

“Says the guy who loves voltage testers,” Mira shot back.

But there was a rhythm between them. A heat—not just from the ovens.

At work, Glenn started to notice.

“You've been mighty chipper lately,” he said one morning, halfway through a rewiring job at the Roxy Theater. “Got a lady or somethin’?”

Julian shrugged. “Something like that.”

By December, Julian’s own apartment had transformed. Where once stood a battered toaster now gleamed a commercial-grade oven Mira helped him install. His fridge was crammed with starters, herbs, imported olives. A handwritten note taped to the cupboard read, “Less baking soda, more baking soul. — M.”

It was around this time that Dana, his ex-wife, showed up unannounced.

“Your sister said you’ve been… different,” she said, standing stiffly in his doorway. “I wanted to see for myself.”

Julian didn’t know what to say. Dana stepped into the kitchen, looked around, sniffed.

“Bread?” she asked, almost incredulous.

He nodded. “It helps me… balance things.”

She didn’t stay long. But as she left, she turned and said, “You always needed something to ground you. I just thought it’d be me.”

Julian stared at the dough in his hands. Didn’t answer.

That night, Mira brought over a basket of burnt walnut rye.

“Experiment gone wrong,” she said.

He bit in. It was still delicious.

Chapter Three: Live Wires

The trouble started in January.

The café’s soft opening drew attention. Food bloggers. Local reporters. Even a minor celebrity chef who declared their pain au levain “almost transcendent.” Julian remained in the background, quietly supplying loaves, slipping them through the kitchen door and vanishing before anyone could ask where the magic came from.

He didn’t want the spotlight. Mira, though, had different ideas.

“Why hide?” she asked one night, barefoot in his kitchen, sipping wine from a mug. “You’re brilliant.”

He shook his head. “I fix wires. I’m not a baker. Not really.”

“You’re more of a baker than half the folks on Instagram with matching stand mixers.”

Julian frowned. “It’s not about being seen. I just… this is mine. And if I lose it, I don’t want everyone watching.”

Mira looked at him a long time. Then quietly: “You're scared of success?”

“No,” he said. “I’m scared of needing it.”

But things were already moving beyond him. A food magazine ran a story—“The Secret Hands Behind Easton’s Best Bread”—and rumors swirled. Some said Mira had a mystery partner. Others whispered about a masked baker.

Glenn brought a copy of the article to work one day.

“Don’t suppose this ‘phantom of the flour’ is you?” he asked, holding it up with a crooked grin.

Julian didn’t answer.

The lines between his worlds were fraying. Electricity and baking, passion and profession. And one night, as thunder rolled over Easton and power flickered across the boroughs, Julian knew it was time to choose.

The following Friday, Julian stood before the door of the converted wing at the Holtz estate, uncertain whether to knock or just walk in. The glass panel beside the entrance was painted with swirling gold letters: Holtz Hearth — Artisan Breads & Pastries. The place wasn’t officially open yet, but the smell of fermenting dough and roasted grains seeped through the frame, warm and familiar, like the first time he’d fixed a toaster as a kid and felt the thrill of making something work again.

He rapped twice, awkwardly. Mira opened the door with a clatter of bracelets on her wrist and a dusting of powdered sugar clinging to her temple like a failed attempt at face paint. She beamed when she saw him, stepping aside with a graceful sweep of her arm.

“You showed,” she said, “and you didn’t bring a tool belt. I’m impressed.”

Julian stepped inside, rubbing his palms along the seams of his jeans. “Didn’t think I’d need to rewire anything today.”

“Well,” Mira said, nodding toward the stainless steel counter where three rounds of dough sat in proofing baskets like sleeping pets, “you’ll need to wire your hands to a scraper, because I’m short-staffed and behind on tomorrow’s test batch.”

Without waiting for an answer, she handed him a baker’s blade and a dusting wand. “You know your way around a banneton?”

Julian scoffed, rolling up his sleeves. “Please.”

He worked quietly at first, folding dough with practiced hands, letting the gluten strands pull and stretch like taut wires beneath his palms. Mir
