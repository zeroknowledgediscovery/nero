Chapter One: The Last of the Embers

The fire was nearly out.

Mira sat hunched in the old rocking chair beside the stone hearth, a threadbare quilt wrapped around her shoulders, her knees drawn up like a child’s. The logs had burned down to a scatter of red ash and a single coughing ember that winked like an eye. She stared at it. It looked as though it would blink out any moment.

The wind howled outside the cabin walls, a thin scream that came through the cracks in the wood. Snow had piled against the door, which moaned softly on its hinges every time the gale shifted. She’d used the last of the firewood two nights ago—her mistake, truly. She had overestimated how long it would last. Now she sat wrapped in wool and regret, wishing she’d gone to fetch more from the trees that bowed in the valley below.

But Mira hadn’t gone back down the hill in four days.

The last time she had stepped out beyond the porch, she’d found tracks. Bare feet in the snow. Not animal. Human. Too large for a child, too narrow for a man. And they had stopped right at her doorstep.

No one had knocked.

No one had left.

She hadn’t opened the door since.

The kettle, hanging above the fading coals, was empty. No point in keeping it there. The water in the barrel had frozen into a hard brick of ice. She would need to chip some out later. Or sooner. If she didn’t get something warm in her, she might not last the night. Still, she stayed seated, as if rising would break the fragile shell that protected her from something nameless.

She’d come up to the cabin for solitude. For quiet. For the kind of isolation only the northern ridges of Evron could offer, where the only neighbors were foxes and frost. After what happened in the city—after the fire and the trial and the woman on the bridge—she had no right to be among people.

But now, it seemed, people—or something pretending to be them—had come looking for her.

The wind faltered. Then silence.

Mira stood. Her legs were stiff, her feet numb even inside thick wool socks. She moved toward the hearth, crouched, and prodded the coals with a bit of iron. They hissed faintly, defiant but dying.

With one hand she reached into the shadowed basket beside the hearth and withdrew the last bit of kindling—a crooked, half-rotten branch she had meant to toss out. She broke it in two, laid the pieces across the ember, and blew gently.

Once.

Twice.

The ember blinked again.

Then, miraculously, caught.

A slow flame licked the wood, curling pale yellow and then orange. Her breath fogged the air in front of her as she fed the fire scrap after scrap—old paper from the journal she’d stopped writing in, a sliver of pine bark, a bit of towel too frayed to mend. She watched the flames grow with a strange hunger in her chest. Not just for heat. But for life. For motion.

When the cabin was quiet again, filled with the soft crackling of fire, Mira sat back and stared at the door.

There had been no more prints in the snow after that first set. Nothing since.

But she had heard the knock.

Three slow taps.

And then the sound of something breathing just outside.

Now, three days later, she still hadn’t dared to open it.

But the fire had changed something. Warmth crept back into her fingers. Her thoughts were no longer dull and fogged with cold. She stood again and walked to the door. Laid her hand against the wood. It was colder than death.

She waited.

Nothing.

Mira unlatched it.

The wind blasted her back.

She staggered, shielding her face as snow whipped into the cabin like a fury. The fire behind her hissed in protest. She gritted her teeth and pulled the door shut with effort, forcing it against the piled snow until the latch caught again.

Outside, just before she closed it, she had seen something in the snow.

A shape, half-covered by the storm. A bundle of cloth. A dark smear.

She went still. Then moved.

Her coat was under the cot. Boots still damp from days ago. She dressed quickly, moving without thought, just muscle memory and dread guiding her. She grabbed the lantern from the hook, lit it with a finger of kindling, and stepped out.

The cold slapped her like a curse.

Snow crunched beneath her boots as she stepped off the porch. The wind clawed at her face, tearing her breath away. She stumbled toward the shape.

It was a person.

No. A body.

Mira dropped to her knees.

It was a man, curled against the side of the cabin, arms wrapped around himself. His face was pale blue, beard crusted with frost. His eyes were closed.

But his chest moved.

He was alive.

“Oh gods,” she muttered, already grabbing his shoulder. “Hey—hey!”

He didn’t respond.

She looked around. There were no footprints leading to him. No trail. Just... him.

She dragged him inside.

It took all her strength. He was heavy, half-frozen. His clothes were strange—rough-spun, but stitched with symbols she didn’t recognize. His boots were laced with red cord. Something in his coat jangled when she pulled him through the door.

She got him to the hearth, propped him up against a stack of wool. The fire had grown stronger now, crackling with a golden heat. She rubbed his hands, then peeled off his outer layers, trying to find skin, warmth, anything to tell her he was still real.

Then his eyes opened.

Dark. Almost black. Unfocused.

“Where am I?” he whispered.

Mira stared. “You’re at a cabin. On Greyfen Ridge.”

He blinked slowly. “The door. You opened it.”

“Yes.”

“I was... waiting.”

Her heart slowed.

“You knocked?”

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he looked around the cabin, eyes tracing every line of the walls, every nail. As if he recognized it. As if he were remembering.

“I need your name,” she said. “Are you hurt?”

“I’m not supposed to be here,” he muttered, as if to himself. “Not again.”

“What’s your name?”

He looked at her then.

“I think... I was Elias,” he said. “Before the crossing.”

She stepped back. “What crossing?”

But Elias had slumped forward, unconscious.

And outside, beneath the storm, something howled—not wind. Something older.

Something hungry.

Chapter Two: The Things We Forget

Mira didn’t sleep that night. She sat beside the fire, watching the man—Elias—murmur in his sleep. His lips moved without sound. His hands twitched. Once, he cried out.

“Don’t open it,” he whispered. “Not again.”

She stayed beside him until dawn, feeding the fire with whatever she could find—pages from old books, broken furniture, a coil of birch bark hidden in the eaves. Snow rattled against the windows like a fist. The storm was worse than ever. But inside, it was warm.

Warm enough to think.

Warm enough to remember.

Mira hadn’t told Elias her full name. Not yet. He didn’t need to know she was Mira Veln, once Captain of the City Guard. Not when she had failed so many. Not when the woman on the bridge had fallen screaming because of her mistake.

That was months ago. A lifetime. But sometimes, in dreams, she still heard the splash.

And now here was Elias, appearing from nowhere, wearing symbols she couldn’t read, speaking in riddles and warnings.

She should have left him outside.

But she didn’t.

In the morning, he woke. Pale, sweating, eyes sharp now.

“You kept the fire going,” he said.

She nodded.

He stared into it. “It’s important.”

“Why?”

He looked at her with something like fear.

“Because it sees through the flames.”

She frowned. “What does?”

But he didn’t answer. He just looked back at the fire and said: “If it goes out again, neither of us will wake.”

She didn't know if she trusted him—not yet. But she couldn't deny the chill his words left behind, as if he’d peeled back something invisible and let the cold inside. Mira kept the fire alive with trembling hands. She moved slowly, deliberately, her body still recovering from nights spent freezing and still. Elias said little after that, only sat cross-legged near the flames, head bowed, his hands extended to soak in the warmth. She noticed the faint burns on his palms, old scars in the shape of circles, like coins pressed into flesh and never healed.

"Those marks," she said after a while. "What are they?"

He didn’t look up. "They’re not important anymore."

"Don’t lie to me."

His eyes lifted then, and something passed between them—a flicker of recognition, or maybe it was just shared exhaustion. He reached into the inner pocket of his coat and pulled out a small leather pouch. It was cracked at the seams, its drawstring frayed. He tossed it gently into her lap.

"Open it."

Mira hesitated. Then, slowly, she unfastened the string and peeked inside.

Ash.

At first she thought it was just dirt, maybe burnt leaves. But the scent hit her—sharp, pungent, like scorched cedar and iron. And something else. Something faintly sweet.

"What is this?"

"Memories," Elias said. "Or what’s left of them."

She blinked. "You’re mad."

"Maybe. But I know what’s coming."

"Why were you at my door?"

"I wasn’t. Not really. Not entirely. It doesn’t work that way."

"Then explain it to me. Gods, I haven’t spoken to anyone in weeks, and the first voice I hear belongs to a lunatic."

Elias gave a thin smile. It didn’t touch his eyes.

"You remember the old tales? The ones they told children when the nights stretched too long? The stories of the Grey King and the mirror that devoured sound?"

Mira laughed dryly. "Those are campfire lies. Things meant to keep kids from wandering too far into the forest."

"And yet," he said, "here you are. In a cabin built on old bones. With snow that never melts, and wind that talks in dreams."

The wind did speak, sometimes. She’d thought she imagined it. Whispers just beneath sleep, luring her toward the trees. A woman’s voice, sometimes a child’s. Mira had stopped walking too close to the pines after she heard her own name on the breeze.

"You think this is some old curse?" she asked.

"I think something’s waking up," Elias said. "And it remembers you."

"Me?"

"You and the others. You were all there. Once."

She rose, furious, confused
