The Curse of Eldralore
Chapter One: The Whispers of Windsreach

The kingdom of Eldralore was unlike any other land beneath the sun. Its forests shimmered with leaves of iridescent silver, its rivers sang with voices none could mimic, and at its heart stood Windsreach Castle, tall and cold as forgotten winter. There, among the ancient spires and halls steeped in old magic, lived a princess with a gift more feared than revered.

Princess Elowen was born during a thunderstorm so fierce it split the skies with fire. Her first cry silenced the winds, and the rain froze midair. Whispers had it that the spirits of the wild had touched her soul, leaving behind a gift — or a curse. As she grew, animals would gather near her chambers, birds perching along her windowsill, deer bowing their heads beneath her balcony, even wolves waiting patiently at the castle gates.

When she turned seven, her power emerged — in fury and fear.

It was a game, harmless at first. Her cousin Rilen teased her, as he often did, hiding her favorite ribbon in the castle stables. Frustrated, she had pointed a finger at him, her eyes shining strangely, and spoken words she did not know. In an instant, Rilen dropped to the floor, writhing, twisting — and where once stood a boy now sat a wide-eyed fox, trembling in the straw.

Queen Arlayne wept for days. King Vaeron summoned all the wise men of Eldralore, and none could reverse the spell. The fox remained, half-caged and half-free, prowling the castle grounds, sometimes glaring up at the towers with a look too human to bear.

Elowen was kept under close watch after that. Her tutors drilled restraint into her. Her every emotion was measured, monitored, dulled. Yet the gift grew stronger. And the animals came still — snakes in the kitchens, falcons perching inside the chapel, bears lumbering near the outer wall.

By the time she reached sixteen, Princess Elowen had become a myth within her own realm.

“Be still,” whispered the handmaids when they brushed her silver-threaded hair. “Be kind, be calm. Don’t get angry. Don’t dream too loudly.”

But dreams do not heed such warnings. And Elowen dreamed — of running through the wilds without shoes, of shouting into the stars, of using her power to protect, not hide.

She had no friends, save for a stable boy named Dareth, who spoke little and smiled less, but who once brought her a wounded hawk and said nothing when she healed it with just a glance. He was quiet and strong and seemed to sense the pulse of the land the same way she did.

One evening, as twilight bled into the trees, Elowen climbed to the northern tower — her sanctuary. The wind tugged at her gown, and below, the forest rustled like a restless sea.

“She’s coming,” said a voice behind her.

It was her grandmother, Queen Myrielle — old, cloaked in crow feathers, blind in both eyes, but somehow always knowing where to go. Myrielle had been the last true sorceress in Eldralore, before the magic thinned.

“Who’s coming?” Elowen asked, still watching the woods.

“The one who fears you. The one who seeks to bind you. A princess of flame. A rider of ruin. Her name will be ash and her hands full of chains.”

Elowen turned. “You speak in riddles.”

“I speak in what remains,” the old queen said, and turned, bones cracking, to leave. “You must learn what you are, before others decide it for you.”

That night, Elowen dreamed of fire swallowing the castle. She stood on the parapet, robes burning, and below her the kingdom screamed. But she did not flee — she raised her hand, and animals poured from the forest in waves: lions, wolves, great owls, snakes thick as rivers. They surged over the walls, obeying her call, and the fire receded.

She woke sweating. Somewhere, a fox barked.

The next day, an envoy arrived from the southern empire of Kirell. The banner was blood red, the sigil a burning crown. The emissary was Lady Serina — tall, veiled in crimson, with eyes like molten gold. She smiled with her mouth but not her eyes.

“A proposal,” Serina said, bowing low before King Vaeron. “Our emperor’s daughter seeks an alliance. Princess Tharelle would wed your daughter. Unite the old blood with the flame.”

Elowen choked on her breath. A marriage? To a stranger? To the daughter of Kirell — a realm that scorned Eldralore’s magic, that hunted wild things for sport?

King Vaeron looked troubled. “We are not… a people of such customs.”

Serina smiled. “Then consider it a peace offering. One that might avert certain... consequences.”

And Elowen understood: this was not a proposal. It was a warning.

That night she crept from the castle, through the hidden gate beneath the kitchens, past the yawning roots of the Old Elm, and into the woods. Dareth met her there, without needing to be called.

“I have to know,” she said, clutching a worn map. “What they fear in me. What I really am.”

He nodded, and they walked together into the deep forest, where the moon never fully touched the ground and the air was thick with secrets.

They reached a glade where the air shimmered strangely. Dareth stepped back.

“This is druid land,” he said. “They won’t harm you. But they’ll see you.”

And they did.

From the trees emerged the Thorned Circle — druids robed in vines and antlers, eyes inked black. One stepped forward: a woman with hair of moss and lips cracked like bark.

“You carry the Beast Soul,” she said to Elowen. “It was once a gift of kings. Then they feared it. Locked it away in the blood of daughters. But it grows. It always grows.”

Elowen’s voice shook. “Can it be controlled?”

“No. But it can be chosen. Will you be cage or key?”

“I don’t understand.”

“You will.”

Then they touched her forehead, and she fell — not down, but inward.

She saw herself — a thousand selves — bird and bear, serpent and stag, running through fire, through ice, through time. She saw wars lost and won by whispers. She saw a throne carved of bone. She saw the fox again — her cousin — and behind his eyes, fury.

When she woke, Dareth was holding her hand.

“They said you screamed,” he said. “Like a falcon.”

Back at the castle, the Emperor’s daughter had arrived.

Tharelle was everything Elowen was not: fiery, loud, wrapped in silk and steel. She walked through Windsreach like a conqueror, and wherever she stepped, torches flared.

At the feast, Tharelle toasted Elowen.

“To the girl with beasts for blood,” she said. “Let us tame each other.”

Elowen’s smile was thin. “You’d have better luck taming the moon.”

Later, in the gardens, Tharelle cornered her.

“You scare them,” Tharelle said. “That makes us kin.”

“I am not like you.”

“You will be. Or you’ll burn.”

And then — without warning — Tharelle reached out, seizing Elowen’s wrist. Pain lanced through her. Elowen gasped, her vision going white.

“Say the words,” Tharelle hissed. “Turn me. Let’s see the monster.”

But Elowen did not.

Instead, the flowers around them withered. Birds dropped from the trees. A growl rose from the dark — low, guttural, ancient.

Tharelle let go, stepping back.

“I see,” she whispered. “You’re not just the monster. You’re the forest itself.”

And with that, she vanished into shadow.

Elowen stood alone in the silence.

She knew now what had to be done. She would no longer be kept in towers. No longer be a curse wearing a crown.

She would find the old bloodlines. The beast kings. The scattered tribes of the wild.

She would build her own court — not of lords and ladies, but of those who remembered what it was to run on four legs and speak with the wind.

And when Tharelle came again, with fire and chains, she would meet not a girl.

But a kingdom reborn in tooth and claw.

The days following Tharelle’s arrival unfolded with an uneasy quiet, like the hush before a storm. Elowen walked the halls of Windsreach as if in a dream, her footsteps echoing against stone that remembered too much. The castle, once cold but constant, now seemed to lean inward, listening, waiting. Tharelle had taken up residence in the eastern wing — a place rarely used since the old wars. Now torches blazed there day and night, and the scent of foreign spices filled the halls. Servants gossiped in whispers, speaking of voices in the firelight and shadows that moved against their will.

Elowen tried to remain distant, to retreat to her tower, to the woods, to the small circle of solace she had left, but it was impossible to ignore the pulse of something changing. She could feel it, like the shift in air before a lightning strike — the taste of magic thickening on her tongue, the rustling of beasts growing restless in the woods. It wasn’t just Tharelle’s presence, though she brought with her the weight of empire and threat. It was something older. Something waking.

Dareth found her again at the stables one morning, brushing the mane of a wild-haired mare that no one else could ride. He stood in the doorway, silent for a time, until she looked up and nodded.

“They’re watching you,” he said quietly. “Not just the southerners. Your father’s men. Even some of the court.”

“I know,” she replied, resting her cheek against the mare’s neck. “They think I’m going to snap.”

“Are you?”

Elowen straightened and met his gaze. “Not yet.”

They stood in silence, the mare nickering softly between them. A breeze rustled the straw, and somewhere beyond the walls, the caw of a raven echoed.

“There are rumors,” Dareth said, stepping closer. “Of a beast in the eastern woods. A great one. Too fast for arrows. Too clever for snares.”

Elowen’s breath caught. “Has it harmed anyone?”

“No. But the trees near where it’s been seen... they twist. Curl inwards, like they're afraid. People are saying it's a spirit, an omen. Maybe even one of your kind.”

“My kind,” she echoed bitterly. “You sound like them now.”

Dareth’s face softened. “I meant no insult. I just thought... if it’s like you, maybe it’s drawn to you. Maybe you could speak to it.”

She nodded slowly, her mind already far from the stables. “I’ll go to
