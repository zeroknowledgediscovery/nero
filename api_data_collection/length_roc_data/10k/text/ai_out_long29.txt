Title: Paper Walls

Chapter One: The Elevator Game

The hum of fluorescent lights buzzed above, slightly out of sync with the rhythmic clack of keyboards. Carter Ellison adjusted the knot of his tie, which had started the morning crisp and symmetrical and now slouched like it had a hangover. He stepped into the elevator, the brushed metal doors shutting behind him with a sigh.

On the way to the 18th floor of Rembrandt & Lowe, a mid-sized advertising firm that took itself very seriously, Carter wasn’t alone. Lydia Park, with her sharp glasses and sarcastic smile, stood at the back of the elevator, thumbing through Slack messages on her phone. She didn't look up when he entered, but he felt her presence like a mild electric current.

“Morning, Carter,” she said without looking.

He hesitated, uncertain whether she was talking to him or the phone.

"Hey," he replied, glancing at the floor numbers. "Big pitch today?"

"Every day’s a pitch. Today just happens to involve more coffee and fewer excuses," she replied, slipping her phone into her pocket.

The elevator dinged and let them out into the open-concept hellscape that was their floor. Rows of desks, half-heartedly separated by frosted glass partitions, stretched under a ceiling of exposed ductwork and corporate optimism. The place reeked of burnt espresso and ambition.

Carter dropped into his chair beside Joel, the junior copywriter who dressed like he lived out of a lost-and-found box but spoke like a TED Talk. Joel was already sipping from a ceramic mug that read: Don’t Talk To Me Until I’ve Had My Buzzwords.

“Client’s early,” Joel said, not looking away from his monitor. “Like five minutes ago. Lydia’s running point.”

Carter blinked. “What, they’re in the boardroom already?”

Joel nodded. “The McKellan account. She pulled rank. I think she’s in kill mode.”

Kill mode. That was Lydia’s thing. She could destroy a pitch with a precision Carter both admired and feared. She didn’t wield power, she carved with it.

He stood, straightened his tie again, and crossed the floor to the glass-walled conference room. Inside, Lydia was already presenting, her slides clean, her tone casual but sharp-edged. Across the table sat a trio of clients, all with identically folded hands and faces trained in polite skepticism.

Carter took a seat near the back, catching the tail end of Lydia’s line: “…and that’s not just what your brand says. It’s what it whispers.”

Silence. Then the oldest of the three clients—a man with a tan that looked like it came from a bottle and not the sun—nodded slowly.

“Interesting. But what’s the metric behind that whisper?” he asked.

Lydia didn’t miss a beat. “Engagement. Retention. Loyalty. We speak softly, but we make damn sure they listen.”

It was the kind of line that would’ve sounded ridiculous coming from anyone else. But from Lydia, it landed.

After the meeting, Carter caught her by the copy machine.

“Whispers, huh?” he said, leaning against the wall.

She smirked. “Not every campaign needs to shout. Some of them just need to lean in.”

“You’ve been reading old Don Draper scripts again.”

“Guilty. But hey, it worked. They bought in.”

Carter handed her a coffee he had snagged on the way out. “Peace offering. For not telling me you hijacked the pitch.”

She took it, giving him a sideways glance. “Not hijacked. Delegated.”

“Sure. Just next time maybe loop me in on the delegation part.”

There was a flicker of something—amusement, maybe—in her eyes. “Fair.”

Chapter Two: Welcome to Tuesday

By Tuesday, the team had pivoted to full-throttle mode. The McKellan win had elevated Lydia’s status from respected to revered. Carter watched from his desk as people orbited her with new caution, the way junior staff tiptoe around a senior partner they suspect might remember names if she had time.

They were given the Valcor project next—a tech brand trying to break into luxury home automation. This one was Carter’s. Or at least it was supposed to be.

“So here’s the concept,” he began at the morning meeting. “Valcor wants to be seen as both smart and subtle. Think: a house that doesn’t just talk to you, it anticipates you.”

“Like a psychic but with LEDs,” Joel added.

Carter ignored him. “We don’t show the product. We show its absence. Rooms that feel curated, not cluttered. Technology that doesn’t interrupt, it adapts.”

He glanced toward Lydia, who was uncharacteristically quiet. She was sketching something in the margin of her notebook.

“You’re going with minimalism?” she asked.

“Exactly. Let the absence speak.”

She nodded slowly, then said, “Flip it.”

“What?”

“Overdesign the hell out of it. Make it oppressive. Too many screens. Talking fridges. Overstimulating, noisy, over-connected.”

He stared. “But that’s the opposite of—”

“Right. We show what the world looks like without Valcor. Then cut to peace. A room where everything just… works.”

The room was silent for a beat. Then Joel said, “Damn. That’s good.”

Carter’s mouth was dry. He knew the idea was better than his. He hated that he knew it.

“Let’s build both versions,” Lydia said, standing. “Run them past focus groups. Fast.”

As the room emptied, Carter lingered.

“You always do that?” he asked.

“What?”

“Hijack and improve?”

Lydia shrugged. “I only hijack if there’s a better way to land the plane.”

He wanted to argue, but he also wanted to win. And he couldn’t deny the elegance of her angle.

He went back to his desk, frustrated but intrigued. The line between rivalry and flirtation had always been blurry with Lydia, and he wasn’t entirely sure if either of them wanted it sharpened.

Chapter Three: Fire Alarms and Secrets

It was during the quarterly fire drill that Carter saw her notebook again—the one with the sketch she’d made in the meeting. While the entire floor evacuated down sixteen flights of emergency stairs, Lydia stopped halfway to check her phone.

He leaned over. “That important?”

“Only if you think missed calls from creative directors are life-threatening.”

The stairwell was stuffy, filled with the murmur of colleagues pretending not to hate the forced camaraderie. Carter noticed her sketch again—curved lines, an unfinished logo, notes in shorthand. Not Valcor-related. Something else.

“You working on a side project?”

She didn’t answer right away. Then: “You ever think about quitting?”

The question hit him sideways. “Every Monday morning.”

She laughed. “No, I mean really quitting. Leaving all this. Starting something of your own.”

Carter hesitated. “Sometimes. But ideas are cheap. Rent isn’t.”

“Still. Doesn’t it feel like we’re building other people’s empires with our ideas?”

He looked around. Joel was halfway up the stairs quoting Nietzsche to someone. A graphic designer was carrying a plant. The whole office, displaced and dazed.

“Yeah,” he said quietly. “Sometimes it does.”

Lydia didn’t reply, but her look said more than silence usually did.

Later that week, Carter found a name scribbled on the back of a napkin near the trash: “Studio Nine.” A domain name was written below it. It wasn’t anyone’s project on file.

He pocketed it.

Chapter Four: Lines in the Carpet

By mid-February, everything had changed and nothing had.

The McKellan campaign was now live. Valcor was in pre-production. Lydia and Carter had fallen into a rhythm—a volatile, unpredictable rhythm. They finished each other’s sentences and undermined each other’s slides. There was a tension between them like the kind that sparks only when you know someone could either change your life or completely ruin your week.

Joel noticed.

“You guys gonna kiss or throw staplers at each other?” he asked one afternoon, eating instant noodles with a fork from the supply closet.

“Neither,” Carter said, too quickly.

“Both,” Lydia replied from behind him.

That night, after everyone had left, Carter stayed late. He logged onto the domain scribbled on the napkin. A simple placeholder site loaded: “Studio Nine – Coming Soon.”

He clicked the source code. No contact info. No linked profiles. Clean, anonymous.

The next morning, he confronted Lydia in the breakroom.

“You’re starting your own agency?”

She didn’t flinch. “Maybe.”

“With who?”

“No one yet.”

He folded his arms. “Why tell me?”

“I didn’t.”

“But you left the napkin.”

“Maybe I wanted you to find it.”

The silence between them wasn’t awkward. It was electric.

“You serious?” he asked.

Her eyes met his. “Are you?”

–––

After the morning’s pitch, Carter retreated to his corner of the open floor plan—a desk that offered just enough privacy for daydreaming but not enough for productivity. The glass office walls made everything visible, like a fishbowl designed for high-functioning anxiety. He half-heartedly reviewed mockups for an account he didn't particularly care about, clicking through slides that blurred together in a haze of marketing jargon and half-formed slogans. Outside his window, the city pressed in—towering glass buildings and streetlights blinking like tired eyes. Carter let his fingers drift over the keyboard but typed nothing.

He glanced across the office and found Lydia deep in conversation with Simon Brant, one of the creative directors whose cologne entered a room two seconds before he did. Simon leaned too close, smiled too wide. Lydia smiled back, but it was the tight-lipped kind Carter had come to recognize. She was measuring him, not enjoying him.

Carter returned to his screen, annoyed without fully understanding why. He had known Lydia for just under a year, since she'd transferred from the firm’s Chicago office, and in that time they’d gone from mild acquaintances to reluctant collaborators to… something more complicated. She was the kind of person who made everyone else feel a step behind without ever seeming rushed herself. Carter admired that. He also resented it.

At noon, the company catered lunch—an offering meant to inspire loyalty but mostly resulted in digestive complaints and passive-aggressive Slack messa
