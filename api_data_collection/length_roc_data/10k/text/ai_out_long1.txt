Chapter One: The Smell of Ether

In the old part of Münster, wedged between a silent canal and a forgotten bakery, stood a narrow three-story townhouse whose windows had not been washed in decades. Ivy clung desperately to its brickwork, climbing higher every summer until it reached the crumbling ledge above the attic. Inside, amidst the mothballed furniture and dusty floors, lived Dr. Emil Hart, a chemist of peculiar discipline and method.

Emil had once been the youngest lecturer in organic synthesis at Heidelberg. Now he conducted experiments in solitude, sponsored by no one, his only company a radio that never played anything but static and a black cat named Bunsen. The air in the house constantly reeked of something between burnt sugar and metal filings.

On that morning in April, the light slanted through the curtainless window of his lab—formerly the dining room—and fell on an array of glassware: flasks, beakers, and tubes coiled like intestines. Emil sat hunched over a faded notebook, his hand stained with indigo ink, scribbling in the margins of a diagram labeled “Project: Götterfunken.”

The project had begun as a curiosity, born from late nights poring over 19th-century alchemical texts Emil found in a locked case at the university library. The phrase “divine spark” occurred too often to dismiss as metaphor. Something about it had clung to him like a scent—something vital, possibly real.

His fingers trembled as he added a drop of silvery liquid to a beaker containing a thick purple sludge. The reaction was immediate—violent. A hiss like frying bacon, and a puff of turquoise smoke curled upward, dissipating into the ceiling. The lights flickered.

"Bunsen," he muttered, "make a note. Reagent X-17 requires insulation."

The cat blinked once, unimpressed.

He turned the page in his notebook and wrote:

    Observation: Substance appears to exude heat on contact with organic molecules. Further testing necessary. Possible applications in neurochemistry?

A knock on the front door startled him so much that he knocked over a bottle of acetone. The smell clawed at his nostrils. Swearing under his breath, he padded out of the lab and into the hall, the wooden floor cold beneath his bare feet.

He opened the door to find a woman he hadn’t seen in eleven years.

"Hello, Emil," she said, pulling back the hood of her coat. Her hair was shorter now, clipped to the nape, but her eyes—gray, volcanic—had not changed. "I need your help."

"Lina," he said, hoarsely. "I thought you were in Buenos Aires."

"I was. Then Madrid. Then nowhere," she said. "Can I come in?"

He stepped aside.

They sat in the parlor, both aware of the clock ticking with exaggerated slowness. Dust floated like ash in the shaft of sunlight between them. She declined tea, and he didn’t insist.

"You still look like hell," she said, smirking.

"You always said I had the face of a sleep-deprived cadaver."

"I meant it as a compliment."

There was a silence between them like a held breath.

"I need you to synthesize something," she said. "Something difficult. Illegal, probably. Dangerous, certainly."

He gave a tired laugh. "You don’t waste time, do you?"

"No," she said. "I’m running out of it."

Then she took a folded sheet of paper from her coat pocket and laid it on the coffee table. Emil leaned over and read the formula. His eyebrows lifted.

"This compound… This is an isomer of C-34B," he said. "It doesn't exist. It shouldn’t exist."

"And yet I’ve seen what it can do. A man in Zaragoza—he ingested half a gram and spoke five languages simultaneously for twenty-seven minutes. He had never left Aragón in his life."

"You’re chasing fables," Emil said.

"No. I'm chasing truth," she said, leaning forward. "And I need someone mad enough to catch it."

He looked at her for a long moment, then stood. "Come," he said. "I'll show you something."

He led her into the lab, stepping over piles of journals and a disassembled rotary phone. On the center table sat the beaker, still steaming faintly. Lina’s gaze settled on it.

"What is it?"

"An accident," Emil said. "Or maybe not. I was trying to create a compound with a specific energy resonance. But this—this reacts to thought."

"You mean it’s psychoactive?"

"No, not exactly. It resonates. Amplifies what's already present. Thoughts become… audible, sometimes visible. It’s crude, unstable. But it's real."

Lina looked at him, her eyes narrowing. "Can it be refined?"

Emil’s mouth twitched, as though about to smile. "That’s the question, isn’t it?"

Outside, the first rain of spring began to fall, pattering on the ivy-covered bricks. Inside, Emil began clearing space on the bench, the gears of his mind turning once more.

By the end of that week, the project had a name: Mnemosyne.

Lina moved into the guest room—formerly a closet—and brought with her a suitcase full of documents, photographs, and newspaper clippings, most in Spanish, many redacted. There was one that caught Emil’s attention: a grainy image of a man convulsing in a hospital bed, captioned only with “Sujeto 41. Valencia. 2018.”

"How did he get access to the isomer?" Emil asked.

Lina hesitated. "A man named Varga. He was part of a program—government-funded, but off-books. Biochemical enhancement, fringe nootropics, memory grafting. After Varga disappeared, the program was supposedly dismantled. But I don’t believe that."

"And now you think Varga is trying to recreate the isomer?"

"No," she said. "I think he already has."

Over the following days, they set up a second lab in the attic, away from the cats and fumes and unpredictable power surges. Emil constructed a crude centrifuge out of a washing machine motor and began synthesizing derivatives of the compound he’d named ‘Echo.’ Some were inert, some volatile, one exploded a glass tube with such force it embedded a shard in his shoulder.

"God, you're bleeding," Lina said, rushing to help.

"Just a scratch," Emil muttered, gritting his teeth. "The glass is the real concern. That was borosilicate."

Late one night, after a failed batch turned a bright viridian and then corroded through the beaker, Lina came down the attic stairs holding a photograph. It was of a young woman—dark-skinned, late teens—with a look in her eyes that suggested neither innocence nor fear, but a deep, ferocious understanding.

"This is Sofía," Lina said. "She was Subject 19. Varga said she could remember being born."

Emil stared at the image. Something shifted behind his eyes.

"You didn’t come to me just because I’m a chemist," he said.

Lina nodded. "You remember her, don’t you?"

He didn’t answer, but his hand tightened on the bench. The smell of ether hung in the air like a ghost.

It was during the third week that Emil began to dream of equations.

Not symbols or numbers, but full sequences, sketched across neural spaces. In the dreams, he was always underwater, and the equations glowed faintly above him like jellyfish. Sometimes he could reach them. Sometimes he could not.

Lina noticed the change.

"You’ve been muttering in your sleep," she said over breakfast.

"About what?"

"Helices. Temporal junctions. Once, you said the phrase ‘reverse entropy cascade’ three times, then started laughing."

"Sounds like me," Emil said, chewing dry toast.

By now, they had synthesized a stable sample of the isomer—only a microgram, stored in a sealed vial within a lead case. They kept it in the icebox next to the eggs.

Lina insisted on bringing in a third party: a neurologist she trusted, Dr. Marija Kovač, who had once performed cortical stimulation on herself in an underground clinic in Belgrade. Emil was skeptical—until Marija arrived, examined the compound, and uttered a phrase that chilled him.

"This isn't just a nootropic," she said. "This is something older. Something primal."

"Explain," Lina said.

"I've seen something similar," Marija continued. "Only once. In Macedonia, 2003. A boy they said could draw places he’d never seen, write words in tongues that didn’t exist. We tested his blood. There was a molecule—fractured, unstable. This looks like its cousin."

"You think this is genetic?"

"I think," Marija said, "this compound doesn’t create ability. It unlocks it."

The three of them sat in silence.

Then Emil stood.

"All right," he said. "Then let’s open the lock."

They didn’t notice Bunsen watching from the stairs, his eyes reflecting the low, flickering light.

By the following night, they had assembled a makeshift testing chamber in the basement, repurposing old lead-lined filing cabinets and copper shielding to contain any residual emissions. Emil insisted on a Faraday cage around the entire chamber.

“It’s overkill,” Marija said, tightening a bolt with her gloved hands.

“It’s protocol,” Emil replied. “Until we know what kind of frequency discharge the compound might trigger, we isolate every variable. Even thought is noise.”

Bunsen yawned from atop a stool, unimpressed.

They tested minuscule doses on bacterial colonies first. One strain, E. coli K-12, demonstrated anomalous growth patterns—dividing along geometric fractals instead of the expected rod-shaped chains. Marija observed the Petri dish through a lens, her brow furrowing.

“This is mitosis,” she murmured, “but rewritten. This bacterium is dividing based on mathematical sequences, not biology.”

“Fibonacci?” Lina asked.

“No,” Emil said, peering in beside her. “It’s Gödel.”

Marija looked at him. “You mean—logical incompleteness?”

He nodded. “The cells are following a recursive rule that never resolves. They’re… aware of their own limits.”

No one spoke for a long moment.

Outside, the rain came harder, running down the brick walls like liquid memory. Inside, Lina unzipped her coat and retrieved a small black notebook. She hesitated before opening it.

“This belonged to Varga,” she said. “I stole it when we were in Salamanca.”

She flipped it open to a page filled with numbers, each one scrawled in a slightly different hand. A
