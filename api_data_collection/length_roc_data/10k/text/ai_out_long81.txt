Title: Ashes of the Decade

Chapter One: The Ten-Year Drift

It had been ten years since Nathan Farren had done anything with purpose. A decade of smoke rings, unpaid parking tickets, aimless nights, and unremembered mornings. His life had become an uneven terrain of excuses and missteps, a mosaic of missed calls and missed chances. Somewhere along the way, responsibility had become not just a nuisance—but an ancient concept, almost mythological in nature. At 35, Nathan lived in a cramped studio in South Boston, nestled above a laundromat that hummed day and night. His mattress sat directly on the floor, sunken in the middle. Half-empty bottles populated every flat surface.

He woke up on a Thursday in April with the sharp taste of gin and orange juice caked at the back of his throat. His phone buzzed beneath a hoodie. The screen lit up: "Joanne - 4 Missed Calls". He squinted. Joanne. The name held weight, a name he hadn’t heard out loud in months. He ran a hand through his hair, greasy and overgrown.

Nathan didn't call her back. Instead, he staggered into the kitchen—which was really just a corner with a hot plate—and poured cereal into a chipped bowl. No milk.

At some point, the world outside his window changed. The sky turned a grayish orange, the kind of color that suggested something significant had happened or was about to. Sirens, or maybe just a dog barking. Hard to say.

The phone buzzed again. A text.

Joanne: “He’s in the hospital. Come now or don’t bother ever again.”

No punctuation. That was how he knew she meant it.

He stared at the message long enough to feel something shift. His hand, trembling just a little, reached for the keys.

The last time Nathan had seen his father, they'd screamed at each other in the driveway. It was raining, and Nathan had been drunk—again. His father had said something about “burning bridges” and Nathan had laughed, lighting a cigarette with shaking hands, and muttering something cruel about graveyards and ashes. That was eight years ago. Since then, there’d been birthday cards signed with a first initial, and one funeral for an uncle neither of them liked.

Now, he stood at the sliding doors of Saint Aurelius Medical Center, unsure whether to walk in or keep walking, maybe all the way to the water.

He pressed through the entrance.

The hospital was colder than he remembered hospitals being. The fluorescent lights hummed with a tired kind of urgency. He asked the nurse for Walter Farren’s room and followed the maze of white-tiled corridors to Room 318.

Joanne sat beside the bed, pale and furious. Her black hair was up in a messy bun, and there were three coffee cups beside her—one from Dunkin’, one hospital styrofoam, one probably his father’s. She didn't look at him.

“You came.”

“I got your text.”

She stood. “He had a stroke.”

Nathan looked at the body in the bed. Walter Farren, once six feet of fury and discipline, now seemed to have shrunk into his sheets. Tubes, wires, the faint hiss of a machine breathing rhythmically.

“When?” Nathan asked.

“Three days ago.”

Three days. “Why didn’t you—”

“Because you don’t answer.” Her voice cracked like a whip. “You haven’t shown up for ten years. Why would I think today would be different?”

Nathan had no answer. He sat down in the plastic chair and leaned forward, elbows on knees.

Joanne crossed her arms. “He was asking about you.”

“Why?”

She shook her head. “He wanted to tell you something. He said he had... papers, in the house. Something he wanted you to have.”

Nathan blinked. “He’s never wanted me to have anything.”

“Well,” she said, gathering her coat, “maybe dying makes people generous.”

The house on Garnet Street hadn’t changed much. The grass was long. The paint on the porch peeled like sunburnt skin. Nathan had a key, still. He kept it in an old jewelry box with some Polaroids and a Zippo he never used.

Inside, the air was thick with dust and old leather. The kind of smell that you remember even in dreams. He moved through the living room slowly, touching furniture as if to confirm it still existed. A stack of unopened mail sat beneath a ceramic owl on the side table.

Upstairs, the bedroom was clean, neat. Walter had always been tidy. A man of systems. Nathan found a metal box in the closet, under a pile of winter coats. It was locked. He knew where the key would be: taped beneath the second drawer in the desk. Always there, since 1992.

He opened the box.

Inside: a folded letter. An envelope with Nathan’s name on it. Two old photographs. And a legal document.

He sat on the bed and unfolded the letter.

“Nathan,

If you’re reading this, then either I’m dead or someone decided you deserved a second chance. I don’t know which is worse.”

He snorted.

“You wasted a decade. I wasted time believing that was just a phase. But there’s something I never told you. Your mother—she left something behind. Not money. Not jewelry. Something harder to explain.

I never opened the safe deposit box after she died. I couldn’t. It’s yours now. Box #442, Chatham Bank. Key’s taped to the back of this letter.”

Nathan blinked. His mother had died when he was fifteen. She’d been a painter, wild and brilliant. He remembered her hands always stained with blue or green. He remembered, too, the way she smiled when she talked about “stories that lived in rooms.”

He turned the envelope over. The key was there. Small, brass.

He pocketed it.

The drive to Chatham was three hours. He made it in two and a half, burning through a mix CD that skipped every other song. His fingers trembled against the steering wheel. He hadn’t thought of his mother in years—not really. She’d become a flicker in memory. A name in a photo album.

At the bank, he showed the ID, signed the paperwork, waited as the clerk returned with a long metal box.

Inside: a notebook. Handbound, wrapped in linen. A letter. And a strange, flat wooden object that looked like a part of a puzzle.

He opened the notebook first. His mother’s handwriting. Swirling, chaotic.

“To my son—if they let you find this, then maybe you’re ready to know.”

What followed was a mess of journal entries, sketches, and a recurring phrase:

“The Ashes Room.”

That night, Nathan sat in a motel outside of Chatham, the notebook spread across the bed. He read every page. His mother described dreams of a door behind a mirror, a house that didn’t exist, a voice that whispered about “embers of memory.” Madness, maybe. Or art. But something in the notebook felt real.

There was a map drawn on one page. Coordinates.

He plugged them into his phone. Northern Vermont.

His heart raced. Was he really doing this?

He packed the notebook, the key, the letter. He booked a cabin in Vermont.

It was time to stop drifting.

Time to follow the ashes.

The road north felt like a different country altogether—thick pine forests crowding the shoulder, telephone lines stretching overhead like the ribs of some ancient, slumbering beast. The farther Nathan drove, the more the world seemed to fall away behind him. By the time he crossed into Vermont, the sun was just beginning to retreat behind the hills, casting long, copper shadows across the road. His phone had lost signal an hour earlier, leaving him alone with the worn notebook in the passenger seat and the rattle of something loose in the engine.

He stopped at a gas station near the town of Winhall, a place so small it seemed to consist entirely of a post office, a hardware store, and a diner. He topped off the tank, bought a bottle of water, and asked the attendant if he knew anything about the area around Lyon Ridge. The man, in his sixties and wearing a Patriots cap, scratched his chin thoughtfully before answering.

“Up past the ridge? Ain’t much up there anymore. Used to be a camp, way back. Closed in the eighties. Lotta trees. Lotta wind.”

“Any houses?” Nathan asked, clutching the notebook under his coat.

“Couple. Mostly empty now. Deer run through there more’n people.”

He thanked the man and continued north. The last leg of the drive wound up a narrow, gravel road that seemed to climb indefinitely. The GPS had died, but the coordinates etched in his mother’s notebook guided him better than any satellite.

The cabin he’d rented sat at the edge of the woods, modest and leaning slightly like it had grown tired of standing up straight. He parked, grabbed his duffel, and walked up the creaking steps. Inside, the air was dry and musty. The furniture was simple—two chairs, a table, a cast iron stove. He lit a fire and sat on the floor, spreading the notebook across the rug.

Pages scrawled in paint and graphite detailed strange symbols—some that looked like constellations, others like alphabets from lost civilizations. Phrases repeated themselves, as if trying to convince him of their importance: “The Room only appears to those who inherit the memory.” And, more puzzling: “The wooden token must be placed beneath the mirror at midnight.”

Nathan reached into his coat and retrieved the flat wooden piece. It was circular, smooth, with a single engraving in the center: a four-pointed star intersected by a spiral. He hadn’t noticed it before, but the lines shimmered faintly when they caught the light of the fire.

Beneath the phrase about the mirror, his mother had added in smaller handwriting: “Don’t forget who you are, even if you’ve forgotten everything else.”

He turned to the map again. The location marked in red ink was less than two miles from where he now sat. The ridge. A hollow near the top of the rise. The handwriting labeled it: “Ashes Room.”

The trail to the ridge was overgrown, but the old instincts kicked in. Nathan had grown up climbing hills and ducking through underbrush behind the house in Boston. His legs burned, and the cold air made his chest ache, but he kept climbing.

At the summit, beneath a low canopy of fir trees, was a clearing. Silent. Untouched. The grass was strangely even, the stones laid out in a semicircle, like they’
