Title: The Prince and the Ashen Star
Chapter One: The Letter in the Flame

The morning air of Eldareth was perfumed with the scent of cinnamon and dying leaves. Autumn had cloaked the palace grounds in crimson and gold, the colors of change, though the court still pretended it was summer. Prince Kaelen, second son of the High Throne, found little comfort in the pageantry of the season. His boots crunched over frost-tipped grass as he crossed the Eastern courtyard alone, arms crossed and eyes distant.

He hadn’t slept. Again.

“Your Highness.” A soft voice echoed behind him.

Kaelen turned, recognizing Sir Rorin—his shadow more than his guard, the only man in the palace who dared call him by name when protocol demanded title.

“You’ll catch fever,” Rorin said, offering a fur-lined cloak.

Kaelen accepted it, more out of respect than chill. “Did the ravens come?”

“No word from Caer Vardis. Nor from the Northward Pass. But…” Rorin hesitated. “Something else arrived.”

The knight reached into the folds of his surcoat and produced a folded parchment, its edges blackened as if licked by flame. The seal bore no crest, just an indigo smear shaped like a dying star.

Kaelen frowned. “What is this?”

“It appeared in your chambers. No one saw who delivered it.”

The prince opened the letter. The parchment was warm—absurdly so—and bore no ink, only a single line burnt into the paper as though by invisible fire:

“The world is ending. You must come. Midnight’s Hollow. The door opens for no other.”

He blinked. “A jest?”

“I don’t think so,” said Rorin. “It reeks of old magic.”

Kaelen looked up, eyes stormed. “Get the horses.”

Chapter Two: Midnight’s Hollow

They rode hard through the Rivenwood, avoiding the high roads where questions gathered like flies. Only Rorin and Kaelen knew the journey’s purpose, though the prince himself wasn’t sure he understood it. A message without a name, a warning with no reason, and a place that did not exist on any map he knew. Midnight’s Hollow. A fable, whispered by old women to children to keep them from wandering into the hills.

They reached the place after five nights. The Hollow was not marked by any sign or landmark, but they knew it when they saw it—a clearing where the trees leaned away rather than toward, and the sky above was unnaturally dark, as if time forgot this piece of land.

In the center, a door stood upright, embedded in nothing, its frame made of bone and bramble.

“Gods,” Rorin murmured.

Kaelen approached it slowly. There was no handle. No seam.

He reached out. The surface shimmered under his hand and, without sound, opened.

Beyond was not another part of the forest—but a chamber of lightless stone, carved in impossible angles, walls humming with ancient energy. And standing at its heart, a woman draped in silver threads, her eyes black as coals and burning just the same.

“Welcome, Prince of the Cracked Crown,” she said.

Kaelen stiffened. “You know me.”

She nodded. “I called you.”

“Why?”

“The world dies, and you must stop it.”

Chapter Three: The Fractured World

Her name was Virell, Keeper of the Eclipsed Flame. She spoke in broken riddles at first, her tongue old as forgotten suns. But she told him the truth, or at least her truth: that the world—Aravell—was not whole. Not anymore. It had fractured long ago during the War of the Splintering Sky, and only now, centuries later, were the wounds beginning to bleed again.

“There are seven shards,” she explained, gesturing to a constellation map etched into the stone. “Each a fragment of the Prime Source. And each guarded, hidden, cursed.”

“And you want me to collect them?” Kaelen asked, his brow furrowed.

“No,” she replied, voice quiet. “You must earn them.”

One was kept in the Hollow Monastery, guarded by monks who spoke only in dreams. Another in the Ruins of Sylveth, beneath the bones of the first dragon. A third lay sealed in the chest of a sleeping god.

Kaelen felt laughter rising in his throat. “You’re mad.”

“No more than the world,” she said. “But you’ve already begun. The moment you opened the door, your path was inked.”

“I have no army. No magic.”

“You have choice. That is the rarest power.”

Chapter Four: A Blade Named Mourning

The Hollow spat them out onto a different path, far south of Eldareth. The skies here were bruised purple, the sun a sickle barely scraping the edge of the horizon. The land was barren but not empty.

They came upon a village hollowed by silence—no people, no livestock, just houses whose doors bled rust. On the altar of a broken chapel lay a sword, black as obsidian, hilt wrapped in silver thread. It vibrated faintly, humming like a whispered name.

Kaelen touched it—and saw fire.

A battlefield. Screams. Himself, older, broken, kneeling before a burning city.

Then, nothing.

When he awoke, Rorin stood over him.

“The sword,” Kaelen gasped. “Did you touch it?”

“No,” Rorin said. “But it sings to you.”

Virell’s voice echoed in his skull. “That is Mourning, the blade that remembers. It will show you the cost before the choice.”

Chapter Five: The Monk’s Dream

They reached the Hollow Monastery after ten more days, guided by visions Kaelen could not explain. Dreams and symbols, voices in the wind. The monks greeted him not with words but by pressing their foreheads to his and filling his mind with images: a child with no face, drowning in black water; a tower of screaming mirrors; a field of clocks all ticking backward.

The trial was simple. Kaelen was given a vial of blood and told to drink it.

“What is it?” he asked.

Rorin frowned. “Poison?”

“A memory,” one monk said aloud, breaking their vow. “Of someone you’ve never been. You must become him, and find your way back.”

Kaelen drank.

He was suddenly elsewhere—a thief in a city of smoke, hunted by guards for a crime he didn’t commit. He had no sword, no name. He had only instinct.

It took him seven days in the dream to remember he was a prince. When he awoke, the shard lay on his chest, a sliver of gold encased in a stone heart.

Chapter Six: Betrayal in Sylveth

Sylveth was a ruin of bones and shattered marble. Once a city of dragons, now a graveyard.

They weren’t alone.

A group of mercenaries had arrived days before, led by a woman Kaelen once called friend—Captain Serah Valen, now exiled from Eldareth for reasons too tangled to speak of.

“Kaelen,” she said, drawing her blade. “Or do you call yourself something else now?”

“I need the shard,” he said.

She smiled. “Then you’ll have to bleed for it.”

What followed was chaos—steel on stone, shouts, fire. Rorin took a spear to the side. Kaelen dueled Serah beneath a crumbling arch, their swords ringing like bells.

She was better. Always had been.

But Kaelen was different now.

He let Mourning guide him, saw the futures behind her eyes. Saw her die. Saw her live.

He chose mercy. Knocked the sword from her hand. Offered his instead.

She stared at it. “You’re a fool.”

“Maybe.”

She took his hand.

And together, they entered the dragon’s tomb.

Chapter Seven: When the Sky Split

With three shards in hand, the sky began to change. Colors bled wrong. Birds flew backward. Children spoke in dead tongues.

Virell returned in flame.

“Time frays,” she warned. “You must hurry. The next shard is buried in the Wastes of Harn, where time forgot itself.”

“And the others?” Kaelen asked.

“They will come to you. But beware—the Starborn have seen you.”

“Who?”

She faded.

The Starborn came that night. Creatures of glass and breath, with no faces but thousands of mouths. They whispered Kaelen’s name in every voice he’d ever heard, even those long dead.

He did not sleep.

He did not dare.

Kaelen stood still for a long time after the woman’s form vanished into smoke. The torchlight in the strange chamber flickered against the wet, dark stone, casting shadows that danced with a rhythm that seemed off, like a heartbeat too slow or too fast. He tried to tell himself this was a dream, some elaborate jest played by sorcerers or madmen—but deep in his bones, he already knew that was not true. The air in this place was too heavy with meaning, too dense with the kind of silence that only ancient truths could summon.

He looked to Rorin, who hadn’t stepped inside the door but had come close enough to lean against its invisible threshold. The knight’s brow was creased, his mouth pressed into a thin line, but his hand did not reach for his sword. That alone spoke volumes.

“What did she say?” Rorin asked, eyes scanning the room as if trying to understand how it fit into the world they knew.

Kaelen didn’t answer immediately. He turned, walking back through the door, half-expecting it to shut behind him and leave him lost forever in that unnatural chamber. But the door remained open until he crossed the threshold—and then, without fanfare, it simply closed. A blink, and it was gone. The frame had vanished, no scorch mark left on the grass, no shimmer in the air. Just trees again, leaning in as if the moment had never happened.

“She said the world is ending,” Kaelen said finally, his voice hollow.

“Well,” Rorin muttered, adjusting the hilt of his blade, “at least it’s not another arranged betrothal.”

Kaelen didn’t laugh. Instead, he turned back toward the horses. “We’ll need supplies. Provisions. And no questions asked.”

“You’re not thinking of returning to the palace?” Rorin asked, tone bordering on alarm.

“No,” Kaelen replied. “We go east. There’s an old sage near the Glass Hills. He used to talk of things like this. Runes, stars, cracks in the veil. My brother always called him a madman.”

“Your brother calls squirrels mad when they don’t run,” Rorin said. He paused. “Does this have something to do with the plague in Vesseran? Or those stories out of the marshlands—the black rain and blood-colored fog?”

Kaelen shook his head. “I don’t know. But if I wait to understand, we’ll already be too late.”

They rode again before dawn, their horses restless and snorting in the chill.
