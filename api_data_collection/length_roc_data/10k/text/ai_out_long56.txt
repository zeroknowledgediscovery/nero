The Echo Protocol
By Anonymous

Chapter One: The Tip

The coffee was bitter, but Sam Keller needed it. Outside, D.C. was drowning in sleet and dirty snow, January’s final insult to a tired city. The barista wore a bored expression, and Sam watched her hand the receipt to the next customer as if she’d handed out a death certificate. He rubbed his eyes, shifting the weight of the Canon DSLR hanging from his shoulder.

Sam wasn’t just tired. He was unraveling.

On his cracked phone screen, a message blinked in encrypted green:

“Check your burner. Echo Protocol is live.”

No name. No context. Just the familiar shiver of a whistleblower's digital whisper.

He slipped his hand into the inner pocket of his worn parka and retrieved the burner phone he kept nested in foil. He powered it up, fingers trembling—not from the cold, but from the slow, awful certainty that whatever came next would bury him deeper than the last time.

A single .txt file waited.

    “Langley set-up confirmed. Echo live. You have 72 hrs. They’re watching. Archive at old quarry safehouse. Trust no one. Delete after reading.”

He deleted it, of course. But it was already too late. In Langley, alarms were quietly ringing. Men with no last names and silver laptops were turning toward his metadata.

The journalist in him couldn’t help it. A lead like this was fire and blood and truth. It was the itch that kept him alive through five warzones and a kidnapping in Sudan. But Echo Protocol? That wasn’t just a scandal—it was myth. The kind of black program you only heard about in suicide notes.

His heart was pounding before he left the café. The Canon? Just cover. The real lens was in his mind, clicking open to a story that could end presidencies—or end him first.

Chapter Two: The Quarry

Sam parked the rented sedan two miles out from the quarry. He used back roads and avoided gas stations with cameras. This wasn’t his first time walking into a ghost’s house.

The wind knifed through the forest, carrying the smell of frostbitten pine and long-dead leaves. He moved fast, checking his six every ten steps. Somewhere in that black tree line, the eyes might already be watching.

The safehouse wasn’t a house, not really. Just an old storage shack built into the stone face. Someone had tried to torch it years ago, but the reinforced steel beneath the soot still held.

Inside, the floor groaned under his boots. A single bulb dangled from the ceiling, flickering as he yanked the chain. The box sat in the corner, where the message said it would be.

He knelt. Flipped open the lid.

A laptop, heavily modified, battery removed. A plastic bag filled with hard drives. And a single printed dossier labeled:

OP: ECHO // RESTRICTED LEVEL BLACK

He opened it.

Page after page of redacted memos, dead analyst names, and surveillance logs from inside American borders. Massive, illegal dragnet programs. Unlawful psychological operations run on U.S. soil. Dissidents—journalists, senators, citizens—flagged as domestic threats.

He turned the page and stopped breathing.

There was a surveillance photo of himself. Leaving his old apartment in New York. Dated two months ago.

KELLER, SAMUEL - SUBJECT LEVEL 1 (LEAK RISK)

Underneath, someone had scrawled by hand in red ink:
“Containment authorized.”

He snapped the laptop shut and stuffed everything into a backpack. Then he ran.

Chapter Three: The Shadow on His Six

The first tail was a dark SUV he spotted just past the county line. No plates. The driver was wearing sunglasses at night.

The second came hours later—a woman at a gas station pretending to shop for sunflower seeds while glancing at him through the aisle mirror. She smiled too long. And her coat bulged near the waist.

Sam kept driving. He didn’t check into any hotels. Slept in the car one night, a motel parking lot the next. He ate gas station food and hacked open vending machines for water.

He called no one. Not even Hailey.

But she called him.

At 4:22 a.m., his burner buzzed once.

“Keller?”

Her voice hit him like an old wound.

“Hailey? Jesus, how—”

“You’ve been flagged, Sam. I got into an old NSA queue before they locked me out. Your name is echoing hard through the system. You need to dump your car. Tonight.”

“I found the archive. It’s real.”

There was a pause.

“Then you’re dead unless you disappear. Right now. There’s chatter. Langley activated a black recovery team. You know what that means.”

“Cleaner squad.”

“Worse. The Red Index.”

He swallowed hard. That name. Even she sounded afraid saying it.

She whispered, “They don’t arrest. They erase.”

Chapter Four: Red Index

The Red Index wasn’t just a hit team.

It was the CIA’s worst-kept secret among the worst people in journalism. A division that didn’t officially exist. Born out of the Patriot Act’s loopholes, made lethal through Presidential Findings signed in invisible ink.

Sam remembered an ex-CIA asset in Yemen telling him a story once. A journalist in Caracas wrote too close to a real op. The Red Index dropped his body into the ocean from 10,000 feet. No evidence, no trace. Just a severed phone call mid-interview.

And now Sam was on their list.

He stopped the car in an underpass outside Pittsburgh and torched it. Left the bag in a waterproof case under a bridge, using coordinates he memorized as a kid. Then he walked. Caught a bus using a fake ID. Changed in the bathroom. Became someone else.

But even ghosts get hunted.

By the time he hit Chicago, he felt them again. Not just people. Signals. Every public camera he passed, every Bluetooth ping, every ATM lens—they were watching.

He tapped back into his network. Old anarchist contacts. A woman named Rook met him in a parking garage near Wicker Park. Her Mohawk was gone, replaced by a grey hoodie.

“You really pissed off the devil this time, Keller,” she said.

“I need a secure upload node. Clean. Untraceable.”

“I’ve got one. But you only get one shot. After that, we burn everything.”

He handed her the drive.

Chapter Five: Exposure

The upload node was buried in the bandwidth of an abandoned ISDN line—clean enough, Rook promised, to buy him thirty seconds.

He uploaded it all.

All the evidence. The Echo memos. The illegal surveillance programs. The list of U.S. citizens targeted by psychological operations. The names of senators compromised, judges blackmailed, journalists ghosted.

Then he attached one final document: the Red Index list.

At the top:
Keller, Samuel
Hailey Tran
Sen. Arlen Weiss
Ellie Madani (deceased)

The upload confirmed.

He wiped the drives and set fire to the building. By dawn, the sky above Chicago glowed with sirens. Somewhere, someone clicked open the leak. Somewhere else, the CIA’s internal systems lit up like a Christmas tree.

But Sam didn’t stop moving.

Chapter Six: Extraction

The plan was simple. Get to Montreal. Disappear through back channels into Iceland or Russia—anywhere with no extradition and a distaste for American intelligence.

But Hailey met him at the border.

She looked older than he remembered. Her voice was low, dry. “They traced my IP. I had 11 minutes to evacuate. They know I helped.”

“I shouldn’t have called you.”

“You always say that. Then you call anyway.”

They kissed once. It was short. Sad.

They hit the border fence at 3 a.m., slipping under floodlights and motion sensors. Hailey hacked a cam feed. Sam cut a hole in the fence. On the other side: cold freedom.

But gunfire shattered the silence.

They ran. Hailey fell. Sam dragged her. Her blood warmed his hands.

The Red Index wasn’t far behind.

Outside, the snow had begun to fall harder, thickening the grayness of the city until it seemed like the skyline itself had been erased. Sam stood beneath the overhang of the café’s awning for a long moment, watching people walk by with their heads down, hats pulled tight, shoulders hunched into winter’s bite. Everyone looked anonymous here. That’s why he’d picked D.C. after New York fell apart. It was a city built on secrets, full of people who learned to look past each other. Perfect for someone who no longer belonged to any place.

He walked five blocks to where he’d parked his beat-up Civic, checking every reflection in the glass storefronts along the way. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for yet—maybe someone just a little too still, a shadow that moved against the grain—but instinct kept tugging at the edges of his senses. When he slid into the driver’s seat, he sat for a full minute without turning the key. The burner phone still rested in his pocket like a hot coin. He didn’t trust it anymore. Hell, he didn’t trust anything anymore. But curiosity was the hook. It always had been. And now something was pulling, hard.

The drive to the apartment was uneventful, though he took a long route, doubling back twice, slipping through alleys, and circling the block before finally easing the car into the underground garage beneath the old brownstone he’d been renting under the name “Jonathan Carr.” The place wasn’t much, just two rooms stacked on top of one another with creaky floors and spotty heat. But the rent was cash and the landlord never asked questions, which made it home enough.

Upstairs, he dumped his coat and gear, tossed the burner on the counter, and locked both deadbolts behind him. The dossier’s message haunted him. Echo Protocol is live. He’d heard the term only once before, whispered during a classified briefing transcript leaked to the foreign press years ago, then mysteriously scrubbed. That one reference was enough to fuel a dozen conspiracy sites and a handful of deep-dive Reddit threads, but even those had gone quiet. People who dug too deep into Echo tended to vanish. He remembered one user—“Veritas1337”—who had mapped a few names connected to Echo and posted them on a now-defunct forum. A week later, a local newspaper in Florida reported that he’d “fallen” from the roof of his three-story apartment building. Case closed.

Sam opened his laptop and began scanni
