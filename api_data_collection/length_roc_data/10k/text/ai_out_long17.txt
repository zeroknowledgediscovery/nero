Title: When We Were Ferns
Author: [Redacted]
Chapter One: The Creek Behind the Hollow

In the summer of 1998, the sun never really set in Willowbend. Not in the minds of the children, at least. It hung low, orange and wide as a yawning mouth, for hours on end, painting shadows on the cracked pavement and rusted swing sets. Days dragged lazily like beetles across the backyard fence, and the nights were filled with cricket chirps and whispered dares.

Tommy Granger and Evie Malone were best friends since before either of them could spell the word. Their mothers met in Lamplight Grocery on the corner of Mulberry and 3rd, back when diapers were still a relevant concern. From that day on, it seemed like Tommy and Evie were handed to each other by fate—or perhaps just bored suburban proximity. They lived three houses apart on Cedar Loop and navigated those few hundred feet with the urgency of diplomats on secret missions.

Tommy was lanky and pale, with knobby knees and a thousand questions. His front tooth never quite caught up with the rest of his smile, giving him a perpetual look of surprise. Evie had a constellation of freckles across her nose and eyes that changed colors depending on her mood—green when she laughed, gray when she lied. She wore oversized T-shirts from her older brother's drawer and had an irrational fear of dryer lint.

Their world, in the beginning, revolved around the creek behind the Hollow, a small wooded area just past the cemetery where kids weren’t supposed to go. The trees there whispered to each other in a language only kids could almost understand. The creek ran cold even in July, and its bed was paved in smooth pebbles and secrets.

"This one looks like a dinosaur egg," Evie announced one afternoon, holding up a lump of mossy stone.

Tommy squinted. “Looks like a potato that forgot what it was.”

“It’s a dinosaur egg. You just don’t have the imagination.”

“You don’t have the science,” he shot back, flinging a pebble into the current.

They sat cross-legged on a fallen log, their feet dangling just above the water.

“If we ever find a real dinosaur,” Evie said after a while, “we shouldn’t tell anyone.”

“Obviously.”

“We’ll keep it here, teach it tricks, feed it peanut butter and stuff.”

“It’d probably eat your face.”

“Better mine than yours,” she grinned, and they both knew she meant it.

That summer was full of inventions. They created a language made mostly of grunts and whistles. They mapped the forest on a scrap of cardboard and named the clearings after inside jokes. There was Mosquito Point, where Tommy got bitten seventeen times in one sitting. There was Lint Hollow, a soft mossy patch where Evie had once had a panic attack after seeing a ball of dryer lint in her backpack. And there was the “Fern Circle,” a ring of ferns so perfectly shaped that they decided it was magic. Only they were allowed inside. It was a rule.

Rules mattered. More than anything.
Chapter Two: Rules are Rules (Until They're Not)

Evie and Tommy had rules like other kids had video games. Rule #1: No lying—except when absolutely necessary (a clause added after the Great Spaghetti Incident of ‘96). Rule #2: No crying unless it’s over a pet or a grandparent. Rule #3: If one of us dies, the other has to avenge their death, even if it’s just by being really sad for a long time.

Rule #7 was important. It was about The Notebook.

Tommy’s grandfather, a retired postal worker who had lost most of his hearing and all of his social filter, gave him an old leather-bound journal one Christmas. "For your truths," he had said, with a crooked wink. The Notebook became their confessional, their logbook, their story archive. Everything went in there: dream fragments, overheard adult conversations, sketches of the Fern Circle. On page 73, there was a poorly drawn but deeply felt map of a future treehouse. On page 94, a blood pact.

They hid The Notebook in an old tin lunchbox under a rock by the creek. Every time they buried it, they did a short, solemn ritual. It involved clinking together juice boxes and a weird chant Evie made up that sounded vaguely Latin but was mostly gibberish.

The summer stretched on. Fireflies came and went. A boy named Aaron Rayburn moved into town and tried to climb the Hollow fence. Tommy pushed him into a patch of poison ivy for that.

“What if someone finds our notebook?” Evie asked one afternoon, legs dangling over the creek as usual.

“They won’t,” said Tommy, skipping a stone.

“But what if they do?”

“Then they’ll know what it’s like to be us. Might make ‘em better people.”

Evie didn’t reply to that. Instead, she reached into the water and pulled out a fish skeleton—just the spine and tail, almost artistic in its simplicity. She held it up to the sky.

“Do you think we’ll still be friends when we’re old?”

“How old?”

“Like…thirty.”

Tommy laughed. “Thirty’s not old. That’s just grown-up kid.”

“I don’t want to be a grown-up kid. I want to stay a kid-kid.”

He shrugged. “Then don’t grow up.”

“Deal.”

But people always say that, don’t they?
Chapter Three: Rain, and Other Cracks

On August 11th, it rained hard. One of those fast, angry storms that comes from nowhere and soaks the world in minutes. The trees bowed, the roads flooded, and the creek rose like it had something to prove.

Tommy and Evie met under the bus stop roof, both soaked through.

“We have to check the notebook,” she said, wiping water from her eyes.

“It’ll be fine, it’s in the box.”

“It’s metal. Metal rusts.”

“It’s supposed to rust. That makes it cooler.”

They went anyway, sloshing through ankle-deep water and hopping the fence to the Hollow. The creek was a raging, muddy mess, and their rock marker was gone.

Evie screamed.

Tommy dropped to his knees and started digging where he thought the lunchbox had been. Mud clung to his arms like wet skin.

“It’s gone. Oh god. It’s gone.”

“We’ll find it,” he said, teeth clenched.

But they didn’t. Not that day. Not the next either.

The Fern Circle was half underwater. The ferns flattened, trampled by the storm like the world had stepped on their little magic kingdom.

Something changed after that.

They still met at the creek. Still made up games. But Evie laughed less. Tommy grew quieter. There was a new edge to their silences.

Then came September.

School meant different classes. Different friends. Evie started hanging around Mira Halstead, a girl who wore eyeliner and knew all the lyrics to Alanis Morissette songs. Tommy got obsessed with space, spent hours in the library alone reading about quasars and dark matter.

They still met. Sometimes. But the Fern Circle remained empty.
Chapter Four: The Year That Wasn't

1999 came quietly. No apocalypse. No Y2K panic in Willowbend. Just fireworks over the lake and cheap champagne spilled on carpet by parents who would regret it later.

Tommy and Evie barely spoke that winter.

Not because of a fight, exactly.

Because life shifted.

Tommy's dad got a new job. Spent more time away. His mom started sleeping on the couch. Evie’s parents divorced after a screaming match that ended with a broken vase and three cop cars on the lawn.

Everything became smaller. More adult.

By March, Tommy was drawing black holes in the margins of his math homework. Evie was writing song lyrics in sharpie on her arms and refusing to explain them.

They didn’t go back to the Hollow until April.

The notebook was still gone.

Or so they thought.

But then—

“Tommy. Look.”

Evie held it. The leather was warped and cracked, but unmistakable.

“It was in my mom’s closet,” she said quietly. “I don’t know how it got there.”

They sat in the Fern Circle again—new ferns growing from the soggy earth.

Page 117 was new.

It was written in a messy, unsure hand. Not Tommy’s. Not Evie’s.

Just a sentence:

“You forgot the rules.”

One particularly sweltering day in mid-July, when even the insects seemed too tired to buzz, Tommy and Evie made the decision to run away. Not forever—just for a few hours. They packed a backpack with peanut butter crackers, two Capri Suns, and a small flashlight that barely worked unless you hit it first. Evie smuggled out a bag of gummy worms from her kitchen pantry and a plastic magnifying glass she claimed could start a fire if you aimed it right. Tommy brought the compass from his dad’s old army kit and a comic book rolled tightly into a cylinder. The plan was to make it as far as Gorman’s Field and camp under the stars until at least 10 p.m., which in their minds was basically the same as being feral.

They set out just after lunch, weaving through side streets and ducking past chain-link fences. The field, which was actually an overgrown lot behind a shuttered auto shop, looked like a patch of green defiance in a town built on cracked asphalt and quiet disappointments. No one went there except the occasional high schooler looking to sneak a cigarette, but to Tommy and Evie, it was their wild frontier.

They laid out a blanket in the tallest patch of grass, where the world couldn’t see them. Above, clouds drifted lazily like they had nowhere better to be. Around them, dragonflies skated on the air, and the sound of distant traffic was muffled by the thick summer hush.

"I think I could live out here forever," Evie said, chewing on a gummy worm.

"You’d miss running water in like, two hours," Tommy replied.

"I'd dig a well. You think I'm not resourceful?"

He chuckled and flopped onto his back, shielding his eyes from the sun with one arm. "You'd die of dysentery by day three."

"Whatever. I’d outlive you by a week at least."

They lay in silence for a while, letting the heat settle around them like a heavy blanket. Tommy thought about how quiet everything was, how the field seemed to hum with the kind of magic that only existed when adults weren’t watching.

Evie broke the silence. "Do you think people are born best friends, or do they grow into it like a skin?"

He turned his head to look at her. "Like a skin?"

"You know
