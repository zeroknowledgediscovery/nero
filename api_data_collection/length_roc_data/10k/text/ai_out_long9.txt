Title: Pas de Ciel

Chapter One: The Smell of Rosin

The studio smelled of sweat, wood, and rosin—the holy trinity of ballet. Marianne Duclair stood at the barre, her hands resting lightly on the smooth wood as if she were afraid it might slip away. The windows behind her were streaked with rain, and the pale gray light that filtered in made the room look ghostly. Her reflection stared back from the mirror with a strange flicker, as if it too were unsure of its place in the world.

She was twenty-three and far too old to be uncertain. Her thighs trembled with fatigue. The morning rehearsal had already pushed most of the corps de ballet to the brink, but she lingered. Madame Reiko, the company’s Japanese-French ballet mistress, watched from a corner, arms folded, eyes sharp as razors.

"Again," she said without raising her voice. But it sliced the air.

Marianne swallowed the dry sting in her throat. She stepped into first position, toes turned out with painful precision, and raised her arms into fifth en haut. The music began—Chopin, as mournful as it was exquisite. She moved.

Her body remembered. The pirouette was better this time—less wobble, more grace. She finished the combination, chest heaving. Madame Reiko didn’t blink.

"Acceptable," the woman said, then vanished like smoke into the hallway.

Marianne allowed herself to collapse onto the floor, legs in a V, breathing through her nose. The parquet was cool. Behind her, Léon Marchand, principal dancer and self-declared king of the Parisian stage, sauntered in. His hair was a chaos of curls. His grin, practiced and predatory.

"Trying to impress Reiko, ma chère?" he asked, dropping to a split beside her.

"I’d settle for surviving her," Marianne said, without looking at him.

He laughed, a genuine sound for once. "That’s the secret. Don’t try to win her. She eats victories for breakfast."

They sat in silence, the music replaying in someone’s phone speaker nearby. Marianne finally looked over. Léon was stretching, arms behind his back, lean as a whip. Beautiful. Dangerous.

"Do you ever think about quitting?" she asked, surprising herself.

His brow furrowed. "No. Never."

"Not even for—"

"For what?" he snapped, then softened. "There’s nothing else. There never was."

Marianne nodded, even though she didn’t agree. She’d thought about it a thousand times—at night, when her feet throbbed so violently they felt like open wounds; in the wings, when the curtain rose and she realized she didn’t know who she was outside the spotlight. But she kept dancing. Kept surviving. Ballet was a cruel god, and she had long since offered up her soul.

Chapter Two: Glass Castles

The apartment on Rue des Martyrs was cramped and smelled faintly of lavender and mildew. Marianne lived with her younger sister, Camille, who studied architecture at École des Beaux-Arts and seemed made of brighter, gentler matter. Camille had once tried ballet, too, but her knees betrayed her.

"You're home late," Camille said, emerging from the tiny kitchen with two mugs of peppermint tea. "You look like a corpse."

"Thanks." Marianne accepted the cup gratefully. Her hands were cracked from resin.

"You eat today?"

"Coffee counts."

"Mm. That’s not eating." Camille sat cross-legged on the couch, which groaned under her slight weight. Her drawings were everywhere—on the floor, the walls, even the ceiling, taped like stars. "You’ve got to take care of yourself, Mari."

"I do. I stretch. I rest."

"That’s not care. That’s maintenance. There’s a difference."

They sipped their tea in silence. Outside, the rain had stopped, and Paris glimmered like a wet gemstone. Camille glanced sideways.

"You remember Baptiste?"

Marianne nearly choked. "Baptiste Giraud?"

Camille nodded.

"The pianist?"

"He’s back in Paris. Has a show this weekend at the Opéra Garnier. I saw the flyer."

Marianne looked away. Her stomach fluttered unpleasantly. Baptiste had been her first love and her most humiliating loss. He played like the sky falling—wild, beautiful, tragic. But he'd left, without a word. Vanished into Berlin, chasing a scholarship and shadows.

"You should go," Camille said gently.

"I’d rather die."

"Mari—"

"Don’t. Not tonight."

Camille sighed but said no more.

Chapter Three: A Stage of Ash

By the end of the week, the corps was unraveling. The new ballet—Ashes of Giselle—was modern, brutal, and unlike anything Marianne had danced before. There were no tutus. No tidy narratives. Just raw movement, each gesture torn from the soul.

Choreographer Elián Moreno was Argentine, manic, and usually barefoot. He spoke with his hands, his heart, his whole being.

"No more pretty lines!" he shouted during a rehearsal. "You are not dolls. You are not feathers. You are grief. You are fire."

He approached Marianne after one particularly grueling session, sweat dripping from his beard. "You—you are close. But too contained. You’re dancing like someone afraid to fall."

"I’m not."

"Then prove it."

And then he did the unthinkable—he cast her as the lead.

Léon would partner her, of course. There were rumors about them already. About their chemistry. Their arguments. Their nearly-sex in the practice studio last month.

"You think you can handle this?" Léon asked as they reviewed the pas de deux that night, long after the others had gone home.

"Do you doubt me?"

"No. I worry about you."

She stared at him. This wasn’t his usual arrogance. This was fear—naked and fragile.

"You’re afraid I’ll fail?"

"I’m afraid you’ll burn."

She didn’t answer. The music began again, and they danced—clashing, soaring, crashing together like the sea against a lighthouse. It was violent, exquisite. When it ended, they were breathless. Marianne’s eyes shone.

"You should be afraid," she said. "Because I’m not."

Chapter Four: Broken Ribbons

Opening night came like a storm. Camille was in the audience. So was Madame Reiko. And, to Marianne’s horror—Baptiste.

He was thinner. Older. His eyes found hers from the third row, and she nearly stumbled during warm-up.

"Focus," Léon hissed.

"I am."

But she wasn’t.

The performance blurred. She danced with fury, with abandon. The pain in her ankle—a minor sprain from a missed landing earlier that week—screamed. She ignored it. The stage swallowed her whole.

The final solo approached. She had to fall, rise, then leap into Léon’s arms. The leap of death, they called it. No harness. No trick. Just trust and timing.

The music soared.

She ran.

She jumped.

And her ankle snapped mid-air.

Chapter Five: After the Curtain

Hospital lights were always cruel. Marianne lay still, leg in a cast, high on morphine. Léon sat beside her, face pale.

"You’ll dance again," he said, though he didn’t sound convinced.

"I flew," she whispered.

He nodded. "And you fell."

She laughed, then cried.

The door opened. Baptiste entered, holding flowers like an apology.

"Marianne."

She couldn’t speak.

"I’m sorry," he said.

"For leaving or for coming back?"

"For both."

She didn’t know if she forgave him. Not yet. But his hand found hers, and she didn’t pull away.

Outside, the city kept spinning. Inside, a ballerina began to rebuild.

The studio emptied slowly, bodies peeling off the floor, muscle by aching muscle. Marianne lingered near the far wall, wrapping her toes in lamb’s wool with fingers that trembled from fatigue more than cold. The rain continued outside in that lazy Parisian way, a murmur against the glass that made the wooden floors feel warmer by comparison. She had stopped hoping for approval from Madame Reiko a long time ago. The woman’s compliments were like pearls dropped into the sea—rare, unreachable, and often buried under waves of criticism. But today, even "acceptable" had struck something inside her, a brittle chord that hummed long after the music died.

She didn’t hear Adrienne approaching until the girl’s shadow broke over her shoulder. Adrienne was one of the younger corps dancers, no older than nineteen, with strawberry-blonde curls and that unfortunate eagerness of someone who hadn’t yet tasted the bitterness of the world.

"You looked amazing today," Adrienne said, dropping beside her with a thud that made the floor sigh.

Marianne offered a half-smile, grateful but unwilling to fan the flames of anyone’s illusion. "Thanks. I think my legs are about to stage a revolt."

Adrienne giggled, the kind of carefree laugh Marianne remembered making once, years ago when her first pair of pointe shoes still felt like sacred objects. Now they were just tools—necessary, cruel, disposable.

"Do you ever get used to it?" Adrienne asked suddenly, her voice quieter, more fragile.

"The pain?"

"The pressure. The watching. The not knowing if you're enough."

Marianne looked down at her wrapped toes, at the faint smear of blood beneath the gauze. "You don’t get used to it," she said. "You learn to hide it."

Adrienne blinked. "That’s kind of bleak."

"It’s honest."

From across the room, Léon’s voice boomed as he flirted with one of the costume assistants. Marianne watched him with the same wary respect one might give a panther—gorgeous, poised, and deadly. He had danced with the Bolshoi before defecting to Paris. Whispers said he'd once punched a choreographer in Moscow and walked out mid-show. It only made him more mythical.

"You know," Adrienne said, following her gaze, "people think you and Léon are a thing."

Marianne snorted. "People think a lot of things. Doesn’t make them true."

"But you’ve danced together for years."

"Dancing with someone doesn’t mean you know them. It just means you’ve learned how to fall the same way."

That night, Marianne took the Métro home, crammed between a man with paint-stained hands and a student reading Sartre. The world felt heavier after rehearsal, as if gravity had grown teeth. Her feet throbbed in her sneakers, phantom pointe pain pulsing with every jolt of the train. She tried not to think about Baptiste, but his name floated up anyway, unbidden, like
