The Thistlebone Legacy
Chapter One: A House on Wither Hill

They came at dusk, as if the dark itself had beckoned them home. The Grale family—what remained of it—had been gone from Wither Hill for almost twenty years. But on a night thick with mist and the distant growl of thunder, the black Rolls-Royce came purring up the gravel path, headlights bleeding pale through the hanging fog, and stopped at the gate of the old Thistlebone House.

Cassara Grale, the eldest daughter, stepped out first. She wore a dark green coat belted at the waist, gloves too elegant for the mud-caked ground, and her hair in a tight bun that gave nothing away. Behind her, Jules Grale, her younger brother, emerged with a cigarette in his mouth and an expression of vague distaste. The third passenger remained in the backseat for a long moment. When he finally stepped out, even the crows on the fenceposts seemed to hush.

Roman Grale.

Their father.

His face was pale as bone, his eyes sunken but watchful, always watching. As if the trees whispered secrets only he could hear. He stood before the gate of Thistlebone and said nothing, just stared at the rusting emblem of a thistle and a snake twined together, carved into iron. A family crest that no one dared speak of in the village anymore.

"Still here," Cassara murmured, brushing her glove across the gate's surface. “Like rot beneath a floorboard.”

Jules chuckled dryly. “You always did have a way with metaphors, Cass.”

The gate creaked open with a groan that felt like a warning.

They stepped into the past.

The village of Barrow's Dell remembered the Grales all too well. They had been the ruling name here once—not by law, but by fear. Even now, decades since the scandal, older villagers kept their heads down when they heard the name. Shopkeepers who had been boys during the Trial crossed themselves when they passed Thistlebone's overgrown boundary wall.

“Thought they’d burned that place to ash,” muttered Ewan, the blacksmith, as he watched the car disappear up the lane.

His apprentice, a wiry youth named Lew, looked up with a frown. “Who are they, really?”

Ewan spat into the fire. “Ghosts. Rich, well-dressed ghosts with secrets stitched into their coats.”

Inside Thistlebone, the air was stale, like breath held too long. The furniture was covered in white sheets, yellowed at the edges, and the chandeliers hung like skeletal hands from the high ceilings. A single painting still dominated the drawing room—a portrait of Alaric Grale, Roman’s grandfather, eyes burning like coals above a faint smile. The man who built the family’s fortune. The man who vanished in 1913 without a trace.

Cassara pulled the cloth from a nearby chair and sat, dust pluming into the air like a curse. “I assume you have a reason for dragging us back, Father.”

Roman stood by the fireplace, his long fingers brushing across the stone mantel. He stared into the empty hearth as if it held visions.

“It’s time,” he said. “The blood oath was made. And the debt... must be paid.”

Jules scoffed. “Oh come on, are we still clinging to those old stories? Blood oaths and secret chambers and cursed lineages? You want us to play house in this mausoleum until some imaginary debt is cleared?”

Roman turned, slowly. “Not imaginary. Buried. Like everything else in this house.”

There was silence.

Then Cassara spoke. “We need to know everything. All of it.”

The truth began, like most sins, with a body.

In 1892, Alaric Grale found something beneath the hill. A relic of sorts. The villagers called it the Thistle Idol, a carved object that predated the church and the town and perhaps even language itself. The records were burned in the fire of 1899, but the whispers endured. Alaric’s rise to power had been meteoric. Factories. Land. Men who bent the knee with their mouths smiling and eyes terrified.

But there was a cost.

The family kept the idol in a vault under the house. And each generation, it was said, owed a tithe—an offering of blood, either symbolic or real. When the tithes went unpaid… strange things happened.

Roman’s voice broke as he explained it, staring not at his children but at something behind them.

“They took your mother,” he said. “The night I refused. I thought it was a dream. But I heard her—under the floorboards. For weeks. Until she stopped.”

Neither Cassara nor Jules said anything for a long time.

Later that night, Cassara explored the east wing. The power had long since been shut off, so she carried an oil lantern, its golden glow casting eerie shadows along the hallway. She stopped before the nursery door. It was ajar, creaking slightly as if moved by breath alone.

Inside, dust lay thick on the floorboards. The crib remained in one corner, broken at one side. Strange symbols were carved into the wood. Not letters—just looping, coiling shapes like vines or intestines. Cassara knelt and ran her fingers along them.

She didn’t remember this. And yet it felt familiar.

A sudden chill swept the room. She stood quickly and turned.

A child stood in the hallway.

Not moving. Just watching.

Eyes black as pitch.

Then it was gone.

In the morning, Jules walked the grounds. The garden was a ruin of bramble and thistle, weeds grown up through shattered flagstone paths. He kicked a rusted birdbath and lit another cigarette, squinting at the treeline. There was something wrong with the birds here—too quiet. Or perhaps too many of them watching.

He nearly stepped on the half-buried skull before he saw it.

Small. Animal? Maybe. But the jaw was human.

He didn’t scream.

He didn’t even look surprised.

He just muttered, “Well, shit. I guess the rumors weren’t so exaggerated after all.”

They spent the week going through the house, cataloguing old records, journals, and hidden compartments. Roman, despite his age, seemed to grow more lucid by the day, as if being close to the source gave him clarity. On the third night, he showed them the vault.

It was hidden behind the wine cellar, sealed by a puzzle lock carved in the same twisting shapes Cassara had seen in the nursery. Roman pressed his palm to the center, muttered something in a language that seemed wrong in the mouth, and the stone slid aside.

The vault was deep.

At its heart stood a pedestal. And on it, the Idol.

It was no bigger than a human head, carved from dark wood that shimmered like wet stone, pulsing faintly with its own light. The face was twisted, not quite human, with antlers and too many teeth.

Cassara whispered, “It’s alive.”

Jules turned away, muttering, “We’re all bloody insane.”

Roman knelt before it and said, “We must ask for forgiveness. We must offer something.”

Cassara felt something move beneath her skin.

Something waking up.

Back in the village, animals began disappearing. A farmer found his entire flock arranged in a circle, entrails spiraled outward like a symbol. Children spoke of dreams—of the man with black eyes and horns who came to them at night and whispered their names.

The police from Dunwick came once. Then never again.

The Grales stayed in the house. Studying. Preparing.

Jules began to change. His dreams became violent. He took to carrying a knife, though he claimed it was for “practical” reasons. Once, Cassara found him standing in the hallway outside her room, staring at the wall. When she asked what he was doing, he just said, “Listening.”

The house creaked and groaned at all hours, its foundations whispering old stories.

Cassara discovered a journal—her mother’s. Pages torn, water-stained, but enough remained.

“I saw it in Jules when he was three. He watched the idol and it blinked. I tried to burn it once. It bled.”

On the seventh night, Roman went missing.

They found his coat in the garden, torn and wet. No sign of a struggle. No footprints. Only the word PAID carved into the frost of the stone bench.

Cassara took charge.

They would finish this.

Burn the idol. Destroy the vault. End the bloodline if they had to.

But Thistlebone House was not finished with them yet.

Not by a long shot.

That night, the rain came.

It came hard, angry, as if the sky itself resented what the Grales had awakened. Thunder rolled over Wither Hill like the grinding of ancient stones, and the windows of Thistlebone shuddered in their panes. The storm lashed against the house, not like weather, but like a siege. Cassara stood at the window in her father’s study, arms folded tightly, watching the trees sway like dancers in convulsions. The old elms groaned under the weight of the wind, and she could swear they leaned closer than before.

Behind her, the fire burned low. She had piled Roman’s papers on the desk—old ledgers, handwritten records from generations past, pieces of the puzzle they were still trying to assemble. She had expected land deeds, business transactions, maybe some half-buried affairs. Instead, she found scrawled invocations, blood-signed contracts, and diagrams that felt wrong even to look at. One sketch kept reappearing—some kind of circle with symbols around it, always with a crude eye at the center. The words "Dominus Silvarum" were scribbled beneath it more than once.

The Lord of the Woods.

A myth, supposedly. Cassara had read something about it in the old village almanacs—an entity from pre-Christian Barrow's Dell, worshipped in groves and feared in storms. The villagers had buried that past in soil and salt, but the roots had grown back.

She closed the book and stepped away from the desk. She needed air, or at least space from the suffocating layers of secrets that hung in every corner of the house. She found Jules in the drawing room, sprawled in an armchair with a bottle of red wine and a look that could sour milk.

“You’re not sleeping,” she said, not a question.

He looked at her, eyes dull, and took a long pull from the bottle. “Neither are you.”

She sat opposite him, rubbing her temples. “He’s not coming back, is he?”

Jules didn’t answer right away. He leaned forward, resting his elb
