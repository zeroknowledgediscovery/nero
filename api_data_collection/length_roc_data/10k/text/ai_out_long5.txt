Title: The House Next Door

Chapter One: The Fence Line

Maple Lane was the kind of street where everything looked too neat to be real. Lawns mowed to exact inches, porch lights timed to flicker on at twilight, and garbage bins aligned with military precision every Thursday morning. But beneath the surface—underneath the vinyl siding and flowerbeds of pink begonias—there was a slow, simmering unease.

It started, as most things do, quietly.

The Thompsons had lived at number 42 for seven years. Jacob Thompson was a software engineer, quiet and precise, with a beard that never quite matched the color of his thinning hair. His wife, Mara, ran a boutique bakery downtown. Their daughter, Ella, was in fifth grade, all elbows and awkwardness, trying hard to be invisible at school and home. To them, the house next door had always been vacant. No one came. No one went. The mailbox, though pristine, never bore a name.

Until May.

The moving truck arrived early in the morning. Jacob watched from his upstairs office window as men in blue coveralls hauled out a variety of mismatched furniture—some antique, some modern, and all out of sync. A piano with chipped keys. A velvet armchair. A stack of what looked like crates labeled in Cyrillic script. A woman emerged from the passenger seat of a small silver hatchback, her hair in a long dark braid down her back, sunglasses wide enough to hide her entire face.

Mara was the first to introduce herself. She took over a batch of lemon scones and rang the bell at number 40. No answer. The bell didn't chime. She knocked. Still nothing.

Later that evening, as the sun dipped behind the elms lining the street, the woman appeared again—this time in the backyard, barefoot, digging with a small hand shovel under the light of a citronella torch.

Jacob watched her for a long time. She didn’t notice him.

The next morning, there was a fence.

Not a new fence, exactly, but an extension—tall, wooden, and raw-smelling, stretching half the length of their shared property line. It hadn’t been there the day before. No sound of hammering, no scent of fresh-cut timber, just… suddenly, the fence.

Jacob went to investigate. Close up, he could see it was old wood, oddly aged, yet still wet at the base. It didn't match the existing fence in style or height.

“What’s she building?” Mara asked that night over dinner.

“A barrier,” Jacob said.

Ella stabbed at her broccoli. “Maybe she’s a witch.”

Mara frowned. “Don’t be rude.”

“She was digging with a spoon,” Ella added.

“Shovel,” Jacob corrected. “And don’t spy.”

“I wasn’t spying. I was in the treehouse.”

“Still,” he said, though his voice trailed into nothing.

By the weekend, the woman had a name. Or at least, a mailbox label: D. Kalinina.

No one saw her again for a week. No comings or goings. No lights on. Just the occasional scrape of metal against earth. Then came the dog. A massive animal, gray and wiry, with eyes like marbles and a bark that felt like it shook the siding.

Jacob didn’t like dogs.

He had a reason for it—a bite when he was six, from a neighbor’s boxer that had gone “playful” a little too hard. The scar still itched when he was nervous. Mara said it was psychosomatic. Jacob didn’t argue.

Ella, on the other hand, was fascinated. She named the dog “Bones” and whispered to it through the fence slats, even though it never responded.

Three weeks in, the neighborhood watch got involved. Mr. Hinshaw from across the street knocked on the Thompsons’ door with a clipboard and a practiced smile.

“We’re just concerned,” he said. “A new person on the block, strange hours, no community engagement…”

Jacob leaned in the doorway. “She’s not doing anything illegal.”

“We don’t know what she’s doing.”

“Then maybe leave her be.”

Mr. Hinshaw didn’t like that. He made a note on his clipboard.

Two nights later, Bones went missing. The barking stopped.

The silence was worse.

Ella cried at bedtime.

“I didn’t even get to pet him,” she said.

That night, Jacob dreamt of digging. Hands blistering as he clawed at dark soil, pulling up objects he couldn’t recognize—twisted things, broken bones, glass eyes. When he woke, Mara was gone from bed. He found her downstairs, looking out the window.

“She’s out there again.”

Jacob looked. D. Kalinina stood still as a statue in the backyard. No shovel this time. Just standing.

“She knows we’re watching,” Mara whispered.

Chapter Two: Echoes in the Garden

In the third week of June, Ella stopped going outside.

“She won’t even touch the swing,” Mara said. “She says it feels… watched.”

“Watched how?”

“I don’t know, Jacob. Just watched.”

Jacob started noticing little things. Tools going missing from the shed. A pile of feathers near the fence, all of them black and oily. The sound of music at odd hours—an old phonograph maybe, scratchy violin pieces that played and then looped.

Then, a note. Slipped under their front door. No envelope. Just:

“The fence is not for you. Do not look over it.”

Mara wanted to call the police. Jacob talked her down.

“She hasn’t threatened us. Not really.”

“Jacob—”

“We can’t prove it was her.”

“Who else would it be?”

She had a point.

The next day, the fence was higher. Two more boards, crude and uneven, added overnight. Ella said she saw the dog again, in a dream, lying under the apple tree in their yard.

“He said he was sorry,” she whispered to Jacob. “He said she made him dig.”

“Sweetheart, dogs don’t talk.”

“This one does.”

After Ella went to bed, Jacob poured a drink and stood at the window. The house next door was dark. Not empty. Never empty. But dark.

He stepped out into the yard, barefoot. The grass was cool. The air tasted metallic.

At the fence, he pressed his eye to a knothole.

Nothing.

Then a glint—something shiny buried in the soil. A coin?

He reached through the slats, fingertips brushing earth. Cold, hard.

Then a snap. Pain. Something bit him.

He jerked back. Blood on his knuckle. A small tooth-shaped cut.

The next morning, he found a coin on their doormat. Old. Russian, maybe? The date worn down. Mara threw it out. Jacob fished it back.

Things began to spiral.

First, the power flickered, but only in the upstairs hallway. Then Mara’s bakery oven refused to heat beyond 200°F. Jacob’s code at work was corrupted three times in a week. Small things. Minor things. But accumulating.

Mr. Hinshaw left a second note: “We’re having a neighborhood meeting. Attendance expected.”

The meeting was chaos. Everyone whispering rumors, half-formed theories.

“She practices old-world magic.”

“She’s ex-KGB.”

“She’s building a bunker.”

Jacob said nothing. Mara’s hands were clenched in her lap.

Ella drew pictures during the meeting. A dog. A woman with a long braid. A garden full of skulls.

That night, the dream came again. Jacob digging. But this time, he found a mirror. When he looked into it, he saw Bones. And Bones spoke.

“Don’t cross the fence.”

Jacob woke to the sound of hammering. He rushed to the window.

No one there.

But the fence was taller still.

Chapter Three: Crosswinds

By July, the heat had turned oppressive. The kind that made pavement bleed tar and cicadas drone like haunted machines. The fence at number 40 now stood at nearly ten feet—looming, overgrown with some type of vine that hadn’t been there the week before. Leaves dark as bruises, pulsing gently in the wind, though no wind moved.

Jacob had stopped working from home. He couldn’t focus. The dreams were worse. The same digging, the same mirror, but now, Mara was in them too—her eyes milked over, whispering in a language he didn’t recognize.

Ella wouldn’t leave her room.

The school had called. Summer reading was behind. The teacher sounded vaguely annoyed, as if Ella’s silence was a deliberate act of rebellion. Jacob didn’t explain. How could he? Their daughter now painted with only shades of gray and blue, smeared with fingers and rags.

One morning, the family awoke to find something left on their doorstep.

A cage.

Inside: three small bones and a bird feather.

Mara cried.

They didn’t call the police. Not anymore. Something unspoken hung between them—a realization too heavy to say aloud.

Kalinina was not just strange.

She was something else.

That afternoon, Jacob climbed into the attic and opened the crawlspace above the ceiling. Dust made his eyes burn, but he needed to see—needed proof that he hadn’t imagined it.

And there, nestled between the joists, was another coin.

Same shape. Same worn-down face. Except this one had blood on it.

He cleaned it. He didn’t tell Mara.

Later that week, the neighbors on the far end of Maple Lane—the Cartwrights—moved out without warning. One morning their car was gone, garage door ajar, trash bins overturned. House left unlocked. A for-sale sign planted crooked in the yard two days later.

“Something’s happening,” Mara said.

Jacob nodded.

They barely talked anymore. Just exchanged glances. Muted, huddled communication.

Then the treehouse burned down.

Jacob had been in the shower. Ella screamed—high, shrill, full of panic. He ran out soaked, soap still clinging to his chest.

Flames clawed up the ladder like orange fingers. No sound. No accelerant. Just fire, sudden and sure. The swing set melted into the grass.

And next to the ashes, on their lawn, the third coin.

That night, Jacob broke his promise.

He climbed the fence.

The top was slick. The vines moved as if sensing him, curling slightly toward his arms. He hoisted himself over and dropped, hitting the ground harder than he meant.

Silence.

The backyard was... different. Deeper somehow. As if it didn't exist entirely in this world. The grass was soft, almost damp. The smell of sulfur hovered in the air. A faint blue glow lit the perimeter. There was a garden—but not vegetables. Not flowers.

Bones. Arranged in circles. Runes carved into stones. A phonograph that turned by itself, playing a broken tune over and over.

And the dog.

Bones.

He sat at the far end, u
