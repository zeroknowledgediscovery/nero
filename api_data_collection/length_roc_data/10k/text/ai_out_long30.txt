The Prince of Ash and Ember
Chapter One: The Burden of Crown

The sun hung low above the black hills of Velmira, smearing the clouds in hues of dying fire. From the tall spires of the Iron Citadel, where crows circled and bells chimed with the heaviness of fate, Prince Caelan watched in silence. The gold of his circlet felt too tight around his brow, as though the very metal rebelled against the head it adorned.

He had been crowned not two days past, after the sudden death of King Aldren—his father—whose body now rested in the sealed crypts below the Citadel, still warm with incense and royal sorrow. The circumstances of the king’s death remained unclear. Some said he choked on lamb stew. Others whispered of poison brewed in the courts of Belros to the west. But Caelan suspected his father died of something more ancient and corrosive—fear.

“You shouldn’t be out here alone,” said a voice behind him, soft as ash falling on stone.

Caelan turned. Serel, his mother’s ward and closest companion since childhood, approached with a shawl over her shoulders and wind in her copper hair.

“I’m not alone,” Caelan said. “I’m with the only thing that makes sense in this place—the horizon.”

Serel gave a half-smile. “And does it speak to you more kindly than your councilors?”

“They speak,” he said, his tone dry. “But only of tax levies and feudal tensions. Not a word about the three-headed raven seen flying over the Sable Woods, or why the silver mines in Dros are producing blood instead of ore.”

“That raven’s a myth,” Serel said, but not convincingly. “A tale for the frost-drunk.”

“Then it’s a tale that now flies in daylight,” Caelan said. “Lord Thren saw it himself. He came back pale as ice. And he doesn’t scare easily.”

Silence stretched between them, broken only by the wind dragging clouds like ghosts across the sky.

“There’s more, isn’t there?” Serel asked.

Caelan hesitated, then turned to her fully. “There’s something beneath the castle. Something… older than our line. I dreamt of it last night. A door of bone and smoke, and behind it… whispers.”

Serel paled. “The Wyrd Vaults?”

“I didn’t say it aloud,” he said. “But that’s what I thought too. And the key... my father wore it around his neck, didn’t he?”

Her lips trembled. “He did. A shard of onyx, veined with red.”

“Then I’ll need it.”

“You don’t even know what’s inside!”

“Neither did he. And now he’s dead.”

They stared at each other, the wind a judge between them. Caelan’s fists were tight at his sides.

Chapter Two: Shadows in the Vault

The descent into the underlevels of the Citadel was not a walk but a trial. Stone staircases curved downward in labyrinthine spirals, flanked by torches that lit themselves as Caelan passed. Serel walked beside him, tight-lipped, her hand never straying far from the hilt of her shortblade.

“How many levels does this place have?” Caelan asked, trying to lighten the air.

“I’ve only seen five. The sixth is forbidden. Beyond that…” She trailed off.

“The onyx key fits there?”

“Yes.”

At last, they reached a heavy door shaped like a yawning mouth—its edges lined with what looked like bone, though polished and blackened with age. In the center was a depression shaped perfectly to hold the onyx shard.

Caelan inserted the shard. The door breathed. That was the only way to describe it—a low, guttural exhalation like a beast waking from slumber. The stone creaked, groaned, then melted inward.

Inside was a chamber unlike any in the castle. It pulsed. The walls looked fleshy, living—blood vessels bulging with unseen pressure.

There were no relics here. No treasure. Only a stone dais, and upon it, an object wrapped in cloths of gold thread and ash-dyed silk.

He stepped forward.

“Caelan, wait—”

But he had already reached it. He unwrapped the cloth. Inside was a mask, shaped like a human face, but wrong—too long in the jaw, with eye holes that seemed deeper than the skull.

When he touched it, his vision turned to flame.

He was no longer in the vault. He was standing on a plain of scorched stone, beneath a sky of writhing smoke. A tower of obsidian rose before him, and from it came a voice that cracked the earth:

“Heir of fire. Child of ash. Your blood remembers.”

And then the vision shattered, and he collapsed, gasping.

Chapter Three: The Council’s Teeth

The next morning, Caelan stood before the Royal Council with heavy eyes and ash on his skin he could not wash off.

“You opened the Vault?” Chancellor Merid said, rising from her seat. “Are you mad?”

“Madness would be ignoring what lies beneath our feet,” Caelan said. “I saw something—no, I was shown something. A vision. This kingdom stands on a grave, and it is no longer sleeping.”

General Voreth leaned forward. “Dreams and relics don’t win wars. We have raiders on the southern shores. Pirans breaking treaties. Why do you chase ghosts?”

“Because they’re already in our halls,” Caelan snapped. “The mines bleed. The sky shrieks. Even the land is turning sour. These aren’t signs of war. These are omens.”

Serel stood to his side, quiet but firm. “The prince speaks truth. And more—King Aldren knew. He kept the Vault sealed for a reason. But secrecy didn’t save him.”

The council murmured, divided. Some looked fearful. Others scoffed.

Caelan raised his hand. “I’ll send an envoy to the Oracles of Erowen. They understand the old magicks. We need knowledge, not swords.”

“They’ll demand a price,” Merid said.

“They always do,” Caelan replied.

Chapter Four: The Oracle’s Curse

The journey to Erowen took three days on windsteeds. The hills gave way to glassy lakes, and forests where the trees whispered in languages long dead.

At last they came to the Temple of Threads, a woven palace made from living vines and glimmering spider silk.

The Oracles greeted them not with words but with a song—a piercing harmony that made Serel weep and Caelan grit his teeth.

The High Oracle, a man with skin like bark and eyes of gold, approached.

“You wear the scent of the Vault,” he said. “The mask has chosen.”

“I need answers,” Caelan said.

“You won’t like them.”

“Give them anyway.”

The Oracle reached out and touched Caelan’s brow. Again the world slipped.

He saw fire. Endless fire. Cities crumbling. A sea turned to black glass. And above it all, the tower from before—only now, it cracked, and from its peak emerged a figure in the mask.

Himself.

The Oracle pulled away.

“You are the Flamebound. The last of the Ember Line. Your blood was sealed to keep the old god from rising. But now the seals fail.”

“What god?” Caelan asked, voice tight.

“Not a god. A hunger. A king of nothing. The Hollow Flame.”

“And what must I do?”

“Choose. Rule as a man… or awaken as a god.”

Chapter Five: Treason in the Ashes

They returned to Velmira under moonlight, only to find the city changed.

Smoke curled from the palace. The gates were barred.

The steward met them in secret. “The Council has moved against you,” he whispered. “They say you’re possessed. That you seek to summon the old fire.”

“And do they not see it already burns?” Caelan growled.

Serel gripped his arm. “We need allies.”

“I’ll find them,” Caelan said. “Among the broken, the banished, the forgotten. If the crown no longer fits the head, then let me be something else.”

He removed the circlet. Left it on the steward’s table.

“I go now not as prince,” he said. “But as firewalker.”

And in the distance, the wind howled like a herald of things to come.

Caelan left Serel by the parapets and made his way down the winding stone corridors of the Citadel, his boots echoing in the hush that lingered after dusk. The castle always breathed differently at night. Its walls seemed to exhale secrets, and every candle flame flickered like it feared what shadows might reveal. The court was asleep—at least the part of it that didn’t work under moonlight, scheming in the alcoves, conspiring over goblets of wine. The young prince knew better than to believe power slumbered with the sun.

The private quarters of the king—no, his quarters now—remained sealed. Caelan hadn’t yet crossed the threshold. There was something indecent in doing so before the scent of his father had faded from the cushions and books and drapery. Instead, he spent his nights in the map chamber, poring over old routes and contested borders, trying to understand the world his blood had condemned him to rule.

He lit the lantern by the table and unrolled the vellum spread across the surface, tracing the river lines that marked the Kingdom of Velmira’s reach. Northward, the jagged teeth of the Fenrock Mountains had long marked the limit of human endurance. To the west lay the sea, though the harbors had gone quiet since the storm that swallowed the fleet of Arvalen, the High Admiral’s son among them. In the east, the Dead Glades—uncharted and bristling with memories too old for maps. And south, always south, the realm of Belros, where ambitions simmered hotter than the red sands that birthed them.

A cough from the corner startled him. He turned, reaching instinctively for the short dagger at his belt.

“Peace, Highness,” said a familiar voice, soft and dry as crumbling parchment.

Caelan narrowed his eyes. “Old Karn.”

The royal historian emerged from the shadow, a stack of brittle scrolls under one arm, his thin frame draped in ink-stained robes. “You burn candles faster than the scribes, my lord. Tiring of the weight of ignorance already?”

“I seek knowledge, not relief,” Caelan replied, gesturing to the maps. “This kingdom holds its breath. I want to know what happens when it exhales.”

Karn chuckled, setting the scrolls down. “Ah, then you seek prophecy.”

“I don’t believe in prophecy.”

“Then perhaps prophecy believes in you.”

Caelan frowned. “Enough riddles.”

“Riddles are the only safe truths,” Karn said. He opened one scroll delicately. “Have you heard of the Ember Pact?”

“I’ve read the royal charters. The Treaty of Hollow Rest. The Firelaws. All of it.”

“This isn’t i
