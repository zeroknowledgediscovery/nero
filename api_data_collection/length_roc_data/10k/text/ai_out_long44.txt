Title: The Primate Directive
Chapter One: The Banana Boardroom

The sun crested over the emerald canopy of the Ko’Wimba Jungle, lighting upon towers of steel and glass that pierced through the green with unapologetic ambition. The skyscrapers—vines still clinging to some windows—belonged not to humans, but to a coalition of primates who, over decades, had transformed from tree-swinging anarchists into ruthless corporate visionaries.

At the top of the tallest tower—nicknamed “The Banana Spire”—sat the CEO of Simian Holdings Ltd., a powerful orangutan named Magnus Gibbons. His office, large and circular like a giant nest, overlooked the sprawling megacity of Naru-Pan, a testament to primate evolution and ambition. Magnus drummed his thick fingers on a desk made of polished petrified wood, staring through the tinted glass at a rival building across the ravine—a sleek obsidian spire belonging to Vervet Ventures.

A soft chime echoed. The doors whooshed open and in rolled Clivus, Magnus’ executive assistant, a spider monkey in a pinstripe vest and monocle clinging to his left eye socket. “Sir, they’re here,” Clivus squeaked, voice high and always seemingly out of breath.

“Send them in. All of them.”

The boardroom filled quickly. Bonobos in tailored blazers, capuchins tapping away on miniature tablets, one silverback gorilla who refused to sit in a chair—he always stood at the end of the table like an ominous sculpture.

“This quarterly report,” Magnus began, his voice slow and gravelly, “is trash.”

Murmurs. A chimpanzee in a mauve suit adjusted his tie nervously. That was Travis P. Bimble, CFO, known for his creative accounting and nervous tics. “W-we’re seeing… diversification across our acorn derivatives. And Q2 was—”

“Don’t insult the intelligence of this board, Travis.” Magnus’s deep-set eyes bore into him. “Our mango exports dropped by 8%. Avocado futures tanked after that mole rat exposé. And let’s not even talk about the hack into our JungleCoin servers.”

The gorilla at the end of the table grunted.

“He’s right,” said Kaia, the only female macaque on the board, her voice a silky rasp. “The mole rat footage was damning. We need PR spin, and fast.”

“Spin?” Magnus snapped. “Spin doesn’t fix broken teeth. We need vengeance. Strategy. We need a hostile takeover.”

“You can’t be suggesting—” Travis started.

“I am,” Magnus said, his voice icy. “We take Vervet Ventures.”

Gasps. Even the gorilla’s brow lifted.

“They’ve been eating into our territory since they acquired Papaya Dynamics. That was our acquisition. Our territory. We have the liquidity, we have the influence, and we have something they don’t.”

“BananaCoin?” Clivus offered.

“No,” Magnus growled. “Ruthlessness.”

He leaned forward, the overhead light catching the silver stripe that ran through his fur like a scar.

“Prepare the Board for war.”

Chapter Two: The Vervet Gambit

Across the ravine, in a sterile, orchid-scented conference room atop Vervet Ventures HQ, CEO Lex Talon, a sleek, jet-black vervet with unsettling turquoise eyes, lounged with his feet propped on a glass table. Unlike Magnus, Lex was young, flamboyant, and disarmingly polite. He wore no clothes—only a titanium cuff on his left forearm that projected holographic interfaces at will.

“Simian Holdings is wounded,” Lex said to his entourage of lemur strategists and a lone aye-aye who doubled as both his legal advisor and personal sommelier. “This is our chance.”

“Espionage?” asked Rinji, a spectacled langur and Lex’s head of operations.

“No, no. Something more… civilized. We buy out their suppliers. We corner the market on coconut silk. If they want to wage war, we’ll fight with contracts and embargoes.”

“And the mole rats?” asked Del, the aye-aye, swirling a glass of fermented durian wine.

“Still loyal. But we’ll need new dirt. I want surveillance on Magnus. Audio, visual, emotional resonance. There’s something off about him lately. Ever since the IPO flop.”

Back in the jungle, Magnus stood at the edge of the boardroom balcony, staring down at the electric vines pulsing along the city pathways. He remembered a time when dominance was established with a howl and a swing through the canopy. Now it was spreadsheets, court injunctions, media leaks.

“Sir,” Clivus said, sidling up, “I’ve scheduled a call with Marmoset & Finch. They’re ready to advise on the proxy war.”

“Good. And the drones?”

“En route to Sector Nine.”

Magnus grunted. “Let’s see if Lex likes surprises.”

Chapter Three: Of Spies and Stocks

Late at night, in a club known only as The Canopy—where exotic birds sang jazz and the lights were dimmed with fogfruit oil—a lone tamarin entered wearing a trench coat two sizes too large.

She sat at the bar, ordered a fermented guava spritz, and waited. Moments later, Kaia entered, blending in like another overworked exec drowning her bonuses. They sat side by side, eyes forward, pretending not to know each other.

“You were followed,” said Kaia, quietly.

“By whom?” asked the tamarin.

“A parrot. Corporate breed. Probably Lex’s. Got a red band on the leg and recites stock prices in reverse.”

The tamarin nodded. “The files are ready. Magnus doesn’t know. But he will. Soon.”

A pause.

“Why betray him?”

Kaia’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “You ever see what an orangutan does to someone who fails him? Travis didn’t resign. He was recycled.”

The tamarin drained her drink. “I’ll contact Lex. Operation Figleaf proceeds.”

Outside, lightning flashed through the canopy, illuminating a world on the brink of a hostile merger.

Chapter Four: Banana Protocols

The following week, chaos bloomed like spores from a bruised mushroom. Headlines flashed: “Mango Sector Crashes!”, “Whistleblower Leaks Boardroom Footage”, “Lex Talon Declares Legal Challenge to Simian Holdings’ Merger Play!”

Magnus slammed the tablet down. “Kaia,” he said through gritted teeth, “call an emergency board meeting.”

When the board reassembled, the mood was sour. Travis’ chair remained empty, draped in banana leaves—a silent warning.

“We’ve been compromised,” Magnus said. “Someone’s feeding intel to Lex. Clivus, run loyalty algorithms. Audit every message from the past three weeks.”

Clivus saluted and dashed off, tails flapping behind him.

Kaia kept her expression neutral. She knew her time was running out.

But she had one last card to play. A secret held deep in the archives of the old jungle code—a treaty between the gorilla tribes and the vervets. If invoked, it could force a truce, or at least sow enough confusion to disrupt Magnus’ momentum.

That night, under cover of smog and mist, Kaia made her way to the ruins of the Old Tree Library.

She never noticed the drone, silent as a bat, following overhead.

Chapter Five: The Banana Falls

When the explosion hit the central trade tower, even the macaques in the outer provinces felt the tremor.

It wasn’t just an attack. It was a statement.

Lex had gone too far.

Magnus stood amidst the wreckage of the boardroom, splinters of petrified wood embedded in his arms, blood seeping into his fur.

“We retaliate,” he whispered. “Tonight.”

Silence descended on the boardroom, broken only by the quiet tapping of Clivus’s claws on his miniature tablet. Magnus rose from his chair and began to pace, the thick, deliberate thump of his knuckles on the floor resonating through the room like war drums. His breath came slow, controlled. But the fury beneath it was volcanic.

“We’ve allowed them to circle us like carrion birds,” he said, voice low and bitter. “We built this city. We turned a jungle into an empire. And now what are we? Stock-tickers and PR fluff. We used to tear vines from the canopy and stake our claim. Now we wait for quarterly projections like timid meerkats.”

“Some might argue, sir,” offered Kaia with a measured calm, “that the very evolution you're criticizing is what’s kept us alive. Expansion, regulation, diplomacy... it has its place.”

Magnus turned sharply. “Diplomacy didn’t stop Vervet Ventures from stealing our logistics contracts in the Eastern Groves. It didn’t stop them from flooding the market with artificially inflated guava indexes. It didn’t stop them from recruiting Marmoset & Finch—our own legal team.”

Travis raised a tentative hand. “They were technically never exclusive, Magnus. They’re a firm, not a family.”

“Exactly the problem,” Magnus replied coldly. “Loyalty means nothing anymore. Except to us. We still remember what binds us. Blood. Bonds. And bananas.”

There was a murmur of assent. The gorilla grunted once more, louder this time. His name was Bruno, former head of the Jungle Enforcement Agency and now Director of Security at Simian Holdings. His presence was a living reminder of what happened when rules failed: violence filled the gap.

“I propose,” Magnus continued, walking to the window and tapping it, zooming the projection on the Vervet Ventures tower, “a campaign of precision. No overt aggression. No lawsuits. No overtures. We dissect them from the inside. Financial incisions. Strategic defections. Reputation smearing.”

Kaia crossed her arms. “And who will execute this? The PR branch is still recovering from the Mango Doping Scandal.”

“The Reorg Division,” Magnus said. “It’s time we activated Project Scythe.”

There were audible gasps. Even Clivus looked up from his tablet, monocle trembling.

“That project was mothballed years ago,” said Travis, paling. “It’s... unorthodox.”

“And now necessary. I’ve seen Lex Talon’s latest hires—ex-HyenaBank analysts, two cybernetic lemurs, and a sloth with advanced pattern detection AI in his cortex. He’s building an army. We’ll respond with precision.”

Kaia’s eyes narrowed. “Then we’re off the books.”

Magnus didn’t blink. “Off, buried, and burned. Let’s remind them what primates are capable of when cornered.”

He turned to Bruno, whose face had been expressionless until now. The gorilla cracked his knuckles. “Say the word.”

“Begin.”

Later that night, the boardroom emp
