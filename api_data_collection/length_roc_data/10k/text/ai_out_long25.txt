Lights Between Lies

Chapter One: The Audition

Los Angeles, for all its sun-drenched glamour, stank of desperation in the early mornings. The sidewalks shimmered with the vague residue of last night’s failures, and the air buzzed with a peculiar static of expectation. Jesse Lorne, 29 years old and still clinging to the prefix “aspiring,” stood outside the Ventura Boulevard casting office with a coffee cup that trembled just slightly in his hand.

He was handsome in that generic way that agents found reassuring—sharp cheekbones, brooding eyes, hair that curled in exactly the right places to look rebellious without threatening commercial viability. But his eyes—his eyes were tired. There was something quietly collapsed about him that no lighting technician could fix.

He rehearsed the lines again. “I’m not afraid of dying. I’m afraid of disappearing.” It sounded stale to his ears now, parched. Every other guy inside that waiting room probably delivered it with the same clenched jaw and faux gravitas. Jesse hadn’t worked in nearly eight months. His last gig had been a short-lived web series called Fangs & Fables, where he played a werewolf with a secret heart of gold. The show had been canceled halfway through its second season, and no one had even told him personally. He found out from Twitter.

Inside, a bored assistant called his name. “Jesse Lorne? You’re up.”

He stepped into the audition room, where a folding table separated him from three people who didn’t look up from their laptops. Behind the camera, a woman with prematurely gray hair gave him a brittle smile. “Slate please.”

“Jesse Lorne. Six feet. Repped by Varner & Lee.”

“Whenever you’re ready.”

He started the scene, but halfway through his second line, the man in the center—presumably the director—sighed. Loudly.

“Hold up. Can you, like, actually feel it? This isn’t CSI: Glendale, alright? This guy’s supposed to be wrecked. You ever lose something that mattered?”

Jesse blinked. “Yes. I have.”

“Then bring that.”

He did the scene again. Slower this time. Quieter. He didn’t raise his voice. Didn’t reach. The fear in his chest wasn’t theatrical; it was real. Afterward, no one said anything for a moment too long. The gray-haired woman gave a nod.

“Thanks, Jesse. That was… better.”

He left the room. The sunlight outside seemed blinding, accusatory. He took out his phone, then put it back in his pocket. No one to call. No one who would care. He walked down the boulevard until he reached a bus stop. He didn’t get on the bus. Just sat on the bench and watched the cars glide past like ghosts on rails.

Chapter Two: The Callback

He got the callback two days later.

His agent, a relentlessly optimistic woman named Sherri, called while he was microwaving a burrito. “You’re pinned for Sins of Empire. The new Netflix limited series. It’s down to you and one other guy for the lead.”

Jesse blinked. “The lead?”

“I told you they were looking for someone raw. You’re raw as hell, Jesse. That scene, that audition? It wasn’t acting. It was... cracked open.”

He didn’t know what to say to that. Gratitude stuck somewhere in his chest. “Do we know who the other guy is?”

“Probably someone with a verified Instagram. Who cares? You’re in the room now. Wear something black. Moody sells.”

The callback was more intense. They had him do a chemistry read with a tall actress named Wren Moretti, who had already been cast. She had this haunting look about her, all angles and pale skin and eyes like broken glass. She didn’t speak to him before the read. Just nodded once, briskly.

In the scene, she played a war correspondent and he a jaded ex-soldier turned vigilante. Jesse forgot the camera was there. When she reached out and touched his arm in the scene, something unspoken cracked between them. A moment later, the casting director said, “Cut,” and Jesse realized his hands were shaking.

Afterward, Wren finally looked at him. “You’re not faking it,” she said. Not a question.

“No,” he said.

“Good. Then maybe we won’t screw this up.”

Chapter Three: Filming Begins

Jesse got the part.

They flew him to Vancouver. He stayed in a furnished apartment that smelled faintly of lemon cleanser and someone else’s memories. The shoot was grueling. Long days. Short nights. Emotional landmines buried in every scene. The director, Marcus Hollin, was a legend—a self-described "actor’s director" who liked to whisper secrets into ears right before the take. He once told Jesse that the character, Kade Rilke, had attempted suicide off-screen. That wasn't in the script.

“You don’t need to say it. But feel it.”

The camera loved Jesse. He could feel it. When he cried, it wasn’t performative. When he screamed, it was hoarse and real. He didn’t know where Kade ended and he began.

Wren was brilliant. Distant. They didn’t talk much between scenes, but on-screen, their chemistry crackled like live wires. Rumors started—gossip blogs whispering about an off-camera romance. There wasn’t one. Unless you counted the silences between them, which seemed thick with something unnamed.

“Why don’t you ever talk after we shoot?” Jesse asked her one night.

They were alone in the makeup trailer. She was wiping off blood from a stunt scene.

“Because it bleeds over,” she said. “If I start talking, I don’t know who I’ll be. Me or her.”

He understood that. Too well.

Chapter Four: Fame Arrives

When Sins of Empire dropped, it exploded. Jesse woke up one morning to 200k Instagram followers. Then half a million. The show topped charts. Critics raved. His face was everywhere—billboards, memes, magazine covers. The New Yorker called his performance “brutally honest, with edges carved from trauma and truth.”

People recognized him at gas stations. Waitresses smiled too long. Paparazzi began following him, especially when he and Wren were seen leaving the same hotel in Manhattan.

They weren’t together, not really. They’d slept together exactly twice. Both times after late-night reshoots, both times without speaking after. There was a sadness in her that matched his, and that sort of thing doesn’t lead to love. Just reflection.

His agent got offers. Marvel wanted to meet. A Scorsese project circled. His name was being said in rooms he never imagined he’d enter.

But something was unraveling.

Chapter Five: The Lie Beneath

Jesse’s mother called one evening. She lived in Idaho, ran a quilting shop, didn’t watch television.

“You okay, hon?”

He hesitated. “Yeah.”

“You sound hollow,” she said. “Like you’re echoing.”

That stuck with him.

He started drinking more. Not recklessly, just enough to blur the lines. Wren vanished after the premiere. Wouldn’t return texts. Rumor said she was in a rehab clinic in Arizona, but no one confirmed it.

Then came the leak.

A Reddit thread. A video. Grainy footage of Jesse screaming at a PA on set. Calling him “a worthless extra in the background of his life.”

It spread fast. People tweeted things like “Jesse Lorne = canceled” and “Another fake nice guy revealed.”

The studio issued a statement. Jesse’s publicist crafted an apology. He read it like a script.

“I’m deeply sorry for my behavior. That wasn’t me.”

But it was him. A version.

He disappeared for a while. Upstate cabin. No internet. Just snow and pine trees and silence.

One day, Wren showed up.

“How’d you find me?”

She shrugged. “Everyone’s findable. Even ghosts.”

They didn’t talk much. She stayed three days. They didn’t sleep together.

When she left, she said, “You should write something. Tell your own story. Otherwise, they’ll keep writing it for you.”

He stared at the fire after she left. The logs hissed. Something old inside him cracked open.

Jesse walked for almost an hour without direction, letting the hum of traffic and the sharpness of late morning sun push against his skin. His thoughts turned to static—snippets of dialogue, the director’s sigh, the way his voice caught in his throat halfway through the final line. There was a flavor to rejection in this town that never quite dulled with repetition. It always found new edges, new angles to twist from. By the time he reached Laurel Canyon, he realized he’d walked past his apartment by several blocks. He doubled back, passing the same rusted red Jeep parked beside the curb, same man in a trucker hat chain-smoking with his phone pressed to his ear, arguing about headshots.

Back in his apartment—third floor walk-up, faded carpet, cracked tiles in the kitchenette—he dropped the keys into the chipped bowl near the door and let himself fall onto the couch. The cushions gave a long sigh, as if they too were tired of pretending they belonged in someone’s success story.

He picked up the script again, eyes scanning lines he no longer felt connected to. The role—Kade Rilke, ex-Marine turned reluctant hero in the fictional civil collapse of America—had layers, but they were the kind of layers executives liked: enough trauma to be brooding, but not enough to be alienating. Jesse could see what they wanted in him. The sadness he carried was palatable. It didn’t repel. It looked good on camera.

He was nearly asleep when his phone buzzed. Sherri’s name flashed on the screen.

“You were good,” she said, no hello.

“How do you know?” he asked, rubbing sleep from his eyes.

“I got a text from casting. They ‘liked what you brought to the table.’ That’s code for you’re still in it. So don’t go full tortured artist just yet.”

He didn’t say anything for a moment. The idea of hope was almost more exhausting than failure.

“Did they say when callbacks are?”

“Not yet. But soon. Probably this week. And Jesse?”

“Yeah?”

“Don’t self-destruct, okay? These things move fast when they want to. You’ll blink and be famous. Or you’ll blink and it’s over. Either way, stay upright.”

After she hung up, he sat in silence, watching the fan rotate in lazy circles above his head. He thought about what it would mean to land the part. What it would change. What it wouldn’t. He tried to i
