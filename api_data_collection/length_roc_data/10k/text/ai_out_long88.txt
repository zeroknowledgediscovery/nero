Chapter One: The Hollow Sound

The footsteps were moving away, slow and deliberate. Muffled slightly by the old, cracked linoleum, they seemed to echo off the bare walls more than they should have, as if the sound were trying to stay behind even as the person left.

Lena sat upright in her bed, her heart crawling up into her throat like a beetle trying to escape the dark. She strained to hear more, but the silence was complete now. Silence had a weight in this place—it wasn’t absence of sound, but the presence of something else.

She slipped her feet to the cold floor, pausing, listening again. Nothing. Not the creak of a floorboard. Not the groan of the pipes. The footsteps had stopped. Or maybe whoever it was had paused too, waiting.

She crossed the small room—bare walls, a desk with a chipped edge, two books stacked in defiance of the minimalism demanded by the house rules. She pressed her ear to the door.

Still nothing.

She opened it slowly, flinching at the faint click of the latch. The hallway stretched left and right in a straight line of dim yellow light from overhead bulbs caged in wire. The carpet had long since been torn out, leaving the hall an uneven landscape of glue patches and scuff marks.

To the left, something shifted. A whisper of movement.

“Hello?” she called, then hated herself for it. Her voice sounded smaller than she intended, fragile and brittle like frost on a window.

Nothing replied.

She took a cautious step, then another. She passed Room 8, then 9. Hers was 10. Room 11’s door was slightly ajar.

She pushed it open.

The room was empty.

No.

The closet door was open, hanging on one hinge. The chair at the desk was tipped back, as if someone had left in a hurry. Lena’s eyes scanned the walls. There were photos pinned up, curling at the corners. Someone’s parents, a lake, a cracked Polaroid of a cat.

She backed out of the room, closed the door quietly.

Room 12 was farther down, and it, too, was silent.

Only when she reached the stairwell did she realize she was holding her breath.

She let it out slowly. She wasn’t supposed to be out after lights out. There were rules here. Punishments, too, the kind that didn’t leave marks. She turned to go back—

—and the footsteps started again.

Only this time, they were behind her.

She turned sharply, but the hallway was still.

Room 10 sat like a closed eye, no sign of movement.

She rushed back to it and closed the door behind her, leaned her back against it. Her heart was a hammer now. Not footsteps, maybe. Could’ve been something else. A draft. A dream still lingering.

She slept little after that. When the sun came up, pale and indifferent, she sat at her desk and wrote a letter. She addressed it to herself and kept it under her pillow.

—

Breakfast was quiet. It usually was. A room of twenty girls, each wrapped in their own silence like a blanket.

Across from her, Annie stirred her oatmeal with mechanical boredom.

“You look like hell,” Annie said, not unkindly.

“Did you hear anything last night?” Lena asked.

“Always,” Annie replied, lifting a spoon. “This place is full of sounds. Creaks. Whispers. Doors that don’t shut right.”

“No, like—footsteps.”

Annie looked up then, her dark eyes narrowing just slightly. “Where?”

“In the hall. Past curfew.”

Annie chewed her lip a moment. “Could’ve been Ms. Halberd.”

“She doesn’t walk that slow.”

Annie didn’t reply.

—

That day, classes dragged. History, then etiquette, then quiet hour. During the latter, Lena slipped away. Not far. Just to the stairwell, then down. The basement was off-limits. That’s why she went.

It wasn’t locked. The door was heavy, smelled of rust.

She stepped inside.

Dust motes danced like ghosts in the narrow shafts of light. The air was thick, cloying. It smelled like mold and something else—wet stone, maybe.

She passed the old laundry machines, all unplugged and dented. Beyond them, another hallway opened, lined with storage rooms. The door at the end was metal, newer than the rest. No label.

She reached for the handle—

It turned on its own.

Lena yanked her hand back.

The door opened slowly.

No one stood there. Just another room.

No, not a room. A corridor. Bare, concrete, unfinished. It sloped downward.

A noise drifted up—

A song.

Soft, and wrong.

She backed away, closed the door carefully, and ran back up the stairs.

—

That night, she dreamed of footsteps and the song, woven together like static through an old radio.

—

Three days passed. Lena stopped telling Annie what she saw, because the other girl had started looking at her differently.

On the fourth day, one of the girls didn’t show up for morning duties.

“She ran,” someone whispered.

“Jumped the fence.”

“No way,” said Annie, arms crossed. “Not her.”

Lena felt cold. Room 11 was empty now.

The headmistress said nothing. Only instructed the others to remain indoors after sundown.

Two days later, another girl vanished.

The rooms were silent again, but different now. The silence was afraid.

—

That night, Lena left her room again. She had to know.

She went back to the basement. The metal door was closed.

She opened it.

The corridor was darker this time.

She walked. Slowly. Carefully.

The song came again—closer.

A voice, rising and falling like it didn’t belong to a person.

She followed it until she reached the second door.

This one had no handle.

She knocked.

Once.

Twice.

The singing stopped.

Then, from the other side:

“Do you remember the orchard?”

Lena froze. Her heart stopped.

She had been four when her parents brought her to the orchard. A weekend. Apples. The sun. No one else had known.

“Who are you?” she whispered.

“Come in.”

The door swung open.

There was only darkness.

And the footsteps came again—this time, walking toward her.

She should have run. Every instinct in her body twisted into a knot of resistance, but her feet refused to move. The door had opened without her touch. The voice—so soft and familiar, as though whispered directly into her memory—had spoken the words only she could recognize. Something about the air down here, thick and pressurized like before a thunderstorm, kept her rooted. She stepped forward.

The darkness was not absolute. Her eyes adjusted slowly, revealing the barest contours of the room beyond. The walls were raw concrete, wet in patches. Water dripped from exposed pipes overhead, tapping an uneven rhythm against metal grates on the floor. There were no light bulbs, only a faint green glow that came from behind another door farther in. It pulsed like a heartbeat.

She passed a collapsed shelving unit, its contents—folders, brittle pages, something that looked like a leather-bound book—strewn across the floor in disarray. A rusted cart leaned against one wall. As she stepped around it, she saw the marks on the concrete: long, arching scrapes that started and stopped in no logical pattern.

The second door creaked open with a gentle push.

The green light was coming from an old monitor. The kind with a bulbous screen and thick wires. It was plugged into a socket that looked far too new for the room around it. On the screen, grainy footage played on a loop: the hallway outside her room. The time stamp read: 02:43 AM.

She watched the black and white image until movement caught her eye. A figure appeared—no details, just a shape. The camera fuzzed when it passed, but Lena felt certain it had looked directly into the lens. The loop restarted, and the figure walked past again.

Behind her, something scraped the floor.

She spun around, fists clenched, but there was no one.

Only the door slowly swinging shut.

She rushed forward, grabbed the handle—but there wasn’t one. Just a flat panel of steel.

She slammed her palm against it. Once, twice. “Hello?” she shouted. Her voice echoed strangely, folding back on itself.

Then: footsteps again.

Closer.

Slower.

This time, they circled.

She pressed herself to the corner, trying to find a weapon. A broken length of pipe lay nearby, and she snatched it up.

The footsteps stopped just beyond the edge of the green glow.

“I didn’t think you’d come back,” said the voice.

It was a woman’s voice, vaguely familiar, but distorted, like it was being spoken underwater.

“I want to see who you are,” Lena said.

The glow flickered, and a shape stepped forward. Not quite a woman—taller, her limbs too long, her skin the wrong shade of pale. Eyes that didn’t blink. A face that looked like someone had tried to remember what a face should be and almost got it right.

“You asked who I am,” it said. “But you already know.”

“No,” Lena whispered.

“Yes,” it said. “You left me here.”

“I don’t—”

The thing smiled, and Lena saw teeth. Too many.

“You brought me here. When you opened that box. In the orchard.”

The memory hit her like cold water. A cardboard box buried under the soil beneath the oldest apple tree. Her mother yelling. Her father dragging her away. A shriek she hadn’t been able to explain.

“I was five,” she said. “That wasn’t real.”

“You let me out,” it said. “And they sent you here because they knew. But they didn’t know how deep I went.”

Lena gripped the pipe tighter. “What do you want?”

“To be remembered,” it said. “To be known. And I need a name.”

“I’m not giving you mine.”

“You already did.”

It stepped closer, and Lena swung. The pipe connected, but there was no impact—like swinging through steam. The creature blurred, then reformed beside her.

“I remember the orchard,” it said again. “You sang to me.”

Lena bolted. She hit the door with all her strength, screaming, clawing, until the green light behind her dimmed to nothing.

Then the door opened.

And she fell through, onto the basement floor.

The room behind her was gone. Only a solid wall of concrete remained.

When she looked back, her hands were black with soot.

—

They didn’t believe her.

Not when she told Annie. Not when she tried to find the door again. The hallway was there. The old laundry machines were ther
