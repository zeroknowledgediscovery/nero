Title: The Thief of Ember Hollow

Chapter One: Whispers in the Moss

Rain slipped down the gray stones of Ember Hollow like tears off a dying man's cheek. The Hollow stank of old roots and forgotten promises. Beneath a twisted canopy of black alder trees, where the sun dared not gaze, a goblin crouched near a hollow log, chewing on a raw slug. His name was Snaggrel, and he was destined—though he’d cuss you out for saying it—to steal the Crystal of Virid.

Snaggrel was runt-sized, even for a goblin, with ears that curled like boiled cabbage and a nose that twitched at lies. His skin was the shade of wet kelp and slicked with grime. But his eyes—black marbles glinting with cunning—missed little. He wore a patchwork vest made from the skins of rats and owlets, stitched with spider silk and bound with the rib of a vole. The vest stank worse than him, which was saying something.

"Ye ever hear o’ the Crystal o’ Virid?" he asked the slug before swallowing it whole. "Course ye haven’t. Not many has. That’s the point."

He sat back on his haunches, licking his claws clean. In the distance, a bell tolled from atop Cradlespire Keep—a sound no goblin should ever hear unless they were being cooked for a lord’s supper.

He knew what the bell meant. It meant the Seers were stirring. It meant the Crystal was vulnerable. And he—Snaggrel, bane of chicken coops and picker of noble pockets—was going to take it.

But he wasn't alone.

Far to the east, past the Grayfen Marsh and the shattered towers of Osgult, a woman in a feathered cloak spoke to an iron mirror. Her name was Vaeleen, a mage of the Unnamed Order, though few used the word "mage" near her without spitting afterward. Her voice echoed coldly through her empty chamber.

"The goblin has awakened," she said. "Just as the moss-blooded prophecy croaked."

The mirror fogged, shimmered, and showed a flicker of Snaggrel rooting through the bones of a drowned badger.

Vaeleen sneered. “This is the creature who’ll steal my inheritance?”

She waved her hand, and the mirror shattered into spiders.

—

Snaggrel padded through the moss, careful of the bloodsnare ferns and the eye-lichens that blinked at him from tree trunks. He carried nothing but a sling and a bone dagger chipped from a wyrmling’s rib. His goal lay many leagues away, under stone and spell, but his first stop was an old ruin buried in a swamp.

There lived Greel the Mad, a former hedge-witch turned tree. She'd once cursed a knight into a beetle for calling her “hag,” and she knew things best left unwhispered. She also owed Snaggrel a favor. Something about a stolen ring and a bad batch of toadwine.

Snaggrel found her just before dusk, her bark-skin cracked and oozing sap. A single yellow eye rolled open in the knot of her trunk.

“You again,” she groaned.

“Need a whisper, Greel,” he said, bowing low. “One about a shiny rock.”

“The Crystal?” she hissed, bark creaking. “You’re dumber than a blind troll with a compass.”

“Yeah, maybe. But I’m me, and I’m the only one daft enough to try.”

She gave a wheeze that might have been laughter or indigestion. “You’ll need more than teeth and bad breath to get past the Wyrd Wardens.”

“You’ll help?”

“No,” she said. “But I’ll give you a name. Find the half-elf thief in Clattershade. She once stole a dragon’s hoard in her sleep. She’ll get you inside the outer ring.”

Snaggrel scratched under his chin. “A name?”

“Riss. She’s trouble.”

“All right,” he said. “But so am I.”

—

Clattershade stank of eel oil and broken dreams. A hundred market stalls haggled over rusted daggers, lizard meat, and memory dust. Snaggrel moved like a flea among dogs—quick, hungry, unseen. He found Riss in a crumbling alehouse, drinking fire syrup and arm-wrestling a tattooed ogre.

She had one ear pierced with a fishhook and silver scars like spiderwebs along her neck.

“You’re a goblin,” she said, watching him over her mug.

“You’re half-elf,” he said. “Neither of us asked for it.”

She grinned. “Fair. What do you want?”

“To steal something stupid and die trying.”

“Even fairer. I’m in.”

They left that night with a trail of angry gamblers behind them. As they traveled, Riss told stories of vaults in the clouds and beastmen that guarded the halls of Cradlespire.

“The Crystal’s not just guarded by flesh,” she said. “It’s guarded by memory. You walk too close, and it’ll whisper lies from your past. Make you forget why you came.”

Snaggrel spat. “I never forget a job. Not one.”

“Good,” she said. “Because this one’s likely to be our last.”

—

They crossed into the haunted thickets of Wyrmroot, where time lagged and fog turned to teeth. A ghost-hound chased them for two days, until Snaggrel fed it a handful of bone coins he'd dug up in the Barrow Mound. The hound bowed and vanished with a yelp of relief.

Near the edge of the thicket, they met the third of their cursed trio—a bard named Hallowin, who’d been hexed to only speak in questions.

“Are you thieves? Are you fools? Are you... the end?”

“Yes,” Snaggrel said. “No. And maybe.”

Hallowin laughed like a broken harp. “May I come with you?”

Riss shrugged. “We’ll need bait.”

—

They reached Cradlespire in the dark of the no-moon, hidden by spells and stink. The spire rose like a fang from the earth, wreathed in lightning and guarded by statues that breathed.

They snuck through the catacombs, dodging sleeptraps and blood runes, until they came upon the Crystal of Virid.

It floated above a bed of obsidian, humming like a dying star. Green light twisted in its heart, pulsing with hunger.

“It’s not just a gem,” Riss whispered. “It’s alive.”

“I know,” Snaggrel said. “And it wants to leave.”

He stepped forward. His hand, dirty and small, reached for destiny.

And the Crystal spoke.

—

The voice was not a sound but a vibration behind Snaggrel’s eyes, as if his skull were a bell and something ancient had struck it. The Crystal of Virid pulsed again, dimming the torches with its lightless glow. He froze. Even Riss held her breath, one hand on the hilt of her curved dagger, the other hovering uncertainly over her mouth as though to shield her soul.

"You are not worthy," the voice echoed in a language that had no words but carried meaning like heat from a fire. It wasn’t accusation. It was fact. The kind that grinds down entire empires.

Snaggrel grinned, his teeth crooked like graveyard posts. “You don’t know what I’m worth.”

The air rippled around the Crystal. Riss stepped back. Hallowin, who had taken to humming nervously through his nose, looked to the ceiling where ethereal script now drifted, writhing like worms in oil.

Snaggrel kept walking, slow and steady, each step pulling the silence tighter. As he crossed the threshold of the obsidian dais, the floor beneath him groaned—not with weight, but memory. Images darted through his head. Not his own. Princes weeping, cities burning, blood-stained children laughing in dungeons of gold. The Crystal showed him things meant to break the will. It was old magic, raw and ugly, forged before kindness was invented.

Snaggrel closed his eyes.

He thought of the smell of damp moss under his hovel back in the Hollow. He remembered the first coin he stole—a copper trinket from a dying merchant whose pouch had no more blood in it than gold. He thought of the time he fed a starving whelp instead of eating it. Small things. True things.

“Do yer worst,” he whispered to the Crystal.

And that, somehow, was enough.

The glow shifted. The voices stilled. The air thinned as though holding its breath. Then the Crystal fell—no grand blast, no shattering light—just a simple drop, like a dying apple from a cursed tree. Snaggrel caught it in both hands. It was warm. Slick with power.

Riss exhaled. “That’s it?”

“No traps? No soul-sucking?” Hallowin asked.

Snaggrel frowned. “Feels wrong, don’t it?”

That’s when the screaming began.

It came from below. Deep in the bones of the tower, a roar rose like a thunderstorm arguing with itself. The walls trembled. A stone face on the far column cracked open and shrieked with rusted breath.

“The Wyrd Wardens,” Riss said, already running.

Snaggrel tucked the Crystal under his vest. It didn’t burn him. It fit there, snug, almost eager. They bolted through the catacombs, pursued by grinding metal and the skitter of claws too many for any beast that walked the world.

Behind them, a chamber door exploded inward, and one of the Wardens emerged. It was neither machine nor flesh, but a riddle given shape—limbs jointed like spider legs, faces shifting every second between queen and soldier, child and corpse. One of its mouths opened wide enough to speak.

“RETURN THE STONE, LITTLE THIEF.”

Snaggrel didn't answer. He hurled a smoke pod behind him—stolen from a goblin alchemist who’d choked on his own brilliance—and kept moving. Riss slid beneath a collapsing archway, while Hallowin leapt awkwardly, losing a boot but gaining speed.

They burst out into the cold night, panting under the weight of stolen fate. The spire behind them groaned and began to collapse inward as if embarrassed to still stand. A thousand hidden guardians awoke too late.

For now, they were free.

But freedom is rarely without cost.

—

They camped by a burned oak two miles from the spire, too tired to speak, too alive to sleep. Snaggrel sat apart from the others, watching the Crystal. It no longer glowed, but he could feel it thinking. It was a presence now, like a shadow under his heart.

Riss finally spoke. “So what’s next?”

“Someone’s going to come for it,” Snaggrel muttered. “Probably a hundred someones. Maybe gods.”

“We could sell it.”

“Could.”

“We could destroy it.”

“Might be the same thing.”

Hallowin rubbed his bare foot, frowning. “Is this how the world ends? With a goblin and two idiots around a fire?”

“No,” Snaggrel said, standing. “This is how it starts.”

He tucked the Crystal deeper into his vest. Somewhere out there, the Seers would already be scrying. The great towers would whisper. V
