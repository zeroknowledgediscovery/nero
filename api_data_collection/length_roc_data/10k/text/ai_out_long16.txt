Title: Shadow Line
Chapter One: The Job

The buzz of the neon sign outside cast a jagged glow through the rain-streaked window, slicing across Jacob Vance’s scarred face like a memory he didn’t want to keep. He sat in the corner booth of a half-dead diner on 3rd and Mulberry, nursing a black coffee and pretending not to notice the two men watching him from the bar. The waitress, too tired to flirt and too used to men like him, dropped his check without a word. He didn’t look at it.

Outside, the city pulsed with indifference. Horns. Sirens. Shattered laughter from a sidewalk argument. He’d been back in the city two weeks. Long enough to pick up the scent of trouble.

Jacob had been a lot of things in his forty-two years. Soldier. Cop. Drifter. But the only thing he’d ever been good at was protection. Not the glamorous kind you see in movies—no sunglasses, no earpiece, no suits. Just instinct, pain, and the ability to see danger before it got close.

He wasn’t expecting a job tonight. But then the woman walked in.

She didn’t belong. That was obvious. Tailored coat, auburn hair pulled into a no-nonsense twist, and the kind of shoes that cost more than this place made in a week. She spotted Jacob immediately and walked toward him like she owned the ground she stepped on.

“Mr. Vance?”

He looked up slowly. “Depends.”

“I’m Celine Harrow. I need protection. I was told you’re the best.”

Jacob raised an eyebrow. “By who?”

“A friend of my father’s. Marcus Bell.”

Jacob leaned back. “Marcus is dead.”

“I know,” she said, voice tight. “But before he died, he left a note. With your name on it.”

That got his attention. Bell had been a CIA spook turned security contractor—paranoid, brilliant, and very dead. If he’d written Jacob’s name down before dying, it meant something was rotten, and he didn’t trust the system to fix it.

Jacob took a sip of his coffee. “I don’t do babysitting.”

“This isn’t babysitting,” Celine said. She sat down without being invited. “It’s survival.”

He studied her, the edges of his old instincts flickering awake. There was something under the surface of her calm—terror, barely bottled.

“Talk.”

“My father—Gareth Harrow—he’s a lobbyist. High profile. Two weeks ago, he survived an assassination attempt. They made it look like a carjacking gone wrong, but I know it wasn’t. And yesterday, he disappeared. No ransom. No demands. Nothing.”

Jacob didn’t speak for a moment.

“What do the cops say?”

“That he probably needed a break. Stress, pressure...the usual bull.”

“And you?”

“I think he found something. Something that got him taken.”

Jacob drummed his fingers once on the table. “You have enemies?”

“Me? No. Him?” She gave a humorless smile. “He’s been in bed with half the corporations in the Capitol. If there’s something they want buried, and he got hold of it…”

Jacob finished his coffee. “You have a place to stay?”

“I was at the Ritz. I checked out this morning. I knew they’d look for me there.”

“Good.”

He stood. The rain had thickened outside, blurring the city’s edges. He tossed a few bills on the table.

“Let’s go.”

Celine hesitated. “That’s it? You believe me?”

“I believe Bell believed in something enough to write my name down. That’s enough for now.”

Jacob’s safehouse was a half-renovated warehouse in the south docks—gray brick, rusted windows, and an old freight elevator that groaned like a dying beast. But it was secure. He’d wired it himself. Cameras, motion detectors, two backup generators, and an armory that would’ve made Homeland Security nervous.

Celine stood stiffly in the center of the room while Jacob moved through the shadows, checking his gear, thinking.

“You hungry?” he asked.

“I haven’t eaten since morning.”

He tossed her a protein bar from a shelf. “It’s not caviar, but it’ll keep you alive.”

She caught it, barely, and unwrapped it with shaking hands. Jacob watched.

“Tell me more about your father,” he said. “Everything.”

She nodded, chewing slowly.

“My father wasn’t a good man,” she said. “He never pretended to be. But last year, he changed. He became…nervous. He said something was happening. Something big. Said if anything ever happened to him, I should find Marcus Bell.”

Jacob’s jaw tightened. “And Bell sent you to me.”

She nodded. “There’s more. Before he disappeared, my father gave me a key. Just said it opened a box. I think whatever he found is in it.”

“Where’s the box?”

“In a storage facility uptown. But it’s probably being watched.”

Jacob looked out the window. The storm was growing stronger, wind howling against steel. “Then we’ll go at dawn.”

—

They were gone before first light. Jacob drove a battered ‘97 Impala through the empty streets, his eyes flicking constantly to the rearview. He didn’t trust the quiet. Quiet meant setup. Quiet meant death.

Celine directed him to a storage facility just off the Beltway. Clean. Corporate. Expensive. A place where people stored family heirlooms and tax secrets.

They passed through two levels of security before reaching the locker.

Inside, in a small metal box, lay a flash drive and a single folded page. Jacob pocketed both. “We’re not reading this here.”

They were halfway back to the car when Jacob’s instincts screamed. He shoved Celine behind a parked SUV and ducked just as a silenced shot cracked the morning.

“Go!” he barked.

They ran. Two men emerged from the alley across the street—black coats, tight formation, trained. Not amateurs.

Jacob fired back once, forcing them into cover. “Keep moving!”

They rounded the corner, bullets chasing them through the mist. Jacob knew the city. He led her through an abandoned subway entrance and down into the dark.

Celine was gasping, pale. “Who—who were they?”

“People who don’t want us looking at that flash drive.”

He pulled out a small penlight and clicked it on. “We hide now. Then we hit back.”

—

In the safehouse again, Jacob plugged the flash drive into a secure laptop. The files inside weren’t documents—they were video feeds. Surveillance. Conversations. Meetings. Half were encrypted. The rest were bad enough.

A man in a high-backed chair, speaking to a known arms dealer. Another clip—someone who looked a hell of a lot like a senator accepting a case of unmarked bills. Time-stamped. GPS-tagged. All recent.

Jacob turned to Celine. “This is blackmail material. Enough to bring down half the Hill.”

“My father must’ve compiled it,” she whispered. “Why?”

“Insurance. Or revenge.”

There was a knock.

A single, gentle tap on the door. Once.

Jacob froze. He drew his Glock, motioned for Celine to move back.

The knock came again.

He opened the door with the barrel raised.

A child stood there. No older than ten. Wet. Dirty.

She held out a folded envelope.

“For you,” she said.

Jacob took it. She vanished into the alley without a word.

Inside the envelope was a photo of Gareth Harrow—bloodied, tied to a chair—and a simple message in block letters:

STOP DIGGING. NEXT TIME IT'S HER.

Jacob didn’t speak for a long time. Then he looked at Celine.

“They know we have the drive.”

She nodded.

“We run?”

He shook his head. “We hunt.”

Jacob stared at the photo longer than he should have, the edges of it curling slightly where his fingers clenched too tight. It wasn’t just the blood that bothered him—it was the eyes. Gareth Harrow’s gaze was vacant, unfocused. He looked like a man already dead, except for the fact that he was still breathing. Maybe.

Celine sat across from him on the edge of a steel chair, arms wrapped around herself. Her fingers gripped the sleeves of her coat so hard her knuckles had gone white. She looked like she was waiting for a verdict.

Jacob set the photo down and slid the envelope aside. “We need to assume this place is compromised now.”

“I thought you said it was secure.”

“It was. Until now. They found us too fast. That means we missed something, or someone sold us out.”

Celine’s eyes flicked toward the security monitors in the corner of the room. Nothing moved on the screens—just rain sliding off rooftops and alleyways steeped in shadow.

Jacob stood, walked to the far wall, and opened a hidden panel behind a set of battered lockers. Inside was a duffel bag already half-packed. He started adding weapons, burner phones, cash. The motions were automatic. He’d done this more times than he wanted to remember.

“We leave in fifteen.”

“Where are we going?”

Jacob didn’t look at her. “Somewhere they won’t expect.”

“You have a place?”

“Not exactly.”

She waited, the silence stretching.

“But I know someone who does.”

He zipped the bag and slung it over his shoulder. Celine grabbed her own small case, still dusty from the storage facility.

As they headed for the freight elevator, she asked the question he’d been expecting.

“Why are you helping me?”

Jacob didn’t answer right away. He hit the switch and the elevator groaned into motion.

“Because once, a long time ago, Marcus Bell pulled me out of something I didn’t think I’d survive. He never asked for anything back. Now he’s dead. And your father… he knew Bell. That connects you to something bigger. Bigger than you or me.”

The elevator opened to the alley behind the building. Rain fell harder now, pooling around the wheels of the Impala. Jacob looked both ways before motioning her forward.

“So this is guilt?” she asked, only half-joking.

“This is debt.”

—

The drive took them west, away from the dense maze of downtown, through industrial parks and forgotten neighborhoods where factories stood empty and dogs roamed in packs. Jacob kept the speed steady, eyes alert, one hand always near the gearshift and the Glock tucked between the seats.

Celine sat quietly, but her mind was racing. She kept replaying the video clips they’d seen—images of corruption too damning to be coincidence. It wasn’t just politics. It was organized, structured, like a shadow government running parallel to the one they showed on TV.

Eventually she said, “What do you think this is all about? T
