Title: The Copper Heart

Chapter One: A Drip in the Dark

The wrench slipped again. Cold sweat broke across Milo Griggs’s forehead as he fumbled under the sink, the corroded nut stubborn beneath his trembling fingers. Water trickled in a quiet, rhythmic pulse — plink, plink — into the shallow plastic bucket nestled between his knees. The sound needled his nerves like the echo of childhood nightmares. He cursed, softly, then louder. The wrench clattered against the tile, and Milo flinched as though struck.

"Bloody hell," he muttered, crawling out from under the cabinet. His cheeks were damp, whether from sweat or splashed water, he didn’t know. He stared at the offending pipe, a harmless little S-curve of copper and rust. It wasn’t leaking much. Nothing urgent. Not enough to justify the heaving in his chest or the tightness in his throat.

The smell of mildew was faint but present, like an old memory. He wiped his hands on his overalls, his knuckles pale. "It’s just a leak," he said aloud. "Just water. Just pipes. You’re a bloody plumber."

Outside, spring sunlight slanted over the hedgerows of Darwick, a hamlet that had never grown past its dozen streets and single bakery. Milo had lived here all his life — a quiet, loping man with wire-rimmed glasses and the stooped back of someone accustomed to crawling through narrow spaces. Most everyone in Darwick knew him. He was the man you called when the tap wouldn’t stop running or the toilet gurgled in the middle of the night.

They didn’t know about the fear.

It started ten years ago. A job up north, in Kentmere. A crawlspace. Flooded. Rats. A cracked pipe that burst when he touched it. He’d choked on brackish water and panic, his torchlight dying mid-cough. Trapped for forty minutes with his heart trying to claw out of his ribs. Ever since, he’d been... different.

Milo lit a cigarette with shaking hands and opened the back door to let in some air. The hills stretched in drowsy rolls behind his garden. Sheep dotted the far slope. The breeze smelled of grass and distant rain.

His phone buzzed on the kitchen counter. He eyed it warily, took a long drag, then answered.

"Griggs Plumbing."

"Mr. Griggs? Oh, thank goodness. I’m in a bit of a bind. The— the cellar’s flooded, you see, and I think the boiler’s gone funny. It’s humming." The voice was old, high and thready.

Milo pinched the bridge of his nose. "Mrs. Redfern?"

"Yes, dear. You did my bathroom in '18. Lovely work. But the cellar—"

"I’ll be over after lunch."

He hung up. Took another drag. Told himself, firmly, that it was fine. That the water would be shallow. That the light would work. That there would be no... rats.

But already, his chest ached.

Mrs. Redfern’s house sat on the edge of Darwick, a brick Victorian with ivy up one side and gnomes lining the garden path like silent sentries. Milo knocked twice, gently, and was greeted by the smell of lavender polish and stale biscuits.

"In the kitchen, dear," she called.

He followed the sound, nodding politely. "Where’s the water?"

"Downstairs. I haven’t gone down myself — arthritis in the knees. But I heard it humming. The boiler, I mean. It’s never made that noise before."

Milo knelt by the trapdoor to the cellar. The boards were damp. His throat tightened. The smell wafting up was metallic and sour. "I’ll take a look."

He opened the door. Darkness gaped below, warm and wet. A hum, almost musical, buzzed up the steps. It set his teeth on edge.

Torch in hand, Milo descended.

The water was ankle-deep. Not bad. He sloshed forward, beam sweeping across the stone walls, the old washer, the pipes. Something thumped behind a shelf and he froze, heart slamming.

"Just pipes," he whispered. "Just water."

But the humming grew louder.

He reached the boiler, crouched, and inspected the valve. A buildup of pressure. Nothing critical. He adjusted a dial, wiped his brow.

Then, from the dark, came a whisper.

At first, he thought it was the pipes groaning. But no — it was clearer, wet and deliberate.

"Milo..."

He spun. The beam sliced across the dark. Nothing there. Just shelves, shadows.

"Milo..."

He fled. The stairs were slick, his foot slipped, he caught the railing. Panting. Clambered out and slammed the trapdoor shut.

"Dear? Are you alright?" Mrs. Redfern asked, peering in with narrowed eyes.

"Faulty valve. Fixed it," he muttered, voice hollow. "Boiler’s safe now. Just... stay out of the cellar."

Back home, Milo sat in the bath, still in his overalls, the water turning gray with silt and rust. His fingers wouldn’t stop trembling.

He tried to write it off. Lack of sleep. Stress. The whisper? Just the wind. Echoes. Maybe his own name in his head. Not real.

But it felt real.

The humming. The voice. The cold hands of fear around his spine.

He needed a drink.

At the Dog & Whistle, the pub was mostly empty. Barry, the barkeep, nodded as Milo entered and poured him a stout without a word. Milo didn’t drink often, but when he did, it was for forgetting.

"You alright, mate? You look like you’ve seen a ghost."

Milo hesitated. "Just a cellar. Dark and wet. Usual."

Barry leaned in. "Funny you say that. You remember the old Wexler estate? On the edge of the woods?"

Milo frowned. "Burnt down in '91."

"Yeah. But they say the new owner’s renovating. Needs plumbing work. Asked after you."

"Me?"

"Yup. Told him you were the best. You are, y’know. Even with your... quirks."

Milo felt the bottom fall out of his stomach.

The Wexler place. Old, broken, cursed by some accounts. The woods around it twisted and silent. He’d never been near it, not since the fire.

"No," he said flatly. "Tell him to find someone else."

Barry shrugged. "Suit yourself. But the pay’s double standard. City money."

Milo finished his drink and left.

That night, he dreamed of pipes like intestines, twisting through walls that pulsed with unseen life. A voice echoed through them, whispering, always whispering.

"Milo..."

Chapter Two: Copper Calls

The request came again, two days later. This time by letter, tucked into his mailbox beneath the usual invoices and fliers.

"Mr. Griggs,

I am in urgent need of a seasoned plumber with local knowledge and discretion. The property I am restoring is old, and its systems... peculiar. I’ve been advised of your skill and reliability. A generous retainer will be offered, along with boarding, as the work may span several weeks.

Respectfully,

E. Thorn"

There was no phone number. Just an address: Wexler Estate, Grove Hill Lane.

Milo crumpled the letter. Threw it in the bin. Then, twenty minutes later, retrieved it.

He told himself he’d go out of curiosity. Not for the money. Not because of the whisper. Not because he needed to prove anything.

Just a job. Another job.

And if he kept hearing that voice — in his sink, in the kettle, in the faucet's hiss — that was probably just stress.

Right?

Milo stood outside the Wexler gate the next morning, arms stiff at his sides, toolkit in hand. The iron fence had long since rusted to a dull orange, crooked in places where the earth had shifted. Beyond it, the house squatted like a forgotten monument, its brickwork blackened in places, roof sagging with time and moss. Ivy strangled the porch columns. Windows reflected the sky in blind panes. Something about the angle of the gables felt... off, like they were leaning in on themselves, conspiring.

He hadn't planned to come. Not really. But after a night of restless turning and phantom dripping sounds that came from nowhere discernible, he had risen at dawn, packed his bag, and driven in silence. Some impulse — maybe a morbid kind of defiance — had dragged him here. He had to see for himself. Maybe once he looked the place in the face, it would stop worming through his thoughts.

The front gate squealed as he pushed through it. A low mist hugged the gravel path. The trees surrounding the property pressed in close, their branches gnarled like old knuckles. Milo hesitated at the porch step. He expected rot, the groan of half-dead timber — but the boards held underfoot, solid.

The door opened before he could knock.

A tall, narrow figure stood in the threshold. Pale, angular, hair slicked neatly back in an anachronistic part. His shirt was buttoned to the neck, vest pressed, boots shining. He could have stepped out of a photograph from another century.

"Mister Griggs. You came."

The voice was smooth, cultured, touched with something that didn’t belong in Darwick — nor, Milo thought uneasily, anywhere nearby.

"I did," Milo said. "You’re Mr. Thorn?"

"Indeed. Edmund Thorn. Please, come in."

Inside, the house was surprisingly intact. Dust lay thick, but the floorboards were whole, the walls uncracked. Furniture, though faded and shrouded under linen, showed signs of careful placement. And everything — every room Milo glimpsed as he was led deeper — felt staged. As if someone had been working to make it look untouched by time, yet deliberately old.

"The plumbing’s a relic," Thorn explained as he gestured toward the corridor leading to the service wing. "The house’s core system dates to the 1800s. There have been… interventions, but none successful. I need someone who respects the integrity of the structure while restoring function. I trust you’re capable?"

Milo grunted. "I’ll look."

"That’s all I ask."

Thorn did not follow him to the basement stair. Milo noticed it — not just as odd, but as if Thorn refused to follow. Instead, the man nodded once and said, "I’ll be upstairs in the study. Ring the bell if you need me."

As he descended, Milo was struck by the quiet. The sort that wasn’t absence of sound but rather the presence of something waiting. The air was heavy. He flicked on his torch, and the beam lit up walls of old stone, some patched with crumbling plaster. The plumbing lines here were ancient — true copper, mostly hand-forged. Some had burst and crusted over. Others still dripped slowly, rhythmically.

The boiler loomed
