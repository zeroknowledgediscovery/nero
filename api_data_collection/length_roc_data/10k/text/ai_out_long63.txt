Chapter One: The Window Rolls Down

The Ferrari’s window slid down with a purr that barely whispered over the ocean breeze. Scarlet metal, polished to the sheen of sin, gleamed under the lowering sun. The driver, a woman with a scar like lightning down her jawline, let the engine idle as she stared out at the beach. Her fingers, long and knuckled with tension, drummed lightly against the steering wheel.

“Luca,” she said.

From the passenger seat, the man flinched. He was young—maybe twenty-four—his jeans too clean, his face too eager, too sharp. He looked over. “Yeah?”

“You sure you want to do this?”

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he looked ahead at the figure standing alone at the shoreline. The man wore white, barefoot in the sand, hands tucked behind his back like he was attending a funeral. His name was Dimas Vale. And Luca had waited three years to see him again.

“I’m sure,” Luca said.

The woman turned her head slowly. Her eyes were pale blue, like beach glass. “Then go. Say what you need to say.”

The Ferrari hissed as he opened the door. Gravel crunched beneath his boots. He walked—tense, shoulders bunched like he expected to get shot before he reached the water. But Dimas didn’t move.

“Hey,” Luca said when he was within earshot.

Dimas turned. His face had aged. Grey curled in his temples. But the eyes were still the same: deep, unreadable, half-asleep. “You shouldn’t be here.”

“That’s a hell of a thing to say.”

“You came all this way to get insulted?” Dimas’s voice was smooth, but not cruel. Not yet. “Go home, kid.”

“I want to talk,” Luca said. “About my sister.”

The ocean spat up a foamy wave, licking at Dimas’s feet. He sighed. “Not here. Not with them watching.”

Luca frowned. “Them?”

Dimas nodded subtly—towards the rocks. For a moment, Luca saw nothing. Then, movement. A lens catching light. A sliver of polished steel.

“They’ve been on me since Paris,” Dimas muttered. “You brought trouble, didn’t you?”

“No,” Luca said. “Trouble brought me.”

Dimas gave a long, slow blink, then nodded once. “Get in the car.”

—

They drove inland, through winding roads that looked half-abandoned, past citrus trees and rotted signs. The woman never asked questions. She didn’t look at either of them. Just drove, fast and smooth, like the wheel was part of her body.

They stopped at a motel that might’ve once had charm, if someone hadn’t killed the charm and buried it under rust and mildew. Room 14 smelled like lemon cleaner and regret. But it had a table. A light. Chairs.

“You have ten minutes,” the woman said. She stood in the doorway, one hand resting on something beneath her coat.

Luca sat across from Dimas. The table was chipped. His hands left prints in the dust.

“You were supposed to protect her,” Luca said.

“I tried.”

“No,” he snapped. “You promised. That’s different.”

Dimas’s mouth twisted. “We were compromised. You think I meant for her to die?”

Luca stared. “She didn’t die.”

Silence.

“She’s alive?” Dimas whispered.

“You tell me,” Luca said. “She went missing three years ago. You were the last person to see her.”

Dimas sat back slowly. He looked haunted, but not surprised. “That night... she said she had a plan.”

“What plan?”

“She didn’t tell me. Only said if things went bad, to run.”

“You ran.”

“I thought she was behind me.” Dimas’s jaw tensed. “She wasn’t.”

They sat there. Clock ticking. The woman in the doorway didn’t move, but Luca could feel her growing impatient like a thunderstorm on the edge of the sky.

Then Dimas said: “If she’s alive, she’ll be in Caligari.”

“Where the hell is that?”

“It’s not on a map.”

—

Two days later, they reached a compound in the south of Italy, where the roads turned to gravel and the gravel turned to dirt. The compound sat behind broken walls, like something half-remembered from a war story. It was a place you didn’t go unless you were already dead in some way.

Luca got out first. His stomach clenched. The woman—her name was Myra—stayed with the car.

“Tell me you’re armed,” she muttered.

Luca nodded. “Kind of.”

“Kind of doesn’t cut it.”

He showed her the knife. Not a gun—he didn’t trust himself with those yet. But the knife was old, steel tempered in silence. It had belonged to his father.

Dimas led the way, quiet as a ghost. They entered through a gate half-hinged. Inside were people with faces like puzzles missing pieces—hard eyes, broken teeth, tattoos like maps of pain. Nobody smiled.

A man approached. Big. Bald. Arms thick with ink and history. He spoke in low Italian. Dimas replied. Luca caught only fragments—“ragazza,” “scomparsa,” “famiglia.” The man looked at Luca, then back at Dimas. After a beat, he stepped aside.

Inside the compound was a door that led to a room that led to another room. And finally, a hall with a woman standing at the end of it.

She had jet-black hair. Her face was shadowed. She was tall. Still. And when Luca saw her, he nearly dropped the knife.

“Sera?” he whispered.

The woman stepped into the light. And she smiled.

But it wasn’t his sister.

—

“She calls herself ‘Sera,’” Dimas said later. “She’s not your sister. But she’s part of the same game.”

“What game?”

“Something old,” he said. “Older than you think. Your sister... she found something. A list. A code. She cracked it. Now everyone wants her dead.”

“She told me about the code before she vanished,” Luca said. “It didn’t make sense. She was scared.”

“She had reason.”

Outside, a hawk circled.

“Then what do we do?” Luca asked.

Dimas lit a cigarette. “We find the others. The ones she trusted. And we pray.”

Luca looked out the window. He thought about the day his sister vanished—the blood on her bed, the note in cipher, the clock frozen at 3:17. He had chased ghosts for three years. But now, at last, the trail was warming. He could feel it in his blood.

He turned to Dimas. “Let’s burn the world down if we have to.”

Dimas nodded once. “That’s the spirit.”

—

Dimas stubbed out the cigarette on the windowsill, leaving a faint smear of ash on the sun-bleached wood. The wind moaned through the half-broken shutters, and somewhere outside, a metal door creaked like it had something to say. Myra was downstairs, sitting with her back to the wall, drinking something from a chipped enamel mug that steamed in the cold. She hadn’t spoken since they arrived, and Luca was beginning to understand that silence, for her, wasn’t an absence. It was a weapon.

He sat on the edge of the cot. “You think she’s really here? In Caligari?”

Dimas ran a hand over his face. His palms were weathered, scarred across the knuckles. “If she’s not here now, she was. Her name’s been carved into too many whispers for it to be coincidence.”

“Whispers don’t get you far. I need something solid.”

Dimas glanced toward the doorway. “This place isn’t made for solid things. Everything here floats just above real. You’ll get stories. Codes. Maybe a photo. But you won’t get truth. Not clean.”

Luca reached into his jacket and pulled out the folded piece of paper that had started it all: the coded letter his sister had left him. It had been folded so many times it looked more like fabric than paper now, smoothed and crinkled like an old road map. The symbols on it meant nothing to him, even now. Rows of slashed lines, broken circles, dots with tails. The only thing he ever recognized was the signature. A crude shape like a trident, drawn in red ink.

He unfolded it again, laid it on the floor between them. “This trident. She drew that on our bedroom wall when we were kids. Said it was ‘hers.’”

Dimas crouched, examined the mark. “I’ve seen this,” he said quietly. “In Marrakesh. And again in a vault under a gallery in Prague.”

Luca blinked. “You think she was there?”

“I think she’s been everywhere.” He sat back on his heels. “What your sister found... it wasn’t just data. It was a sequence.”

“A sequence of what?”

Dimas gave a ghost of a smile. “Of people. Locations. Decisions. It’s like someone set up dominoes fifty years ago and she’s the first one to knock them down.”

“I still don’t get why.”

“She must’ve seen something,” he said. “Or knew someone who did.”

Myra stepped into the room then, silent as snowfall. She was chewing on something—mint leaves, maybe—and her eyes were scanning the floor like a predator.

“We need to move,” she said flatly.

Luca stood. “Now?”

“There’s a convoy heading up from Palermo. Someone sold us out. We’ve got maybe fifteen minutes before this place becomes a memory.”

Dimas didn’t ask questions. He grabbed his coat, swept the paper off the floor, and tucked it into his shirt.

“What about ‘Sera’?” Luca asked.

“She’s not coming.”

“Why not?”

“She was the one who made the call.”

The words landed like broken teeth in his mouth. He wanted to argue. Wanted to grab Dimas and shake him and scream that he was wrong. But somewhere, deep in the hollow of his ribs, he knew it was true.

“She smiled like she knew me,” he muttered.

“She smiled like a spider,” Myra said. “Come on. We’re burning daylight.”

They left the way they came—through the warren of rooms, past the bald guard who was suddenly nowhere to be seen. The compound’s gates hung open. A rusted motorcycle leaned half-collapsed near the guardhouse, the engine still warm.

Myra got behind the wheel. Dimas climbed in beside her. Luca hesitated.

The sky had shifted. The color of a storm not yet born. In the distance, the hills seemed to move—not like shadows, but like shapes with intention. He got in and slammed the door.

“What’s in Palermo?” he asked.

“Answers,” Myra said. “And maybe a bullet.”

They drove west, away from Caligari, toward the coast. As the compound disappeared behind them, the first drops of rain struck the windshield like warning taps from something just out of view. Myra didn’t slow. She leaned into the wheel like she could outrun what was behind them.

For the next hour, nobody spoke. The road twisted and bucked through hills of olive trees and crumbling ruins. Oc
