Chapter One: The Sound of Shattering Glass

The screech cut through the morning like a blade. Metal screamed against metal, rubber burned into the cracked asphalt, and for a moment, the world seemed to pause in anticipation—before a violent, chaotic impact shattered everything.

It happened at the intersection of 6th and Meyer, a place nobody ever really noticed. The lights were blinking yellow, a sign of a system failure during routine maintenance. A delivery truck, an old Chevy with rust around the bumper, had rolled through the intersection at a cautious crawl. From the opposite side, a sedan—a silver Honda Civic driven by a software engineer late for a meeting—entered the intersection with equal caution.

Neither driver saw the other until the final moment, and by then it was physics, not intent, that took over.

The Honda clipped the rear axle of the Chevy truck, spinning it sideways. The truck tipped—not violently, but with the grace of something caught in a slow-motion dream—and fell onto its side. The Civic crumpled inward at the hood, airbags bursting out like oversized mushrooms. The truck's cargo—boxed electronics—erupted through the back door, skidding across the road and bouncing into a nearby alleyway. A pedestrian screamed. A dog barked. A street vendor dropped his tongs.

But no one died.

Which made it harder, somehow.

Eloise Marrin had not meant to see the accident. She’d been sipping coffee in her parked car, a habit she couldn’t break, scrolling through half-hearted texts and waiting for the courage to walk into the HR firm where she’d been working temp for three months. The moment the collision occurred, she looked up, coffee sloshing onto her skirt. Her first thought was not “I should help,” but “Was that real?”

By the time she reached the intersection, someone else—an older man in a worn blue windbreaker—was already pulling the truck driver from the tilted cab.

“You all right?” the man asked, grunting as he helped the driver down.

“Yeah, yeah, just… didn’t see him,” the driver muttered, blinking at the street like he expected it to look different. “He wasn’t supposed to be there.”

“No one was,” Eloise murmured. She was standing near the Civic now. Its driver had emerged, shaken but unharmed, a red mark blossoming across his forehead where the airbag had kissed him too hard.

“Lights were out,” the Civic driver said, as if someone had accused him. “They were blinking. I—I slowed. I swear to God, I slowed.”

Eloise nodded, but didn’t say anything.

A teenager across the street had recorded the whole thing. His phone was up like a weapon.

The report would say it was nobody’s fault.

It was true.

The maintenance logs confirmed that the city had flagged the light system at 6th and Meyer for review two days ago. The blinking yellow had been initiated automatically during testing. Protocols were followed. The drivers had both obeyed the blinking caution lights. There was no alcohol, no speeding, no negligence.

But the fallout would ripple through the city in strange, untraceable ways.

The delivery company would file for partial insurance compensation and be denied due to a loophole in the “unexpected equipment failure” clause. The truck driver, a thirty-six-year-old single father named Randall Weems, would miss two weeks of work waiting for physical therapy appointments. The Civic driver, a man named Howard Lin, would develop an obsession with traffic signals, eventually filing a civil complaint against the city that would go nowhere.

And Eloise Marrin, who didn’t even see the full crash, would change everything.

Two weeks later, Eloise quit her temp job without sending the exit paperwork. She began waking up early and walking to the corner of 6th and Meyer, coffee in hand, watching the cars and pedestrians with an odd intensity. Her friends said she seemed distant. She didn’t disagree. Something had burrowed into her, a quiet unease.

That was the first time she met Deacon Welles.

“I saw you watching,” he said.

Eloise turned, startled. Deacon stood about six feet tall, with too-long hair pulled back into a knot. He wore a faded leather jacket and boots better suited to a motorcyclist. He looked like he should have been doing something more important than loitering.

“I come here most mornings,” she said, instinctively folding her arms.

“I know. I’ve been watching you watching.”

She frowned. “You sound like a creep.”

“Probably,” he said, smiling faintly. “But I was also at the scene that morning.”

“You saw the crash?”

“Felt it, more than saw. I was in that alleyway back there. The sound was... you don’t forget it.”

“No,” she said. “You don’t.”

They stood there in silence, watching the light blink green, then red, then green again.

“Why do you come back?” he asked finally.

“I don’t know,” Eloise said, though it wasn’t true. She came back because the crash had opened something. A tear in the surface. A glimpse of how fragile it all was. She couldn’t let it go.

The city eventually fixed the traffic lights. The timing was adjusted. New paint was laid on the street. A minor news story was published in the Herald: Intersections Repaired After Rare Malfunction. No follow-up. No outrage.

But accidents that aren’t anyone’s fault have a way of leaving ghosts.

Eloise started writing again. She hadn’t written in years, but now her nights filled with long, feverish journal entries. Not about the crash exactly, but about before—how quickly things could vanish, how no system was ever really secure.

She emailed a few of the survivors. Randall never replied. Howard Lin did, once.

    “Thanks for asking. I’m doing okay. I think about it sometimes. Mostly at night. Not sure why you care, but thanks.”

She didn’t reply. What could she say?

Deacon, on the other hand, kept showing up. They began talking regularly. Not always about the crash, but about everything. He was a mechanic. Had been for years. Said he liked engines because they were predictable until they weren’t.

“Machines,” he said once, “always fail eventually. The trick is knowing when.”

Eloise started sketching maps. Of intersections. Of power grids. Of places where systems could fail.

She wasn’t entirely sure when it turned from curiosity to obsession.

Maybe it was the second crash.

The second crash happened three months later. On a rainy Wednesday, barely reported. This one involved a school bus and a city utility van. No children were hurt—thank God, the papers said—but the utility driver lost his leg.

The circumstances were oddly familiar: a timing mismatch on an automated traffic sequence. A street corner on the other side of town. Another “no one to blame” situation.

Eloise circled the article in red and mailed it to Deacon.

He showed up at her apartment the next night with a six-pack of beer and a folder stuffed with diagrams.

“I think someone’s doing this on purpose,” he said.

Eloise stared at him.

“Or,” he added, “someone's system is broken. And they don’t know. Or they know and don’t care.”

She sat down slowly. “What are we saying here?”

“We're saying,” he said, sliding a grainy photo of a circuit board across the table, “that maybe the accidents aren’t accidents.”

A pause.

Eloise picked up the photo. “Then we find out who’s letting them happen.”

She didn’t know what it meant, exactly. But she knew one thing: she hadn’t been wrong to keep watching.

The surface had cracked.

And something was looking back.

Deacon laid out the diagrams with meticulous care, each corner of the page flattened with the edge of a calloused hand. He didn’t speak at first, letting the silence stretch out between them like a taut wire. Eloise poured herself another coffee—not because she needed the caffeine but because the ritual steadied her hands.

“These are from an old project,” he said finally. “City-wide traffic automation review. About three years ago, before I quit working contract for the municipal services department.”

She raised an eyebrow, not hiding her skepticism. “You were working with the city?”

“Briefly. I wasn’t exactly their first choice. I got in through a subcontractor. They needed diagnostics run on old analog systems before a scheduled upgrade. Most of the hardware in this city’s grid is Frankenstein’d together—pieces from the eighties, rewired in the nineties, patched with firmware in the 2000s. It’s a joke.”

“And no one ever just… fixed it?”

He laughed, but without humor. “You ever try convincing a budget committee to overhaul something that still mostly works?”

She didn’t answer. She knew that argument too well. Her last HR gig had ended after an internal audit revealed that the payroll system still relied on a spreadsheet manually updated by a seventy-year-old supervisor who refused to learn anything newer than Lotus 1-2-3. The motto was always: If it’s not broken enough to be a liability, it’s not broken.

“What am I looking at?” she asked, leaning closer.

He pointed to a sequence of numbers, his finger hovering just above the surface of the page. “This is the diagnostic readout from the signal controller at 6th and Meyer. Not from the day of the crash. From before.”

She narrowed her eyes. “How far before?”

“Six weeks. A routine test. Everything checked out… except here.” He tapped a small line of hexadecimal code. “This isn’t supposed to be here.”

Eloise wasn’t a coder, but she understood enough from her years in tech-adjacent admin work to recognize malformed code when she saw it. “That’s not a bug.”

“No,” Deacon said. “It’s a ghost. Something’s left a fingerprint in the code—something not city standard. And it’s not isolated.”

He opened a second folder. More intersections. More small, anomalous sequences.

“That’s… how many locations?” she asked.

“Eleven. All within this quadrant of the city. And all showing signs of logic inconsistencies in their signal timing history. Not enough to trip the failsafes. Just enough to delay. To confuse.”

She leaned back, staring at the ceiling. H
