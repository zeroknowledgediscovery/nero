Title: The Crimson Violet

Chapter One: Ashes Beneath the Orchard

There were things in the town of Marrow Glen that people did not speak of, not even under cover of dark, not even when the firelight flickered softly and the whiskey had warmed their tongues. To be born in Marrow Glen was to inherit silence as a birthright and suspicion as a second skin.

Beneath the edge of town, past the wilting orchard of plums and ash trees that hadn’t borne fruit in nearly a decade, lay the Grange estate—a creaking manor half-swallowed by ivy and secrecy. It was there that Violet Grange returned, unannounced and cloaked in the scent of rain and regret, after nearly seven years gone. Her absence had been spoken of only once, in hushed voices, following the suicide of her brother, Declan. The official story said he fell into the quarry during a storm. The unofficial one was... left untold.

Violet stepped through the rusting gate, the iron whimpering as she passed, dragging behind her a single suitcase and the heavy trail of memory. Her once-boyish hair now swept her shoulders, and the lavender birthmark beneath her collarbone—the one her mother had always insisted was a mark of some ancient blessing—peeked through the rain-dark fabric of her blouse.

The house had not changed. Shadows nested in the corners of the porch. The windows blinked slowly, unwilling to recognize her. She stood there, listening to the wind whistle through the eaves, until the door creaked open without her touch.

“Still as dramatic as ever,” came a voice. Familiar, and yet splintered by time.

“Hello, Maren,” Violet said, stepping inside.

Maren Delaney had once been her closest friend. And something else, too, though they'd never dared give it a name. Not back then. Not here, where love between two women was sin dressed as madness, or madness disguised as sin.

“You look... older,” Maren said, eyes like storm glass, her auburn hair pulled into a severe knot at the nape of her neck.

“So do you,” Violet said, setting down her suitcase with a thud that echoed through the empty house.

“I never left.”

“I know.”

Maren's mouth twisted. “Everyone thought you’d be dead by now. Or famous. Turns out you’re just late.”

Violet tilted her head, half-smiling. “Late for what?”

Maren didn’t answer. Instead, she turned and walked down the corridor, her footsteps muffled by a thick runner of moth-eaten carpet. Violet followed.

In the parlor, nothing had moved. The grandfather clock ticked its ceaseless dirge. A faint scent of burnt clove lingered, as though someone had smoked a pipe in the dark hours of morning.

“I didn’t come back for nostalgia,” Violet said, lowering herself onto the cracked leather of the settee. “I came back because something’s wrong.”

Maren remained standing. “You mean the letters.”

Violet’s eyes snapped up. “You got one too?”

Maren nodded. “Three, actually. Same handwriting. No signature. Just... fragments. Like someone is trying to rebuild a corpse from bones.”

Violet fished in her coat pocket and drew out a folded page. It was smeared at the edges with what might have been blood or ink.

    The orchard remembers. Come home. You were wrong about Declan.

Maren read it, face unreadable. “They’re trying to open something. Someone. I don’t know if they want us to help... or to stop them.”

A log cracked in the hearth, though no fire had been lit.

“We need to find the others,” Violet said.

“There are no others,” Maren whispered.

Violet leaned forward, voice low. “There were others. You know it. You know.”

And just like that, Maren’s resolve cracked. She looked toward the window, where the orchard pulsed gently in the mist, as though breathing.

The next morning dawned red, the sky bleeding at its seams. Violet wandered through the kitchen, brushing her fingers across the counters where flour had once dusted every surface and her mother’s humming had softened the corners of the room.

“Everything’s gone quiet,” Maren said, standing in the doorway. “No birds. No wind.”

“It’s listening,” Violet murmured.

“What is?”

“The thing beneath.”

They walked to the edge of the orchard, where the soil grew black and soft. In the center, where the plum trees knotted like arthritic hands, there stood an old swing, barely clinging to the gnarled limb that held it.

Violet stepped forward and laid her hand on the bark. “It started here.”

“You think it wants you?” Maren asked.

“I think it wants both of us.”

Later that day, they found the first body.

It was pinned to the chapel door with a rusted pitchfork, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes packed with violets. The reverend, old Brother Aldwych, had been dead for at least two days, though no one had noticed.

Carved into the wood beside him, in symbols that crawled like insects across the grain, were the words:

    LOVE WAS NEVER MEANT FOR THE DEAD.

Violet felt her breath catch. “This is a warning.”

Maren’s jaw clenched. “Or a welcome.”

That night, sleep did not come. Violet lay in the bedroom that once belonged to her mother, staring at the cracked ceiling where water stains formed shapes she pretended not to recognize.

At two a.m., she heard the piano. Just a single note, pressed down and held. Then another. And another.

She rose, barefoot, and crept down the hallway. At the base of the stairs, a figure stood cloaked in moonlight—long-limbed, thin, wearing Declan’s old peacoat.

She opened her mouth, but no sound emerged.

The figure turned, and there was nothing where a face should have been. Just skin stretched smooth, eyes inked directly into the flesh like tattoos.

“Violet,” it rasped, with a voice like splintered wood. “You left us.”

Then it vanished.

She stumbled back into the parlor and found Maren sitting in the dark, hands wrapped around a steaming mug.

“I saw him,” Violet whispered.

Maren did not look surprised. “They always come back, eventually.”

“Do you believe in ghosts?”

“I believe in the things we bury.”

Outside, the wind began to howl.

Inside, the walls began to weep.

The storm arrived without warning. It wasn’t the kind of rain that eased in with a whisper and gathered in polite puddles—it was a war cry of thunder and water, slamming down on the old shingles of the Grange estate like fists against a coffin lid. Violet stood at the window, her breath fogging the pane as she watched the orchard twist and flail beneath the downpour. The trees looked alive, frantic, like they were trying to speak in the language of broken branches.

Behind her, Maren stirred. She’d fallen asleep on the parlor couch, her limbs draped like she’d been dropped there. Her hair had come loose in the night, red strands curling down across her cheek like spilled ink. She blinked awake slowly, confusion blooming across her features like a bruise.

“You didn’t sleep,” she said, voice rough as stone dragged across stone.

“I watched,” Violet replied. “Something’s moving out there. Not just shadows.”

Maren stood and joined her at the window, rubbing the sleep from her face. For a moment, neither of them spoke. The world outside was chaos. But inside, there was stillness, like the breath held just before a scream.

“What did we used to say when we were kids?” Violet asked suddenly. “That rhyme?”

Maren gave her a sidelong look. “You mean the one we sang in the orchard?”

Violet nodded. “‘Red leaves fall and black roots grow…’”

“‘And lovers lost will never know…’” Maren finished. Her voice was hollow. “We thought we made it up.”

“We didn’t.”

Violet turned from the window, unease curling in her stomach like rot. “Do you think someone knew, back then? About us? About what was… starting?”

Maren didn’t answer right away. When she did, her voice was brittle. “Your mother knew.”

That struck like a slap. Violet blinked. “She never said anything.”

“She didn’t have to. I saw it in her eyes. The day we kissed in the barn, remember that? You laughed. I was terrified. But she was standing there, near the fence. Watching.”

Violet swallowed hard. She remembered. The sun had been just beginning to set, dust floating in the air like golden snow. They’d been thirteen. They’d thought they were invisible.

“She never spoke to me again after that,” Maren said, her tone distant. “Even when I came to the house with my father. She looked through me.”

Violet crossed the room and sat beside her on the couch. The leather was cold. “I’m sorry.”

“It’s not your fault. It’s this place. This town. Nothing lives here. Not really.”

They sat in silence as the storm raged. Time bent strangely, like it always did in that house. Hours folded in on themselves. The clocks ticked out of sync. Somewhere upstairs, a floorboard groaned under invisible weight.

That afternoon, they went into town.

Marrow Glen had not changed in seven years. The streets were still lined with crooked stone buildings and rust-colored shutters. The general store stood stubborn and peeling, its front windows filled with yellowing flyers and jars of candy no one bought. The people, too, had aged without grace. Faces Violet recognized twisted with confusion and quiet judgment as she passed. She heard her name in whispers, but no one greeted her.

“They never forgave you,” Maren said under her breath as they crossed the square. “They think Declan died because of you.”

“They’re wrong,” Violet said, jaw tight. “It wasn’t me. It was—”

She stopped. The old church loomed ahead, its steeple casting a long shadow like a sundial marking sorrow. The door was gone now—removed after the reverend’s body had been found. In its place was yellow tape, but even that had been shredded by wind and time.

Maren nodded toward the chapel. “It started again here.”

They went inside.

The pews were askew, some overturned, others broken. The altar had been scorched, as if someone had tried to burn something out of it. On the floor, the scorch marks spiraled out in a shape that Violet recognized but couldn’t place—an ancient pattern that prickled behind her eyes like d
