CHAPTER ONE
The Last Letter

Blood—thick and dark—crawled from the wound in his side like some creature bent on escaping him. David Felton gritted his teeth, fighting the tremors in his hand as he dragged the pen across the warped notepaper. His breath hitched, caught in the ruins of a collapsed lung, but he refused to stop. Each letter was carved in pain, the words bleeding from him like the blood soaking the floor beneath his desk.

"They have come for me. If you're reading this, you already know too much."

The ink smudged under his fingertips. His hand faltered.

"Tell her... I'm sorry."

The pen slipped from his grasp and clattered to the hardwood floor. A final breath escaped him, sharp and sudden, like a secret he'd meant to keep but couldn't.

Outside, the wind whispered through the cracked windowpane. Somewhere in the distance, the muffled wail of sirens twisted into the night.

Three days later, Marian Cole stood on the threshold of the old house, her arms wrapped tightly around her chest. She stared up at the second-story window—the same one David had insisted they keep open, even in winter. For the ghosts, he used to say. "They hate feeling trapped."

She hadn’t spoken to him in four years.

"Are you sure you want to go in alone?" asked Eli Moran, her partner from the Bureau. He was tall, soft-eyed, and, at the moment, visibly uncomfortable in his too-tight blazer.

Marian nodded, her dark hair pulled back in a severe ponytail. "He was my friend. I need to see it."

The house smelled like mothballs and old paper. The kind of place where memory hung like smoke. Dust motes danced in the filtered sunlight as she stepped into the study, where the chalk outline still marked the spot where David's body had been found.

On the desk, untouched, was the note. The last thing he’d ever written. She picked it up with gloved hands, reading the jagged words. Something about the handwriting didn’t sit right with her—it looked forced, stuttering. Wrong.

"They have come for me."
"Tell her... I'm sorry."

"Her," Eli murmured, reading over her shoulder. "You think he meant you?"

Marian didn’t answer. She was already looking past the note, toward the edge of the desk. The bloodstains were oddly shaped, not the usual spatter. There was a pattern, almost. Not quite letters—more like symbols.

"What is this?" she whispered.

Eli crouched beside her. "You think he was trying to write something else?"

"I think he was trying to warn us."

Later that night, Marian sat alone in her apartment, the note beside her, the desk lamp burning low. She’d scanned it, enhanced it, inverted it. Nothing made the symbols make sense.

Until she remembered the book.

David’s obsession, the one that had fractured his career and their friendship. The Palinode Manuscript. An untranslatable codex found in the ruins beneath an abandoned monastery in Southern France. He’d believed it held the key to something ancient. Something buried.

They’d all laughed at him.

But now he was dead.

Marian dug through her files until she found the folder—tabbed “Palinode, David” in her cursive. She pulled out a grainy scan of one of the manuscript’s pages and held it beside the bloodstained desk photo.

The match wasn’t exact.

But close enough.

She picked up her phone and dialed.

"Emory," said a sleepy voice on the other end.

"Wake up. I need your help. David was right."

CHAPTER TWO
The Book That Shouldn’t Exist

Emory Vass was the kind of scholar who didn’t wear shoes unless he had to. He opened the door barefoot, wearing a coffee-stained sweater and holding a steaming mug in one hand and a Siamese cat in the other.

"You look terrible," he said, squinting at Marian.

"Thanks. Can I come in?"

She showed him the note, the photo, and the Palinode image. Emory blinked, set the cat down, and leaned in so close his nose nearly touched the paper.

"Where did you say you got this?"

"From David’s desk. The night he died."

Emory exhaled. "Jesus Christ. He found it. He really found it."

"Found what?"

Emory glanced over his shoulder as though the walls had ears. He gestured for her to sit and began pacing.

"You know how people say the Voynich Manuscript was a hoax? Or that it’s just gibberish? Same with the Palinode. But I’ve always believed there’s a root language underneath. A proto-script."

"Are you saying David cracked it?"

"I’m saying he got too close." Emory pulled a battered leather-bound volume from a hidden drawer. Marian’s breath caught. It was the real Palinode.

"I thought this was in storage at the National Archive."

"It was. Until it wasn't."

He flipped to a marked page. There it was—the same symbol, etched in a faded brown ink that looked uncomfortably like dried blood.

"David’s note is a match. This isn’t coincidence. This is invocation."

Marian stiffened. "Invocation of what?"

Emory didn’t answer at first. Then, in a voice low enough that the cat twitched, he said:

"Of them."

It began with the dreams.

That night, Marian woke in sweat, the sheets tangled around her legs. The same image burned in her mind: a circle of black stones, a red sky, and a sound—like whispering, but backward.

She sat up, heart pounding. On the wall, in her own handwriting, were the same symbols from David’s floor. She hadn’t written them. At least, she didn’t remember doing it.

At 3:12 AM, she called Emory.

"I think something followed me back."

Emory didn’t ask what. He just said: "Get over here. Bring salt. And iron."

By the end of the week, two more deaths were reported. Both former colleagues of David. Both found in locked rooms. Both with notes scrawled in blood, and the same stuttering message:

"They have come."

The Bureau began to take interest.

But by then, it was too late.

The language was spreading.

Through dreams. Through speech. Through writing.

Even through thought.

CHAPTER THREE
The Voice in the Ink

Agent Eli Moran was the next to succumb.

He’d always been grounded—pragmatic, unshaken. But when Marian visited him at the field office, she found him staring at a blank wall, muttering in a language she couldn’t place.

"Eli?" she said, touching his shoulder.

He didn’t blink.

"Eli, look at me."

Slowly, he turned. His eyes were red-rimmed, pupils dilated.

"You hear it too?" he whispered.

"Hear what?"

"The voice in the ink. It’s inside the letters."

And then he screamed.

By the time they institutionalized him, three more people were dead. Each linked to the manuscript, each exhibiting the same signs: insomnia, paranoia, and compulsive writing in the Palinode script.

Emory and Marian worked day and night, translating fragments. What they uncovered was a ritual. A calling.

Something ancient was being remembered.

Woken.

A name appeared again and again in the glyphs.

Halem-Yat.

Not a person. Not a god.

A concept. A mouth beneath the earth.

David hadn’t been paranoid.

He’d been trying to stop it.

And they were already too late.

Marian’s own symptoms began with small things. A ringing in her ears. Numbers rearranging themselves. Shadows moving just out of frame.

But when she woke one morning with her fingernails torn off—each one lined up beside her bed like offerings—she knew she was next.

Only one thing remained: finish David’s work. Complete the translation.

Find the ritual. Undo the invocation.

If it wasn’t already permanent.

Marian stayed at David’s house long after Eli had left. The evening light, filtered through dusty blinds, painted the study in long, amber slashes. The bloodstains were faint now, faded by time and cleaning efforts, but the weight of the room hadn't changed. It still pulsed with something—not grief, not fear exactly, but an unsettled hum beneath the surface, as if the walls remembered.

She lowered herself into David’s old leather chair. It creaked under her weight, the scent of aged paper and decaying leather rising around her. Her fingers hovered over the desk, grazing the grooves where he had scribbled so many of his notes. She remembered him hunched over this same desk in college, muttering translations to himself in six different dead languages, his coffee always going cold. He had been brilliant. And he had always been on the edge of something—not just discovery, but collapse.

She took a breath, steadying her hands. The note still lay where she'd left it, beside the faded photograph of the manuscript page. There was no doubt in her mind now that he’d been trying to write something more than a farewell. The shapes in his blood weren't random. The language, if that’s what it was, had cadence. Intent. She traced one of the bloodmarks on the photo, lips moving silently as she attempted to sound out the glyph in her mind. Nothing came. Just a vague static behind her ears and the onset of a pressure headache blooming behind her eyes.

She forced herself to focus. “If this is a message,” she murmured aloud, “then who the hell was it meant for?”

The room offered no answer.

Instead, her eyes drifted to the bookshelf in the corner—untouched, she guessed, by the investigators. David had kept everything. Marian stepped over, fingers brushing the spines: ancient texts, obscure journals, unpublished treatises in foreign alphabets. The fourth shelf housed his more recent obsessions. She recognized the titles immediately: The Ninefold Path, Enochian Variants, The Lost Dialects of Mesopotamia. Her fingers stopped on a slim black volume with no title.

Pulling it free, she flipped it open. A loose page fell out, landing at her feet.

She bent, picked it up. Not paper. Vellum. Faint ink, aged with time. But what startled her wasn't its age—it was the handwriting. Hers.

Her own writing, unmistakably hers, repeated the same symbol over and over. The one from the blood trail. The page was torn abruptly, and a final line had been scrawled at the bottom:

"I didn't mean to remember. But now it won't let me forget."

She sat back slowly, heart thumping in her chest, eyes wide.

Had she written this? When?
