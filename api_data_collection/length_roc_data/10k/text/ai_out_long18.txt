Title: Ashes of the Accord

Chapter One: The Sky Without a Sun

They told us the sun still existed. Somewhere beyond the black mesh of clouds, past the eternal haze that settled on the sky like an infected wound, the sun glowed. It was a truth passed down in bedtime stories and state-sponsored education videos—just another myth to soothe the sleepless.

My name is Thren Vale, born in Dome 9E under the Accord of Unified Dominion. That’s what we called the ruling body, though no one really knew who sat at its helm. Faces changed. Edicts poured in. Faces vanished. The Accord remained.

The world ended fifty-six years before I was born, or so the records claimed. Something about the Breath Wars, a chain of bioweapon exchanges that left the surface poisoned, mutated. Survivors fled underground or to the domes—the great sealed sanctuaries rising like tumors from the scorched soil. We learned not to ask what lay beyond the domes. Some who went out never came back. Others returned with glassy eyes and mouths sewn shut, literally.

My dome, 9E, wasn't the worst. It wasn't the best either. The rations came once a week, protein-paste in silver packets. Water was recycled through sand filters and algae tanks. We had electricity for seven hours each day, then night came and stayed like a guest who’d outstayed its welcome.

I worked sanitation maintenance—Level 3 access, which meant I got to clean ducts, scrub air scrubbers, and crawl through the intestinal machinery of the dome. It gave me time to think, and time, in Dome 9E, was a dangerous luxury.

It started with a sound.

A rhythmic click, like metal tapping bone. I was two levels below the dome floor, near Sector 4W, cleaning a blockage in the air shaft. My headlamp flickered, casting seizures of light across the aluminum walls. The click came again, closer now. I paused, heart hiccuping.

"Who's there?"

Nothing.

Then a whisper: “Breathless...”

I turned, but the corridor was empty. Just the wheeze of filtered air. I told myself it was a trick of the ducts—pipes vibrating or a looped echo. I climbed out of the shaft with hands like ice and a heart trying to crack my ribs open.

That night, I told Calla. She was the only one I trusted. Calla had been born in 9E like me. Her father vanished during one of the Recalibrations—government purges masked as system updates. Her mother died birthing her younger brother. Calla raised him herself, sharp-eyed, quiet, always watching the angles.

"Whispers?" she said, spooning paste into her mouth. "Could be the ones that live in the walls."

I stared.

She shrugged. "You never heard about them? Shadows between steel. Workers who disappeared, came back wrong. Talk in backwards language. Some say they breathe the air outside and it changed them."

"You believe that?"

Calla didn’t answer. She just kept eating, eyes focused on a crack in the ceiling.

The next day, I was reassigned.

They told me my name had been pulled in the lottery. I was to report to Surface Watch, effective immediately. I tried to protest—I had no training, no gear clearance—but protests only got you reassigned faster, usually to something worse.

Surface Watch was a myth in itself. Few ever returned. Some said it was a death sentence wrapped in duty.

But I went.

Chapter Two: Surface Watch

They brought us up in a maglift, sealed in a steel coffin that shuddered and groaned with every vertical meter. The other two with me didn’t speak. One was a tall man with an artificial left eye that blinked asynchronously. The other—a girl younger than me, with pale lashes and eyes like faded ink.

We stopped abruptly. The doors opened into a chamber that reeked of burnt plastic and ozone. A man waited for us, wearing a suit that buzzed with embedded electronics. His face was lined, expression unreadable.

"Welcome to the edge," he said. "I am Watchmaster Rell."

He briefed us quickly. Our job was simple: monitor the horizon for anomalies. Drones could no longer be trusted—too many went rogue, influenced by outside signals. Human eyes were the last reliable tool.

We would sleep in shifts. We would not communicate with the lower domes unless instructed. We would never, under any circumstance, open the primary hatch.

"Outside is death," Rell said, eyes on mine like he knew I didn’t believe him. "But it doesn’t always kill quickly. Sometimes, it talks first."

The observatory was little more than a bubble of reinforced glass and rusted steel, mounted on a pivoting arm. From inside, the world beyond looked like a bad dream: land flattened into skeletal ridges, the sky a gauze of ash and drifting red clouds. Here and there, shapes moved—too distant to identify, too fast to track. I told myself they were windblown debris.

The first anomaly appeared on my third rotation.

It was a figure.

Bipedal. Human-sized. Wrapped in strips of dark cloth. It walked slowly across the horizon, pausing every dozen steps to face the dome. I used the telescopic lens. Its face was hidden. But I could swear it was watching me.

I reported it.

Rell said, “Ignore it. That one’s always there.”

Always?

It returned every night for the next week.

Then the voice returned.

Late one shift, the speaker crackled. I was alone. The others were asleep or feigning it.

Thren...

I dropped the mug I was holding. Coffee seeped into the grated floor.

Thren Vale... breath with us.

I pulled the plug on the speaker. It continued anyway.

Your lungs are not your own.

I ran. I didn't stop until I hit the access stairs to the lower dome, but the lock was sealed. The lights above the hatch blinked red. No exit.

Later, Rell found me curled against the wall.

“First time hearing them?” he asked.

I nodded.

“You’ll get used to it.”

I never did.

Chapter Three: Blood in the Walls

Calla came to find me three weeks later.

She wore a technician’s badge and a stolen uniform, face shadowed beneath a hood. She said nothing as she led me to a service tunnel behind the old antenna arrays. Her brother was missing, and she thought Surface Watch might be connected.

“What do you mean missing?”

“Gone,” she whispered. “No notice. No file deletion. Just... gone.”

We hacked into the Accord Archive. A risky move. Death sentence if caught.

The files we found were fragmented, corrupted, overwritten in patches. But one phrase repeated in half a dozen reports:

Breath Signal: Containment Failed. Memetic Corruption Detected.

It made no sense. Until we matched the dates.

Each signal event coincided with new assignments to Surface Watch.

And each of those names—including mine—was listed as “Presumed Reassimilated.”

We were being experimented on.

Used.

The figure outside the dome wasn’t just watching. It was part of the test.

We decided to escape.

We built an exo-rig from scavenged parts, wrapped our skin in foil-mesh to deflect breath particles—if that was even real—and timed our exit during the maintenance blackout.

We made it ten meters past the dome before the sky spoke.

It wasn’t words. It was a sound like memories burning. A shriek that existed inside the bones.

Calla screamed. I saw her blood boil beneath her skin. Her eyes turned black. She reached for me, and her voice was not her own:

Breathe with me.

I ran.

Ran until the world tilted and I fell into the scorched dirt.

When I woke, the dome was gone.

And the figure stood beside me.

“Welcome,” it said, “to the breathless.”

The next morning, I sat in the communal mess hall beneath flickering amber lights. The paste tasted of rust and plastic. Children lined up against the far wall, reciting the Pledge of Unity beneath the gaze of a ceiling-mounted drone. It hovered silently, its red lens pulsing every few seconds, recording each movement, every deviation. A boy stuttered his line—“Through breath and bond, we endure”—and was quickly escorted out by a monitor in black. No one said a word. We never did. Silence was safer than sympathy.

Calla slid into the seat across from me, setting down a ration block and an old book with its spine nearly dissolved.

“Still thinking about the whisper?” she asked.

I nodded, trying not to look at the boy’s empty seat.

“There’s a crawlspace behind the vent near your berth,” she said. “Leads into the maintenance bypass. You can listen to things in there. Sometimes it helps make sense of the noise.”

“You’ve used it?”

She smirked. “I’ve lived in it. There’s more of the dome that’s hidden than shown. Always has been. The Accord doesn’t build for comfort—they build for control.”

“Why help me?”

Her eyes didn’t flinch. “Because you listened when my brother cried in the night.”

That was Calla. Sharp, unsentimental, but she remembered everything.

I went to the vent after third cycle. The corridor was empty, lights buzzing in epileptic bursts. The panel came off easily with a little pressure and the help of a maintenance knife. I crawled through, brushing against old wires and insulated conduit, the smell of mold and dust thick in my throat. After a dozen meters, the space opened slightly into a junction box—a forgotten cavity between layers. A child could have lived here. A child like Calla.

I sat. Listened.

At first, nothing. Then, a hum—low and rhythmic. Not machine. Not airflow. A voice underneath the silence, speaking too low to understand but too constant to ignore. I pressed my ear to the metal.

“…the skin remembers…”

The words came not in sound but in sensation. A pressure behind the eyes. A pull at the base of the spine.

I scrambled out.

That night, I didn’t sleep.

Two cycles later, a new face joined our sector. His name was Alric Dreel, a pale, wiry man with a twitch behind his left eye. He claimed he came from Dome 4B, but when I asked about the surface tension levels over there, he hesitated.

“We don’t track that where I’m from,” he said, his tone too flat.

I’d been trained to read lies. Maintenance techs learned early that truth could save lives—or cost them. Alric was hiding something.

He started askin
