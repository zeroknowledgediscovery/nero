Whispers of Tansel Wood
Chapter One: The Spark in the Bramble

It was the way the wind moved through the brambles that gave her away. Not by sound, for sprites seldom made any, nor by sight, for even the keenest eyes would miss the slip of her shadow under leaf and thorn. But the breeze—yes, the breeze—stumbled over something just a heartbeat before it reached Old Harnen's boots, and he knew then she was near.

Old Harnen stooped, one knee creaking. He reached out, calloused fingers brushing the edge of a curling fern. “You don’t belong in these woods, little flicker,” he murmured. “But I won’t catch you if you don’t want catching.”

Nothing moved.

Then, just as he stood and turned back toward the mossy trail, a shimmer like frost on fire peeled away from the trunk of a squat ash tree. She flitted—no bigger than a pinecone, glowing with a strange, off-yellow light, flickering oddly as if unsure of what color to wear in the waking world. She trailed sparks like ink dropped into water, dissolving too soon to see clearly.

And she was laughing.

The sprite darted up and around Harnen’s head, looping twice before perching with a flutter of gossamer wings on the rim of his weather-beaten hat. “You walk like a boar with stones in its shoes,” she said, voice chime-like and yet rough around the edges, as though laughter had dulled its tune.

“I walk like a man who knows these woods,” Harnen grumbled, not unkindly. “What are you doing this far from Tansel Hollow, eh? Don’t you know the wards have faded since the Waking?”

The sprite blinked—eyes too large, too green. “Do you mean the old chalk circles? They’ve all been washed away. Rain doesn’t like lines, you know.”

“And you don’t belong here,” he said again.

“But I am here.” She tilted her head, the thin lines of her face catching golden light. “I’ve got a name now.”

“Have you.” He adjusted his hat, and she fluttered up briefly before settling again. “Well then, let’s hear it.”

“Elmira,” she said, though she whispered it like she wasn’t quite sure. “Elmira Briarwhisp.”

Harnen sucked on his teeth. “That’s no name given by the Hollow. Who named you, sprite?”

Elmira didn’t answer. Her light dimmed, just a shade.

The Hollow had long been a secret to men, hidden not by walls but by forgetting. A ring of ancient trees—sycamore, yew, and the ghost-pale ironbirch—encircled a glade where the old magicks still whispered in the moss. It had once thrummed with the breath of a dozen sprites, flitting in and out of the soft-lantern light of their fungus towers, their songs stitched into the wind. But now the Hollow was nearly silent.

Nearly.

Elmira, as she now chose to be called, hovered over the cracked basin of the central glade fountain. The water, once humming with aurora-light, now trickled dully, like it was embarrassed to still be alive. She poked at the surface with a stick.

“I named myself,” she muttered to no one. “Because nobody else did.”

“Names are weight, child,” said a low voice behind her, dry as shed bark. “You wear them long after the world forgets.”

She spun. “Elder Thiln.”

The old sprite, more bark than shimmer, stood hunched under the arc of a curling fern. He didn’t glow; he etched light, as if the shadows tried to pull him into themselves but failed. His wings were torn, one hanging limp.

“You shouldn’t be wandering into the human wood,” he said, hobbling closer. “Their dreams have teeth now. They don't see what we are. They see what they fear.”

“I wasn’t afraid,” she said.

“You should be.”

He reached into the moss and drew forth a thin blade of quartz. It caught no light, but it hummed softly. “There are things waking beyond the Hollow. And you’ve stirred them.”

Elmira frowned. “It was just one old man. He can barely bend without creaking.”

Thiln sighed, the kind of sigh that lives longer than its speaker. “He’s not the danger. But the moment you step beyond the chalk-ring, you become part of their story. And their stories are hungry.”

In the town of Wensgrove, just three days’ march west of the Hollow, a girl named Arlyn stared into a cup of dandelion tea and saw it swirl into the shape of a face. Not a real one—not clearly—but the outline of a cheek, the curl of a smile too wild to be human. She blinked, and it was gone.

“I’m not mad,” she said aloud.

“Hmm?” her brother Gereth looked up from mending a boot.

“I saw something.”

“You always see something.”

“No, really.” She set the cup down. “It looked like someone. Like… a girl, with leaves for hair.”

Gereth frowned. “You’ve been reading Gran’s books again.”

Arlyn didn’t deny it.

Their grandmother had been one of the last wardens of the old lore, keeper of the Songs Without Names and the Rules of Borrowed Fire. She died five winters ago, leaving behind stacks of leather-bound volumes that reeked of mildew and secrets. Their father had tried to burn them once. The flames hadn’t caught.

Now, Arlyn opened the thickest of the tomes again. The one with the pressed acorn on the cover.

“Sprites,” she whispered. “Said to carry the memory of the forest itself. Said to vanish when named. Said to awaken... when the veil weakens.”

She didn’t know why, but her chest ached when she read it. Like something old had turned over in her ribs.

That night, Elmira dreamed of a mountain split by song. A place where music bled from the stones and turned into rivers of light. A throne sat empty at its summit, built from wind and bark and the bones of birds.

In the dream, she sat there. And she burned.

But the fire did not consume. It whispered.

“Elmira,” it said. “You have been named. You have been chosen.”

She woke to the sound of the Hollow breaking.

Trees don’t scream. Not really. But the old ones groan when wounded, and the ironbirch, the eldest of all, cried out that dawn. Something had torn a wound through its bark, leaving black resin oozing like blood.

Thiln stood before it, tiny hand pressed to the trunk. “The wards,” he said. “Gone. The veil... thinner than mist.”

Elmira stepped closer. “I dreamed something.”

Thiln didn’t turn. “You are not ready.”

“I dreamed the throne.”

Now he looked. His eyes, usually dim with moss-glow, widened.

“You saw the Crown of Greenfire?”

She nodded.

He reached into his chest—not metaphorically, but truly, through a small opening in the bark-like plating of his ribs—and pulled out a splinter of goldglass. “Then it’s begun.”

“What has?”

“The Reckoning.”

Meanwhile, deep below Wensgrove, in a cavern no one remembered carving, a man with a crooked lantern stared at a wall of stone and whispered, “She has returned.” He was bald, robed in tatters, and smelled of soil turned over too many times. On the wall, a faint outline—part glyph, part tree, part open mouth—glowed with wet light.

Another voice behind him, this one calm and clear as cut ice, said: “Then we have only three moons left.”

“Three?”

“She lit the branch,” the ice-voice said. “That means the Hollow is bleeding. The sprite has touched the edge.”

The bald man shivered. “So the songs are true.”

“Some,” said the other. “Some are bait.”

The glyph pulsed once. Then again. Then faded.

“Tell the Order,” the voice said. “The Greenfire is rising.”

And far above them, in the quiet sky over the Hollow, a single leaf fell—out of season, against the wind, glowing faintly.

Elmira watched it land beside her foot. She picked it up, and it did not crumble.

It sang.

The song was so faint it could have been imagined, but Elmira knew better. It curled up from the veins of the leaf like threads of memory unraveling, and for a moment she was no longer standing in the Hollow. She was somewhere else—somewhen else—on a ridge where the trees burned with autumn though the air was winter-cold, surrounded by shapes that stood too still to be human. One figure turned, its eyes hollow, its skin carved from petrified ash.

Then she blinked, and it was just a leaf again. Just her, the quiet forest, and Thiln’s face twisted in a way she had never seen—fear and awe, mixed like oil and fire.

“Put it down,” he said quietly. “That leaf was not meant for you.”

“But it came to me.”

“All the more reason to be wary. The forest does not make choices lightly.”

She hesitated, but tucked the leaf into the woven reed pouch that dangled from her belt anyway. Thiln winced.

“That leaf belonged to the last Warden of the Crown. You cannot wear its weight without waking its memory.”

“I didn’t ask for it,” she muttered. “It came to me.”

“And that is worse.”

Far away in the town of Wensgrove, Arlyn dreamt of vines. They crawled from the cracks between her floorboards, writhing in slow, deliberate coils. Her bed lifted with them, tilting as the wooden arms reached for the ceiling. In her dream, the vines whispered her name—each syllable drawn out like a root curling through stone.

When she awoke, her arms were covered in dirt.

She sat bolt upright, brushing soil from her sheets. Her heart thundered. For a long moment, she said nothing. Then she climbed out of bed and pulled Gran’s book from its hiding place under the loose floor plank. It fell open—on its own—to the page she'd read the day before.

“When the root takes hold in flesh, and the veil thins, seek the Crown or be devoured.”

She traced the inked glyph beneath it—a spiral of thorns inside a circle. It looked disturbingly like the pattern her teacup had made.

Downstairs, the morning was soft and grey. Gereth had already left for the tannery, and the hearth smoldered low with last night’s coal. Arlyn slipped on her boots, slung a satchel over her shoulder, and stepped into the mist.

The road to the forest was not one she took often. It wound behind the orchard, through Old Mern’s goat pasture, and disappeared under a low arch of ivy. Gran had once told her the woods beyond weren’t natural. They shifted. Moved.

But Gran had also told her the sprites had vanished long before Arlyn was born.

Yet here she was, walking toward where the trees grew oldest, where her pul
