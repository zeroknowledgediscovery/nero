Whispers of the Wandering Wood
Chapter One: The Glimmer in the Bramble

The Bramblewood was older than the bones of the mountains that loomed behind it. Its trees gnarled and twisted like the thoughts of dreaming gods, their roots threading deep into a soil thick with stories never told aloud. Sunlight never dared to fully pierce the canopy, instead spilling through in fractured beams, soft as sighs. The forest breathed. It remembered.

And somewhere in its forgotten folds, a pixie named Nettle spun magic like a spider weaves silk.

She was not large, even by pixie standards, no taller than a sprig of lavender in bloom. Her wings, veined like frost on a windowpane, shimmered with colors that changed depending on the hour — at dawn, pink; at dusk, a bruised violet. Nettle’s eyes were too large for her face, giving her an expression that seemed forever on the edge of knowing too much. Her hair, a wind-tangled riot of moss and black curls, always smelled faintly of flint and rain.

Most pixies were capable of a trick or two — a glimmer to mislead, a whisper to misplace a hunter’s path. But Nettle? Nettle once turned a falling star into a lantern, just to light the inside of her tree-stump cottage for tea. Magic loved her, clung to her, circled her like moths to a flame that never burned. She was, as the older fae whispered behind the leaves, touched.

And as with all touched things, she was a little... odd.

Nettle’s cottage was hidden in the heart of a hollow oak. The door, a slab of beetle-polished bark, opened to a cozy room lined with shelves that hummed. Not metaphorically — they hummed, the spellbooks too saturated with old enchantments to stay quiet. The walls were covered in a hundred clocks, none of which told the right time but all of which chimed in peculiar unison when the mood struck them. Potions bubbled of their own accord, and the fireplace roared when someone told a particularly scandalous secret.

On this particular morning, which may or may not have been a Tuesday, Nettle stood before her cauldron and frowned.

“Too much ashroot,” she muttered. “Or not enough lieberry. Depends on whether I want it to fly or explode.”

“Perhaps both?” a voice offered helpfully.

Nettle turned to see a raven — or something dressed like one — perched on her window ledge. It wore a hat, which was the first clue that it wasn’t entirely of the bird persuasion.

“Grack,” she said. “You again.”

“Don’t sound so delighted. I brought news.” The raven-creature preened its feathers, which were in fact smoke made solid.

Nettle’s brow arched. “What kind of news?”

“The kind that crawls through roots and shivers through leaves. Something is stirring in the deepwood. Something old.”

She paused, stirring her potion counterclockwise, then clockwise again, then backwards in time. “Old things stir all the time. The Deepwood’s practically a retirement home for ancient evils.”

“Not like this,” Grack replied. “This one’s waking up with purpose.”

There was a long silence. The potion thickened. A single bubble rose, popped, and from it escaped a tiny sound like a trumpet playing a dirge.

Finally, Nettle sighed. “Fine. I’ll have a look.”

The journey to the Deepwood’s heart was not one taken lightly. Even for those born of magic, it was a place where reality folded like paper and secrets took shape in the fog. Nettle packed carefully: a pouch of truths (distilled, not fermented), a bottle of moonlight, a dagger carved from regret, and a biscuit.

The biscuit was for morale.

She flew low, darting between roots and hollows, careful not to disturb the sleeping stones. The deeper she went, the quieter the world became, as though even sound was wary of trespassing.

Then she heard it — not a noise exactly, but the absence of noise. A silence so absolute it had weight.

And in that silence stood a tree.

It was black. Not charred, not dark — black, like the color had been siphoned from every other thing and poured into this shape. It pulsed faintly, as though breathing. At its base, half-swallowed by moss, was a door. Not bark, not wood — stone, old and carved with sigils that curled and shifted when she tried to read them.

“Grack,” she whispered.

He was already beside her. “Told you.”

“This tree shouldn’t be here.”

“It wasn’t. Until it was.”

Nettle circled the door warily. “Do you think it’s a prison?”

Grack didn’t answer immediately. “If it is, something’s already loose.”

Back in the village of Thistledown Hollow, gossip fluttered like moths in the twilight. The elder pixies had noticed the signs: mushrooms blooming upside down, rivers running in loops, shadows refusing to match their owners. And all of it pointed to one conclusion — the Seal was weakening.

The Seal, according to fae lore, was forged in the First Silence — a time before song, before magic. It kept Hollowroot asleep.

And Hollowroot, in turn, had teeth.

Nettle returned home shaken. Not afraid, exactly. She didn’t really do fear the same way others did. But the air tasted different. Things long dead were whispering again.

The next day, she received a visitor.

He arrived on the back of a dragonfly the size of a sheep, wearing robes that sparkled like dew on a spiderweb. His name was Finloe, and he was from the Crystal Archive — a place where magic was studied, classified, and occasionally argued with.

“I’ve heard about your talents,” he said without preamble. “We need your help.”

Nettle gave him tea. “Flattery tastes better with honey. What do you want?”

“There’s a disturbance in the ley-lines. Something big. Your name keeps showing up in the readings.”

“Sounds like your problem.”

Finloe leaned forward. “It will be everyone’s problem if this breaks through. We believe it’s looking for a vessel. A source. A... host.”

“Then it’s foolish,” Nettle replied, sipping. “The woods will eat it.”

Finloe didn’t blink. “Or it will eat the woods.”

That night, Nettle stood on her roof and stared at the stars. They seemed farther away than usual. Her fingers itched with power — not her own, but something older. Something reaching.

She whispered a word she hadn’t spoken in centuries. The ground responded.

And far below the roots and rock, the thing in the tree stirred.

It had remembered her name.

Nettle didn’t sleep that night.

Sleep, for a pixie of her nature, was never just rest — it was wandering through dreamthreads spun by the Forestmind itself, tangling into visions of possible futures and impossible pasts. But that night, every time she tried to drift, she found herself falling into a great black root that spiraled down and down with no end. Faces peered out of the bark, eyes like melted gold, mouths whispering secrets too old to belong to this world. She would jerk awake each time just as the root split open like a mouth to swallow her whole.

So instead, she paced.

The floorboards creaked not from age, but from mild irritation. They didn’t like being walked on in circles, and she could hear them muttering under their breath. Even her cauldron had gone quiet, its usual happy burbling reduced to a low simmer, as if it too sensed something coiled in the dark.

When the first rays of dawn smudged the horizon like charcoal across damp paper, Nettle stopped in front of her window and opened the shutters. The air outside had changed again. Everything was too still. Even the breeze seemed to be holding its breath.

A knock came at her door, light but deliberate. Three taps, a pause, then two more. She frowned. That was the rhythm of the Old Compact, a call-and-response from the first treaties between the fae and the deeper wilds.

She opened it.

A figure stood on her threshold. Not tall, not short — it was the kind of shape your eyes forgot the moment you looked away. It wore a robe stitched from shadow and fog, its face hidden beneath a hood that seemed to drink the light around it. But Nettle knew who — or rather what — it was.

“The Hollowbound,” she murmured, narrowing her eyes. “You're not meant to leave the Rootstone.”

The creature tilted its head. “Neither are you.”

“I never swore an oath.”

“You were born under the First Tree’s shadow. That is oath enough.”

Nettle didn’t invite it in. That would have been unwise. Instead, she stepped out onto the moss-carpeted path and pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders. “Why are you here?”

“The bindings are fraying,” the Hollowbound said in a voice like wind through dead leaves. “Something is calling from the other side. Something that remembers the taste of stars and the songs of fire. We came to warn you.”

“I already saw the black tree.”

“It is not a tree. It is a seed.”

Nettle felt her stomach tighten. “What does it want?”

“Not what. Who.”

They stared at one another for a long moment. Behind her, inside her cottage, the humming from her books began to rise, uneasy and discordant.

“Why me?” she asked at last, though a part of her already knew.

“Because you are the only one foolish enough to touch what should remain untouched. And strong enough to survive it.”

With that, the Hollowbound turned and vanished, melting into the morning mist like ink into water.

By midday, the glade behind her cottage had grown cold despite the sunlight. Nettle stood ankle-deep in spell circles etched into the earth, each carved with precision and sealed with drops of her own blood. Around her floated relics she hadn’t touched in decades — an obsidian comb from the Dusk Court, a bone flute given by a dream-eater, a ring that once belonged to her sister before she’d vanished into the mirror realm. All anchors. All dangerous.

She was preparing for something she didn’t yet understand, but her instincts — older than her bones, older than her name — told her it was necessary.

The air vibrated.

A tear opened above the sigils. Not torn fabric, not light — more like the concept of place had been briefly removed from that spot. Through it, she glimpsed teeth. Not sharp. Wide. Endless. A smile without joy. A mouth without
