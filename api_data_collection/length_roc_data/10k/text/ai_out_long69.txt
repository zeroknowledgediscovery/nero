Title: The Echo in the Alley

Chapter One: The Shriek in the Fog

The fog had rolled in so thick over Milltown that morning, it looked like the sky had come down for a nap on the pavement. Dull yellow light from the streetlamps cut through the haze in sad, cone-shaped beams, and the sound of car tires hissing on wet asphalt echoed off the rows of narrow brick houses. In the alley between Cromer’s Bakery and the back of Everett’s Pawn, a man crouched behind a stack of wooden crates, nursing a cigarette with a shaky hand.

He hadn't meant to scare anyone. God, no. It was just that he hadn't had a proper bed in weeks, and the alley was as good a place as any to stay out of the wind. But then the girl—couldn’t have been more than seven or eight—came skipping down the alley like it belonged to her. Probably taking a shortcut on her way to school, humming some nonsense song about ladybugs and rain boots, her red coat flapping behind her like a cape.

The man tried to back away, tried to disappear further into the shadows, but his knee hit the crate. It scraped loudly against the wall, startling the pigeons perched above. The girl turned, wide-eyed, and saw him. For half a second they just stared at each other. His mouth opened to say something—“Sorry,” maybe, or “Don’t be afraid”—but all that came out was a raw cough, guttural and dry. She screamed. High and sharp. The kind of scream that makes dogs bark and grown men flinch.

Then she was gone.

Boots thudding against the alley stones, her shriek still echoing down the block. The man stood slowly, cigarette forgotten on the ground. He cursed under his breath and wiped his sleeve across his mouth. The back of his hand trembled. It had begun.

Her name was Clara Hemsworth, and the scream echoed in her bones for the rest of the day. Even when Mrs. O’Donnell asked her to recite the times tables, Clara couldn’t concentrate. The man’s face kept appearing behind her closed eyes—gaunt, dirt-smudged, something haunted behind his dark eyes. Her classmates giggled when she got “seven times eight” wrong, and she didn’t even care.

After school, her mother noticed the silence.

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost, honey.”

Clara didn’t answer. She stirred her mashed potatoes in slow circles, not eating. Her younger brother Max kicked the table leg and said, “Maybe she did see one. She’s always walking alone.”

Her mother gave Max the look, then turned back to Clara. “Did something happen on the way to school?”

Clara hesitated. “There was a man. In the alley behind Cromer’s. He scared me.”

Her mother’s expression tightened. “What do you mean, scared you? Did he touch you?”

“No,” Clara said quickly. “Just... he was there. Hiding. I think.”

They called the police.

Detective Eloise Marron didn’t like small-town politics, and Milltown was full of them. Her boss, Chief Granger, already had his ideas. “Probably one of those vagrants from the bus depot. Sleeping it off in a crate. We’ll send a cruiser by in the morning.”

But Eloise had seen the girl. Clara had the stillness of someone who had touched something wrong in the world. It wasn’t just a kid spooked by shadows. She pulled up her coat collar and decided to walk the alley herself.

The crates were there, just as described, but shifted slightly. Someone had definitely hidden behind them. Eloise knelt, found the butt of a cigarette, smudged lipstick on the filter. Not the sort of thing a homeless man might leave behind. Curious.

“Detective?” It was Officer Brant, coming up behind her. “Got something.”

She followed him around the back of the bakery. Behind a trash bin, hidden under a torn tarp, they found a box of notebooks. Not new ones—handwritten journals. Stained, weather-worn. Names, places, dates. One of them had a name that made her stop cold.

R.E. Varin.

A name she hadn't heard in years. A name that didn’t belong in Milltown.

Clara dreamed of the alley that night. In her dream, the fog came alive and wrapped around her legs like vines, whispering her name in voices that didn’t belong to anyone. The man was there, only he wasn’t hiding anymore. He stood tall, coat fluttering even though there was no wind, and in his hand was a silver locket. Clara recognized it. It had belonged to her grandmother.

She woke up gasping, clutching the blankets to her chest.

Two weeks passed. The alley incident began to fade from town gossip. Clara stopped flinching at loud sounds. Her mother stopped checking the locks twice a night. But Detective Marron hadn’t let go.

The journals were full of references to an event called “The Convergence.” Scribbled diagrams of star positions, strange glyphs, and repeated mentions of “the Echo.” Eloise sent photos of a few pages to a friend in Boston who worked at Miskatonic University’s archives. The response was blunt: These look like pieces of a suppressed monograph from the 1940s. A cultist text, possibly forged.

“Forged or not,” Eloise muttered to herself, staring at a drawing of a crooked alley almost identical to the one behind Cromer’s, “someone put a lot of effort into planting this.”

Three days before the summer solstice, a boy named Jonas Mirk vanished on his way home from baseball practice. His cap was found in the same alley. Clara heard the news and threw up in the bathroom before school.

That night, she heard whispering outside her window.

The man’s name was Rellan Varin, though he hadn’t heard it spoken in years. Not aloud. Not since the flames at Black Hollow, not since the Order had fallen. He had come to Milltown because something had started stirring again. Something old. The girl—Clara—had seen him, yes, but more importantly, she had heard it too. The Echo.

He didn’t want to involve a child. That part still made his skin crawl. But he had no choice. The Echo wasn’t a sound—it was a memory trying to come back, and Clara was at the center of it. She had the bloodline.

Rellan watched the town from the shadows. Something was waking. It would begin again.

Eloise had her first conversation with Clara two days after Jonas vanished. The child looked older than she had weeks ago. When Eloise asked about the alley, about the man, Clara said something strange.

“I think he’s trying to help.”

“Help you how?”

Clara shook her head. “He’s looking for the voice. The one that sings without a mouth.”

Eloise blinked. “Who told you that?”

Clara pointed to her temple. “It’s in my head. And it’s in his too. But his is cracked.”

The night of the solstice, Milltown lost power. Every house. Every streetlamp. A sudden silence spread like a blanket. No wind. No frogs. Not even the hum of a fridge.

Clara stood in her front yard, barefoot, staring at the sky. It was clear above, moon like a white coin. From across the street, Eloise called to her.

“Clara? Go back inside, honey.”

But Clara didn’t move. She was humming again.

Behind her, shadows in the alley shifted. A shape stepped out.

Rellan.

He carried something under his arm—a leather-bound tome. The final piece of the ritual. The last record of what had been tried, and what had failed.

Eloise reached for her weapon, but the book began to glow. Not brightly, just a soft pulse like a heartbeat. Clara turned to Rellan.

“You found it.”

He nodded. “But I’m not the one meant to open it.”

Clara stepped forward.

Eloise didn’t lower her weapon. The hum coming off the book—it wasn’t just light, it was sound, deep and low, felt more than heard. Something primal in it made her molars ache. She stepped in front of Clara without even thinking.

“I don’t know who you are,” she said, voice firm despite the icy tingle in her fingertips, “but you’re not getting near her. Drop the book.”

Rellan didn’t flinch. He moved slowly, like someone used to keeping calm around dangerous animals. His eyes, hollow but focused, met hers. “I don’t want her harmed. The opposite, in fact. She’s the only one who can stop it.”

“Stop what?” Eloise kept her hand steady. The girl was still humming, soft and oddly harmonic now with the pulse from the book. “Clara, honey—step back. Come to me.”

But Clara stayed where she was. “I dreamed about this,” she said. Her voice was level, but her hands were trembling. “I was holding the sky in my hands and it was heavy, but it was mine. And he was there. Only it wasn’t really him.”

Eloise moved closer, slowly circling the man. She could see now that the book wasn’t just glowing—it was shifting. The cover writhed faintly, almost like breath passing beneath leather. The glyph on the front—a sharp triangle with nested circles—burned gold.

“This isn’t a dream,” Eloise muttered, mostly to herself. She wasn’t the type to believe in fairy tales, let alone prophecies or supernatural warnings. She’d seen too many overdoses and domestic calls to make space for mysticism. But none of that explained the book, or why it made her vision flicker at the edges when she looked directly at it.

Rellan raised his free hand. “I can explain. But not here. Not tonight. If we’re exposed too long, it will see us.”

“What will?” she asked, though the answer seemed to press against the back of her mind like a word on the tip of her tongue.

Rellan’s gaze drifted to the trees beyond the neighborhood. “The thing that remembers forgetting.”

Before Eloise could respond, Clara stumbled forward. Her knees buckled, and both Rellan and Eloise lunged at once, catching her between them. The moment their hands met, the pulse from the book surged into a flare, and the air warped with pressure.

They weren’t in the yard anymore.

It took Eloise a full thirty seconds before she could draw breath again. They were standing—no, floating—on a gray plain that stretched into horizonless fog. Beneath their feet was neither soil nor stone, but a shifting floor of fragmented reflections. The sky overhead was black, but pinpricked with red stars that pulsed like blinking eyes.

Clara was already upright, standing unafraid in the middle of it all. The humming had stopped.
