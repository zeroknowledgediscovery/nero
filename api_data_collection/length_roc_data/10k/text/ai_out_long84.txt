Chapter One: Double-Booked

It started with the sound of a spoon clinking against ceramic. Evan Mulroney, thirty-two, single by circumstance and occasional design, stirred honey into his coffee with the same distracted air he brought to most tasks. It was late afternoon in Chicago, the sun already sinking behind the apartment blocks, casting long, slanted shadows across the cluttered surface of his kitchen table—newspapers, unopened mail, a dying pothos plant he kept meaning to revive. His phone buzzed once. Then again. He picked it up, thumb hovering over the screen, brow furrowed.

Two texts.

Rachel: “Looking forward to tonight! 😊 Hope you like Vietnamese!”

Marissa: “Can’t wait for 7! Dress sharp, mister. 🍷”

Evan blinked. Re-read. Then said, quietly, “Shit.”

He had, in the blur of last week’s networking drinks, a conversation in a bookstore, and three too many late-night app scrolls, apparently scheduled two first dates—one with Rachel, the sharp-witted editor with dark eyes and an unhealthy obsession with true crime podcasts, and the other with Marissa, the free-spirited photographer who made everything sound like an adventure waiting to happen.

Same day. Same time. Different places.

He sat very still, processing. On the television, muted but still visually noisy, a commercial showed a smiling couple kissing over pasta. The irony was palpable.

Evan checked the time: 5:12 PM. Two hours until disaster. He could cancel one of them. That would be the rational thing to do. But he wasn’t rational; he was curious. Possibly bored. And, beneath that, maybe a little desperate not to miss out on either.

His best friend, Joel, picked up on the second ring.

“You absolute idiot,” Joel said after hearing the story.

“I’m not asking for judgment. I’m asking for strategy.”

“You want strategy for how to date two women at once, in the same city, on the same night?”

“I didn’t mean to.”

“That’s worse.”

“I didn’t not mean to,” Evan offered weakly.

Joel sighed. “Okay. Lay it out.”

Rachel had chosen Saigon Sisters, a cozy place in the West Loop known for its banh mi and low lighting. Marissa had picked The Violet Hour in Wicker Park, with its mixologist-chic cocktails and dramatic velvet curtains.

“Reservations at seven, both places,” Evan said. “I can push Rachel to 7:15. Maybe 7:30. She’s chill. I tell Marissa I’ll be ten minutes late. Hit her spot first, grab a drink, make an excuse, then Uber to Rachel. Dinner. Then circle back to Marissa for a ‘surprise dessert’ or something.”

“You’re asking for an aneurysm. What if one of them runs late?”

“I’ll adapt.”

“Evan, you once got confused by the two-exit bathroom at Ramen-San.”

“I’ve grown.”

“You’re going to end up alone and covered in chili oil.”

“Thanks for the vote of confidence.”

But Evan did it. Or at least, he tried.

7:04 PM – He walked into The Violet Hour in a gray blazer and dark jeans, running a hand through his hair like he hadn’t already done that thirty-seven times in the cab.

Marissa waved from a shadowy booth. She was luminous. Dressed in a retro polka-dot dress and wearing earrings shaped like tiny cameras. She handed him a drink without asking.

“I picked for you,” she said. “Figured you for a bourbon kind of guy.”

Evan smiled. “You figured right.”

They talked travel. She had stories of Moroccan train mishaps and Icelandic hitchhiking, and he managed to contribute anecdotes of his one brave trip to Montreal and a disastrous Airbnb experience involving a live ferret.

At 7:36 PM, he excused himself.

“I’ve got to—friend emergency,” he said, wincing. “Ten minutes, tops.”

Marissa raised an eyebrow. “Should I be worried?”

He kissed her cheek. “You’ll miss me.”

She laughed and took a sip of her drink. “I already do.”

Outside, he sprinted for an Uber and begged the driver for speed.

7:48 PM – He slid into the booth across from Rachel, breathless, apologetic.

“I’m so sorry. My boss called and—long story.”

Rachel, clad in a black turtleneck and gold earrings, looked amused more than annoyed.

“You’re lucky I like Vietnamese food too much to leave.”

Dinner was good. Really good. Rachel was smart, almost intimidatingly so, but never unkind. She spoke about her father’s political campaigns, about her love of autumn and ghost tours, about a novel she was secretly writing.

Evan’s mind was a spinning plate.

At 9:03 PM, with dessert menus approaching, he muttered something about having to walk his friend’s dog and dashed out again.

9:26 PM – Back at The Violet Hour.

Marissa was outside, waiting.

“You look like you wrestled a bear,” she said. “Was your friend on fire?”

He smiled sheepishly. “Chihuahua emergency. Don’t ask.”

She eyed him for a moment, then held out a paper bag. Inside was a still-warm cookie from a bakery down the street.

“I figured if you were lying, you might as well enjoy dessert anyway.”

Evan blinked.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “This night got away from me.”

Marissa shrugged. “It happens. Just don’t make it a habit.”

They sat on the curb, eating cookies, watching the last of the bars spill out onto the sidewalk.

He didn’t go home until midnight. Alone, full of sugar and guilt.

Chapter Two: Fractures and Echoes

Evan woke up the next morning with a gnawing pit in his stomach and a dozen unread messages. Two were from Rachel.

Rachel: “I had a great time. Would love to see you again.”

Rachel (later): “Actually, were you okay last night? You seemed… distracted. Hope all’s good.”

One from Marissa.

Marissa: “So. Want to tell me the real story now, or do we keep pretending you’re a part-time firefighter with a dog?”

He groaned, dragging a pillow over his head.

Later, after three cups of black coffee and an internal lecture that bordered on the Biblical, he decided honesty might not kill him. Not all at once, anyway.

He replied to both.

To Rachel: “You’re right. I was distracted. I messed up. Scheduled two dates, tried to be clever. Not proud. You deserve better.”

To Marissa: “Yeah… there wasn’t a dog. There was another date. And you were both too great for me to want to cancel. Also not proud. Sorry.”

He expected radio silence. Maybe a meme of a dumpster fire. What he didn’t expect were their responses.

Rachel: “That’s... unexpectedly honest. I’m not thrilled, but I’ve had worse. Still, not sure what to do with this.”

Marissa: “Damn. That’s gutsy. Stupid, but gutsy. Call me tomorrow.”

The next few days were strange. Evan floated through work, meetings blurring into emails, emails dissolving into Slack messages. He saw Joel for a drink.

“So what’s the fallout?”

“Minimal. For now.”

“Do you actually like them? Either of them?”

He hesitated. “I liked them both.”

“That’s not what I asked.”

Evan didn’t answer.

By the following week, things had changed.

Rachel invited him to an author panel at her publishing house. It was awkward at first, but she seemed willing to give him a second chance—under probation, as she called it.

Marissa, on the other hand, took him to a roller-skating party where he fell twice and earned a massive bruise but also a long, lingering kiss behind the DJ booth.

He was falling, and he was falling in two directions.

By character count, the story was just beginning.

Evan sat on the edge of his bed, shoes still on, tie loose around his neck like a remnant of a former self who had ambitions of control over the evening. His apartment, dimly lit by the streetlamps filtering through the blinds, felt both suffocating and oddly quiet after the chaos of the night. He could still taste the ginger-laced pork belly from Saigon Sisters and the smoke-kissed bourbon Marissa had handed him. And yet, despite the sensory trail lingering on his tongue and clothes, there was a hollowness that crept in—a dull awareness that something about the evening had shifted in him.

He had pulled it off. Technically. Neither woman had stormed off. No drinks were thrown, no dramatic reveals, no accidental meetings in the restroom. But the whole thing had cost him. He’d lied—indirectly, maybe, but lied nonetheless. Evan was a man of mild habits and lukewarm impulses, not some player juggling hearts. So why had he done it? Why had he let curiosity outpace decency?

He pulled out his phone and opened the Notes app, a strange ritual he’d started during the pandemic—a private therapy of sorts, where he jotted down thoughts too vague or embarrassing to text anyone. He typed:

“Double-booked dates. Both amazing. Felt like two parts of me fit into two different worlds. Is that normal or just cowardice?”

He stared at it. Deleted it. Then typed something else.

“They’re not interchangeable. I know that.”

The next morning, Evan woke to a sky smeared with clouds and the muffled sounds of the building’s old pipes coughing awake. His phone buzzed at 8:23 a.m.—far too early for social calls. He checked it, half-expecting a follow-up scolding or a curt “thanks, but no thanks.” Instead, it was a message from Joel.

Joel: “Brunch? You owe me a disaster debrief.”

Evan smiled faintly and replied: “Only if you buy the coffee.”

When he arrived at the corner diner, Joel was already halfway through a plate of eggs and toast, reading something on his tablet.

“You look like someone who broke both arms trying to hug a cactus,” Joel said as Evan slid into the booth.

“Thanks,” Evan muttered. “Appreciate the imagery.”

“So? What’s the damage report?”

Evan filled him in—every awkward pivot, every near miss, the full story of the night including Rachel’s late-night text and Marissa’s clever cookie gesture. Joel listened in silence, occasionally raising an eyebrow but mostly just nodding.

“You really like both of them,” Joel said once Evan had finished.

“Yeah,” Evan admitted. “But not the same way.”

“Explain.”

“It’s like…” Evan paused, collecting his thoughts. “Rachel’s like a sharp wind—you feel her before you see her. There’s this energy around her, this intelligence that makes me want to be sharper, funnier, more… real. But Marissa—she’
