Title: Gridiron & Grimoires
Chapter One: The Field and the Flame

Jaxson Wilder wasn’t used to sitting still. On the turf, he moved like smoke—slipping tackles, reading gaps, juking defenders like they were made of mist. Quarterback for the Chicago Cyclones, three-time MVP, cover of every sports magazine in North America. But on this chilly Tuesday morning, Jaxson sat alone in his high-rise penthouse, staring at a worn leather-bound book that didn’t belong in any locker room.

The title etched in crumbling gold letters read: The Veil Unseen: An Initiate’s Guide to Arcane Foundations. It had no author, no publisher, and he sure as hell hadn’t bought it. It had just… appeared. Dropped in his gym bag between a protein shaker and a pair of cleats, like some weird joke.

He’d tossed it aside at first. Then he’d tried to throw it out, but it kept showing back up. On his kitchen counter. His car seat. Even once on the field, during pregame warm-ups, tucked beneath a pylon.

Now, ten days later, he was flipping it open for the first time, though he didn’t know why.

“Chapter One: Energy is Memory,” he read aloud. The letters shimmered faintly, dancing like candlelight on the page. Jaxson blinked. “Okay. Nope.”

He snapped the book shut. It thudded with more weight than seemed natural. Heavy like a helmet filled with lead. He set it down.

Then it flipped open again.

“Nope,” Jaxson muttered again, backing away.

The pages turned on their own, stopping at a passage written in a jagged, ink-dark script: “Every world has a game. Magic is the game between the threads of reality. Learn its rules, and you may bend the score in your favor.”

Jaxson closed his eyes. Maybe it was all a symptom of his latest concussion. Or the stress of the Cyclones' playoff loss to the Raiders. Maybe he was cracking.

Then his phone buzzed.

Coach Braddock. He let it ring.

Then another buzz. Unknown Number. And a text: "You opened the book. Meet me at 18th and Wabash. Midnight. Bring nothing."

He stared.

And against every ounce of reason in his brain and body, Jaxson showed up.

The intersection at 18th and Wabash was dead at midnight, except for a single flickering gas lamp that hadn’t been part of Chicago’s infrastructure in at least a century. Jaxson parked his car a block away and walked in a hoodie, basketball shorts, and Nike slides. He looked ridiculous. He felt ridiculous.

Then a voice came from behind him.

“Wilder. You’re late.”

He turned fast. A woman stood in the middle of the intersection wearing what looked like a blacksmith’s apron over a leather trench coat. Her eyes glowed faintly violet in the gaslight. Jaxson instinctively took a step back.

“Uh—who are you?”

“Name’s Lira. I’m your sponsor.”

“My what?”

“You opened the book. That makes you a candidate. You were marked when you first touched it.” She nodded toward the star-shaped tattoo that had appeared on his left palm last week—he’d thought it was some new ink he drunkenly got in Miami. “That symbol binds you to the Veil. Which means now, you either learn how to wield it, or die from it.”

Jaxson looked around. “Is this a prank? Is this one of those TikTok cult things?”

Lira smiled grimly. “Sure. Let’s call it that. Come with me.”

She turned and walked straight into a brick wall—and vanished.

Jaxson stood dumbfounded. Then curiosity, the same trait that got him to watch game film for 11 hours straight and practice no-look shovel passes until his arms went numb, took over. He stepped toward the wall.

And fell through it.

The other side looked nothing like Chicago. More like an alleyway made of shifting glass and smoke. The air was warm and smelled like burnt cinnamon. Torches floated in midair.

Lira was already twenty feet ahead.

“Keep up,” she said. “This place doesn’t like hesitation.”

Jaxson jogged to catch up, the sound of his slides echoing awkwardly in the shimmering alley. “Okay, so… magic’s real?”

“As real as gravity. Just harder to measure.”

“And the book?”

“It chooses people who’ve already touched the edge. Sometimes athletes, sometimes artists, sometimes lunatics. You—you’re borderline.”

“Gee, thanks.”

They stopped in front of a wooden door carved with hundreds of runes. Lira tapped it twice. It melted into fog, revealing a spiraling staircase lit by floating blue orbs.

“Training begins now,” she said.

Jaxson hesitated. “I have practice tomorrow. Interviews. Press junkets—”

Lira raised an eyebrow. “You can go back. Try to pretend the Veil isn’t real. You’ll start seeing things. Shadows in your peripheral vision. Voices in hotel mirrors. By then, it’ll be too late. You either step forward now, or you’re out.”

He looked down at his marked palm. The star pulsed faintly.

“…Screw it.”

He walked through.

The first week was the worst.

Jaxson had thought two-a-days in August heat were brutal, but learning to control the threads of the Veil made that look like recess. Spells weren’t cast with wands—they were woven, with intention, memory, and emotion. He had to relive his most intense moments—wins, losses, betrayals—and twist those memories into sigils.

He failed. Repeatedly.

During a weaving trial, he accidentally summoned a storm of flaming footballs that smashed half the training room. During focus training, he slipped into a trance and started reciting Cyclones plays from 2022 until he passed out. The instructors—beings cloaked in shifting ink and static—barely tolerated him.

But Lira didn’t give up on him.

She trained him late into the night, using methods that blurred the line between coaching and torment. She made him recall the exact moment he fumbled the championship ball in 2023. Then channel that shame into a binding rune.

“You’re trying to brute force it,” she said once, shoving his shoulder as he failed another thread pull. “This isn’t the field. You can’t overpower it.”

“What if that’s all I know how to do?” he snapped.

“Then learn something else.”

He hated her. Then he respected her. Eventually, he trusted her.

By month two, he could split fire into fractals and shape them into moving images—he made one of the final touchdown he scored against the Falcons and cried watching it flicker.

By month three, he could bend light around himself and walk unseen through the training hall.

By month four, he returned to the NFL.

It was meant to be a cover. He needed the money, the status, the media presence. The Veil’s enemies were watching for people who stepped out of its order. Hiding in plain sight as a football god? Perfect.

Except the powers didn’t stay hidden.

During a game against Dallas, he felt the opposing quarterback shift—just slightly—the threads of reality. Not enough for fans to notice. But Jaxson did.

He wasn’t the only Veilborn in the league.

Back in the locker room, Jaxson confronted him.

Tyrell Moore. Giants’ golden boy. Rookie of the Year two seasons ago.

“I saw you twist the snap,” Jaxson whispered. “Right before halftime. That wasn’t just instinct.”

Tyrell didn’t deny it.

“You’re a threadweaver,” he said. “Didn’t think you’d wake up so fast.”

“How many of us are there?”

Tyrell just smirked. “Enough.”

Then he walked away.

And in that moment, Jaxson knew that the field was just another arena in a much older, stranger war.

And he wasn’t even close to ready.

Jaxson didn’t sleep that night.

After the confrontation with Tyrell Moore, the locker room had felt colder, more distant. Everything was too quiet. The hum of the fluorescent lights buzzed like interference in his ears, and every face around him blurred into an indistinct smear of smiles, chatter, and cleats clacking on the tiles. When he finally made it back to his condo, he tossed his duffel bag aside and paced until dawn, eyes tracing the skyline like it might hold answers.

Who else knew? How many more players—teammates, rivals—were like him? Magic in the league? What did that even mean? Had this been going on for years? Decades?

And what was Tyrell’s angle?

The next morning, he returned to the Hall of Threads—Lira’s term for the strange spiraling space hidden beneath Chicago, where the Veil flowed most openly. The entrance was tucked between a shuttered jazz club and a Lithuanian bakery, behind a metal door that never rusted and could only be opened by drawing a circle in the air with your breath.

Lira was already waiting inside, brewing something that smelled like tree sap and motor oil over a fireless stove. Her apron was smeared with crimson chalk and scorched thread remnants. When she saw him, she didn’t even greet him, just said, “You saw one.”

He nodded slowly, still shaken. “Tyrell Moore. Quarterback. He twisted the snap, made it jump the line. Clean as silk.”

“I warned you,” she said, pouring the thick black liquid into two cracked mugs. “The Veil’s been bleeding into sports for longer than you'd think. It’s a natural fit. Precision, emotion, instinct. The playing field’s practically a ritual circle.”

“Why doesn’t anyone stop it? Expose it?”

“You think anyone would believe a story like this? And even if they did, it’s not illegal. Not technically. The Veil isn’t governed by your laws—it’s older. And besides, most of the ones who use it don’t abuse it. They just… bend the odds.”

Jaxson took a sip. The drink burned like whiskey but left his tongue tasting of iron and pine. “But someone is abusing it. I can feel it. Something’s off.”

Lira didn’t speak for a long time. Then she leaned against the counter and folded her arms. “There’s a faction,” she said finally. “They call themselves the Second Signal. They believe the Veil should rule—not hide. They’ve infiltrated media, politics… even sports. Tyrell’s likely one of theirs.”

“So what happens now?”

“You train harder. You stop thinking like an athlete and start thinking like a mage. If you want to survive, Jaxson, you’ll have to do more than throw fireballs and weave light.”

He exhaled sharply and set the mug down.

“Fine. Let’s go again.”

That afternoon, Lira took him d
