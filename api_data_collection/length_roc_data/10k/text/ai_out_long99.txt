Chapter One: The Return of Ember

The sky above the eastern range was cloudless, the kind of pale, blue stretch that made the world seem wider than usual. A brittle wind combed the dried grass, making it hiss and whisper like it carried secrets from the valley below. Atop a bluff, where the land flattened into the open sweep of the Harper ranch, a lone horse appeared. Ember—chestnut and white-spotted, her mane tangled with burs—trotted nervously into view, reins trailing behind her like limp ribbons, saddle askew.

Mara Harper stood on the porch with a bucket in hand, her boots dusty from the morning’s work. She blinked once, twice, the breath snagging in her chest. Ember shouldn’t be alone. Her brother, Eli, had taken her out early that morning to scout the northern fence line. He wouldn’t have let her go unless something had gone wrong.

The horse clomped across the packed dirt yard, sides heaving, flanks flecked with sweat and burrs. One stirrup was broken. Mara dropped the bucket. The water sloshed, forgotten.

“Dad!” she shouted into the house. “Dad, Ember’s back!”

Inside, a chair scraped against wood. Benjamin Harper stepped out, his face pale beneath his weather-beaten skin. He didn’t ask questions. He just walked straight past his daughter and ran a hand down Ember’s neck, whispering softly to calm her. Then he pulled himself into the saddle despite the broken stirrup.

“Get the rifle and ride south,” he said without looking at Mara. “Find Joe. Bring him to the north ridge. Tell him Eli’s missing.”

Mara’s voice trembled. “You don’t think—?”

“Go.”

She did.

The sun was higher now, casting long bars of heat across the road as Mara galloped toward the Miller ranch. Joe Miller wasn’t family by blood, but he was as close to kin as the Harpers had. A friend of Eli’s since they were boys, Joe worked the neighboring land and rode like he was born in the saddle.

When she found him in the barnyard, elbow-deep in a tractor engine, Joe didn’t hesitate. He dropped the wrench and reached for his rifle.

“Let’s go,” he said. “Lead the way.”

The northern ridge was rough land, thick with scrub oak and rabbitbrush, the kind of place a man could vanish into without a trace. When they found Eli’s tracks, it was only because Benjamin knew every inch of that land—knew his son’s bootprint, even the way his horse moved when scared.

They found the first sign just below the ridge crest: scuffed earth, broken brush, and then—a dark stain in the dust. Blood. Not a lot, but enough.

Joe knelt beside it. “No sign of a body.”

Mara looked away, blinking fast. “That doesn’t mean—he could be hurt, hiding.”

Benjamin didn’t speak. He was staring at something else, just past the blood—a set of unfamiliar tracks. Boot prints, larger than Eli’s. And something else.

“Someone else was here,” he murmured. “And they were dragging something.”

They didn’t find Eli that day.

They searched until dark and returned with grim faces and silent mouths. Mara didn’t sleep that night. She sat on the porch, Ember tethered nearby, the horse’s quiet shifting the only sound besides the wind.

She knew something was wrong—something deeper than a simple accident. Her brother didn’t fall off horses. He didn’t run from fights. If he was gone, it wasn’t by choice.

The next morning, the sheriff came.

“Got a call from a trapper up near Tangle Creek,” he said, thumbing through a small notebook. “Said he saw a campfire two nights ago. Claimed someone was singing. Strange kind of song—said it wasn’t English. Maybe Slavic.”

Benjamin frowned. “That’s not Eli.”

“No, but he said the man wasn’t alone. Saw a younger fella tied up. Said he looked injured.”

Mara’s heart stopped.

The trail to Tangle Creek was overgrown and narrow, running along a snaking gorge filled with black water and mosquito hum. The further in they rode, the quieter the woods became—no birdsong, no wind. Just silence.

It was late afternoon when they found the camp.

A smoldering firepit. Bones—animal, mostly, though not all. Torn cloth. A tin plate with strange markings carved into the rim. And a smell—bitter, iron-rich, like old blood.

Joe kicked through the remains. “They were here. Not long ago.”

“Look,” Mara said.

Near a tree, tied to the bark with a strip of twisted leather, hung something small and terrible: Eli’s hat. The inside was soaked with blood.

The sheriff ordered a wider search. Rangers were called in. Dogs. Drones. Nothing turned up. Weeks passed. Then months.

Eli Harper became a name whispered in town like a ghost story. People said he'd run off. Others said he'd been taken by wolves. But Mara never stopped believing he was alive.

She started to dream—strange dreams of a forest thick with black trees and silver light, of voices calling her name in a tongue she didn’t understand. She began to hear things, too. Whispers, especially at dusk. Once, she found Ember standing at the barn door, eyes wide, snorting at nothing.

Then came the letter.

It arrived without a stamp. No return address. Just her name—“Mara Harper”—in thick, uneven handwriting.

Inside was a single sentence.

“Your brother is not dead, but the price for his life must be paid.”

And beneath it, drawn in black ink, the symbol she’d seen carved into the tin plate at the camp.

A circle. A line. And a single, staring eye.

Benjamin stared at the symbol for a long time before finally speaking. His voice was low, like it hurt him to use it. “I’ve seen this before,” he said, turning the page slightly, careful not to smudge the ink. “Not recently. Years ago. Up north, before we ever came to Harper Valley. There was a man—something off about him. Always kept to himself, never bought supplies, never traded stock. Claimed to be a healer, but folks whispered other things. He used to paint this same damn mark on the rocks by his shack. And one day, he just vanished.”

Mara glanced at Joe, hoping for disbelief in his eyes. But he looked grim. Thoughtful. “You saying this is the same man?”

Benjamin shook his head. “I’m saying whatever he was part of, it didn’t stay behind.”

They kept the letter hidden, even from the sheriff. Benjamin didn’t trust the law to understand. Joe agreed, for once more out of instinct than reason. The three of them began meeting in the old storm cellar behind the barn, a place no one ever went. Mara laid the letter on the center of the worktable each night, staring at the circle and the line and the eye as if the shape would rearrange itself into meaning.

That meaning came two weeks later, when the dreams started getting worse.

Mara saw a man standing on a stone outcrop beneath a sky with no stars. His eyes were covered by cloth, but he could still see her. He lifted his hands, palms upward, and spoke in a language that scraped like claws across her spine. Each time she woke, sweating, gasping, she remembered one word more than the night before. By the fourth night, she could say it out loud.

“Anzelim.”

Joe looked up sharply when she said it. “Say that again.”

“Anzelim.”

He grabbed a book from the corner—some dusty old tome on folk legends and frontier tales, one of the many things his grandfather left him. He flipped through the pages, muttering, until he stopped on a passage written in dense, cramped script.

“Here,” he said, pointing. “This is from some diary in the 1800s. A miner near Crag Hollow. He wrote about a ‘man in black robes who lives beyond the stone gate, whose name is Anzelim, the Price-Gatherer.’ Says he makes deals. Brings people back from death. For a cost.”

Benjamin’s voice was cold. “What kind of cost?”

Joe looked back at the book, then at Mara. “It doesn’t say.”

The next morning, they found the circle burned into the ground behind the barn. No fire, no signs of trespassing. Just scorched earth, and in the center, a single object.

Eli’s pocketknife.

The same one he carried everywhere. The same one that Benjamin had given him when he turned sixteen. The wooden handle was cracked. The blade was rusted and stained with something that didn’t look like mud.

That night, Mara made her decision.

She saddled Ember. Packed a bag. Took her brother’s knife and the letter. Left a note on the kitchen table, one that simply read: “I have to find him.”

She rode north, into the hills where the creek cut sharp between rock walls and the wind moved like breath through the pines. At first, she saw nothing unusual. No signs of camps, no footprints, no strange symbols. But the forest changed subtly as the day wore on. The light grew colder, more silver than gold. The air held the scent of ash and moss. The birds stopped singing.

By the time dusk fell, she found the clearing.

It was circular, perfectly so, rimmed with stones that were too smooth, too round to be natural. In the center, a slab of dark granite jutted from the ground, polished and cold. On it, the same symbol again—circle, line, eye—carved deep into its surface.

Mara stepped into the circle. The wind died. Everything fell still. For the first time, she heard her own heartbeat like a drum in her ears.

“I’m here,” she whispered. “I got your letter. You said he’s alive. Where is he?”

The shadows deepened. The trees seemed to lean inward. Then, a voice—not from any direction, but from everywhere at once.

“Will you pay the price?”

She turned, searching the clearing, hand on Eli’s knife. “What price?”

“A life for a life.”

“No,” she said quickly. “There has to be another way.”

Silence.

Then the voice again, slower this time.

“You have called. The debt has been acknowledged. He lives, but your place is now written.”

Mara took a step back. “What does that mean?”

There was no answer. The air in the clearing seemed to twist. The granite slab pulsed once, faintly, like a heartbeat. And then the world returned to normal—wind whispering, insects chirping, the light back to its natural hue.

The clearing was empty.

Mara left the forest with more questions than answers, but something had changed. She knew it e
