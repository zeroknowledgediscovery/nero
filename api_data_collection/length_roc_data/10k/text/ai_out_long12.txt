Title: Grease and Smoke

Chapter One: The Last Bolt

The wrench slipped with a metallic clang, scraping Jonah’s knuckle raw. He swore, low and bitter, then wiped the blood on his oil-stained jeans. The Chevy Caprice in front of him—black, sun-faded, and dented—was a lost cause, but he couldn’t give up. Not yet.

Jonah Grady had been a mechanic in the town of Ashwick for seventeen years. Long enough to watch the buildings peel and the people leave. Long enough to lose track of which rusted cars he’d fixed and which he’d buried under scrap. He ran "Grady’s Garage" alone since Pop passed. No customers today—just the wind rattling the tin roof and the ever-dripping coffee machine hissing in the background.

He sighed, looked at the cracked clock above the parts shelf—3:42 PM—and pushed the wrench back into the engine.

“Goddamn carb’s choked up,” he muttered. “Just like this town.”

From the corner of the garage came a sudden clatter.

He turned fast. “Hello?”

Silence.

Then: a slow crunch of gravel outside.

He stepped out, wiping his hands with a rag, squinting into the afternoon haze. A woman stood there, lean and taut like a tensioned wire. Leather jacket, dusty boots. A cigarette dangled from her fingers, unlit.

“You Grady?” she asked.

“Yeah. What’s it to you?”

She didn’t smile. “I need an engine rebuilt. Not fixed. Rebuilt. And I need it fast.”

Jonah studied her face. There was something sharp in her eyes, like she wasn’t used to asking for help.

“Depends what’s wrong with it,” he said.

She tossed him a set of keys. “You’ll see.”

The truck was parked two blocks down, she said. Left it idling, which was crazy, but he didn’t argue. As he walked, he turned the keys in his hand. The fob had no markings. Just plain black plastic. The kind of thing you got when you didn’t want anything traceable.

He found the truck—a battered, matte-gray Ford F-150. The engine was knocking like a death rattle. He shut it off and popped the hood.

Inside was a mess. But not just mechanical. There was something off—parts replaced with aftermarket pieces that didn’t belong. Wires that had been cut and rerouted. Jonah frowned. This wasn’t just a rebuild. It was a cover-up.

When he walked back to the garage, the woman was leaning against the wall, arms folded. Her eyes flicked toward him.

“Well?”

“This ain’t a job,” Jonah said. “It’s a goddamn jigsaw.”

“I’ll pay.”

“How much?”

She named a number. Jonah blinked.

“Cash?” he asked.

She nodded.

“What’s in it for you?”

She took a long time before answering. “Closure.”

Her name was Maeve. No last name, or if she had one, she wasn’t sharing. Said she was passing through. Said the truck belonged to her brother.

“Used to,” she added.

Jonah didn’t press.

That night, he stayed late in the garage, cigarette burning in the ashtray, fingers black with grease. He opened the truck’s engine wide, deeper than most mechanics would dare. He needed to understand what he was fixing—and why.

He found a small black box wired into the ignition system. Not standard. Not even close. Jonah had seen something like it years ago, when a Homeland Security van came in busted and they asked no questions. This was military-grade. Tracking, maybe. Remote kill switch.

He put it on the bench and stared at it.

Next morning, Maeve was there before he opened.

“You found it,” she said.

“You knew it was there?”

“I hoped.”

“You wanna explain?”

She leaned against the wall. Her face was paler than yesterday. Less guarded.

“My brother ran with people he shouldn’t have. Government folks. Off-the-books kinds. The truck... it’s a loose end.”

“Loose end they wanna tie up?”

“Something like that.”

Jonah felt his skin prickle. He wasn’t built for cloak-and-dagger. He built engines, fixed clutches, cussed at brakes. But the way Maeve looked at him—like he was the last thing standing between her and whatever hell was coming—he couldn’t say no.

He nodded toward the bench. “You want me to take it out?”

Maeve hesitated. Then nodded.

He started pulling the wires.

The men came on the third day.

Black Suburban. No plates. Three men in suits who didn’t introduce themselves.

Jonah met them outside, arms crossed.

“You Grady?”

“Who’s asking?”

“Where’s the truck?”

Jonah spat. “Sold it.”

The man in front smiled without humor. “That’s unfortunate.”

They didn’t search the garage. Just handed him a card with no name, no number. Just a red circle printed on the front.

“Call if you remember anything.”

After they left, Jonah found Maeve in the back, crouched behind an oil drum. Her hands were trembling.

“We need to finish this,” she said.

“We?” he said, but it came out weaker than he wanted.

By the fifth day, the truck’s engine was stripped and clean. Jonah had replaced everything suspect. The box was in a lead-lined crate under the floorboards. Maeve made calls in hushed tones, sometimes stepping outside, sometimes disappearing for hours.

She told him about her brother, Liam—brilliant, reckless, doomed. Recruited out of MIT. Worked on things he wasn’t allowed to talk about. When he tried to leave, they made sure he didn’t.

“They said it was a car crash,” she said.

“But it wasn’t?”

She shook her head. “I got this truck two days after the funeral. No note. Just keys in the mail. I know he left something in it. Something they want.”

Jonah looked at the half-assembled engine. “You think it’s in there?”

“Not anymore,” she said, and smiled. It was the first time she had.

On the seventh day, they ran.

The truck roared to life, smoother than it ever had. Jonah packed a duffel with tools, instinct more than thought. Maeve drove. The town faded behind them in the rearview mirror.

“You sure about this?” he asked.

“No,” she said.

But they didn’t turn back.

Somewhere in Arizona, they stopped at a rest stop. The desert stretched wide and mute. Jonah sat on the hood, watching the sun bleed into the mountains.

“You ever think about just... letting it go?” he asked.

Maeve didn’t answer. Just lit a cigarette.

He didn’t push.

Behind them, the truck clicked softly as it cooled. Inside the glovebox, beneath a false bottom, was a hard drive.

Jonah hadn’t asked what was on it. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.

But whatever it was, it had been worth killing for.

And now it was theirs.

Maeve didn’t sleep that night. Jonah could hear her pacing the garage floor above his small cot in the office, bootsteps soft and irregular. He lay in the darkness, staring at the ceiling fan wobbling slightly as it spun. The engine had been rebuilt, the black box removed, and the wires rerouted so clean it looked like factory work—but there was a weight in the air that hadn’t left with the suits.

At dawn, Jonah walked out into the soft gray light, mug of coffee clutched in one hand, and found her outside, sitting on the truck’s tailgate. Her cigarette had burned to the filter without being smoked. She stared at the road like it might carry an answer.

“You know,” Jonah said, sitting down next to her, “you keep looking at that road like it’s gonna tell you something.”

Maeve didn’t smile. She rarely did. “It might. Eventually.”

He took a sip, let the heat roll through him. “I don’t think they’re done. The suits. That box—whatever it is—it’s part of something bigger. You don’t put a government tracker in a truck unless you’re scared of what’s in it.”

“I’m not scared of them,” Maeve said quietly. “I’m scared of what they think I have. That’s the difference.”

Jonah looked at her sidelong. She wasn’t built like someone who spooked easy. There was an edge in her—like rebar wrapped in leather. But everyone had limits. Even metal bent if you hit it just right.

“You ever think about just leaving it? Throw the damn box into a lake and vanish.”

Her jaw tightened. “And let them keep whatever it is they buried? No.”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he reached into his coat and pulled out the small black box. It felt heavier than it should have, dense with something unspoken.

“You’re not telling me everything,” he said.

Maeve exhaled slowly. “Would you believe me if I said I didn’t know everything either?”

“Try me.”

She stared down the road again, and for a while, he thought she wouldn’t answer. Then:

“My brother used to talk about leverage. He said the only thing more powerful than a gun was proof. Not evidence—proof. The kind that makes the bastards sweat before they start to deny it.”

Jonah rolled the box between his palms. “So what’s in here? Proof?”

“Maybe. I think it’s just a key.”

“To what?”

She shook her head. “That’s what I need to find out.”

The silence stretched between them. Jonah glanced at the sky. The clouds hung low, bloated with the promise of rain.

“If you’re dragging me into something deep, Maeve,” he said, “I’d like to know how far the bottom is.”

Her eyes flicked toward him. “That’s the thing about the bottom, Grady. You don’t see it till you hit it.”

Later that morning, Jonah drove the truck out to an old service road that led nowhere. It was where he tested rebuilt engines—a forgotten loop of pavement surrounded by pine and silence. Maeve sat beside him, map unfolded on her lap, but her eyes weren’t on it.

He pushed the truck harder than usual, listening for every whine, every shudder. But it held together. The rebuild had worked. He hadn’t lost his touch.

After two laps, he pulled over and killed the engine. The silence came roaring in.

“I need to go to Denver,” Maeve said suddenly.

Jonah raised an eyebrow. “That’s six hours from here.”

“Five if you drive like a lunatic.”

He looked at her, then at the truck. “You think whatever’s in that box connects to Denver?”

She nodded. “My brother’s last call came from there. Burner phone. Thirty seconds of static, then a name.”

“What name?”

She hesitated. “Halvorsen.”

The name meant nothing to Jonah, but it obviously meant something to her. Her voice had dropped half an octave when she said it.

“You think this Halvorsen has answers?”

“I think he has secr
