Chapter One: The Swing

It started with the swing.

The sun beat down over the cracked blacktop of Meadowrun Elementary, gleaming off the silver chain links and the faded red seat that dangled, just slightly crooked, from the iron A-frame. The swing creaked with the wind, as if aware of its own status. The last swing. The only one not already occupied.

Jude got there first—or at least, he claimed he did.

“No way, I touched it first,” he said, his hand gripping one of the chains as if his life depended on it. He was wiry, all elbows and sharp knees, with a mop of black hair that looked like it hadn’t seen a comb in a week.

Toby, taller but softer, with freckles sprayed across his nose like confetti, stood his ground. “You saw me coming. I was running. It’s not fair if you just cut in like that.”

“Doesn’t matter,” Jude said. “You let go, I win.”

Toby narrowed his eyes. “You didn’t even want it until you saw I was going for it.”

Jude shrugged, shifting his weight and dragging the swing just enough to make it squeal. “Now I do. Too bad.”

A wind kicked up, bringing with it the scent of cut grass and sun-warmed mulch. From the other side of the playground, the jungle gym kids shouted something incomprehensible, their laughter sharp and distant like birds overhead.

“You’re such a jerk,” Toby muttered.

“And you’re too slow,” Jude replied, not unkindly.

Behind them, a teacher's whistle blew once—shrill and authoritative. Neither boy moved.

“You can’t just claim it every day,” Toby said. “That’s not how this works.”

“Oh yeah?” Jude turned, locking eyes with him. “Then let’s make it a game. Winner gets the swing for the rest of recess. Deal?”

“What kind of game?”

A pause. Jude’s grin was slow and calculated. “Race around the monkey bars, jump over the sandbox, touch the basketball pole, then back here. Fastest one wins.”

Toby considered. “You always win races.”

“Not always. You beat me last week.”

“Only ‘cause you tripped.”

“Still counts.” Jude held out his hand.

After a beat, Toby shook it.

They ran. And for a while, it was just the thrill of competition, legs pumping, hearts thudding, shoes pounding dirt and concrete. But it didn’t end with the race. That moment, in the heat of a June afternoon, ignited something that neither of them could see yet. Something that would stretch far beyond the swing set.

It would take them through summer, into secrets and shadows, into woods they weren’t supposed to enter, and down paths that adults never talked about.

But for now, it was just the swing.

Chapter Two: Rules and Rumors

Toby’s backyard was bigger than Jude’s, with a half-rotted treehouse they never used and a fence that leaned like it was tired of standing. That summer, they spent most afternoons there, lying on the grass, sipping melted cherry popsicles from plastic tubes, talking about the stuff no one else ever seemed to notice.

“Did you hear about the Vanishings?” Jude asked one day, midsummer.

Toby blinked. “What?”

“The Vanishings,” Jude said again, more slowly, as if that explained it. “My brother says three kids disappeared last year. Like, totally gone. No trace.”

“That’s just one of his stories.”

“No, seriously. One of them lived on Clover Lane. Two streets over.”

Toby hesitated. “If that’s true, why didn’t we hear about it before?”

Jude’s eyes lit up. “Because the adults keep it secret. They don’t want us to be scared. But I think—” he lowered his voice dramatically, “—I think it has something to do with the woods.”

The woods sat beyond the soccer field, a stretch of thick pines and moss-covered stones. Kids told stories about them all the time—about eyes in the dark, old ghosts, a creature called “Whistler” that no one had actually seen. It was the kind of place you dared someone else to go into but never went yourself.

“You’re just trying to freak me out,” Toby said.

Jude shrugged. “Maybe. But what if I’m right?”

That question sat between them for days.

And when Jude dared Toby to go with him—to sneak out late and go past the soccer field, into the edge of the trees—it was less about belief and more about curiosity. A dare. A test.

They met at midnight, flashlights in hand, pockets full of Oreos and walkie-talkies they barely knew how to use.

“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Toby whispered.

“Too late to back out now,” Jude grinned.

The woods were louder than expected. Not with animals—there were no birds, no frogs, not even the buzz of mosquitos. Just wind and leaves and the soft crack of twigs underfoot.

They didn’t get far the first night. Maybe twenty minutes in before Toby swore he saw something—someone—watching them from behind a fallen log. They ran all the way back to the edge of the field, breathless and pale.

But they didn’t stop going back.

Each night, they went a little deeper.

Chapter Three: The Door in the Hill

Three weeks later, they found the door.

It wasn’t like a normal door. It had no frame, no house or cabin around it. It was just… there. Embedded into the side of a mossy hill, a square of dark iron with a handle so rusted it looked like it would fall off at a touch.

“Holy crap,” Jude said, brushing dirt away. “This is like—like Narnia or something.”

Toby stared at it. “Should we open it?”

“I mean, obviously.”

But when they tried, the door didn’t budge. Locked. Or sealed.

For two nights, they returned with different tools—a crowbar, a wrench, even one of Jude’s mom’s metal knitting needles. Nothing worked. Then, on the third night, Toby touched it again and felt a vibration, low and humming, like the door had suddenly recognized him.

It clicked.

Jude looked at him. “You did that.”

“I didn’t—” Toby began, but then the door began to open.

Inside was darkness. Real darkness. The kind that didn’t just lack light but seemed to swallow it. Their flashlights flickered. The batteries weren’t dead, but the beams dimmed the moment they crossed the threshold.

Toby hesitated. “Maybe we shouldn’t.”

Jude had already stepped inside.

The air was cold. Too cold. The moment Toby followed, his breath fogged out in front of him.

The tunnel sloped down—dirt walls braced with rotting beams, ancient symbols scratched into the wood. The further they went, the more the walls shimmered, like something behind them was watching.

Then the whispering started.

It didn’t make sense—not at first. Just snatches of sound. A phrase here. A word. Names. Some they knew. Some they didn’t.

“Toby… Jude… come further…”

Chapter Four: The Broken Circle

What lay at the bottom of the tunnel was worse than either of them had imagined.

It was a chamber, round, with symbols drawn in salt or ash—lines intersecting, circles nested inside each other, broken by foot scuffs and years of disuse. In the center was something covered by a tarp.

Jude approached it.

“Don’t,” Toby said. “We should go.”

But Jude didn’t stop.

He pulled back the tarp and revealed a mirror. No frame. No backing. Just a sheet of glass—polished, but rippling slightly like water under glass.

In it, their reflections didn’t match.

Toby’s heart leapt. “That’s not us.”

Jude took a step back. In the mirror, his reflection smiled, though he did not.

“Okay, yeah, we’re leaving,” he said.

But behind them, the tunnel had changed. Where once there was a sloping dirt path, now stood a flat wall of stone.

No way back.

Jude won the race. Barely. By the time he slapped his hand against the steel pole at the edge of the basketball court and skidded to a stop beside the swing, he was panting, red-faced, his shirt stuck to his back. Toby came in seconds later, a step behind, and dropped to the dirt, breathing hard.

“That was cheating,” Toby managed between gasps.

“I won fair,” Jude said, not unkindly. “Don’t be a sore loser.”

Toby looked up at him, brushing gravel from his palms. “You cut the sandbox corner.”

“I jumped it. That was part of the rules.”

“You jumped into it,” Toby muttered, “then ran through the middle.”

Jude shrugged, already pulling himself into the swing. The chains groaned as his weight settled in. He kicked once, then again, gaining height with each pump of his legs. Toby watched him, still seated on the ground, and for a long moment neither spoke.

The bell rang in the distance, too far off to be urgent yet. The teachers gave them five-minute warnings before they corralled everyone back inside, and even then, they usually gave the stragglers some leeway. It was June. Everyone was checked out.

“You ever wonder why there’s only three swings?” Toby asked, finally standing and brushing dust from his shorts. “There’s like thirty kids here.”

Jude tilted his head, slowing the swing with his feet. “Budget cuts. Or some kid cracked their head open and their mom sued.”

“That’s grim.”

Jude grinned. “It’s what my brother says.”

“Your brother says a lot of stuff,” Toby replied, stepping beside the swing and giving it a push. Jude let it carry him.

“He’s not wrong. He told me last year about Mr. Sutton getting fired for sleeping in the janitor’s closet. No one believed him, but then Mr. Sutton was just gone one day.”

“Maybe he retired.”

“Retired with a bottle of scotch and a traffic cone pillow,” Jude said, and they both laughed.

That was the thing with Jude. Even when he lied—or exaggerated or made things up in that half-believing way of his—there was always some strange glint in his eye that made you want to believe him anyway. Not because it made sense, but because it made the world feel bigger.

Their laughter faded as the playground emptied out, one teacher at a time calling students into lines. Jude hopped off the swing, landing with a skid, and began walking with his hands in his pockets. Toby followed, not quite ready to let go of the summer smell in the air, the lingering warmth on the back of his neck.

“Next time,” Toby said, “I get the swing.”

Jude didn’t look back. “Only if you win.”

Toby grinned, already planning a route with fewer shortcuts.

That afternoon, the clouds rolled
