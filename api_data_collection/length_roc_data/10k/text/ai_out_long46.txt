Chapter One: Echoes in the Wind

The sun bled across the cracked horizon like a wound that never quite healed. Out in the middle of the high school track field in Cherry Falls, Colorado, the wind rustled the bleachers and tugged at the worn banners that still clung stubbornly to the fences: "State Champions 2002." Faded maroon and gold, the colors of another life.

Jace Weller stood at the edge of lane three, hands on his hips, chest heaving from a two-lap shuffle that bore only a passing resemblance to the gazelle-like sprints of his past. His knees ached. His lungs felt too tight in his chest, as if they were still trying to remember how to fill the space he once owned on this oval.

"Coach would’ve called that a brisk funeral march," he muttered to himself, spitting into the grass. He didn’t smile. The joke didn’t feel like it was his. Not anymore.

Behind him, the sound of an old pickup door creaking open cut the wind. He turned.

"You really gonna try and kill yourself out here again?" The voice was familiar, half-sarcastic and half-concerned. Drew Snyder walked toward him, ball cap low over his forehead, a six-pack clinking inside a plastic bag that swung at his side.

Jace laughed once, short and breathless. "Gotta die somewhere."

Drew shook his head, passing him a bottle. "You used to fly. Now you wheeze. Why come back here, man?"

That was the question, wasn’t it?

Jace Weller was thirty-eight, jobless, divorced, and living in his late father’s basement since his company laid him off eight months ago. Once, he had been the golden boy. 400-meter state record. Scholarship to the University of Texas. Brief flirtation with Olympic trials. And then—well. Torn hamstring in ‘08. A couple of bad decisions. One too many beers. No medals. No podiums. Just years bleeding together, like ink spilled across a ledger nobody would read.

He looked out over the track. It was overgrown at the edges, the rubber cracking like a sunburnt back. Ghosts ran here—versions of himself at seventeen, at twenty, at twenty-five. Their legs pumping, their eyes full of fire. He was always chasing them now. Never catching.

“I’m not here to relive it,” Jace lied. “Just trying to remember what it felt like.”

Drew gave a snort and sat down on the lowest bench of the bleachers. “Bullshit. You’re trying to bring it back.”

“Is that so wrong?”

“Only if you’re expecting a different ending.”

Back in the house—no, the basement, let’s not pretend—Jace stood shirtless in front of the mirror, fingers grazing the ragged white scar across his upper thigh. The result of his final competitive race. Nationals. 2008. It tore during the curve on the third leg. He fell face first, watched the rest of the heat blur past him from the cinder.

He used to dream about that exact moment. Still did, sometimes. The sound of his own grunt as he hit the ground. The silence afterward.

In the kitchen upstairs, his mother’s footsteps creaked the ceiling. The smell of boiled eggs and coffee drifted down like a judgment.

“Jace? You going to the store today? We need bread.”

“I’ll go,” he called back. He didn’t move.

The town hadn’t changed much. Cherry Falls was the kind of place people left, not the kind they came back to. Except Jace. He’d circled back like a lost dog, tail between legs. The people at the grocery store either didn’t recognize him or pretended not to.

All except Lacey.

“Weller.” Her voice cracked through the dusty silence of aisle three. He turned. She still wore her hair in a messy bun, but there were lines now around her mouth and eyes that hadn’t been there when she cheered from the sidelines, pompoms raised. “Didn’t expect to see you haunting these aisles.”

“Didn’t expect to be haunted,” he replied.

She raised an eyebrow. “Still dramatic. You coaching or just jogging around the old track for the hell of it?”

“Just… getting back into shape.”

“Shape of what?” she grinned. Then her eyes softened. “You okay, Jace?”

“No one asks that question if they really want the truth.”

“I do.”

He didn’t answer. She let the silence rest between them like a folded letter.

“Hey,” she said suddenly. “You know about the alumni invitational next month, right?”

He blinked. “The what?”

“They’re doing this big anniversary thing. Twenty-five years since the championship team. Little exhibition race. You should come. Hell, you should run. People would lose their minds.”

He laughed, genuinely this time. It came out dry and coughing. “Run?”

“Just a hundred meters. For fun. Nostalgia, y’know?”

“I haven’t sprinted a hundred in over a decade.”

“Then maybe it’s time.”

She walked off with a wink, the rustle of her grocery bags echoing behind her.

Back at home, Jace dug through the musty bins in the attic. His old spikes, long since rusted and yellowed with time, stared up at him like bones. His Texas track hoodie still smelled faintly of sweat and Gatorade and defeat.

He found his journal buried under a stack of high school trophies. It opened to a page from 2007:

"Keep pushing. There’s no glory in easy."

He slammed it shut. His hand trembled slightly.

Training was slow. Painful. His body resisted like a rusted engine coughing to life. Each morning he ran the straights, walked the curves. Pushups in the basement. Crunches. Ice baths that left his skin purple and his breath jagged.

Drew came by sometimes, watching from the bleachers, tossing sarcastic encouragement like pebbles.

“You really think you’re gonna win this thing?”

“I’m not trying to win.”

“Uh-huh.”

By week three, his form was coming back. Not like it was. Never like it was. But the rhythm returned. Knees lifting. Arms driving. The sound of feet on rubber was its own kind of heartbeat.

The night before the race, Jace stood in front of the mirror again, dressed in a replica of his old kit. It didn’t quite fit the same. His stomach wasn’t what it was, his shoulders broader with age and wear. But in the eyes—there was still something. A flicker.

His mother knocked gently on the doorframe.

“I washed your shoes,” she said.

“Thanks.”

She hesitated. “Don’t hurt yourself.”

“I won’t.”

“I just mean—don’t go chasing something that’s already gone.”

He nodded. But in his heart, he wasn’t sure she was right.

Race day. The stands were packed. Not like a college meet, but more than he expected. Faces from his past, aged and blurred. Coaches, old rivals, kids in jerseys too new to know his name. Lacey waved from the snack tent. Drew brought a folding chair and a cooler.

The sun was harsh and merciless. Lane four. His lane.

The other runners were former teammates, beer-bellied and laughing, but as the gun was raised, the air grew still. Something sacred, almost.

Crack.

He drove out of the blocks like memory. His legs screamed. His lungs tore. But for ten, maybe fifteen seconds, the world fell away. There was no past, no future—only the rush of wind in his ears and the taste of something sharp and clean.

He didn’t win. He came in third.

But as he crossed the line, Jace raised his arms anyway, laughing like someone who had remembered something vital at last.

And the crowd cheered—not for a comeback, not for a champion—but for a man who had run, not from something, but toward it.

Jace sat on the grass after the race, legs stretched out, sweat drenching the back of his shirt. His chest still heaved from the effort, though the pain had settled into something dull and oddly comforting. The sun was starting its slow descent over Cherry Falls, casting golden light across the field. His legs were jelly, but there was an ember burning in his chest—small, defiant, something that hadn’t stirred in years.

He stared at his hands, fingers trembling slightly as he traced a line of callus at the base of his palm. They used to wrap starting blocks with these hands, tie his laces with purpose, hold batons with the trust of teammates who believed in him without question. Back then, every ache was proof of progress, every drop of sweat an investment. Now the pain simply reminded him that he still had skin in the game, even if he didn’t quite know which game he was playing anymore.

Lacey wandered over and dropped beside him with two paper cups. “Gatorade, though I think it’s the powdered kind. Budget cuts,” she said, offering one.

He accepted it with a grunt of thanks, the drink lukewarm and overly sweet, but it tasted like high school and lost afternoons. She took a sip from her own cup and leaned back on her elbows, squinting toward the field.

“You looked... almost like you used to. There was this second, maybe halfway through, where I swear I forgot it was an alumni thing.”

Jace chuckled, the sound low and scratchy. “You flatter me.”

“No, I’m serious. For a heartbeat, I saw seventeen again. You running like hell, the crowd losing it. Just like old times.”

“Old times,” he echoed, looking toward the goalposts at the far end. “Feels like a movie I barely remember watching.”

Lacey didn’t say anything for a moment. The quiet between them was thicker now, tinged with something unsaid, something both heavy and familiar. She picked at the grass with her free hand, her fingers twitching.

“You know,” she said, finally, “you could stick around. Help coach the team. Kids could use someone who’s been through it.”

He shook his head. “I don’t think I’m what they need.”

“Don’t be so sure.”

A small group of kids was still hanging by the track, some of them replaying videos on their phones, laughing, pointing, mimicking exaggerated sprint poses. One boy, probably fifteen or sixteen, noticed Jace and lifted a hand.

“Hey, man! That was sick out there!”

Jace raised a hand in return, nodding.

Lacey smirked. “Seems like at least one of them disagrees.”

He finished the Gatorade, crumpling the cup in his hand. “I’m not sure what the hell I’m doing here, Lacey.”

“You ran. That’s something.”

She stood and brushed the grass off her jeans. Her eyes softened as she looked down at him. “You don’t have to know the desti
