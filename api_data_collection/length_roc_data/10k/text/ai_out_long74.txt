Title: The Grey Veil

Chapter One: The World in Ash

In the beginning, there was no color. Not in the trees, not in the sky, not in the eyes of the people who wandered the iron-grey cities of Aros. It was not that color had been taken—it had never existed. From birth, the citizens of this strange land knew only shades of slate, charcoal, fog, and bone. They were not unhappy, not exactly. After all, one cannot miss what one has never known.

Narell was a boy of seventeen when he first began to question the world’s emptiness. He lived in District IV of Yora, a city at the edge of the northern expanse. His father worked in the Alloy Mines, where smoke blurred the horizon into an indistinguishable smear. His mother cleaned lenses for the Assembly of Truth, the governing body that oversaw every corner of life—light, shadow, time, and order. They taught that color was a myth, a folly dreamed by ancients who once saw fire as more than heat, leaves as more than food. Such stories were quietly discouraged.

But Narell was different, always had been. He sketched with charcoal when he should have studied light equations. He asked his professors odd questions, like why the Assembly had a Department of Vision if everyone’s sight was the same. He received detentions for suggesting the sun might have once glowed something other than pale white. At night, under the flickering grey lamps of his quarters, he would stare at his skin and try to imagine what it might be—red, maybe? Gold?

One evening, Narell met a girl named Elline while exploring an abandoned sector outside the perimeter walls. She was crouched over a rusted console, pulling wires from a broken vision scanner, humming an irregular tune under her breath.

“Do you hear that?” Narell asked.

“Hear what?” She turned, her pale eyes appraising him with cautious amusement.

“That… you’re humming.”

“Old sound,” she replied. “Not from here.”

Narell crouched beside her, fascinated. “What are you doing out here?”

“Looking,” she said, pulling a small shard of broken glass from the ground. It shimmered slightly in the fading light. “For proof.”

“Proof of what?”

“Proof that they lie.”

From that night on, the two met in secret, exchanging whispers and fragments. Elline had been raised by a renegade cartographer named Jorn, who once mapped the edges of the known lands and returned with tales of light that broke into prisms and skies that changed hues. He was later detained by the Assembly and never seen again.

But he had left Elline a journal. In it were descriptions of a flower “so vibrant it hurts to look,” of a sea “that crashes with waves of endless blues and greens,” and of a place beyond the Fog Marches called the Iris Gate.

Elline’s mission, her purpose, was to find it.

And now, so was Narell’s.

Chapter Two: Beneath the Static Sky

Yora was not a forgiving city. Security Sentinels patrolled the streets with unblinking sensors, tuned not to colors, of course, but to heat signatures and emotional spikes. Emotion was considered a threat vector. Strong feelings were reported and logged.

To hide their growing intent, Narell and Elline had to feign indifference in public—eyes down, voices flat, hearts armored. But beneath the surface, they burned. They discovered more remnants—a broken data slate containing a fragment of a visual archive marked “RGB001,” an ancient piece of graffiti showing a hand holding what looked like fire, but different. An unnatural flare of brightness, as though the flame wanted to be more than white.

“Color,” Elline whispered. “This is it.”

“Can we… make it?” Narell asked.

She nodded, but there was doubt behind her certainty. “We’ll need to go past the Horizon Wall.”

“But that’s death.”

“Or freedom.”

They made plans.

One night, during a rare power lull, they slipped through the maintenance ducts beneath the old monorail lines, crossed Sector IX without detection, and reached the outskirts where the terrain grew wild and choked with vines and forgotten machinery. The world there was more broken, more… real.

It was in the forest beyond the factories that they met Grent, an old man with a mechanical eye and a voice like broken gravel. He wore layers of mismatched fabric and carried a boxy device on his back that hissed and whirred when he walked.

“You don’t look like Scavs,” he grunted when he saw them.

“We’re not,” Narell replied. “We’re looking for the Iris Gate.”

Grent’s eye clicked softly. “Fools.”

“Maybe,” Elline said. “But fools who still see something different.”

Grent spat. “You mean ‘feel,’ not see. You’ve no idea what color really is.”

“Teach us,” Narell said.

For the next few days, Grent became their guide, reluctantly. He spoke of the Resistance—scattered enclaves of those who claimed they had unlocked ancient devices that once showed the true spectrum. He told them of pigment, a word lost to textbooks and erased from lexicons. He showed them a photograph, the only one left from a world before the Assembly: a field of blooms, their petals faintly tinted in something… else.

“Only this survived. The rest was burned. Buried. Rewritten.”

“Why?” Narell asked.

“Because if you saw the truth,” Grent whispered, “you’d never return to chains.”

But danger lurked close. The Assembly was aware of increasing insurgent whispers. The Department of Vision had traced illegal neural stimulation signals to the outskirts. Patrols doubled. A bounty was placed on anyone in possession of pre-visual artifacts.

And still, they pressed on.

Chapter Three: The Edge of Knowing

Crossing the Fog Marches was madness. The terrain was alive with static clouds, electromist, and twisted roots that tangled minds and feet alike. Elline lost her left boot to a sink-creep, and Narell’s shoulder was grazed by a venom spike from one of the Assembly’s autonomous drones.

But they survived, thanks to Grent’s uncanny navigation and the protection of a device he called the “Veil Piercer”—a lens made of salvaged glass that filtered frequencies unknown to modern machines.

It was near the third day in the Marches that Narell first saw something.

Not quite a color, not fully. A shimmer. A flutter at the edge of vision. Like a ghost. He blinked rapidly, heart pounding.

“Did you—?”

Elline nodded. “Yes.”

Grent, ahead of them, muttered, “You’re cracking the Filter. Your minds are beginning to reject the conditioning.”

That night, they camped under a canopy of dead vines. Elline held his hand, her thumb brushing circles over his palm.

“What if it’s real?” she asked.

“What if it’s not?” he replied.

And then they kissed—an act illegal under Assembly Statute 9.7b—and the world shifted. For a split second, Narell saw a glow in her eyes, a pulse of something more.

It did not last.

But it was enough.

They found the Gate five days later. Or what was left of it. A ruined arch, overgrown with lichen and strange symbols. At the center, a disc of glass like an eye gazing upward, cracked but intact.

Grent stood before it, silent.

“This was once the Threshold,” he said. “You crossed here, you saw it all. Now? It’s closed. But maybe…”

Elline stepped forward. She placed her palm on the disc. It hummed.

Lines of light—different light—snaked out from the disc, wrapping around her arms, her face. Her mouth opened in shock, her eyes went wide.

“I see it,” she gasped. “I see—!”

Then she screamed.

And everything went black.

After their first meeting, Narell couldn't stop thinking about Elline. Her voice echoed in his ears like a song he had never heard before but somehow knew. In class, he failed to pay attention. The numbers and formulas of light refraction bored him now—meaningless abstractions when set beside the raw possibility of truth. If the Assembly had lied about color, what else had they hidden?

Narell took to wandering farther from his home under the guise of "field observation assignments," carrying a cracked lens he’d stolen from the maintenance wing of the Academy. When held just right, it seemed to bend light in a peculiar way. Not color—never that—but he imagined there was a warmth, a quality to the distortion that suggested more. He shared it with Elline during their second meeting beneath the bridgework near the Water Disposal ducts.

Elline had a way of listening that unnerved him—not with sympathy, but with focus, the kind that sliced through hesitation. “This isn’t just about proving the Assembly wrong,” she told him. “It’s about remembering. They took memory from our blood. That’s why no one questions. They don’t know what they’ve lost.”

“But how do we even start? If no one else sees—”

“They will. If we find the Gate. If we bring something back.”

Narell blinked. “Back?”

Her eyes narrowed. “You thought this was just about you and me?” Her laugh was sharp, but not unkind. “No, Narell. This is a revolution.”

That night, he returned home late. His mother was asleep, but his father was still in his chair, boots off, toes dirty from the ash in the mines. The man was always silent after work, as though the soot had filled not just his lungs but his thoughts. Narell sat across from him, staring at the dim overhead light swaying slightly from a draft.

“Did you ever believe,” Narell said quietly, “that the world could be different?”

His father didn’t move for a while. Then, in a voice dry from dust, he replied, “Different doesn’t put food in your bowl, boy.”

Narell didn’t press. But something about that answer made him feel like a window had opened slightly. Not much. But enough for a breeze.

In the weeks that followed, Narell and Elline deepened their search. They mapped hidden corners of the industrial quarter, dug through digital trash bins and bypassed old security keys. Most of what they found was corrupted beyond use—snippets of conversations, blurred images, audio files filled with static. But here and there were clues. Old schematic files labeled in a language neither of them fully understood, fragments of what looked like machinery tied
