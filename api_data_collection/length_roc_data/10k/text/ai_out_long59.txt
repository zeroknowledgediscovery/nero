Chapter One: The Red Letter Days

Rain needled the thin roof of the apartment like it wanted in. Each drip from the warped corner by the kitchen sink thudded into the dented pot below, the sound steady as a ticking clock—though perhaps more ominous. Jordan Keller sat cross-legged on the sagging couch, one hand tangled in his dark, unkempt curls, the other thumbing through a stack of envelopes. Most were unopened. All were bad news.

"Final Notice," screamed one. "Immediate Action Required," whispered another. A third had the red stripe of doom—overdue electricity bill.

It wasn’t just the bills. It was the way the apartment always felt a few degrees too cold. The way the fridge groaned when it cycled on, like even it didn’t want to keep going. The echo of silence where his partner’s voice used to be, before she’d packed her bags last May and left for Chicago, for something “more stable.”

Jordan exhaled, long and slow. “How the hell did I get here?”

Outside, the city continued its indifferent shuffle. San Amaro was never really quiet. Even at 2 a.m., car alarms, drunk laughter, and the occasional yell kept the air thick with life. But inside apartment 3B on 119 Garrison Street, it was just him and the debt.

He picked up his phone. No new messages. His inbox was a graveyard of unread rejections: “Thank you for your interest, but…” “At this time, we have decided…” “We’ll keep your résumé on file.”

He didn’t even remember what he'd applied for anymore. Coding gigs. Freelance writing. Pet-sitting. Anything.

He stood and padded barefoot across the cracked tile to the kitchenette. Half a loaf of bread. A jar of peanut butter that required serious commitment to scrape anything from. He made a sandwich with a dull butter knife and sat back down, chewing like it was a chore.

That’s when his phone buzzed.

Unknown number. He answered without thinking.

“Jordan Keller?”

“Yeah.”

“This is Lyle Roman. You don’t know me, but I knew your father.”

Jordan blinked. “My father died when I was ten.”

“I know. That’s why I’ve been looking for you.”

Jordan swallowed. “Who the hell are you?”

“I need to talk to you,” the voice said, clipped, urgent. “In person. Tomorrow, if you’re available.”

“I’m not,” Jordan said, almost out of reflex. “I mean—what is this about?”

A pause.

“Your father left something behind. Something people have killed for. And they might come looking for you next.”

The line went dead.

Jordan stared at the phone for a full thirty seconds, waiting for a punchline, another ring, something. When none came, he stood, phone in hand, and walked to the window.

Rain had slowed. Streetlights glared down like disapproving gods. A figure in a black coat stood across the street, unmoving, umbrella tilted just enough to obscure the face.

Jordan dropped the curtain.

The next morning, the coffee tasted like rust. He'd found a half-used tin at the back of the cupboard, next to a jar of something unlabelled and sticky. The streets below his apartment were steaming from the early heat. San Amaro did this—poured rain like regret and then burned the pavement dry like it wanted everyone to forget.

He didn’t forget.

The man on the phone—Lyle—had texted him an address: “10 a.m. Second floor. Ask for Rook.”

That was it.

Jordan had a strong sense this was the kind of message that ended with someone waking up in a tub of ice missing a kidney, but then again, he didn’t exactly have a lot of options.

The building was in the old district. Red brick, crumbling corners. A faded sign read “Peregrine & Sons—Antiques and Curios.” A bell tinkled as he stepped inside. The air smelled like dust and camphor.

A woman with half her hair shaved looked up from behind the counter. “You Jordan?”

He nodded.

“Upstairs. Door on the right.”

The stairs creaked. The hallway upstairs was lined with faded photographs: a man in uniform, a child with a kite, a family in front of a rusted train.

He knocked.

The door opened immediately. The man behind it looked like someone who had once been in shape and then spent a decade living off whiskey and regret. Eyes sharp. Shirt wrinkled. Lyle Roman.

“Come in,” he said. “Quickly.”

The room beyond was small, filled with shelves of books and dusty old relics—a globe with jagged lines scratched into it, a violin with no strings, a box filled with rusted keys.

Jordan sat.

“I’ll get to the point,” Lyle said. “Your father, Thomas Keller, wasn’t who you think he was. He worked with me. Not in finance like your mother told you. He was… let’s say, an independent historian. A retriever of things best left buried.”

Jordan almost laughed. “Are you telling me my dad was Indiana Jones?”

“Indiana Jones didn’t have half a dozen death warrants on his head,” Lyle said. “Listen. In 1997, your father stole something. Something powerful. He hid it. Then he died.”

“What kind of powerful?” Jordan asked.

“The kind people start wars over. The kind you don’t put in a museum.”

Lyle handed him a photograph. It showed a stone about the size of a grapefruit, dark, almost black, etched with spiraling runes that hurt to look at.

“That’s the Obsidian Dial,” Lyle said. “And we think your father left clues to its location. We think you’re the key.”

Jordan blinked. “I work at a grocery store when they call me in. I can’t pay my rent. I don’t have any... key.”

Lyle smiled, a tight, humorless thing. “You’ve got his blood. And that’s enough.”

By afternoon, Jordan was back in his apartment, staring at the photograph. The spiral pattern on the Dial made his stomach twist.

The first clue had been in a journal. Lyle had let him borrow it. His father’s handwriting—tight, aggressive—sprawled across the pages.

“Under the tower where the city forgets,” one note read. “Seek the mouth of silence.”

Beneath it, a sketched map. San Amaro's skyline, but drawn in reverse—mirrored.

Something buzzed in his mind. A memory.

A park he hadn’t been to in years. A crumbling old watchtower left over from the 1800s. People called it “the tower of forgetfulness” because no one knew why it was built, or by whom.

That night, Jordan walked there.

The tower loomed, rusted and skeletal. Vines strangled its base. The air was still.

He found the mouth.

An old iron grate half-buried in mud behind the tower. He lifted it.

Beneath was a tunnel.

And in the tunnel, footprints.

Fresh ones.

Jordan swallowed. “Guess I’m going in.”

And he did.

Not knowing the world was already watching.

Not knowing some of them wanted him dead.

Not knowing this was only the first chapter of the life his father died to keep hidden.

The tunnel swallowed light like a black mouth. Jordan’s phone flashlight flickered as he stepped down into the dark, the weak beam bouncing off walls of stone slick with condensation. The air grew colder, damp, heavy with the smell of rust and mildew. Each step down sounded too loud, like a challenge to the silence.

The tunnel was narrow, only wide enough for one person to walk comfortably. Roots clawed through the stone above like crooked fingers, reaching down as if curious. Jordan moved slowly, dragging his hand along the wall for balance. After about thirty feet, the tunnel widened into a chamber—circular, with walls lined in brickwork that looked older than the city itself. A rusted lantern hung from the ceiling, swinging ever so slightly, as if disturbed moments before he arrived.

Someone had been here.

There were footprints in the dirt, just as he’d seen from above. Two sets. One small, one much larger. He crouched and studied them. The smaller set veered toward the far wall where a series of ancient etchings had been carved into the stone. The larger prints circled the room, then disappeared toward a second tunnel, half-collapsed, with rubble scattered in front of it.

Jordan's heart thudded against his ribs. Every part of him screamed to turn back, to leave the mysterious messages and secret tunnels to people with less to lose. But that was the thing—he didn’t have anything left to lose. If this led to something real, something his father had died to protect, he couldn’t walk away now.

He approached the wall with the etchings. At first glance, they looked like gibberish. Swirls, circles, harsh jagged lines that intersected like broken compass needles. Then he noticed something: one of the symbols matched a drawing in his father's journal. The spiral. The same one that had been etched into the Obsidian Dial.

He pressed his fingers against it.

A grinding sound echoed through the chamber, loud and deep. The wall trembled. Dust rained down. Jordan stumbled back as a section of the brickwork receded and slid aside, revealing a hidden alcove about three feet deep. Inside was a wooden box wrapped in rotting cloth, bound with iron latches rusted shut.

He hesitated only a second before reaching in.

The box was heavier than it looked. As he lifted it out, the air in the room seemed to change—denser, colder. Like something ancient had stirred.

He didn’t open it.

Instead, he turned and retraced his steps, back through the tunnel, the box held tight against his chest. He emerged into the night, the rain just beginning again, soft and cold. The city hadn’t noticed his absence. The streetlamps still hummed. A taxi rolled by, indifferent.

Jordan got back to his apartment without incident, locked the door behind him, and placed the box on the kitchen table like it was a bomb. He sat across from it, breathing heavily, watching it like it might move on its own.

He didn’t know what he expected to find inside. Money, maybe. A map. Proof his father hadn’t gone mad in his final years. Something—anything—that made the last twenty-four hours make sense.

He fetched a screwdriver from the junk drawer and pried the latches open one at a time. The lid resisted. Then, with a reluctant groan, it opened.

Inside were several layers of oilcloth, brittle and yellowed. He peeled them back, revealing a notebook bound in dark leather and what looked l
