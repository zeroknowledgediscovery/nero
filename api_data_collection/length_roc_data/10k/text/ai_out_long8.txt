Chapter One: The Arrangement

The sun scorched the dusty horizon as Avery Malone kicked the side of her stalled pickup truck, the toe of her worn boot connecting with rusted metal. "Damn thing," she muttered, sweat clinging to her temple. She pulled her hat lower against the glare of the mid-June Texas sky. Her phone had one bar of signal and a battery that blinked red.

“Figures,” she grumbled, glancing up the road that stretched out like an old ribbon, knotted and crumbling at the edges. “Could’ve at least died closer to town.”

Behind her, in the bed of the truck, boxes of her late grandmother’s china clinked against each other with every gust of wind. She’d been hauling them from Lubbock to the family ranch outside of Alton, a town so small it barely had a stoplight and only made the weather map when something burned.

The whine of tires on gravel caught her ear. She turned, shielding her eyes.

A silver Chevy Silverado pulled to a stop, engine humming like a satisfied beast. Out stepped a man in a navy ball cap and jeans that looked like they’d seen more fence posts than fashion shows.

“You alright there?” he called out, a grin hitching at the corner of his mouth. He had a smooth, lazy drawl that somehow made the heat seem even thicker.

Avery hesitated. “I’ve been better.”

He walked closer, his boots crunching the grit. “Need a tow?”

“I need a miracle.”

That made him laugh—an easy sound, genuine. He offered a hand. “Eli Callahan.”

She shook it, firm grip, calluses against calluses. “Avery Malone.”

He blinked. “Malone as in Harlan Malone?”

“My granddad, yeah. Why?”

“Guess that makes you the girl who ran off to Dallas.”

“Woman,” she corrected. “And yeah, I suppose I am.”

“Well,” Eli said, tipping his hat back, “guess that makes us neighbors. Sorta.”

Eli towed her truck to his family’s garage, just past the feed store and across from a diner that hadn’t changed since 1975. Avery sat on the worn leather couch in the waiting room while Eli poked around under her hood.

“So what brings you back to Alton?” he asked, wiping his hands on a rag.

“My grandma passed. I’m handling her estate.”

“Sorry to hear that.”

“She raised me,” Avery said, then added quickly, “I’m not here long. Just enough to sell the house and take care of things.”

He nodded slowly. “You’ll be gone by Fourth of July, then?”

“That’s the plan.”

Eli paused. “You seeing anyone?”

Avery blinked. “Excuse me?”

“Just... I have a weird proposition.”

She laughed, but it sounded more like a scoff. “Wow. That’s subtle.”

“No, no, it’s not like that.” Eli raised his hands. “It’s just—my ma’s been on my case. Wants me to settle down, start a family. She thinks I’m hiding someone. Truth is, I’ve just been busy. But I told her I had someone.”

“You... lied to your mom?”

“Sorta.”

“And now you need a fake girlfriend.”

“Exactly.”

Avery stared. “You want me to pretend to date you?”

“Just through the Fourth. There’s this big town barbecue and dance. She’ll calm down if she sees me with someone. You’re leaving anyway—no strings.”

Avery leaned back. “You’re insane.”

“Probably. But I’ll fix your truck for free.”

That got her attention.

“And I’ll throw in gas money.”

She raised an eyebrow. “And?”

“I’ll help you clean out your grandma’s house.”

**

Avery didn’t say yes that day. But that night, as she stared at the ceiling fan spinning above her grandmother’s guest bed, she couldn’t get the deal out of her head.

It wasn’t like she had a lot going on in Dallas. A marketing job she hated, a shoebox apartment near a bar that never closed, and a string of dates that went nowhere. Maybe it would be easier to let the town think she’d found someone, just for a few weeks. Maybe it would be a way to get closure. Or distraction. Or something.

She texted him the next morning: Fine. But you owe me pie.

**

By the following Saturday, Alton was buzzing about the town’s favorite eligible bachelor being seen with the Malone girl. They sat close at the diner—too close, if you asked Martha Jean, who never liked Avery’s family to begin with.

Eli played the part well. He was charming, attentive. He’d pull her chair out and bring her iced tea without asking. He even held her hand walking down Main Street.

“Doesn’t it feel a little... fake?” Avery whispered one afternoon as they sat on the porch swing of her grandmother’s house, sipping sweet tea.

“It’s supposed to be,” Eli replied. “But you’re not a bad fake girlfriend.”

“And you’re not a terrible fake boyfriend.”

They shared a look. A beat too long.

Then Eli cleared his throat. “So, uh. My ma wants to meet you. For real.”

Avery groaned. “This wasn’t part of the deal.”

“Technically, it was.”

She sighed. “Fine. But if she tries to marry us off, I’m blaming you.”

**

Eli’s mother was a woman of soft curls, sharp eyes, and even sharper instincts. She watched Avery with the precision of a hawk eyeing a field mouse.

“So,” she said, over casserole and cornbread, “how’d you two meet?”

Eli started to speak, but Avery interrupted. “We ran into each other by accident. Literally. My truck broke down. He rescued me.”

“Sounds like a romance novel,” she said with a tight smile.

“More like a comedy of errors,” Avery replied.

“Well, I’m glad he found someone who’ll challenge him. He needs that.”

After dinner, Eli walked her to the porch. “You’re good under pressure.”

“Your mom scares me.”

“She scares everyone.”

They laughed. And then silence fell between them like a soft fog.

“You ever think about staying?” Eli asked quietly.

Avery shook her head. “This place was never really mine.”

“But it could be.”

She didn’t answer. Didn’t know how.

**

The days passed, the town grew more convinced, and Avery found herself slipping into the role too easily. She liked the way Eli looked at her, even when no one was watching. She liked how he remembered how she took her coffee. How he called her "Red" when she wore that old flannel shirt.

It started to feel real.

Too real.

And that scared her more than anything.

Because it wasn’t supposed to.

Because she knew she couldn’t stay.

Because eventually, one of them would have to say goodbye.

And she wasn’t sure her heart was ready for that.

Not again.

Avery should have known better than to open the old cedar chest in her grandmother’s attic. The air was thick with dust, and the fan upstairs spun like it had a grudge against gravity. She knelt beside the chest, coughing as she pried open the latch and found a stack of letters bundled with blue ribbon, their corners soft and yellow with age.

She wasn’t a sentimental type, but something about the cursive handwriting and the faint scent of lavender got to her. Each letter was addressed to her grandmother—Amelia Malone—from someone named J.T. The postmarks ranged from 1958 to 1963, all sent from a place in Oklahoma she didn’t recognize. She read the first letter aloud, half under her breath.

“My dearest Amelia, I saw the way you looked at me after the town picnic. I know it can’t be, not with our families the way they are, but I swear on everything good, if you asked me to leave it all behind, I would...”

Avery exhaled sharply. “Well damn, Grandma.”

She kept reading until her eyes blurred. Her grandmother had once been someone who loved fiercely. Someone who made sacrifices. Maybe even someone who lied to protect herself. And now Avery found herself doing the same. Only she wasn’t sure who she was protecting—Eli, her own heart, or the tidy version of herself she’d built back in Dallas.

Later that afternoon, she brought the box of letters downstairs and placed it on the kitchen table. She stared at it, sipping lukewarm coffee, trying not to think about how easily a life could go from passion to secrets to silence.

She wasn’t ready to pack the letters away yet.

**

The next morning, Avery found herself at the Callahan ranch, standing awkwardly in the doorway of Eli’s barn while he adjusted a halter on a young mare. The smell of hay, sweat, and leather hit her in the chest like a memory she didn’t have. He glanced up when he heard her boots on the packed earth.

“You look like you’re here to fire me,” he said, brushing his hands on his jeans.

“I’m here because I found a bunch of letters in my grandma’s attic. Love letters.”

“That sounds like a soap opera waiting to happen.”

She held out the one on top. “They’re from someone named J.T. Ever hear of him?”

Eli squinted at the paper. “J.T.? Could be J.T. Waverly. He used to run cattle over near Brazos Fork. Died a long while back. He and your granddad had a falling out in the sixties. Nobody really talks about why.”

“Well,” Avery said, “I think I found out why.”

Eli looked at her, serious now. “What are you gonna do with them?”

“Don’t know yet. But it makes me wonder what else I don’t know about this place.”

“People got layers,” he said. “Town like this don’t let you see them all at once.”

Avery studied him. “And how many layers do you have, Eli Callahan?”

He smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Enough to keep you guessing.”

That night, they attended the summer movie in the park, where a big white sheet hung between two pine trees and kids ran wild with glo-sticks while their parents laid out quilts and coolers. Eli brought popcorn in a paper sack and sat close enough that his knee brushed hers.

They watched Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and about halfway through, Avery leaned over and whispered, “If we’re faking this relationship, should I pretend to like Westerns?”

“You don’t like Westerns?” he said, scandalized.

“I think they’re all just sweaty men arguing over horses.”

“That’s the most disrespectful thing I’ve ever heard,” he said, grinning.

She leaned against his shoulder anyway.

When the movie ended, they walked under the string lights back to his truck. Eli stopped halfway and turned to face her.

“You’re not faking it right now,” he said softly.

She should have denied it. Should’ve laughed, made a joke. But she didn’t.

“No
