Title: A Bridge Between Seasons
Author: [Anonymous]

Chapter One: The Empty Frame

The rain came down in quiet spurts, not in angry sheets or violent torrents, just a half-hearted drizzle that seemed too tired to properly weep. Jonathan Hale stood on the porch of a house that no longer smelled like home. The keys in his hand were cold, unfamiliar, as though they belonged to another man entirely.

He’d been gone ten years. Not in prison, not in the military, not in some remote jungle chasing tigers. Just...gone. A sequence of missed birthdays, voicemails never returned, child support checks mailed from a thousand miles away, each signed with a generic “Take care, -J.”

The door creaked open, louder than it should have. Inside, the furniture was different. Sara’s touches were gone—the lavender candles, the quirky wind chimes, the watercolors of beaches they never visited. In their place were silence and function. A couch too utilitarian to invite lounging. A coffee table crowded with textbooks and unopened mail. Dust like a blanket.

He took three steps in, paused at the hall where the family photos used to hang. The wall was blank except for a single nail protruding like an accusation. A phantom outline marked the absence of a wooden frame.

"You're late," a voice said from the staircase.

Jonathan turned. His daughter, Elise, stood on the middle landing, half-draped in a cardigan too big for her shoulders. Seventeen now. She had her mother’s hair—dark, wild, untamable—but her gaze was all his: sharp, questioning, a little too observant for comfort.

"I said I'd be here by noon," he said, checking his watch unnecessarily. "It's ten past."

"I meant a decade late."

She disappeared up the stairs before he could reply.

Down the hall, a door closed softly. His son, Milo, fourteen and already taller than Jonathan remembered, hadn't said a word. Just a closed door. Slammed would've been better. Slammed was something. Closed was absence.

Jonathan dropped his duffel bag by the door and looked around again. He was a stranger in this place, a man inserted into a life that had moved on without him.

Chapter Two: Dust and Bread

He spent the first week pretending not to notice how the kids avoided him. Elise left early for school and came back late. Milo surfaced only when he thought Jonathan was out—he was a ghost, moving with the silence of someone who had grown up with the expectation of disappointment.

The house had routines he didn’t understand. The fridge had oat milk. The TV never showed anything but nature documentaries and the news. The Wi-Fi password was a series of sarcastic emojis he couldn’t decipher.

One morning, he made pancakes. Burned the first batch, slightly undercooked the second. Elise sat across from him, headphones in, scrolling through something on her phone.

"You always liked these," he offered.

She removed one earbud. "I'm vegan now."

Milo appeared at the doorway, sniffed the air like a feral animal unsure of a trap. Then he turned back.

“Hey,” Jonathan said, rising. “Milo. Got a second?”

But the boy was already gone.

Later that afternoon, Jonathan found himself in the garage, surrounded by relics. Boxes labeled “Christmas,” “Kitchen—don’t touch,” and “Dad’s crap.” He opened the last one. Baseball gloves, an old polaroid, a model plane still half-painted. A drawing Elise made in second grade: stick figures, a crooked house, a sun smiling like it didn’t know any better.

He sat on the concrete floor and looked at the photo. All four of them. Pre-divorce. Before the missed calls and moved addresses. Before he decided he couldn’t carry his failures on his back and ran, convinced they’d be better without him.

But were they?

Chapter Three: Elise's Silence

On the second Saturday, Jonathan followed Elise to the bus stop. She noticed.

“Stalking’s a felony, you know.”

“I just wanted to walk with you.”

She said nothing. He tried again.

“You still doing art?”

“Nope.”

“But you were so good—”

“I said no.”

They reached the bench. She checked her phone again.

“Your mother says you’re applying to colleges.”

“I’m not doing this.”

“Doing what?”

“This.” She gestured vaguely, as if the sky, air, and ground were all part of a set she wanted no part of.

“I know I messed up, Elise. I’m not asking for—”

“I don’t care,” she snapped. “You don’t get to just show up and play dad. That’s not how this works.”

The bus arrived. She got on without another word. Jonathan stayed on the sidewalk, watching her disappear behind the glass.

Back home, he found Milo watching TV.

“Where’s your sister?” Jonathan asked.

“Not my keeper.”

“Milo…”

“What?”

Jonathan wanted to say something meaningful. Apologize again. Open up. But instead, he just said: “Wanna toss the ball around?”

Milo stared at him like he’d just spoken ancient Greek. “I don’t play anymore.”

The door to his room closed again.

Chapter Four: The Letter

It was the letter that changed things. Or began to.

Jonathan had spent the afternoon fixing a loose step on the back porch when he found a crumpled envelope behind the gardening tools. It was addressed to him, written in Milo’s awkward cursive.

“Dear Dad,” it began. “I hate you. But I also miss you. That’s dumb, right? I mean, you left. You don’t get to be missed.”

Jonathan sat on the step, reading it three times. The ink had bled in places. It was dated two years ago.

He left the letter on Milo’s pillow with a note: I read it. I’m sorry. I miss you too.

No reply that night. But the next day, Milo asked if they could go to the batting cages.

"You're still terrible," Milo said after twenty minutes of silence and foul balls.

"Consistency counts for something."

Milo almost smiled.

Chapter Five: A Birthday Without Cake

Elise’s eighteenth came and went. No party. No balloons. She didn’t tell Jonathan, but he knew—Sara had mentioned it in a brief text. “Don’t make a big deal,” she warned. “She doesn’t want to celebrate.”

He baked a cake anyway. Or tried to. The top caved in, the frosting was lumpy, but he left it on the kitchen table with a note: Happy birthday. I know I don’t deserve to be part of this day, but I want to be. Even if it’s just with cake.

When Elise came home, she didn’t touch the cake. But she didn’t throw it out either.

That night, Jonathan found a sketchbook on the table. One page torn out. A drawing of a man sitting on a porch step, reading a letter.

Chapter Six: The Firewood Pact

Winter was early. The heater was unreliable.

“I’ll chop firewood if you stack it,” Jonathan offered.

Milo shrugged. “Fine.”

The work was slow. The air stung their lungs. But there was rhythm in it—chop, pause, toss, stack. No need for forced words. Sweat spoke better.

On the third day, Milo asked, “Why’d you leave?”

Jonathan didn’t flinch.

“I was scared. Thought I’d ruin you all. Thought it was better if I wasn’t around.”

“Were you happier?”

“No.”

The next day, Milo brought him a mug of cocoa. Silent offering. Peace treaty in porcelain.

Chapter Seven: Broken Glass

One night, Jonathan found Elise crying on the back porch. Her phone lay shattered at her feet.

He sat beside her. Said nothing.

After five minutes, she whispered, “He cheated on me.”

“Who?”

“Sam. My boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend now.”

“I’m sorry.”

She wiped her eyes with her sleeve. “You don’t get to be the shoulder I cry on.”

“No. I don’t. But I’m here.”

A pause.

“You smell like firewood.”

He almost laughed.

Chapter Eight: Sara’s Visit

Sara came by on a Sunday. She looked older. Not in a tired way—more refined, like time had taught her how to carry pain without letting it leak.

“How are they?” she asked.

“Stronger than me.”

“They always were.”

They sat on the porch, drinking coffee in the old mugs they’d bought at a flea market in Vermont.

“I think I’m getting through,” he said.

“Don’t stop trying.”

He didn’t.

Chapter Nine: The First Real Dinner

Jonathan cooked spaghetti. Elise made salad. Milo set the table.

They sat. Talked. Not much. But it wasn’t silence anymore—it was space. Space with room for rebuilding.

“I got into State,” Elise said suddenly.

Jonathan blinked. “That’s amazing.”

She looked at him. “I might go.”

“You should.”

She nodded. “Thanks for the cake.”

He smiled.

Jonathan spent the first night on the couch, curled into a posture that betrayed how unused his body had become to discomfort. The cushions had a vague mildew scent, like someone had spilled juice there once and never quite cleaned it properly. He could hear footsteps above him—light, careful ones. Elise’s. She always walked like a bird ready to take flight. Upstairs, doors opened and closed, faucets hissed, drawers thudded. The rhythm of a house that didn't need him. He laid still, listening, trying to find patterns in the noise.

Sleep came in fits. He dreamed of Sara standing at the top of a staircase, calling the children down for dinner. In the dream, Elise was seven and Milo was a toddler, chubby cheeks and peanut butter on his shirt. Jonathan was holding a camera, trying to frame them just right. But the lens kept fogging up, and when he wiped it clear, the kids had disappeared.

When he woke, sunlight was splashed across the floor like spilled lemonade, pale and sharp. The clock on the microwave blinked 7:04. He sat up, rubbed his eyes, and caught his reflection in the glass of the dark TV—grey in his beard, tiredness in his posture. No amount of polite smiles or handmade pancakes would erase what ten years of distance had etched.

In the kitchen, he found a note on the fridge in Elise’s handwriting. School. Milo too. Leftovers in the fridge. Don’t wait up. The tone was neutral, neither hostile nor kind. A truce made of obligation.

He opened the fridge and found a half-eaten container of pasta, some almond milk, and a single carrot. A bottle of hot sauce leaned precariously on the top shelf. The groceries he'd brought the day before—eggs, real milk, butter—sat untouched. There was a kind of refusal in that, a
