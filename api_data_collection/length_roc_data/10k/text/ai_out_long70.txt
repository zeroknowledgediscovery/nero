Whispers Through Glass
Chapter One: The City Breathes

It was just past midnight when Mara Kline sat cross-legged on the warped windowsill, her bare legs tucked under a woolen blanket that smelled faintly of cedar and age. The apartment above 11th and Halberd was too high to catch the scent of the street, but she imagined it nonetheless—hot dogs, gasoline, cheap perfume trailing behind late-shift waitresses heading home in their thin jackets.

Below, the city whispered. A siren screamed like a lost child. Tires hissed on rain-slick asphalt. Somewhere, a drunk man sang what might have been opera or maybe just an enthusiastic attempt at “My Way.” Mara listened to it all like a lullaby sung from a distance she could never quite reach.

She rested her head against the cool glass, the light from the streetlights slanting upward and casting thin bars of gold across the walls behind her. Her apartment was quiet, save for the hum of the ancient refrigerator and the occasional clicking of the heater pipes. Loneliness wasn’t always loud.

Sometimes, it crept like ivy over brick.

She sighed, pushing her fingers through her dark, unbrushed hair, and turned her eyes to the street. It was then that she noticed the man.

He stood across from the building, leaning casually against the streetlamp, smoking something that glowed faintly in the dark. He wasn’t looking at her. But he also wasn’t not looking. His coat was long and threadbare, his stance too still for the night around him. Mara’s pulse tapped against her throat. She blinked once. Twice. He didn’t move.

Then—gone.

A blink again and the streetlamp glowed alone, humming like a wasp.

She shook her head. Sleep deprivation did weird things. She hadn’t had a solid night in what? Weeks? The insomnia came and went, but lately it stayed, curled at the foot of her bed like a loyal hound.

She made tea. Chamomile, from a tin her sister had mailed her two birthdays ago. The label was peeling, the tin dented. Still, the scent was soft, familiar. Comforting. Unlike the apartment, which she’d taken over from a former college friend who had bolted for San Francisco, citing a man and a startup and a belief that New York had “lost its soul.”

Mara had never been sure the city had a soul to begin with.

At her desk, she opened her laptop. A blinking cursor waited on an empty document. The novel she was supposed to be writing. The one her agent kept emailing about, gently at first, then with that teeth-baring kindness that masked increasing impatience.

She typed two words: The End. Then laughed and deleted them.

Instead, she opened the browser. Searched for news. Nothing new. Nothing ever new. Fires. Scandals. Stock market chaos. A cat video.

Then her inbox. Thirty unread. The usual: newsletters, agent, sister. But one subject line stood out.

Do You Remember the Winter of '97?

No sender.

Mara frowned. Clicked. The message body was blank except for a single line of text.

Look outside.

Her breath caught in her throat. Slowly, she stood. Crossed to the window. Looked.

The man was back.

This time, he looked directly at her.

And smiled.

Her dreams that night were jagged, broken-glass mosaics. A little girl with her face, running barefoot across frozen ground. A train without windows. Laughter echoing through subway tunnels. That same man from the street, leaning in close and whispering something she couldn’t hear.

She woke with her heart pounding and the taste of ash on her tongue.

A knock at the door jolted her fully awake. Two sharp raps, then silence.

Mara stood in her kitchen, tea still in hand, unsure how long she’d been frozen there. She moved toward the door slowly, barefoot. Looked through the peephole.

Nothing.

She opened it a crack anyway.

On the floor lay an envelope. Thick, yellowed, tied with twine. No address. No stamp.

She picked it up and felt the weight of old paper, perhaps photographs. Back inside, she untied it and slid the contents free.

A single Polaroid.

It showed her, ten years old, standing in the snow outside a house she didn’t recognize. Her cheeks flushed, her smile crooked. And beside her—a boy she didn’t remember. Pale hair, sad eyes, hand in hers.

On the back, written in ink too neat to be casual:

You promised you wouldn’t forget.

She dropped it.

The kettle shrieked behind her.

Two days passed. The man on the street didn’t return.

The photo haunted her. She’d never seen it before, and yet… something about it curled inside her brain like smoke. She asked her sister—Jo—if she remembered the boy.

Jo didn’t.

“What winter of ’97?” Jo had said, puzzled. “You were in Phoenix with Mom and Dad. No snow that year. Remember the dog got into the neighbor’s fireworks?”

Mara didn’t. Not really.

She tried to write. The novel, now more overdue than a library book in a lazy town, refused to come. Instead, she found herself walking the streets, retracing her commute, looking for something she couldn’t name.

That’s how she found the bookstore.

It wasn’t new. That much she was sure of. But she’d never noticed it before. Wedged between a pawn shop and an old Polish bakery with cracked windows, the shop’s sign was faded:

Bitterroot Books & Sundry

Inside, the bell jingled with a sound like windchimes underwater.

A man sat behind the counter, eyes pale and unreadable. He looked up as she entered, nodded once. Said nothing.

Mara wandered the aisles. Old books. Older ones. Things with brittle pages and titles in languages she couldn’t place. On a hunch, she asked, “Do you have anything on dreams?”

The man tilted his head, stepped out from behind the counter. Wordlessly, he led her to a shelf tucked behind a curtain. Books bound in leather, some in cloth. One, with no title, seemed to hum in her hands when she picked it up.

She opened it.

The first page held only one word, hand-lettered:

Remember.

She bought it.

The man handed her a receipt that had already yellowed.

As she stepped out, the street looked darker than it had before.

That night, she dreamed of the boy again.

But this time, he spoke.

“Mara,” he whispered. “You left me there.”

“Where?” she asked.

His face broke, mouth trembling.

“In the snow.”

ChatGPT said:

Mara woke later than usual the next morning, the dull light of overcast skies pressing through the slats of her blinds like the fingers of a tired god. The apartment was colder than usual, and her breath fogged slightly as she exhaled into the space around her. The strange heaviness from the dream lingered—though she couldn’t remember every detail, the boy’s voice clung to her mind like a burr. She rubbed her arms, skin prickling, and moved sluggishly to the kitchen.

The Polaroid was still on the counter. She eyed it warily as she brewed coffee, wishing she could pretend it was just some long-lost family snapshot, something dug up in a box from her childhood. But no one had ever mentioned such a photo. No one had ever mentioned a boy.

She sat at her kitchen table, notebook open, pen in hand, the pages still blank. Instead of trying to write fiction, she started listing everything she could remember about 1997. Her handwriting started neat, then grew slanted and anxious.

Desert heat. The neighbor’s peacocks. Her mother’s station wagon with the peeling paint. Cereal with too much sugar. The smell of chlorine.

No snow.

She turned the photo over again. The childlike scrawl on the back hadn’t changed. Still legible, still crisp.

You promised you wouldn’t forget.

The knock on the door came again that evening—same pattern. Two sharp raps, then nothing.

This time, she didn’t hesitate. She threw the door open, her voice half-formed in her throat, but there was no one there.

Only a single feather, pale gray, lying on the floor where the envelope had been before.

She looked down the hall. Empty. The old woman from 3B had her door slightly ajar but ducked back in when Mara’s gaze flicked toward her. Mara picked up the feather. It was soft, lighter than it should have been. When she dropped it onto her desk inside, it spun gently in the still air, then stilled with unnatural suddenness.

She stared at it. A second later, her phone vibrated on the desk. One new message.

Unknown number: Remember the bookstore. Page 43.

She spun, heart hammering. No one should know about the book. She hadn’t told anyone. It hadn’t even had a barcode, hadn’t gone through any register she could see. But the book was still where she’d left it, on her nightstand, dark leather cover absorbing the last slivers of light from the window.

She thumbed through the thick, uneven pages until she reached page 43.

The entire page was taken up by a sketch, delicately inked.

It showed a playground in winter. Snow piled along the edges of a chain-link fence. Swings stilled by frost. Two figures stood near the center, half-turned away from the artist—one small, bundled in a puffed coat. The other, taller, blurry in a way that felt deliberate. Like someone remembered in a dream. The only color on the page was a single red mitten, dropped in the snow near the child’s feet.

She’d seen this before.

Not the drawing. The place.

She didn’t remember where. Not quite. But something sharp pierced through the fog of her memory—laughter on cold air, the burn of wind against her cheeks, a promise made in earnest with the solemnity only children could muster.

“I’ll come back,” she had said. “I promise.”

Mara closed the book. She stared out the window. The street below pulsed with its usual rhythm—cars, late-night pedestrians, neon signs flickering like faulty synapses. But for the first time, the city felt different. Not quieter. Not louder. Just… aware. As though the city itself was watching her.

She turned her gaze inward again and pulled her laptop toward her. This time, she didn’t open the novel draft.

She opened a browser and typed: Winter 1997 New York City playground incident.

The results were standard, at first. A cold snap in early January. Record sn
