Chapter One: The Smell of Ash and Lilac

It happened when Julian tore open a box that had spent the last ten years at the bottom of his mother’s basement, wedged behind old Christmas decorations and yellowing newspapers. The box was unremarkable—scuffed cardboard with edges curled from water damage—but as he opened it, the scent hit him first. A damp, papery musk with something sweet and artificial—lilac perfume, he thought distantly. Her perfume. He didn’t say her name aloud. Didn’t need to.

Inside, there were yearbooks, loose photos, a Walkman missing its back cover, a mix CD labeled “for nights when it’s too quiet,” and a notebook with half the cover torn off, the rest warped and swollen. When he touched the notebook, the edge of a photo poked out—a blurred shot of three teenagers on a bridge. Julian’s stomach turned. The picture had been taken on the last day of everything.

The past, buried under layers of grown-up distractions and obligations, cracked through with a vengeance. He’d spent years pretending it was all behind him, that what happened in the summer of 2002 was nothing more than exaggerated memory. A teenage hallucination of consequence.

But there it was, in his hand. Proof. The tremble in his fingers wasn't from the cold basement air.

That summer had ended differently for each of them. For Julian, it had ended with silence.

Julian lived alone in a rental house outside of Portland, the kind with drywall so thin he could hear the neighbor’s dog licking itself. He was thirty-two, a freelance editor, and his days were filled with margin notes and back-and-forth emails about word choice. At night, he drank. Not excessively. Not like his father. But enough.

After the box, sleep stopped working properly. The faces kept flashing behind his eyes—Tommy’s crooked grin, Lena's copper hair in a braid, and Wyatt, always with his hands stuffed in his pockets, like he was hiding something valuable or dangerous.

On the third sleepless night, Julian drove out to the coast. It was instinctive, a direction his body remembered better than his mind. The same way you find the bathroom in a house you lived in twenty years ago.

He ended up in Graybridge, the town where they'd all grown up. The place hadn’t changed much. A few new fast food joints, a vape store where the old laundromat used to be, but Main Street still had the same uneven bricks and that mural of a salmon leaping up a waterfall that had already been faded back when they were kids.

He parked outside the library—closed for renovations, the sign said—and walked toward the high school. He expected to feel something: nostalgia, regret, maybe even fear. But all he felt was a strange hollowness. Until he saw the flyer.

It was pinned to the bulletin board in the window of the local café, printed in black and red: Graybridge High Class of 2003 Reunion – July 14. Community Hall. 6PM.

That was only two weeks away.

Julian didn’t believe in signs. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that this mattered. That the box had surfaced for a reason. That the flyer, the timing—it wasn’t random.

Maybe it was time to go back properly. Not just drive through town like a tourist in his own life.

Two weeks passed like a breath held too long. Julian found himself checking the notebook, the pictures, the mix CD over and over, like they were maps he just didn’t know how to read.

He hadn’t spoken to Tommy, Lena, or Wyatt in over a decade. Wyatt had vanished first. The others drifted apart like seeds caught in different winds. He hadn’t tried to stop it. Maybe he should have.

The night of the reunion, Julian wore a button-up that didn’t quite fit right and jeans with a coffee stain near the knee. The Community Hall still smelled like mop water and mildew. There were folding chairs and a buffet table lined with deviled eggs and too much potato salad.

People were older, but still recognizable—just slightly thicker versions of their younger selves, with more lines, less hair, and eyes that didn’t light up the way they used to.

Then he saw her.

Lena.

She was by the punch bowl, laughing at something. Her braid was gone; her hair now fell loose and dark around her shoulders. There was a thin scar along her jawline he didn’t remember. But it was her.

He walked over before he could think better of it.

“Julian?” she said, turning with a slow disbelief.

“Hey.”

“Holy shit. I thought you were dead.”

“Not yet.”

They hugged. It wasn’t awkward, but it wasn’t natural either. Somewhere in the middle—a truce between years.

“Wyatt here?” he asked, scanning the room.

She shook her head. “No one’s seen him since... you know.”

Julian didn’t reply. He didn’t need to ask what she meant.

Tommy appeared next, rounder now, with a beard that didn’t quite grow in evenly. He laughed when he saw Julian, smacked him on the back.

They drank. They talked. They avoided certain subjects like mines in a field.

Until Lena said, “Do you remember the night at the river?”

Julian stiffened. Tommy’s face darkened.

“What about it?”

She leaned in, whispering. “Something’s not right. I keep dreaming about it. But things are... different. And I found something. In my dad’s garage. A box.”

Julian’s breath caught.

“What was in it?”

“A map. A journal. Wyatt’s journal. Pages missing. Dates scratched out.”

Tommy swore under his breath. “This again?”

“We never really figured out what happened, did we?” Julian said, his voice lower now.

“No,” Lena answered. “But I think we can.”

Outside, the wind picked up. The town’s old siren whined faintly in the distance—a test, maybe, or a malfunction. But it sounded like a warning.

They met again the next morning, in the parking lot by the old bridge. The same bridge from the photo. The one where it all began—and where it ended.

Julian brought the notebook. Lena brought the journal. Tommy brought coffee and a shotgun—“just in case,” he said, only half-joking.

They followed the trail along the riverbank, through underbrush and brambles. The deeper they went, the quieter it got. Nature hushed around them, like it knew they weren’t just hiking.

At the edge of the clearing, they found it: the burned-out remains of the old cabin.

Julian hadn’t thought it would still be here. But the blackened beams, half-sunk into the moss, were unmistakable. This was where Wyatt had taken them that night. The night everything changed.

“Look,” Lena said, pointing.

In the ash, barely visible, were fresh footprints.

Someone had been here. Recently.

Julian’s pulse thudded in his ears.

Tommy raised the shotgun. “If Wyatt’s alive... why the hell’s he hiding?”

“Maybe he’s not hiding,” Lena whispered. “Maybe he’s watching.”

A twig snapped behind them.

They turned, breath held, silence crushing.

Nothing.

But Julian felt it then, in his spine.

The past wasn’t done with them.

Not yet.

Julian scanned the trees with wide, unblinking eyes. For a moment, all he could hear was the thud of his own heart in his chest, loud and out of rhythm. The forest around them was too still, too rehearsed in its silence. He waited for an animal to bolt, a bird to flap away—but nothing. No movement. No sound.

Tommy stepped forward first, gripping the shotgun with both hands now, eyes darting from shadow to shadow. “We’re probably just spooking ourselves,” he muttered, but his voice trembled slightly, the mask of bravado already cracking. “Kids mess around here all the time.”

“Kids don’t come this deep in,” Julian said. “And not this early in the morning.”

Lena crouched by the footprints. They were shallow but distinct—a heel dug in, the edge of a sole pattern partially visible in the mud. “These are fresh. Probably from today. No rain to wash them out.”

She touched the print like it might tell her something. Julian watched her, noticing the small lines at the corners of her eyes, the way she bit her lip when she was thinking hard. She’d been like that as a teenager too, he remembered. Always analyzing. Always two steps ahead of the rest of them.

“I don’t think Wyatt ever left,” she said softly.

Julian blinked. “What?”

She stood up, brushing dirt from her hands. “You remember the tunnels under the ridge? How we thought they were just some old mining shafts or whatever? I think he’s still down there. Or maybe someone is. Someone who knows what happened that night.”

Tommy looked like he was about to argue, but Julian cut in. “What did the journal say, exactly? The part that wasn’t torn out?”

Lena pulled it from her backpack and opened it to a bookmarked page. The handwriting was jagged and cramped, like it had been written quickly, maybe even in panic.

“July 10th. They’re not who they say they are. I don’t think this is a game anymore. If something happens to me, check the tunnel with the broken stone. The one by the west marker. Tell Lena I’m sorry. Tell them all I’m sorry.”

Beneath it, a smear of ink, like a finger had dragged across the page before it dried. The rest of the entry was missing—torn out so precisely it made Julian’s skin crawl.

“Jesus Christ,” Tommy whispered. “This feels like a setup for a Netflix doc.”

Julian took the journal and stared at the scrawled message. Something about the words pulled at him—tugged at some repressed sensation deep in his chest. He tried to remember that night in detail, but the memories came disjointed, like shards of glass scattered across a floor.

They’d gone to the cabin to drink. To say goodbye. That was the plan. Wyatt had been acting strange for weeks, muttering about dreams, about watchers, about “them.” At the time, Julian had chalked it up to too many pills, or maybe just the pressure of leaving high school and stepping into the terrifying machinery of adult life.

But there’d been something else too—something they’d all seen, but none of them had dared to name.

That was the night the fire started.

He remembered the flames licking at the sky, the air thick with smoke and screaming and a sound—low and metallic—that he could sti
