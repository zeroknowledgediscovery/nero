Chapter One: The Summer That Seemed to Last Forever

The summer that seemed to last forever began on a Tuesday. That was the day the cicadas sang louder than ever, the heat shimmered off the asphalt like something alive, and the days started to blur at their edges. It was the kind of summer that felt like a myth even as it was happening — one that made you forget what school felt like, or what came after. Time stretched long and slow in the town of Linton’s Edge, wrapped in a haze of honeysuckle and smoke from distant grills. People left their windows open at night and trusted the dark not to come too close.

Sixteen-year-old Eli Whitaker didn’t know it then, but that was the last ordinary day he’d ever live.

He was riding his bike past the old railroad yard when he saw her.

A girl in a blue dress, standing alone near the rusted water tower. Her dress flapped in the hot wind and her hair was a deep, strange red that reminded him of sunset bleeding through clouds. She wasn’t from Linton’s Edge — he knew that instantly. Eli knew everyone in that town. The church kids, the trailer park toughs, the rich ones whose parents played golf at the country club and wore linen even when it didn’t make sense.

She didn’t belong to any of them.

Her eyes tracked him as he slowed his bike, curiosity gnawing at his gut. She was barefoot, standing in the scorched grass like it didn’t bother her, arms folded across her chest.

“Hi,” he called out, sweat making his shirt stick to his back. “You okay?”

The girl tilted her head. “Are you Eli?”

He blinked. “Yeah… how do you know that?”

She didn’t answer. Just turned and walked into the trees behind the tower, vanishing into the green shadow like it had swallowed her.

Eli didn’t sleep well that night. He kept seeing the girl’s face in the dark — her calm expression, the way she’d known his name. He didn’t tell anyone about her. Not his mom, who worked night shifts at the clinic and slept through the day in their tiny apartment above the bakery. Not his best friend Miles, who would’ve laughed and said Eli was going all Twin Peaks again. And definitely not Delaney, who would’ve stared at him like he’d started quoting witchcraft.

Instead, he went back.

The next morning he rode out early, even before the sun had burned the dew off the grass. The railroad yard was empty. No girl, no signs anyone had been there. But carved into the metal door of the water tower — fresh and deep — were three letters:

A.M.E.

He traced them with his finger. The edges were rough, like they’d been made with something sharp. A knife, maybe.

“Ame,” he whispered.

“No,” said a voice behind him. “A. M. E. Three different things.”

He spun. She was standing there again — same blue dress, same bare feet, this time holding a folded paper in her hand.

“You came back,” he said.

“You were supposed to.” She handed him the paper. “This is for you.”

He unfolded it slowly. It was a hand-drawn map. Not to anywhere he recognized — just a sprawl of lines and strange symbols. In the center was a circle with a dot inside it.

“What’s this?”

“A way out,” she said. “Or a way in. Depends on how you see it.”

He looked up. “What’s your name?”

She gave him the tiniest smile. “Call me Marrow.”

Linton’s Edge had secrets. Eli had always suspected that. There were things people didn’t talk about — like the old mining tunnels under the hills, or the time the river had turned black for a whole week in ‘82. His grandpa had told stories before he died. About things buried deep and watching. About doors in the woods that didn’t lead anywhere good.

Eli never believed him. Not really.

But now he had a map. And a girl named Marrow who talked like riddles and wrote his name in the air with her finger when she thought he wasn’t looking.

“Why me?” he asked her one afternoon, sitting beside her near the dried-up creek that everyone just called Dead Hollow. “Why now?”

She didn’t answer right away. Just picked up a pebble and threw it, hard, so it bounced off a dead tree trunk.

“Because you’re already halfway there,” she said.

“Halfway to what?”

“To remembering.”

Things started to get strange.

Not in big ways — not yet. But odd little glitches in the edges of the world.

Birds froze midair for a second too long. His mom spoke in her sleep, in a language Eli couldn’t understand. A photo of his dad — who’d died when Eli was three — suddenly showed a man with a different face.

And every time he turned away from the map, the lines rearranged themselves. He tested it. Took pictures. The pictures changed, too.

Miles noticed something was off.

“Dude, you’ve been spacing out hard lately,” he said, tossing a tennis ball against the side of Eli’s apartment. “Like, I called your name five times yesterday before you even blinked. And what’s with the whole ‘exploring the woods like it’s Narnia’ thing?”

Eli wanted to tell him. Really did. But the words caught in his throat like fishhooks.

Marrow had warned him: “Some truths don’t like being said out loud. They fight back.”

Instead, he lied. “Just clearing my head.”

“Well, clear it faster,” Miles said. “Delaney’s throwing that lake party Saturday. Everyone’s going.”

“I’ll think about it.”

He did go.

Mostly because he hoped Marrow would show up. She didn’t.

Instead, Delaney cornered him by the firepit, beer in one hand, the smell of watermelon vape on her breath.

“You’re acting weird,” she said.

“Thanks.”

“No, I mean — like haunted or something. Did someone die?”

“No.”

“Then why do you look like you’ve seen a ghost every time I look at you?”

Eli didn’t answer. Behind Delaney, in the shadows beyond the party, someone was watching.

Marrow.

She raised a hand, not to wave — but to point. Toward the trees. Toward something Eli couldn’t see yet.

And when he blinked, she was gone.

Later that night, he followed the map.

It led him down an old trail behind the cemetery, into the forgotten stretch of woods locals called Old Ash. His phone stopped working halfway there. The stars above flickered like candlelight. And the trees — they moved. Just slightly. Like they were breathing.

The center of the map was real. A circle of stones, half-sunken in the earth. Something was buried in the middle — something round, metal, rusted. A hatch.

He touched it, and pain lanced up his arm like he’d grabbed a live wire.

Then the hatch opened.

Not up. Not down.

It opened outward, like a mouth, and something whispered his name in a voice made of leaves and teeth.

Eli.

Eli.

Remember.

He fell forward into blackness.

When he woke, the world had changed.

Linton’s Edge was the same — but not. People looked at him like they’d never met him. His mom didn’t recognize him. The bakery above which he lived was boarded up. Miles wasn’t in school — no one had heard of him. Delaney’s house was empty, the yard overgrown by ten years of wildness.

And on every wall downtown, in spray paint that dripped red like blood:

A.M.E. IS COMING

Eli wandered through the new-old version of Linton’s Edge with a growing sense of vertigo. Every building was a copy of itself, twisted just slightly — the windows were narrower, the paint colors subtly wrong, the sky a shade dimmer even at noon. It was like walking through a dream someone else had built using his memories. The worst part was that no one knew who he was. The woman at the diner who used to give him free pie slices on Thursdays stared right through him. Principal Marsh, who’d once threatened to expel him for putting glue in the teacher’s lounge coffee pot, asked if he was lost and needed directions. The town hadn’t just forgotten him. It had erased him.

He sat for hours on the steps of what used to be his apartment, the wooden sign for McKinley’s Bakery above him cracked down the center. Dust covered the windows, and ivy crept between the bricks. He didn’t try to open the door. He already knew what he’d find — nothing, or worse, something pretending to be his life. He held the map in his hand and stared at the now-familiar lines. They hadn’t changed this time. The circle at the center remained still, and he wondered if it meant he had arrived… or if this was just another layer, another loop to fall through.

The only place that looked unchanged was the railroad yard. The same iron skeletons of boxcars rusting into the soil, the same tower with the carved letters: A.M.E. But now the letters were glowing faintly in the dusk, pulsing with a sickly reddish light that seemed to burn behind his eyes. He stepped toward them instinctively, heart hammering in his chest. The closer he got, the louder the sound grew — not cicadas anymore, but something deeper, like machines grinding stone into powder beneath the earth.

Marrow was waiting.

She stood beside the tower, no longer barefoot, now wearing black boots that laced to her knees. Her hair had grown longer in just the span of days — or had it been longer all along? She looked at him like someone expecting a soldier back from war.

“You made it through,” she said softly.

Eli took a shaky breath. “What is this place?”

“The same town. Another version. One of many.”

“And the people — why don’t they remember me?”

“Because you’re not you here,” she said. “Not yet.”

He flinched. “That doesn’t make any sense.”

Marrow stepped closer and took the map from his hand. She folded it once, then twice, and then again, until it was small enough to tuck behind her ear like a cigarette. “Sense is overrated. Especially here.”

“But… my mom. Miles. They’re gone. Everything’s gone.”

“They’re not gone,” she said. “They’re out of phase. You slipped. Like a gear skipping teeth. The things you remember are real, but they’re part of a different configuration.”

He stared at her. “I don’t understand anything you’re saying.”

“You will. You have to.”

Marrow looked up at the tower, where the letters flared once and then dimmed. “A.M.E. — it’s not just a name. It’s a trigger. A sequence. You activated it.”

“Why me?”

“Because the t
