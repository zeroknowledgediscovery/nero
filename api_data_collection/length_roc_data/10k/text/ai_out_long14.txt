Title: The Weight of Air

Chapter One: The Drop

The elevator shook once, like a hiccup in the belly of the steel beast that was the Marshall Building, a 64-story tower of corporate ambition and glinting glass windows. Then it dropped—three feet, maybe four. Just enough to make stomachs lurch and breath hitch in twin gasps.

Darkness swallowed the small, rectangular box. The lights blinked out, and with them, the hum of motion, the ambient buzz of fluorescent life. A metallic groan trembled through the frame. Then—stillness.

"Is this—did it stop?" the woman said. Her voice trembled, but not from fear. More like annoyance. She tapped her phone, held it aloft. “No signal. Great.”

The man across from her exhaled slowly, deliberately, as though he was trying to inhale something invisible and exhale something deeply personal. He wore a charcoal blazer over a white shirt. No tie. Neatly shaven, thick-rimmed glasses, a laptop bag beside his shoes.

“Looks like we’re stuck,” he said, unnecessary as the words felt. “I’m Ben.”

“Emily,” she replied, moving toward the panel of buttons. She jabbed at the emergency call button. It clicked. Nothing. “Okay. Well. This is absurd.”

Ben watched her without expression for a moment before stepping forward. “May I?” She stepped aside. He pressed the emergency button, held it, listened. No buzz. No static. No voice.

“Weird,” he said.

“You think?”

Emily leaned against the far wall, arms crossed. Her tailored pantsuit was more creased than it should have been. Her hair, dark and pin-straight, was too perfect. Like a model in a magazine caught off-guard. Ben noticed the scuff on her left heel. The small chip in the nail polish on her thumb. Cracks. He liked cracks.

“I have a meeting in fifteen minutes,” she muttered.

Ben glanced at his watch, more out of reflex than utility. “Unless it’s in this elevator, I don’t think you’re going to make it.”

Silence returned like a tide. The elevator was five feet wide, seven feet long, mirrored on the back wall. It made their faces look tired and too close.

Emily paced. “Someone’s going to notice. It’s a security building. They have cameras. Motion sensors. Something. They’ll see we’re stuck.”

“Unless the power’s out. Or something happened to the system.”

“What kind of something?”

He shrugged. “We don’t know what floor we’re on. For all we know, we’re in between floors. Invisible. They’ll find us, though. These things don’t last long.”

As if summoned by his words, a creak sounded above them. A small one. Then nothing.

“I hate elevators,” Emily said, softer now.

Ben sat down against the wall, stretching out his legs. “I kind of like them.”

She looked at him like he was offering her spoiled milk. “You like elevators?”

He shrugged again. “They’re like little islands of forced introspection. You step into a metal box, and the world stops. No windows. No distractions. Just you and whoever fate decides to toss in.”

“Philosopher.”

“Software engineer, actually.”

“Figures.”

He smiled faintly. “What do you do, Emily?”

“Litigator. Corporate law.”

“Explains the suit.”

“Explains the stress, too.”

She sat across from him eventually, after more pacing, sighing, staring at her phone. She slumped—not like someone defeated, but someone who realized the rules of the game had changed and didn’t like the new ones.

Ben reached into his bag, pulled out a granola bar. “Hungry?”

She hesitated, then took it. “Thanks.”

They chewed in silence, the crinkling of the wrapper unusually loud.

Outside the elevator, the world might have been ending. Inside, time was folding in on itself.

Chapter Two: The Past Gets In

Ben was the first to speak again. “I got stuck in an elevator once before. When I was twelve. With my mother.”

Emily looked up from her phone, surprised. “Yeah?”

“Yeah. She was crying. I didn’t get it at the time, but later I learned she was having a panic attack. Claustrophobia.”

“Sounds familiar.”

He nodded. “I remember holding her hand. Thinking, ‘I’m the kid, but I have to be the grown-up now.’”

Emily was quiet for a moment. “You don’t seem like the type who’d have anxiety. You seem...calm.”

“I’m good at appearing calm. There’s a difference.”

Another beat of silence. The air was getting thick. Not hot, exactly, but used up. As if the elevator, too, was holding its breath.

“What about you?” he asked.

She tilted her head. “What about me?”

“Ever been trapped before?”

Emily blinked. “In a literal sense? No. Figuratively? All the time.”

He waited, patient. There was a tension in her that hadn’t eased, not even after twenty minutes of nothing to do but breathe and talk. She wore her anxiety like a scarf—tight and coiled.

“I was married,” she said finally. “Three years ago. Divorce finalized last April. That count as a trap?”

Ben whistled low. “Ouch.”

“Not really. I filed.”

He nodded. “Kids?”

She shook her head. “Nope. Just a dog I miss and a condo I now regret buying.”

They smiled, but only faintly. The light overhead flickered once. Then, weirdly, came on. Dim, amber, like a generator’s afterthought.

Emily stood and pressed the button again. Still nothing. No voice. No buzz. Just the single bulb watching them from above.

“You think we’re underground?” she asked.

“No idea.”

“It doesn’t feel like we’re high up.”

“Or maybe we fell.”

Her eyes widened, and he held up his hands. “Kidding. Sorry.”

She sat again, a little closer this time.

“Okay,” she said. “Let’s make a game out of this.”

Ben raised an eyebrow.

“Tell me three truths and a lie. I’ll guess which one’s false.”

He smirked. “Alright. Uh… I once went skydiving. I speak fluent Russian. I can juggle. And I’ve never broken a bone.”

Emily’s eyes narrowed. “Russian?”

He nodded.

“You don’t look like someone who juggles.”

“And yet...”

She thought a moment. “The bone thing. That’s the lie.”

“Wrong. I’ve never broken a bone.”

She frowned. “Skydiving?”

He grinned. “Terrified of heights.”

She laughed, real and sudden. It echoed strangely in the elevator. For a moment, it made the walls feel wider.

“My turn,” she said. “I dated someone in the CIA. I once argued a case in front of the Supreme Court. I hate tomatoes. And I’m allergic to cats.”

Ben studied her. “You look like someone who hates tomatoes.”

“Rude.”

“Argued in front of the Supreme Court?”

She raised an eyebrow.

“No, that’s too specific. The lie is the CIA guy.”

“Wrong again.”

He stared. “Wait. Really?”

“Three dates. All very vague. Once he disappeared mid-dinner.”

“Jesus.”

“I know, right?”

The light flickered again. Buzzed. Then, a dull sound—like something scraping in the shaft above.

They both looked up.

“What was that?”

Ben stood, listening. “I don’t know. Maybe someone’s working on it.”

“Doesn’t sound like tools.”

He nodded, slowly. “No. It doesn’t.”

They waited, ears tilted upward like radar dishes. The sound came again, faint but deliberate. Something soft against metal. Dragging.

Emily shivered. “Okay, now I’m officially creeped out.”

Ben didn’t respond. He was listening too hard.

Chapter Three: The Sound of Memory

Two hours passed. At least, by Ben’s watch. Emily’s phone had died.

No one had come.

They’d tried banging on the door. Yelling. Silence.

The lights flickered erratically now. Once they dimmed to almost nothing before returning in a slow, moody glow.

“It’s too quiet,” Emily said.

Ben leaned against the wall, arms folded. “What do you mean?”

“No outside noise. Not even building sounds. Air vents. Nothing.”

Now that she said it, he noticed. Elevators hum. Buildings thrum. Even in silence, there's always... something. This—this was absence.

“Feels like we’ve been...unplugged,” she whispered.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he approached the door, pressed his ear against the seam.

Then he recoiled.

“What?” Emily said.

Ben looked at her, eyes unfocused. “I heard...something. Breathing.”

She stared. “Are you joking?”

“No.”

He put his ear back. Waited. Held up a hand.

Then—it came again.

Not breath. Not quite.

Like wind in a pipe. Or air being dragged across something slick.

He stepped back.

“This isn’t right,” he murmured.

Emily crossed her arms. “So now what? We panic? Start writing messages on the walls in blood?”

Ben didn’t smile. “I think we’re not just trapped. I think something put us here.”

And somewhere above, the dragging sound came again. Slower now. Closer.

And neither of them laughed this time.

The flicker of the emergency light cast long, uncanny shadows that bent across the walls and rippled faintly when either of them moved. For all the silence, there was a quality to the air that wasn’t still. It shifted with their breathing, soaked in the humidity of two anxious bodies, and tasted slightly of copper. Maybe it was just the stress.

Emily slid down the wall again, this time with less composure. Her posture sagged, and she rubbed her temples with the edges of her fingers, as though she could knead the tension out through her skull. Her suit jacket was off now, folded neatly beside her. A slight sheen of sweat marked the base of her neck, disappearing beneath the line of her blouse. Despite her earlier sarcasm and defensive posture, she was coming apart at the seams in a way she didn’t want to admit.

“I keep thinking about my father,” she said after a long stretch of silence. “He used to say that bad things only happen when you slow down. That if you just keep moving, nothing can catch you.”

Ben looked over, brow raised. “That’s an intense life philosophy.”

“It worked for him. Sort of.” She gave a short, dry laugh. “Died on a treadmill at sixty-two. Never even stopped running.”

He leaned his head back against the elevator wall and stared at the ceiling. “That sounds like the saddest metaphor I’ve ever heard.”

“It wasn’t a metaphor. It was Tuesday.”

The sharp turn in her tone made him glance at her again. Her eyes were glassy, but not wet. She blinked it away with a practiced ease, like someone who’d made crying a luxury she cou
