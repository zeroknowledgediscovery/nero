Coins of Passage
Chapter 1: The Telling

When Eli Grantham first found the coin, he was only seven years old. It wasn’t a grand discovery — not one of those tales where a boy trips over destiny in a golden beam of light. No. It was raining that day, an ugly, angry kind of rain that blurred the world into a charcoal sketch, and Eli was knee-deep in mud, chasing after a rusted red kite that had broken free from his hands.

The coin, half-buried near the roots of an ancient elm, glinted once — just once — like an eyelid winking open. If it hadn’t caught that flash of dreary grey light, he would’ve missed it. He almost did. He almost just kept running, arms stretched out like a bird about to crash into the earth.

But he didn’t.

He stopped. Looked. Took two uncertain steps back.

It wasn’t a normal coin. Eli could tell that much immediately, even at seven. It was heavier than it looked — a thick, ridged thing about the size of a silver dollar, but darker, made of some metal that seemed to drink the light rather than reflect it. On one side was an emblem: a tree whose roots tangled around the edge like fingers. On the other, a phrase etched in a language he didn’t know but somehow understood:

    “All debts must be paid.”

He slipped it into his pocket without thinking. That was the kind of boy Eli was — he collected the strange, the broken, the forgotten. Bottle caps, lost buttons, nails bent into useless hooks. A coin like this, heavy and humming faintly against the fabric of his jeans, felt right at home among his treasures.

Of course, he didn't tell anyone. Not his mother, who would’ve scolded him for “picking up trash,” not his brother Joel, who would’ve tried to steal it just for the thrill. And certainly not his father, who barely noticed Eli most days unless something was missing or broken.

The coin stayed hidden. For a while.

But coins have their own gravity, and this one — well, it pulled things into orbit faster than Eli could’ve guessed.

The first thing that happened was the dreams.

They started a few nights after the discovery. Not the usual dreamscape of endless halls and shadow-chases that plagued Eli most nights. These were different. Vivid. Tactile. In them, he stood on a bridge made of stone so old it wept moss. Below, a river writhed — not with water, but with something black and full of eyes. Across the bridge, always, was a figure cloaked in white, holding out an identical coin between two long, narrow fingers.

"You owe," the figure whispered, though its mouth never moved.

Every night, the dream repeated. Sometimes the figure was closer. Sometimes farther. Sometimes there were two figures. Once, there were dozens, their coins gleaming like stars in the fog.

It was Joel who noticed first.

"You look like hell," Joel said one morning over their sad, dry cereal. He was ten, full of that particular cruelty that only older brothers possess.

"Shut up," Eli muttered, spooning mush into his mouth. It tasted like nothing. Like chewing on a lie.

"You better not be having nightmares again," Joel continued, unfazed. "Mom says if you wake up screaming one more time, she’s gonna take you to the doctor."

Eli said nothing. What could he say? That he was seeing rivers of eyes? Bridges that shouldn’t exist? Figures that spoke without words?

The second thing that happened was the luck.

It was small at first. Eli found a crumpled five-dollar bill on the playground. Then he won a free soda from the vending machine at the grocery store — three times in a row. Then Mrs. Donner, the meanest substitute teacher in the whole district, somehow forgot to assign homework the day Eli forgot his backpack.

Coincidence. That’s what anyone would say.

But Eli knew. Somehow, he knew. The coin was doing it.

And for a while, he leaned into it. Who wouldn’t? The world tilted his way now. Little things, but they added up. Joel started getting in trouble instead of him. The neighbor’s dog, who used to bark and snap at Eli’s heels, suddenly became docile as a sleeping cat. Even Mrs. Grantham — their mother, tired and stretched thin from double shifts at the hospital — smiled at him once, really smiled, like she used to when he was very small and the world felt safe.

It couldn’t last.

Deep down, Eli understood that too.

The third thing was the debt.

It began the afternoon Old Man Caulfield died.

Everyone knew Mr. Caulfield. He was the cranky neighbor two houses down, famous for chasing kids off his lawn with a rusted rake and a mouth full of colorful curses. No one liked him much, but he was a part of the neighborhood — like the leaning street sign at the corner or the abandoned tire swing by the woods.

Eli had been walking home from school when he found the wallet. It was lying in the gutter, soaked and heavy with rain. Without thinking, he picked it up. Inside was a wad of cash — way more than any kid had business holding — and an ID card bearing Mr. Caulfield’s scowling photo.

And the coin, tucked neatly into a small side pocket.

An identical coin.

For a moment, the world froze. Raindrops hung midair like beads of glass. Cars on the street stood still, their drivers suspended in time. Even Eli’s own breath seemed caught halfway in his chest.

Then it all snapped back.

He blinked. Shoved the wallet into his backpack.

Later that night, Mr. Caulfield’s house caught fire.

No one was quite sure how it started. Some said it was the old wiring. Others whispered about careless cigarettes. The official report said “undetermined origin.”

What Eli remembered most wasn’t the fire engines or the flashing lights. It was the smell: not smoke, but something sour and metallic, like blood left too long in the sun.

And the dreams changed.

Now the bridge was crumbling beneath his feet. The figure in white was closer than ever, its outstretched hand nearly brushing Eli’s own.

"You owe," it hissed. "One debt paid. More remain."

Eli tried to get rid of the coin after that.

He buried it in the backyard, under the cracked gnome statue no one cared about. It didn’t matter. He woke up the next morning with the coin tucked into his sock drawer, nestled between the worn wool and the forgotten marbles.

He threw it into the river. Three days later, it clattered onto his desk at school, right on top of his math homework.

He tried burning it, smashing it, even leaving it on the altar of the church where his mother sometimes dragged them on Sundays. It always came back.

Sometimes immediately. Sometimes after a day or two. But always, always.

"You owe," the voice in his dreams said, now less whisper and more growl. "All debts must be paid."

By the time Eli was nine, he understood a few things.

One: The coin would never leave him.

Two: It wasn’t done with him. Not by a long shot.

Three: The more he tried to ignore it, the heavier it became — not just physically (though it did seem heavier some days, pulling his pockets down with a dull, dragging weight), but in the air around him. Like walking through a world underwater.

Four: There were others.

He spotted them sometimes, at the edges of his vision. Strangers with strange eyes. A woman at the gas station who stared too long, a man on the bus with a coin chain wrapped around his wrist like a bracelet, a girl at the fair who wore one on a necklace and flinched when Eli’s coin clinked against hers as they passed.

They all carried the same look: a hollowed-out tiredness, a kind of resigned vigilance. The look of someone always listening for footsteps behind them.

It wasn’t until Eli turned twelve that he met the first one who spoke to him.

Her name was Mina, and she saved his life before she even introduced herself.

It happened on a Tuesday, at dusk, the sky bleeding out in bruised purples and sickly yellows. Eli was walking home — the long way, past the woods where the river chattered over broken stones — when he heard the voice.

Not the dream-voice. A real one.

"You owe," it rasped from the shadows.

He turned. Heart hammering. No one there. But the trees leaned in close, their branches clawing at the air.

"You owe," the voice insisted, closer now.

He ran.

Feet pounding, breath tearing at his lungs, Eli sprinted toward the main road. He could almost see it — the safety of it, the bright flicker of headlights — when something cold and heavy slammed into his back, sending him sprawling into the gravel.

He rolled over, ready to fight, ready to die — he didn’t know which.

And then she was there.

Mina.

She moved fast, a blur of black jacket and fury. In her hand was a coin — larger than his, gleaming with symbols he didn’t recognize — and she slammed it into the ground between him and the thing that had been chasing him.

There was a sound like a bell shattering.

The air twisted. The thing screamed — a sound like breaking glass and weeping children — and vanished.

Mina stood over him, breathing hard.

"You’re lucky," she said after a moment, her voice rough but not unkind. "Most don’t get a second chance."

Eli sat up, dizzy, blood trickling from a cut on his temple.

"Who — who are you?" he stammered.

She crouched down, her eyes level with his.

"Someone who owes too," she said simply. "And someone who’s tired of paying alone."

She offered him her hand.

Eli hesitated.

But the coin in his pocket throbbed once, as if urging him forward.

He took her hand.

And everything changed.

Mina didn’t take him home, not right away.
Instead, she led him through a maze of back alleys and side streets Eli barely recognized, even though he’d lived in Fairhaven his whole life. Somehow, in the falling darkness, everything looked different — stretched and unfamiliar, like a bad dream you couldn’t quite wake from.

They ended up in a laundromat — an ancient, flickering place squeezed between a pawn shop and an abandoned video store. The neon OPEN sign buzzed and clicked in protest, barely hanging onto life. Inside, the machines churned on their own, unattended. Eli noticed absent
