Title: The Weight of Ashes

Chapter One: Dust and Lanterns

The old man sat hunched beneath the elm tree, its bark wrinkled like his skin, the shade cool despite the late summer heat. A rusted lantern swayed gently above his head, catching bits of fading sunlight and scattering them like old memories. He hadn’t spoken in hours, but the silence never seemed oppressive. It was like an old friend—worn, patient, knowing. The journal in his lap was cracked along the spine, and the ink had bled on half the pages. Still, his fingers, calloused and stubborn, turned the paper slowly.

“Sixty-eight years,” he muttered to no one. “Sixty-eight years since that night.”

His name was Elias Dunne. Some called him "The Cartographer," though he hadn’t drawn a map in decades. Others, in the southern villages, still spoke of him as the “Firewatcher,” though they meant it more as legend than title. To himself, he was simply Elias—a man who had seen too much and forgotten too little.

His voice was rough as dry grass. “If you’re gonna tell it, tell it true.”

So he began.

It started in the township of Rillhollow, a blink of a place in the gulch between two hills, where mist hung low and stubborn over the earth. Back then, Elias had been a wiry youth of twenty with dirt under his nails and something burning in his chest—not ambition, exactly. More like unrest.

The town had one road in and none out. At least, that’s what his brother Orin used to say. “Only road here’s the one you wish you could take,” he’d grin, brushing soot off his sleeves, hammer tucked in his belt. Orin worked the forge with their father, Alric Dunne—a man of few words and heavy boots. Elias had no love for iron or flame. His fire was of a different sort.

He’d sit in the loft of the barn with scraps of parchment and charcoal, sketching paths that twisted through imagined forests, coastlines he’d never seen. He named them: the Shore of Turning Lights, the River Named for Silence, the Bleeding Hills. When he was done, he’d fold the maps and hide them under the floorboard, as if they were sacred. Maybe they were.

It was in that loft that he first saw her.

“Those real?” she asked.

Elias jumped, knocking the charcoal off his lap. The girl stood near the ladder, arms crossed, a ribbon of blue in her tangled hair.

“Didn’t hear you climb up.”

“You were drawing loud,” she said.

He blinked. “They’re not real. Not yet.”

“Hm. Can I see?”

He hesitated, then handed her a map. She held it as if it were glass.

“The River Named for Silence,” she read aloud. “You made that up?”

“Yes.”

“Sounds like a place I’d run to.”

That was how he met Maren.

By the time he was twenty-three, Elias had already left Rillhollow three times and returned twice. The third time he stayed gone. He left with a satchel of maps and a compass that spun too easily. Maren was supposed to come with him, but the morning he left, she wasn't at the edge of the orchard like they'd planned.

He told himself it didn’t matter. That she’d gotten cold feet. That she belonged to the hills.

But he left angry.

The years blurred after that. He walked trails no one else dared chart. In the Vardelian Crags, he mapped the pass through stone teeth and frozen air. In the eastern marshes, he caught fever twice, but sketched a full map of the moss-flooded settlements before his fingers could hold a pencil steady again.

Every map he sent back to the Academy of Reach in High Merrow earned him gold, but it was the naming he lived for. He didn’t just chart geography—he gave it memory. There was the Gloaming Divide, named after a night spent watching distant lights flicker in uninhabited valleys, and the Vale of Whispered Teeth, where wind passed through twisted birches like breath through a mouth half full of secrets.

He was thirty when the summons came.

A sealed letter bearing the crest of the Crown, the wax fresh and red as heart's blood.

“Elias Dunne, Cartographer of the Outer Range,

You are hereby summoned to Court by command of Her Majesty, Queen Anselma of Brightrest. Matters of grave import await your consideration and service.

Fail not.

—Lord Fenwick Vassel, Royal Scribe.”**

He arrived in Brightrest with a limp and two broken molars. Bandits had tried to rob him on the Elandra Pike. He gave them the gold and kept his maps. Even bleeding, Elias knew the price of memory.

The Queen’s court was built of white stone, but it felt hollow to him. Too clean. He stood before her like a scarecrow, patched and crooked, and yet she did not dismiss him.

“Do you believe the world is mapped, Mr. Dunne?” she asked, her voice clipped, sharp as a chisel.

“No,” he replied. “I believe the parts we’ve dared touch are.”

“And what of the parts we haven’t?”

He hesitated. “Some things might prefer not to be found.”

She smiled then, barely.

“That is why you are here.”

She showed him a map no one else had seen. Older than the kingdom itself, etched into thin black stone. There were no landmarks—just lines, impossible curves, and symbols that pulsed faintly when touched.

“We call it the Null Cartograph,” the Queen said. “It was found beneath the old citadel ruins. The symbols match nothing known. Yet... when held by those with a certain attunement, the map changes.”

She watched him.

“It changed for you.”

He swallowed hard.

That night, he dreamt of a black forest where stars hung from trees like lanterns, and something enormous moved just out of sight. When he awoke, the symbols from the stone burned in his mind.

He left the next morning.

Accompanying him were three others: Brannick, a mercenary with a scar across his throat and a dagger he spoke to; Sister Yllin, a robed scholar who seemed older than her body allowed; and Tomas Vale, a young noble who fancied himself an adventurer and carried a blade he didn’t yet know how to use.

They were to follow the path drawn on the Null Cartograph, through lands unmarked by any known record.

The journey began with silence. Even the birds seemed absent.

Weeks passed. They encountered no villages, no beasts—only ruins of unknown make, worn smooth as if centuries had passed in days. Sister Yllin grew quiet, her journal filling with unintelligible glyphs. Brannick began hearing voices that no one else could.

But the map led them forward.

In the third month, they reached the Pale Valley.

There, the wind didn’t blow, and time seemed to twitch and stammer. Shadows stretched too long. The group camped near a lake where the water reflected not the sky, but stars that belonged to no constellation Elias had ever seen.

On the twelfth night, Tomas vanished. His bedroll untouched, his blade still beside it.

They found his footprints walking straight into the lake. But no body.

Brannick wanted to turn back. Elias refused.

“We’re past the edge of the known,” he said, hands trembling. “What’s left is only truth.”

Two weeks later, they reached the Tree.

It stood alone in a basin of glass sand, roots plunged into soil that smelled of iron. Its bark was silver. Hanging from its branches were hundreds of lanterns—some flickering, others dead. Maren’s ribbon, blue and frayed, hung from one.

Yllin touched the tree and screamed.

Brannick put his dagger through her heart.

“Her mind was gone,” he said, shaking. “She was repeating my dreams.”

Elias fell to his knees. The map in his hand began to burn.

He remembered then—Rillhollow, the orchard, Maren’s hand in his. She hadn’t failed to meet him that morning. She’d gone ahead. Left signs he’d ignored. All this time, the map hadn’t led him forward. It had led him to what he'd forgotten.

The truth was never in the places.

It was in the names.

The old man blinked in the shade, his breath catching.

He touched the cover of his journal.

In it, every map he’d ever drawn. Every false place. Every real name.

Behind him, someone stepped into the orchard.

The lantern above swayed.

“Elias?” a voice said.

He looked up.

And memory returned.

The figure in the orchard stood quiet, half-shadowed by the leaves, as though the world had hesitated just enough to keep her between moments. Elias didn’t speak at first. He simply stared, the haze in his eyes clearing with a slow, reluctant reverence. The voice was too familiar—fragile, unwavering, like a thread pulled from a time when things were smaller and the earth was easier to understand.

“It’s been a long time,” said the woman, stepping forward. Her hair, now streaked with gray, was still tied with the same blue ribbon, though it frayed more at the edges. She didn’t carry herself like a ghost or vision, though Elias briefly wished she were. A ghost would’ve been easier to explain.

“Maren,” he said at last, tasting the name like a fruit bruised from years of forgetting. “I thought you—”

“I know what you thought.” Her voice carried none of the bitterness he expected. If anything, it was wearied, like a well-read book. “I thought the same of you. That you'd died in the frost wastes or fallen into some nameless gorge. But we both kept moving, didn’t we? In our own ways.”

Elias closed his journal and set it aside. His hands, once steady, shook now even in stillness. “I saw your ribbon,” he said. “Hanging from a tree that shouldn’t exist. A place with no name, no echo.”

Maren lowered herself beside him, resting on the tree’s exposed roots as if she’d known this spot all her life. “That ribbon’s been tied to many things over the years. Sometimes to trees. Sometimes to door handles or candle holders. Left them for you, when I could. You never followed.”

He felt something inside him drop and shatter—regret, likely, or the last brittle piece of guilt. “I didn’t see them. Or I thought I imagined them. There was too much noise in my head.”

“You were always chasing silence,” she said softly. “But you never learned how to live in it.”

They sat for a while, saying nothing. The light turned honeyed, dragging longer shadows across the grass. Crickets stirred in the distance. Elias’s bones ached with
