Title: The Prince of Ashes
Chapter One: The Ashen Crown

The fire had long since died in the Great Hearth of Caer Lothewyn, and with it, warmth seemed to have fled the ancient castle. Frost crept like ivy across the stone walls, and the silence was not so much the absence of sound as it was the presence of something darker. In the heart of this withering stronghold stood Prince Corwin, seventeen winters old and barely taller than the iron candelabra beside him. Yet there was a sharpness in his gaze—like the sword he kept hidden beneath his cloak, against royal decorum, against his father’s will.

King Edric, his father, had grown distant since the death of Queen Maerwen two years prior. Some whispered he conversed with shadows in the upper tower. Others claimed the queen’s passing had fractured more than his heart—it had cracked the very earth of Lothewyn. And as the realm fell into drought and plague, as rivers dried and crops blackened, people began to speak openly of the Ashen Curse.

It began in the east, they said. In the fallen land of Varoduun. A sorceress named Elthera, once spurned by the king’s court, had returned from exile with a vengeance forged in black flame. They said she called upon the Wyrms of the Hollow Sky, struck a pact with dead gods, and loosed a blight upon the land. No birds sang in the east now. No child was born without weeping.

“You’re not listening, Corwin,” said Lady Mariel, his tutor and one of the last left in court who dared address him as kin rather than title. “You drift again. These histories are not just tales. They are warnings.”

“I listen,” Corwin said, his voice low. “But there is no wisdom in memorizing doom.”

Mariel shut the tome of old legends with a sigh. “There is if you hope to avoid repeating it. Elthera was no mere sorceress. She was the first of the Hollowed. Mark that name.”

Corwin turned to the frost-glazed window. Below, the courtyard was empty but for the crows. Too many crows these days, some say. Too clever by far.

It was on the eve of the Blood Moon that Corwin first saw the sigil in his dreams.

A crown of ash. A sword wrapped in thorns. And a city of glass, shattering.

He woke choking on soot.

Three days passed before he received the letter. It was sealed in crimson wax with no crest, and the parchment smelled faintly of myrrh and something older—earth turned in a grave. The writing was not ink but rust, perhaps blood.

To Prince Corwin of the Hollow Line,

When the bells toll thrice and no hand moves them, ride east. Bring none but blade and bone. The Queen of Embers waits.

There was no signature.

Corwin burned the letter, but the words stayed etched in his mind.

The next morning, the bells rang. No wind blew, no servant moved. Still, the chimes sang.

“You will not go,” King Edric roared, slamming a goblet against the arm of his throne. “The east is death. It is madness. And you are a child!”

“I am no child,” Corwin said, voice firm. “And I will not wait here to die under stone and silence. I was born under fire. Let me meet it.”

The court fell to whispers. Mariel stepped forward, her eyes narrowed, conflicted.

“Majesty,” she said to the king, “if this is a summons... it may be our last hope. If the Queen of Embers is who I suspect—”

“You dare speak her name!” Edric snarled. “She was banished. Let her rot beyond the Veil.”

Corwin stepped forward. “If she holds power against Elthera, then we need her. If she is the enemy, then I will end her.”

“You will die,” Edric spat.

“Then I will die trying,” Corwin answered. And with that, he left the hall.

He took only his blade—Wyrmfang, named for its jagged edge and silver-steel sheen—and the mare Fenn, a black-eyed steed bred from the cold valleys of Branraen. Mariel gave him an amulet before he departed, a simple iron loop with a shard of green stone.

“To ward off what watches,” she said, pressing it into his palm.

He didn’t ask what.

The east was not as the maps claimed.

Once past the town of Hollowmere, the land cracked like glass. Forests bled sap black as ink, and the wind carried whispers like names half-remembered.

Corwin camped beneath a dead elm his second night out and was awoken by a girl in rags standing above him. Her eyes were pale as pearls and her mouth stitched shut. She pointed east and vanished in the blink of sleep.

On the third day, he found the village of Caer Brenyn.

Or what remained.

Bodies frozen mid-motion, faces twisted in silent screams. Birds pecked at empty eyes, and a lone child sat atop a well, humming a song Corwin didn’t recognize. She wore a crown of bones and smiled with too many teeth.

“Are you the prince?” she asked.

He drew Wyrmfang.

The child vanished into smoke.

It was in the Vale of Smoke that he met his first true companion.

A man clad in wolf pelts, eyes like storm glass. He called himself Ardyn.

“I was a sword once,” Ardyn said. “Then I broke. Now I’m a question.”

Corwin didn’t ask what that meant.

They traveled together, mostly in silence. But Ardyn could fight—wielding twin axes and a strange fire that danced between his fingers in moments of rage.

“There are others,” Ardyn said one night. “Others like you. Called. Marked. Some ride north, some south. All roads end in the same ash.”

Corwin stared into the fire. “Then let’s make them burn.”

They crossed into Varoduun beneath a moon the color of coal. Here, the sky never brightened, and the stars seemed absent—like they had turned their backs on the world.

They were ambushed on the Black Steps, a ruin of stairs leading to nowhere. Hollowed Ones. Creatures once men, now burned inside by Elthera’s curse. Their eyes glowed red, and they moved without breath.

Corwin slew three before he fell, blood running from his shoulder. Ardyn’s fire saved them, but the wounds festered.

A voice spoke to Corwin in his fever. A woman’s voice, and not unkind.

You are the flame that forgets. Come to me, and I will give you your name.

He awoke beneath stone spires, and a woman stood before him in robes of ember and coal.

“I am the Queen of Embers,” she said. “And you are late.”

Corwin’s hand went instinctively to the hilt of Wyrmfang, but the Queen of Embers only lifted one delicate brow, her eyes like molten amber. Her voice was not what he had expected. Neither cruel nor imperial, but tired. Ancient.

“There is no need for steel here,” she said. “If I meant you harm, you’d be nothing but dust.”

He hesitated, watching the way her feet stirred no ash where she stepped. Around them, the ruins whispered. Jagged pillars of obsidian rose from scorched earth, forming a kind of cathedral of ruin. The sky above was choked by smoke, yet here, at the summit of the world’s wound, the air shimmered strangely. The temperature shifted not by season, but by memory—warm one moment, bitter the next, as though grief shaped the very weather.

“You sent the letter,” he said finally.

The Queen inclined her head. “I did. Though I did not write it with ink.”

“What do you want from me?”

“I want nothing, Prince of Ash. But the world does.” She turned away, walking toward the largest of the spires. “Come. There are things you must see.”

Corwin followed. Ardyn trailed behind him, his gait uneven from the last battle, though he said nothing. The fire-wielder had grown more reserved the closer they came to the ruins. Like something here unsettled even him.

The Queen led them into a corridor beneath the tallest spire. There, embedded into the stone, were murals etched in silver and coal. They moved faintly, like shadows trapped in glass. Corwin paused before one—a figure in a torn crown, flames rising from his eyes. Beneath him, a field of ash. The next mural showed a dragon—no, not a dragon. A wyrm. The Wyrm of the Hollow Sky. Its body coiled around the same spire they now stood in. Its eyes were closed, but smoke still curled from its nostrils.

“These are memories,” the Queen said. “Not images. We do not preserve history here—we trap it.”

“Why bring me here?” Corwin asked. “What am I to you?”

She turned and studied him. “You are the last spark of a dying line. The Hollowed curse feeds on lineage, on broken bonds and burned oaths. Your father’s guilt runs deep, and it seeps through the kingdom like poison.”

Corwin’s jaw tensed. “This isn’t his doing. This is Elthera’s—she cast the first spell.”

The Queen’s lips curved into something like pity. “Spells are not born from nothing. They are answers to wounds too long ignored. Elthera may have struck the match, but your house left the forest dry.”

He wanted to argue. He wanted to draw Wyrmfang and demand she explain herself. But he couldn’t deny the truth in her words. His father had banished Elthera, yes—but she had once been his advisor, and more, according to rumor. Some said she had borne him a child. Others claimed she had warned of the famine, the droughts, the broken balance between magic and crown. And in response, the king had cast her out like carrion.

“And now?” Corwin asked. “What am I supposed to do?”

“You will walk the Nine Paths,” she said. “Face what your line has broken. Each path holds a fragment of the world’s undoing. If you survive, you will forge the Ashen Crown. Only then can you challenge Elthera.”

“I thought she was just a sorceress.”

“She was,” the Queen said. “Now, she is a god.”

The Nine Paths were not roads, but realms—each one a memory made solid, a trial of heart and fire. Corwin’s first would be the Vale of Echoes, where the voices of the dead never ceased. To enter, he had to leave behind something of himself.

“Sacrifice is the gatekeeper,” the Queen told him. “What will you offer?”

Corwin glanced at Ardyn, then at the Queen. Slowly, he drew Wyrmfang and held it out.

“Take it.”

Ardyn swore under his breath. “You fool.”

But the Queen only smiled, and took the blade. “Bold. Most give blood. You give strength.”

She waved her hand, and the air cracked. A seam opened in the space before them—like light being peeled back. Cor
