The Ghost in the Pen
By C.R. Vale

Chapter One: The House on Elderberry Street

The rain had started again. A soft, steady percussion on the warped shingles of the old house. Inside, hunched over a battered oak desk that leaned slightly to the left, sat Bernard Ellery, once a name of modest repute in the literary world. Now, fifty-three years old and mostly forgotten, he watched droplets crawl down the smeared windowpane like lazy ghosts with nowhere else to be.

Bernard had not published in over a decade. There were reasons—some petty, some monumental—but he rarely spoke of them. Not since Marianne had left. Not since the reviews of The Salted Road had cut deeper than anticipated. Not since he had moved to the quiet town of Elsfield, where nobody asked questions and nobody recognized his face. He liked that.

The house itself was older than his bones felt. It had been empty when he found it, a crumbling colonial thing with vines for curtains and floors that whined under the lightest step. No one in town ever asked who lived there. If they saw the light in the attic window late into the night, they assumed something harmless. Or chose not to assume anything at all.

Bernard liked to imagine they thought of him as some eccentric recluse, scribbling poems no one would read, drinking black coffee and feeding the neighborhood cats. But the truth was stranger.

His desk—three legs, one replaced with a stack of outdated Writer’s Digest issues—was cluttered with paper, half-used pens, dried tea cups, and a brass key he had never managed to identify. Among these items sat a small, leather-bound notebook. Unmarked. Faded. It had arrived in the mail a month ago. No return address. Inside, pages of careful handwriting in a style that felt... old. Stilted. Unfamiliar.

At first, he thought it a mistake. Some fan’s deranged gift. But something about it unnerved him. He couldn't stop reading. Every word pulsed with familiarity and strangeness. The writer's voice—it was almost his own, but not quite.

Tonight, he flipped to a fresh page. A blank stretch of promise and risk. The lamplight buzzed. His fingers hovered over the page.

Then, the pen moved.

He hadn’t touched it.

The motion was slight, but deliberate. A single line, trembling, curved into existence on the page. He leaned closer, heartbeat hitching.

“She is not gone.”

Bernard’s hand snapped back. The pen stilled.

The room was silent, save the rain. No breeze. No tricks of light. His own breath, shallow and uncertain.

He reached for the notebook again, slower this time. The page remained as it was. No new writing. Just that line.

“She is not gone.”

He swallowed, lips parting. “Who?” he said aloud.

No answer.

He stood, moved away from the desk. A floorboard groaned behind him.

He turned, sharply.

Nothing.

Then the pen rolled off the desk and landed at his feet.

Chapter Two: A Past That Doesn’t Fade

The next morning, Bernard walked to the small café in town, The Elder Cup, a place run by a woman named Margo who wore bright scarves and always smelled faintly of nutmeg. It was one of the few places he visited regularly. Routine, after all, helped keep the ghosts at bay.

Margo looked up from behind the counter and grinned. “Ellery! The usual?”

He nodded, seating himself at the window. Outside, the sky hung low, heavy with the threat of more rain.

A few moments later, a cup clinked before him, steam curling. Margo lingered.

“You look pale. Rough night?”

Bernard gave a noncommittal grunt, eyes flicking to the notebook peeking out of his coat pocket.

Margo followed his gaze. “Still writing?”

“Trying to,” he muttered.

She sat across from him. “You ever think about publishing again?”

He looked up sharply. “Why?”

“Because I think you should.” She sipped her own drink. “People around here don’t know who you were, but I do. The Salted Road was a damn fine book.”

He chuckled, humorless. “Tell that to the Times.”

“I think you’re better now,” she said, surprising him. “You’ve suffered. And that matters. For writers.”

Bernard didn’t reply. Margo rose, patted his hand.

“Don’t let the past win, Bernie.”

She left him with that.

That night, he opened the notebook again. This time, he dared to write.

Who are you?

He waited.

Nothing.

He stared at the page until his eyes blurred.

Then, without his help, new words emerged beneath his own.

You already know. You wrote me.

He blinked, breath caught in his throat.

Wrote you?

He wrote the question quickly.

The reply came slower this time.

Before the end. Before the fire. Before she left.

He froze. Fire. There had been a fire, years ago. A cabin in Vermont. A manuscript lost. Only fragments had survived. No one knew about it—not even Marianne.

He remembered the charred pages, the smell of ash, the night of smoke and flame.

The reply continued.

You started something. You never finished it. I am the piece you abandoned.

He slammed the notebook shut.

Chapter Three: Mirrors and Echoes

Days passed.

The words kept coming.

Sometimes while he slept. Sometimes while he was away. Sometimes while he stared blankly, paralyzed by fear and curiosity.

The voice in the notebook had a name now.

Aveline.

It had appeared in the margins, scribbled hastily. She—if the voice could be called a “she”—spoke in fragments. Memories. Pieces of scenes. A forest. A child. A door that led nowhere. It sounded like a novel, but one Bernard didn’t remember writing.

And yet, it was his style. His syntax. But twisted.

He began copying the notebook’s content into his typewriter, uncertain if he was transcribing or co-authoring. The words seemed to grow richer as he did. More grounded. More... real.

He even began dreaming of her.

In one dream, Aveline stood at the edge of a frozen lake, staring at a cabin that burned despite the snow. In another, she whispered his name into an ear that wasn’t his.

When he woke, he found those dreams already waiting for him in the notebook.

One morning, he noticed something new.

A line beneath his last question.

“Let me finish.”

He stared at it.

“Finish what?” he said aloud.

The notebook answered.

“The story.”

Chapter Four: The Manuscript

Bernard began writing again, truly writing.

Pages stacked up, characters formed. Aveline, yes—but others too. Owen, the stoic hunter. Lina, the girl who vanished in moonlight. The story took place in a half-wintered forest that never melted. The rules were vague, but strict. Don’t speak the dead’s names. Don’t burn cedarwood at night. Never step across a circle of salt.

He didn’t remember inventing any of these ideas.

But they poured from him like ink from a broken bottle.

Margo noticed. “You’ve got that look,” she said one afternoon. “Like something’s finally waking up.”

He nodded, distracted. “Do you believe in ghosts, Margo?”

She tilted her head. “Define ghost.”

“Something unfinished,” he said. “Something that wants to be remembered.”

She thought on that. “Sure. We all carry those.”

One night, he found a new entry in the notebook.

“She is waiting for you.”

Beneath it, a name.

“Marianne.”

His hand trembled. “No,” he whispered. “She’s gone. She left.”

The notebook pulsed, as though ink itself had emotion.

“Not everything that leaves is gone.”

He stayed up all night, staring at the words.

Chapter Five: Return

The story reached its midpoint.

Aveline had crossed the lake. Owen had betrayed her. Lina had left a trail of ash in her wake. The door in the woods had opened—but not all the way.

Bernard felt the urgency building, a momentum outside his control.

Then, one morning, he opened the notebook and found a map.

Drawn in ink. Childlike.

He recognized it.

It was the land around the cabin in Vermont.

A red X marked a place near the old well.

Below it, two words.

“Go back.”

He closed the notebook and stared out the window.

The rain had stopped.

The next morning, Bernard woke to a strange sound echoing from the far end of the house. It wasn’t loud—more like a hush being dragged along the walls, a whisper with weight. The kind of sound that lingered too long. He paused at the edge of his bed, the cold wood pressing against his bare feet, and listened. It came again—soft, irregular. Like a pen scratching paper in an empty room.

At first he thought it might be the wind teasing something loose. The house was full of excuses, full of reasons not to panic. But this didn’t feel like wind. It felt intentional. Measured. He dressed quickly and made his way down the narrow hall, passing dusty frames that still held pictures of people he did not know. The previous owners had left them behind, and Bernard had never taken them down. There was a kind of sad comfort in coexisting with the forgotten.

The attic door was cracked open when he reached it. He distinctly remembered shutting it the night before. He didn’t believe in ghosts—not really—but some instinct deeper than belief told him he was not alone. He pushed the door wide and stepped inside.

The desk was exactly as he had left it, except the notebook was now open. Not only open, but splayed across the desk like it had been thrown there. Pages fluttered as the attic window admitted a lazy breeze. He approached it with caution, as if the book might bite.

There, on the open page, was a new line in the same precise, curling script.

“Come back to me.”

He exhaled sharply. His chest tightened. He sat down and stared at the words, his mind trying to rationalize—perhaps he had written that in his sleep, or under the fog of one too many whiskies. But no, he remembered the night clearly. He had written nothing after the line that claimed she wasn’t gone. He hadn’t even touched the pen since then.

He tried to laugh at himself, to chase away the chill running through his limbs. He failed.

On impulse, he wrote beneath the latest message.

Come back to who?

Nothing happened. The pen stayed still. The attic fell back into its usual quiet. Still, the energy in the room had shifted. Something
