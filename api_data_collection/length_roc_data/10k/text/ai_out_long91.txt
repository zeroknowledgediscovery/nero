Chapter One: Splinters in the Paint

There was a crack in the drywall that someone had tried, poorly, to hide. It had been filled with plaster — too much of it — and unevenly sanded down, so the texture rippled like a tiny, frozen ocean wave. Over that, a swipe of off-white paint, not quite matching the rest of the living room wall, dried in streaks that caught the morning light.

Jude noticed it the moment he walked into the old house on Ashwater Street, even before he saw the sunken sofa, the empty bottles lined up like soldiers on the kitchen counter, or the damp smell of something that had died and had almost — but not quite — been buried. It was the wall that spoke first. It said: Someone messed up, and someone else tried to make it go away.

He stood there, keys still in his hand, the door swinging closed behind him with a soft click. His boots left muddy outlines on the scuffed hardwood, but he didn’t move. He stared at the damaged wall like it had whispered his name.

"Jesus," came a voice from deeper in the house. "I told her to get that fixed before the inspection."

A woman appeared, barefoot and thin as a line sketch. Her name was Melinda, and she was his cousin — technically — though neither of them liked the word. Her hair was tied up with a pencil, and she held a mug that read Ask Me If I Care in peeling red letters.

Jude raised an eyebrow. "You rent this out or keep it as a haunted Airbnb?"

Melinda sipped her coffee. "Funny. You’re funny. And no, I don’t rent it. This was her place."

"Whose?"

She looked at him like he should’ve known. "Eleanor."

Jude blinked. "Eleanor's dead."

"Yeah," Melinda said. "And that’s why you’re here."

He turned back to the wall. Something behind the damage prickled at him, not fear exactly — more like discomfort, like a smell you can’t place but know is wrong. “She lived here?”

“Since March. After the last time she tried rehab.”

Jude didn’t ask how that had gone. The answer was in the silence, and in the crack, and in the scattered things Eleanor had left behind. A blanket half off the couch. Cigarette butts in a teacup. A single black shoe near the hallway like someone had walked out of it and never come back.

“She left a note,” Melinda said.

Jude finally turned to her. “What kind of note?”

“The kind that doesn’t help.”

Melinda walked back into the kitchen, and he followed. The floor creaked under her weight but not his. She moved like someone who lived with ghosts, someone who knew where they stepped.

“It was tucked under the coffeemaker,” she said, lifting a torn envelope from the windowsill. “In case you ever came back.”

He took the paper from her. The handwriting was unmistakably Eleanor’s — shaky, elegant, weirdly neat. One sentence.

They’re under the stairs. I couldn’t burn them.

That was it.

Jude read it twice. Then a third time.

He looked up slowly. “You didn’t…?”

“I haven’t touched anything,” Melinda said. “I don’t want to know what she meant. I figured if it was meant for you, you’d handle it.”

Jude opened the side door to the hallway. There were only three steps leading down to the narrow basement. The light was out. Dust floated in the air like it was underwater.

It took effort to walk down those stairs. The wood gave a protesting groan under each foot. At the bottom, it was cold and smelled of rust and old books. The walls were cement, unfinished. A laundry machine sat in the corner, long dead.

Under the stairs, behind a crooked plywood panel, he found a small cardboard box. Taped shut. But badly.

Just like the wall.

He peeled it open.

Inside: photographs. Hundreds of them. Some Polaroids, some glossy, others matte. Some bent at the corners like they’d been handled too often.

All of them were of people he didn’t know.

All of them had their eyes scratched out.

Jude didn’t breathe for a moment. A low thud echoed from upstairs — maybe Melinda dropping her mug. Or maybe not. He didn’t move.

He took a photo from the pile. A man sitting on a bench. Gray coat. Autumn leaves. His eyes had been gouged out with something sharp.

Another: a woman laughing near a pond. Eyes: slashed.

He looked through them faster now, fingers trembling. A child on a swing, blurred in motion. An old man in a wheelchair. A waitress at a diner, arms mid-gesture. Eyes, eyes, eyes — all missing. As if Eleanor couldn’t bear to see them anymore.

Or couldn’t bear them seeing her.

Jude sat back on the floor. His breath fogged in the cold air.

In the very bottom of the box was something else — a cassette tape.

He turned it over in his hands. On the label, in faint pencil, was one word:

“Don’t.”

He took it anyway.

Later that night, Jude sat in the motel room on the edge of town. The tape lay on the nightstand like a small animal waiting to bite. The TV was on, but the sound was low, just a murmur of news anchors pretending they knew what the hell they were talking about.

He didn’t have a cassette player, not anymore, but Melinda had given him one — dug it out of her attic like a relic from another life. It sat on the dresser now, plugged in and humming faintly.

He inserted the tape.

Pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then breathing.

Then a voice.

"Eleanor?" he said out loud, to no one.

The voice on the tape was hers. But not the version he remembered from childhood, or from the last time he’d seen her in rehab, skeletal and angry. This version was soft. Careful.

“They said they’d stop if I gave them what they wanted. But they never said what that was. I tried… I tried to burn the photos, but the smoke— it came out wrong. I couldn’t stay in the house. Not alone. Not when the walls started… watching.”

A sound followed — like something scratching inside the recorder itself.

“I thought it was just the pills. That I was slipping. But Jude, if you hear this— please don’t open the box. Don’t look at them. They find you that way. Through the eyes.”

He reached forward, stopping the tape.

He felt sick.

The photos were in the trunk of his car. Wrapped in an old towel. He’d meant to throw them out on the way to the motel but hadn’t. Couldn’t.

His eyes drifted to the window. The motel parking lot was empty except for his car, and a black sedan parked three spaces down.

He hadn’t noticed it before.

He stared at the car for a long time.

Then the lights turned on. No engine sound. Just lights.

The motel phone rang.

He didn’t answer.

It rang again.

And again.

Then stopped.

The light in the bathroom flickered once.

Then went out.

Jude stood up. Heart thudding. He looked at the cassette player.

The tape had ejected itself.

It lay on the floor now, snapped in half.

The plastic curled like a smile.

Jude didn’t sleep.

He lay on the stiff motel bed, eyes fixed to the cracked plaster ceiling, counting the ticks of the wall clock like a ritual. Every second brought a new shadow shifting in the corner of his eye. He told himself it was exhaustion. Just exhaustion. But he didn’t believe it.

Outside, the parking lot remained empty except for the sedan. Its lights were off now, windows dark, unmoving. But Jude knew it was still out there. Not just the car — something else. Something watching.

By 4 a.m., he’d wrapped the towel tighter around the box of photographs and shoved it under the bathroom sink. It didn’t help. The air in the room was thick with something he couldn’t name. Not quite dread — more like static. As though the room itself had stopped breathing.

He remembered Eleanor’s voice on the tape. How soft it had been. How sure.

“They find you that way. Through the eyes.”

He closed his eyes and saw nothing but flashes of white light behind his lids, like the afterimage of a camera flash.

The next morning, he drove back to Ashwater Street with the box still in the trunk, determined to bury it. Somewhere deep. Somewhere the light wouldn’t reach.

The sky was a dull slate, the air sticky with impending rain. Melinda wasn’t there when he returned. A note on the door said she’d gone to “pick up supplies” — whatever that meant. Probably liquor. Or sage.

He didn’t go inside. Instead, he popped the trunk, grabbed the box, and walked around to the backyard.

The grass hadn’t been cut in weeks. Maybe longer. He passed a rusted swing set, the chains frayed and tangled, and a wooden shed leaning to one side like it had been drunk for years. Behind it, the ground dipped into a patch of brush, thick and wet. He found a spot beneath a cluster of half-dead trees, the soil soft and loamy, and started to dig with an old rusted spade he’d found beside the house.

It took him longer than it should have. Every time the blade struck rock, it jarred up into his elbows. Sweat poured down his back. But he kept going. Deeper. Until the hole was wide enough.

He lowered the box into the earth like he was burying a coffin.

Then he froze.

Just as he reached for the first handful of dirt to cover it, something shifted in the trees. Not a squirrel. Not a breeze. Something heavy. Deliberate.

He didn’t look up.

Instead, he kept burying.

Faster now. Dirt piled onto the box, clumps falling in a rush like his body knew what his mind refused to. His skin crawled. Every hair on his arms stood upright.

Only when the box was completely covered did he finally lift his head.

Nothing.

Just trees. Grass. The wind beginning to rise.

But still, he felt it. A pressure. Like the air had thickened.

He backed away from the grave. Stumbled slightly. Wiped his hands on his jeans. He didn’t look back.

Inside the house, he went to Eleanor’s room. It was smaller than he remembered. Cluttered. The bed sat unmade, still indented where she must have slept last. A journal lay on the nightstand. He flipped through it, past pages of erratic handwriting, doodles, smeared ink.

They're not people. They wear people like clothes.

That line was circled three times.

Another page: Don’t look at mirrors. Don’t trust windows.

And then, lower down, in all caps, IF YOU SEE THEIR EYES I
