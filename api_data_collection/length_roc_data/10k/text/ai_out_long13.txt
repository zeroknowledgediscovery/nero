Title: The Eighth Spire

Chapter One: The Ribbon of Glass

The city of Virelia, with its stammering neon skyline and breathless tempo, bore a thousand stories in its foundations, and a thousand more in its towers. But none so strange, so whispered-about, as the Eighth Spire. Officially, it didn’t exist. Maps swerved around the block it occupied like magnet-repelled compass needles. Government records blurred its schematics. Yet there it stood—stark, bone-thin, rising 213 stories above the rest, a flawless monolith of black glass, pinched at the top like a needle poised to sew the clouds.

The first time Dacien Rhone saw it, he was fifteen, riding shotgun in his father’s delivery van as they crossed the midline expressway. The building had shimmered then—not from light, but as though reality bent subtly around it. It was out of place. Out of sync. His father, who rarely spoke, muttered a single word: “Aberration.”

Now, seventeen years later, Dacien worked for Keller-Morne, an architecture firm that designed buildings no one could afford and cities no one would ever live in. The kind of place where whispers turned into contracts, and then into dreams shaped in steel. He sat at his desk on the 38th floor of the Eastside Pinnacle, sketching atrium latticework for a mall in Nanjing, when he got the call.

"Mr. Rhone?" A voice like sandpaper over velvet. "We’ve a client interested in a long-term consultation. Private commission. Top priority."

"Alright," he said, eyes still on the sketchpad.

"They asked for you by name."

He blinked. Looked up. "Who?"

There was a pause. "They wouldn’t say. But they want to meet in person. Today. You’ll be driven."

Two hours later, he was seated in the back of a driverless black car, threading the rain-streaked arteries of Virelia. The windows were tinted from the inside—he couldn’t even see the road. But he knew. As the pressure shifted in his ears and the subtle sense of tilt returned to his stomach, he realized where they were going.

When the car stopped and the door hissed open, the tower rose before him again, darker than he remembered. The Eighth Spire. It looked untouched by time. No entrance, no visible seams in the glass. Just presence.

The driverless car pulled away without a sound.

A portion of the wall beside him shivered. A vertical line appeared, then another. The glass folded inward like the petals of a flower recoiling from frost. A narrow hallway lay beyond.

Dacien stepped in.

The interior was a contradiction. Brutalist concrete gave way to brushed metal, then to rich mahogany. It was like walking through the memory of different decades. A woman stood at the end of the hall, arms folded behind her back, dressed in a gray suit so precisely tailored it seemed sprayed on. Her hair was silver—not gray, not white, but silver—and her eyes were framed by tiny silver lenses that reflected his own face back at him.

"Mr. Rhone," she said. "I am Seraphine Vahl. Thank you for coming."

"You're welcome," he said, voice catching. "Is this a... residence?"

"A sanctuary. A monument. A key."

"A key to what?"

She smiled. "Time will elaborate. Come. There are things to show you."

They ascended via an elevator that had no buttons, no cables, no discernible method of motion. It simply moved. Floor after floor flashed past—none of them labeled. Some appeared unfinished, strewn with machinery and broken tile. Others were lush—art galleries, meditation gardens, one floor entirely composed of water with stepping stones forming a spiral.

Finally, the elevator stopped.

They stepped into a chamber lit by skylight, though no sun was visible. The room held a table, circular, inlaid with a mosaic of shifting patterns—mechanical fractals that rearranged as he watched. Eight seats. Seven were occupied.

A man in a red coat turned to face him. "Rhone, good. We’ve waited long enough."

The others said nothing. Just stared.

"Waited for what?" Dacien asked, heart crawling into his throat.

"For the Eighth to return," Seraphine said. "You’ve been here before. Not in body. But in legacy. In blood."

Dacien didn’t laugh. He couldn’t.

The man in the red coat gestured to one of the empty chairs. "Sit. You’re part of this now. You’re part of the Spire."

Chapter Two: The Council of Glass

Their names were as enigmatic as their expressions: A woman called Ilyra, who smelled faintly of roses and gunpowder. A boy no older than twelve, named Emrich, who said nothing but whose eyes flickered in morse code. A bearded man named Cord who claimed to remember the fall of Rome. There were others—each stranger than the last.

"We are the Keepers," Seraphine explained. "Of memory. Of stability. Of recurrence."

"You’re going to need to explain that," Dacien said, gripping the edge of the table.

"This tower was built not as a building, but as a device," she said. "It spans not just physical height but dimensional depth. Time folds within its walls. Memory persists where it should fade. Every seventy years, the Spire chooses a new keeper to replace the lost."

"And you think that’s me?"

"We know it is."

"But I’m nobody."

"You were chosen at birth. Marked at fifteen. Called at thirty-two. Patterns matter, Dacien. Even chaos bends to them."

He stood. "No. This is too much. You people are insane."

Cord chuckled. "We’ve been called worse."

Emrich blinked. The lights dimmed. Something rumbled beneath them.

Seraphine didn’t move. "You can leave, if you like. But understand this—the world outside isn’t what you remember. The city has already begun to change. You’ve been marked by the Spire. Reality bends for you now."

He turned to go. The elevator doors were gone. The hallway was gone. Even the windows showed only darkness.

"What do you want from me?" he asked.

"Help us," said Ilyra, her voice low and smoky. "There’s something in the basement. Something that wasn’t there before."

Chapter Three: Descent

The elevator descended this time. Slowly. With a hum that vibrated the bones.

They called it Sublevel 9, though no one had ever built it.

Cord handed Dacien a small rod. "Reality gets soft down there. This will help keep your shape."

"My shape?"

"You’ll see."

The doors opened. The walls breathed.

They moved through tunnels laced with cables, shadows crawling the other direction. Pipes thrummed with whispered speech. One section of the floor was made of fingers—clenched tightly together. When Dacien stepped over them, they gripped his boots.

The entity waited in the atrium.

It resembled a person, but shimmered wrong. Its movements came too late for its intentions. It grinned with teeth that changed shape. And it spoke in Dacien’s own voice.

"I was you. I am you. I am the version that broke."

"What is it?" Dacien whispered.

Seraphine answered softly. "A shade. An echo of a choice you haven’t made yet. The Spire records everything. Sometimes too well."

The entity lunged. The rod in Dacien’s hand flared with white light and pierced the thing’s chest. It fell without blood, turning to dust that floated upward instead of down.

"You see now," Seraphine said, voice sharp. "Why we need you. Why we all stay."

Dacien nodded. Slowly.

And then the floor beneath them shifted.

The building was rearranging.

The Spire rearranged itself without sound. No creaking steel, no groaning of internal strain. One moment, Dacien stood in the room with the strange council and the shifting table, and the next he was in a narrow corridor with low ceilings and curved walls, their surfaces moving subtly like the underbelly of a massive snake. Light came from somewhere unseen, evenly cast, casting no shadows. He touched the wall, half-expecting it to recoil, but it felt warm and solid, like sun-warmed stone.

He walked for what felt like a long time. Minutes, maybe more. No signs, no doors, and no sounds beyond the muted hum that seemed to vibrate in his ribs. It was the kind of place that could drive a person mad, not with horror, but with indifference. The building didn’t care whether he was afraid or awestruck. It simply existed, far beyond the need to explain itself.

A corner appeared without transition. He turned it and found himself facing a man in janitorial coveralls, seated on a wooden stool, slowly peeling an orange. The scent hit Dacien with the force of memory—summer at his grandfather’s orchard, juice sticky on his fingers, bees tracing lazy orbits.

“You’re walking too fast,” the man said without looking up. “That’s why the walls move.”

Dacien hesitated. “I thought they moved because—well, because they’re alive.”

“That too,” the man said, smiling now, revealing yellowed teeth. “But mostly, they like rhythm. Keep your steps even, breathe slow, and they stay still. Rush, and they get nervous.”

“Who are you?”

The man tossed an orange peel into a small bin and bit deeply into a wedge. He chewed thoughtfully, then pointed down the hall.

“Name’s Not Important. Everyone gets lost the first time. Go left. Not the next left—the one after that. You’ll know it by the humming.”

And just like that, he returned to peeling.

Dacien wanted to ask more, but he felt the Spire tugging at him, gently but firmly, like the undertow beneath calm water. He kept walking. One left. Another. Then the hum—not just heard now, but felt in his feet, up through his spine.

The hallway ended in a glass door. Beyond it, a vast circular room unfurled like the inside of a nautilus shell, lined with books that stretched upward in impossible spirals, vanishing into shadow. He pushed the door open.

A girl sat on the floor near the center, books stacked around her in towers. She looked maybe twenty, with skin the color of wet clay and hair in long black ropes that twitched like antennae when she turned her head.

“You’re not supposed to be here yet,” she said. “But then again, neither was I.”

Dacien hesitated. “Who are you?”

“I’m Kit. Short for Kitania, but nobody uses that anymore. Too many syllables.”

He looked around the room,
