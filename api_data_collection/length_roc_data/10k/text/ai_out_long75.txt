Chapter One: Ghosts in the Morning

The morning sun hadn’t yet burned through the low mist curling like cigarette smoke between the buildings on Garland Street. Traffic was light, mostly delivery vans and early-rising contractors, but even they kept their windows up, their eyes straight. Not many people looked to their left at this time of morning—not toward the half-boarded park where the benches sagged under the weight of the forgotten.

Marcus Halden did. He always did.

He stood on the edge of the sidewalk with a paper cup of bitter diner coffee in his hand and the taste of metal in his mouth. Across the street, half a dozen figures were scattered like discarded scarecrows—bodies wrapped in sleeping bags, tattered coats, piles of everything and nothing. The stink of piss and garbage floated on the morning air like an omen.

One of the men—Marcus thought he was a man, anyway—was talking to a pigeon perched on the lip of an overflowing trash can. His hands made chopping, swooping gestures as he spoke, like he was conducting a mad orchestra. Another sat perfectly still, eyes locked on the horizon as if waiting for something ancient to return.

Marcus sipped his coffee. It tasted like a mistake. “Damn,” he muttered, blinking. He turned to leave.

Then a girl caught his eye.

She couldn’t have been more than nineteen, maybe twenty. Thin as a pole, face smudged with soot or makeup or maybe just the city itself. She had a red hoodie pulled over her head, sleeves stretched past her hands, and she was staring right at him.

He stopped.

Her eyes didn’t look angry or afraid. They looked knowing. Familiar, even. Like she recognized him.

Marcus took a step toward the street.

The girl stood.

From the folds of the hoodie, she pulled out something—a plastic bag, bulging with what looked like cassette tapes. She held it out, shaking it like an offering. Her lips moved, though he couldn’t hear the words.

A horn blared. Marcus staggered back just as a box truck screamed past, leaving exhaust and confusion in its wake. When he looked back, the girl was gone.

The bag lay in the gutter.

He hesitated, then crossed. His shoes crunched over broken glass and a soggy flyer advertising some gone band. The bag was greasy, the kind you got from a gas station, and inside were exactly six cassette tapes. The labels were handwritten in shaky block letters:

    “Don’t Listen Yet”

    “June 14th”

    “Remember Me”

    “Break the Loop”

    “Mother’s Eyes”

    “This One Kills”

Marcus turned the bag over. No name. No number. No explanation.

Behind him, a voice rasped: “She picked you.”

He spun around. The man with the pigeon had sidled up behind him, breath heavy with rot and something sweeter, darker. “She don’t pick often,” the man said, looking down at the tapes. “But when she does... well. You’d best listen.”

Marcus opened his mouth to ask what the hell he meant, but the man was already walking away, arms out to his sides like wings.

The tapes were warm in his hands.

Later that morning, Marcus sat on the floor of his apartment, the tapes splayed out before him like tarot cards. The place was a mess—takeout containers stacked on the counter, the TV remote somewhere under a pile of unpaid bills. He worked freelance sound design, which mostly meant he edited screams for low-budget horror games and slept during the day.

The first tape—“Don’t Listen Yet”—mocked him. Of course it did.

His fingers hovered over it, then chose “June 14th” instead. He rummaged through an old box until he found his battered Walkman, popped the tape in, and pressed play.

The tape hissed.

Then:

“Marcus. If you're hearing this, then I failed.”

He froze.

The voice was female. Young. But there was something else—something that made his spine stiffen. It was her. The girl from the park.

“You have to listen carefully. I don’t have much time. You think this is just a message, but it's more than that. It’s a pattern. A map. There are pieces hidden in the noise. You’ll need to break it down. Isolate the frequencies. I’ve hidden them in the distortion.”

She paused, and the hiss returned, like waves.

“If you ignore this, you die. If you follow it, maybe you live. Maybe we both do.”

Click.

Marcus sat in silence, the tape spooling out inside the Walkman. Something under the voice—it was there. A low hum. A sound that shouldn’t have been on analog tape. He backed it up, closed his eyes, and listened again.

And again.

And again.

Three days later, Marcus had played the first three tapes to death. His apartment was now a nest of notebooks, audio gear, spectral analysis software, and caffeine detritus. He’d isolated a signal on the third tape—an almost imperceptible set of tones that repeated in a sequence. It wasn’t Morse code, but it wasn’t random either.

Somewhere between the humming and the static, he’d started to hear... whispers.

He hadn’t slept more than four hours total since then. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the girl in the red hoodie. Sometimes she was walking down a hallway lit by stuttering fluorescent lights. Sometimes she was screaming behind a wall of glass. Sometimes she was just staring, saying nothing.

He hadn’t gone back to the park. He wasn’t sure why. Maybe he was afraid she wouldn’t be there.

Or worse—afraid she would be.

On the fifth day, a man knocked on his door.

Not just a man—a man in a brown suit two sizes too large, tie askew, face like a wax sculpture left in the sun too long. He smiled without warmth and said, “Mr. Halden?”

Marcus stood behind the chain lock. “Yeah?”

The man held up a badge. It said Federal Communications Bureau. “Mind if we talk?”

Marcus’s mouth went dry. “What for?”

“It’s about a girl. We think she’s been transmitting illegal signals on government bands. Possibly using analog equipment. Very niche.” His smile deepened. “Right up your alley.”

Marcus closed the door. Not slammed it—just closed it. Then he bolted it and backed away.

The man didn’t knock again. But when Marcus checked the hallway security cam later, the man was still standing there. Just staring at the door. For seven minutes.

That night, he played the fifth tape: “Mother’s Eyes.”

This one was different. No voice. Just sound. Wind. Footsteps. Then a lullaby, cracked and broken, sung off-key.

He felt something move in the room.

And then he heard his mother’s voice.

Not like a memory. Not like a recording.

Like she was right behind him.

“Marcus, don’t turn around.”

He didn’t.

“Marcus,” her voice whispered, right beside his ear now, “they’re watching.”

He wept then, quietly. Not from fear, not really. From grief. She’d been dead twelve years.

The Walkman stopped.

And someone knocked on the window.

Eighth floor.

He woke up in the bathtub, cold water up to his ribs. He didn’t remember getting in. The final tape sat on the toilet seat beside him, the label smudged: “This One Kills.”

He didn’t touch it.

Not yet.

He checked the hallway cam again.

The man in the brown suit was gone.

But the girl was there now, standing just out of frame.

Waiting.

The next morning, Marcus found himself staring out his kitchen window, the coffee untouched on the counter. It was raining—thin, slicing rain that made the skyline look like it was melting. His mind was heavy with static, the kind that lingered long after the audio had ended. The girl’s voice still echoed in his skull, warped and half-lost, like a half-remembered dream that pressed at the inside of his ribs.

He didn’t want to play the last tape. Not yet. Something about it felt final. The kind of final that had weight. Something irreversible. And yet it sat there on the windowsill now, like a stray animal waiting to be let in. Its label had faded more overnight, somehow—he was sure of it. The words “This One Kills” were now no more than a suggestion beneath the smudge of oily fingerprints.

He considered calling someone—maybe Eli, his old roommate from undergrad, now working cybersecurity out west. Eli would know how to dissect the audio data, pull out the embedded signals. But Marcus couldn’t bring himself to do it. He felt like talking about the tapes would be betraying some unspoken agreement. They were personal now. Sacred, almost. As if the more he uncovered, the less he could explain—and the more he had to protect.

Instead, he picked up the second tape again, “June 14th,” and rewound it manually, listening for the hundredth time. He isolated the harmonic structure beneath the girl’s voice, tweaking the EQ levels until the sound gave way like ice cracking on a lake. Behind the distortion was something faint—a chime, maybe. A doorbell? And then numbers, whispered in reverse: Nine. Four. One. Zero. Repeated three times.

Marcus scribbled it down, though he didn’t know why. Nine four one zero. A code? A time? An address?

The room around him buzzed with a sick kind of energy. His computer monitor blinked, then went black for a second before rebooting itself. He hadn’t touched anything.

Outside, the rain had stopped.

The silence was somehow worse.

At noon, Marcus left the apartment for the first time in days. He hadn’t shaved, hadn’t showered, and his clothes smelled like old laundry and fear. But he needed to walk. Needed to breathe somewhere that didn’t echo with buried signals and phantom footsteps. The air outside was thick, like soup. Humid, grey, tense.

He didn’t head to Garland Street. He took the long way around, past the glass towers of the financial district, their clean mirrored windows reflecting nothing. Even here, among the polished shoes and sharp suits, people didn’t look each other in the eye. The city had always been like that, but lately it felt deliberate. As if there was something just under the surface everyone had agreed not to mention.

He paused in front of a run-down convenience store on Locust and East 5th. The number on the street sign snagged in his brain. Nine. Four. One. Zero. That wasn’t a code. It was a street number.

His h
