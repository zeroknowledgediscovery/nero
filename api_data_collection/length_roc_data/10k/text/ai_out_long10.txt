The Wildflowers of Dorvan Street
Chapter One: The Petal and the Ash

The bells on the door jingled with that timid, uncertain music that only old shop chimes could summon. They were brass and slightly tarnished, swinging from a frame painted mauve a long time ago, chipped now to show the bare wood. In the early hours, when the sky over Dorvan Street still wore the gray velvet of pre-dawn, the shop was a hush of stems and breath and hands dusted in pollen.

Elaine March, owner of March in Bloom, pushed through the backroom curtain, wiping her palms on her apron. She was forty-seven, crow’s feet lightly tattooed around her eyes, hair braided down her back in a way that looked both accidental and deliberate. There was a stain of crushed marigold on her collarbone, like a sunset someone had tried to bottle and spilled instead.

She greeted the early light with a grumble and a stretch, shivering as the draft wormed under the back door. “Again,” she muttered, and crouched beside the old radiator to give it a thump.

In the front, a vase of freesia trembled. Elaine glanced up. “You’re up early, Peter,” she called.

Peter Henley was twelve and invisible when it suited him. His sneakers, two sizes too big, peeked from behind the display rack. “Didn’t want to miss the dahlias,” he mumbled. “You said they’d be in today.”

Elaine sighed and stood. “I did. Come on, then.” She led him to the crate she’d unpacked an hour ago. The blooms lay still in newspaper wrapping, thick as fists, soaked in a damp silence that seemed holy.

“Why do you like flowers so much?” Peter asked, not for the first time.

Elaine gave her usual answer, which was different each time. “Because they never apologize for being temporary.”

Peter frowned. “That doesn’t make sense.”

Elaine smiled. “Exactly.”

They spent the next hour clipping stems, dunking them into buckets, whispering names that sounded like spells: ranunculus, lisianthus, hellebore. At nine, she opened the doors for real, and the day began in earnest.

Dorvan Street was small but not sleepy. It stretched five blocks between the river and the old train station, lined with shops that hadn’t changed names since Elaine was a girl. Across from March in Bloom was Bellamy’s Books, where Eleanor Bellamy watched the world through lace curtains. Next to the flower shop was a tailor, Mr. Desai, who always smelled like cedar and spoke only when asked.

Customers trickled in — a woman buying a forget-me-not bouquet for her sister’s grave, a man ordering peonies for an apology he hadn’t yet written. Elaine listened, nodded, wrapped the stems in brown paper. She didn’t ask for details; flowers, she believed, were stories with petals, and some stories weren’t hers to know.

By noon, the shop was warm with steam and sunlight. Elaine paused at the window to sip tea, her eyes drifting toward the sidewalk. That’s when she saw him.

The man stood across the street, hands in his coat pockets, watching the shop with a stillness that unnerved her. He was tall, lean, with a slouch like he was hiding from himself. His eyes — she couldn’t tell the color from this far — didn’t flick away when she met them. Instead, he tilted his head, just slightly, and smiled.

Elaine frowned. She didn’t like being observed. But when she blinked, he was gone.

The man returned two days later.

Elaine was trimming hydrangeas, humming something off-key. The bells rang, and she looked up expecting Peter or Eleanor, but it was him.

He moved like someone used to narrow spaces, like alleyways or secrets. He wore a scarf that didn’t match his coat, and his hair was peppered with gray despite a face that couldn’t have passed forty. He didn’t smile this time.

“I’d like a funeral arrangement,” he said.

Elaine nodded slowly. “For someone recently passed?”

The man’s lips twitched. “You could say that.”

She studied him. “Name?”

He hesitated. “Jonathan.”

“Full name, please.”

“Jonathan Vale.” He looked around the shop as though it were a church he’d once believed in. “I’m not sure what they liked, flower-wise.”

“Tell me about them.”

He glanced at the freesia. “She liked poems, I think. And spring. She had a way of laughing when it rained.”

Elaine nodded. “Lilac, then. And maybe bluebells.”

He tilted his head. “Do you always read people like this?”

“No,” she said. “Just ghosts.”

Jonathan’s expression cracked, and a chuckle escaped him. “You’re not like other florists.”

“I’m not sure that’s a compliment.”

“It is. Probably.”

She watched him linger by the peonies. “You knew her well?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he picked up a dried bouquet from the corner display — dusty baby’s breath and thistles — and said, “Why do you keep dead things?”

“To remember what they were.”

He nodded, setting it down. “Maybe I’ll remember, too.”

He left with his arrangement and a receipt, but no change. “Keep it,” he’d said. “For the ghosts.”

Elaine watched him go, the weight of something old settling on her shoulders.

By the time the rains came in April, Jonathan was a regular. He never bought the same flowers twice. Sometimes he came to talk, other times he just stood in the back, watching Elaine work as though her movements spelled something he’d forgotten how to read.

She learned that he’d come from Boston, that he used to teach music theory, and that he had a brother who didn’t speak to him anymore. He learned that she’d once been married, briefly, and that her mother had owned the shop before her.

One morning, he brought her a bundle of violets and said, “For you.”

Elaine raised an eyebrow. “What are you apologizing for?”

“Nothing yet.” His smile was crooked. “Preemptive remorse.”

She didn’t press, but she kept the violets on her workbench.

The days stretched. May arrived with honeysuckle heat. A letter came, slipped under her door with no stamp, no return address. The handwriting was looping, familiar. It read:

You’ve been seen. Tell no one.

Elaine stood in her shop’s silence for a long time, the paper crinkling in her fist. When Peter came by that afternoon, she was jumpier than usual. When Jonathan arrived, she didn’t speak.

He noticed. “What happened?”

She shook her head. “Nothing. Just the wind.”

But he didn’t believe her. And that night, he didn’t return.

It was Peter who found the second letter, taped to the back of the fridge. It was addressed to March’s Bloomkeeper. Inside was a single pressed flower — ghost orchid — and a note that said: He lied. Not who he says. Look deeper. Before the thirteenth.

Elaine stared at the flower, its pale lips curled like secrets.

“Who’s sending these?” Peter asked.

She didn’t answer. Instead, she opened the drawer beneath the register and pulled out an old photo — her mother in the shop, beaming, beside a man whose face had been scratched out.

Below it, an address in Dorvan’s handwriting.

The thirteenth of May dawned pink and uneasy. Elaine closed the shop early. She went to the address.

It was a greenhouse, crumbling at the edge of town, overgrown with ivy and rot. Inside, the air was thick with mildew and memory. And in the center, beneath a hanging basket of morning glories, was a nameplate:

Jonathan Vale. Botanist. 1974–2011.

She stepped back, heart thundering.

Dead. Fourteen years.

But she’d spoken to him. Touched his hand.

Unless—

The bells on the door of her memory jingled again.

And Elaine ran.

Elaine didn’t sleep that night.

The ghost orchid sat on her worktable like a riddle, white and perfect and impossible. She’d placed it in the center of the workbench, beside the still-fresh violets Jonathan had given her. Every few minutes, she’d glance at it as though it might move, confess something. The shop creaked in the wind, but no footsteps came. She brewed tea three times and forgot each cup.

At some point past two in the morning, she opened her old ledger — the one her mother had kept in spidery handwriting, full of sales and notes and coded initials. She flipped through it, looking not for names but for absences. Blank spots. Hidden references. Pages where ink bled too cleanly. And on page ninety-six, she found it.

J.V. - moonflowers (off-book), delivery requested, midnight — no receipt.

The date was from 2009. Two years before the greenhouse plaque. Elaine pressed her fingers to the paper and whispered, “You knew him.”

At dawn, she unlocked the back door and stepped out into the alley behind the shop. It was narrow, mossy, the bricks damp with mist. She followed it to the garden behind the tailor’s, a space she’d always thought abandoned. There, among weeds and forgotten pots, a patch of moonflowers grew. Huge, pale blooms opening to the morning like they had nothing to hide.

Elaine knelt beside them. “What did she do?” she murmured.

“You always talk to flowers?”

The voice behind her wasn’t Peter’s.

She stood slowly, brushing soil from her knees. Jonathan stood in the shadow of the fence, collar up, scarf gone. His eyes were darker than she remembered, less kind.

“You’re supposed to be dead.”

He smiled without warmth. “Aren’t we all, eventually?”

She moved toward him, not trusting her legs. “The greenhouse — the plaque—”

He stepped forward, too close. “I didn’t lie. Not exactly. I am Jonathan Vale. Or was. Names are slippery things when you’re running from the truth.”

“What truth?” she asked, voice barely above wind.

He looked past her, toward the moonflowers. “That sometimes what we bury doesn't stay buried. That some flowers don’t bloom without blood.”

Elaine flinched. “You’re scaring me.”

“I’m trying to help you.”

She crossed her arms, trembling. “Then tell me why someone left a ghost orchid in my shop. Why they said you lied. Why I’m suddenly part of something I never signed up for.”

Jonathan exhaled, like deflating. “Because you reopened the past. You weren’t supposed to find the ledger.”

“I didn’t know I was looking for anything.”

“That’s the worst kind of search,” he said. “The one that starts by accident.”

He handed her a piece of p
