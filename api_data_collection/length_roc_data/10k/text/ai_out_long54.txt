The Kindness of Bows
by E. M. Lorent
Chapter One: The Quiet Strings

Elian Dray stood at the threshold of the shop, fingers wrapped around the case of his violin, reluctant to step out into the frost-touched dawn. The village of Porthlowe still slumbered, chimney smoke curling gently above slate rooftops. He breathed in the salt-tinged air and pushed the door open, stepping into the cold.

He had lived in Porthlowe all of his thirty-two years, and most people knew him as “Elian the Violinist.” Not a flashy title, but a kind one, much like the man himself. His parents had passed years ago, and though he had no siblings, the townsfolk had become his family. He played at the chapel on Sundays, in the square on market days, and in the hall for the rare wedding or funeral. Music was how he spoke to the world, and he played with a heart too tender for the rougher edges of life.

At Hale’s Bakery, the doorbell jingled as he entered. Mrs. Hale, cheeks dusted with flour, smiled without looking up.

“Morning, Elian. Loaf and two rolls, as always?”

“Please,” he said, voice soft and low. “And a small apple tart, if they’re fresh.”

“They came out an hour ago.” She slid the golden pastry into the paper bag, her movements practiced. “Something special today?”

Elian smiled, thinly. “No, just… a feeling.”

He tucked the bag into his satchel and returned to the street, his boots making a crisp sound against the cobblestones. He walked to the town’s small music school, a two-room structure nestled near the chapel, where he taught students who could afford a few coins and those who couldn’t. There, he spent mornings tuning dusty violins, afternoons guiding small fingers across strings, and evenings practicing until the candle burned low.

That morning, however, something was waiting for him.

It came in the form of a letter, left on his music stand, the envelope crisp and the ink on the name smudged as if written in haste: Mr. E. Dray.

He frowned and opened it.

    Dear Mr. Dray,

    I have heard of your talents. A child in our care, named Kaia, has suffered great difficulty and shows a rare gift for music. We ask for your help. Please come to the Greywell Orphanage by the end of the month.

    Respectfully,
    T. Marlin, Headmaster

Elian read the letter twice. Greywell. That was nearly two days east, past the Witherhollow woods and into the inner hills. It was not a place he had ever been, nor one that welcomed visitors. Whispers spoke of strict discipline, stone-faced wards, and a staff that rarely smiled. Still, the letter carried a tone of urgency that touched him.

He did not make decisions lightly, but this one settled into his chest with an odd certainty.

He would go.
Chapter Two: The Road Beyond the Trees

Elian packed that night, tucking spare strings and rosin into the case beside his violin. The morning was a blur of farewells—Mrs. Hale handed him a bundle of wrapped rolls, Father Winstead offered a travel prayer, and the butcher’s boy, Felix, shyly gave him a carved wooden peg for luck.

“Play for the trees,” Felix said, eyes wide. “So they know you’re kind.”

“I will,” Elian promised, touched.

The road to Greywell was a long ribbon of earth and stone, flanked by dense woods that murmured secrets on the wind. He passed through the towns of Mirewell and Brost, staying in modest inns, playing his violin for warm meals and curious ears.

On the second night, he made camp by the edge of Witherhollow, its trees towering and ancient. He lit a small fire and played quietly—songs of home, lullabies, and a piece his mother had once hummed while darning socks.

Somewhere in the dark, something stirred.

He paused.

Out of the shadows came a soft, deliberate rustle. A girl stepped into the flickering light, no older than eleven. She had thick, curly hair, half-tamed by a ribbon, and her eyes held the color of wet stone.

“I heard you,” she said.

Elian’s hand lowered from the strings. “You shouldn’t be out alone. It’s dangerous here.”

“I’m not alone,” she replied. “The woods listen. They always do.”

He blinked, unsure whether to smile or worry.

“What’s your name?” he asked.

“Kaia,” she said simply. “You came for me.”

He straightened. “From Greywell?”

She nodded.

“But… how did you know I’d be here?”

Kaia gave a small shrug. “The trees told me. They said someone kind was coming.”

Elian didn’t laugh. There was something too solemn in her voice. Instead, he offered her a spot by the fire, breaking a roll in half. She took it, ate slowly, and then curled beside the flames as if she had always belonged there.

That night, Elian did not sleep much.
Chapter Three: The Grey Stone Walls

Greywell Orphanage sat atop a low hill, its outer walls gray as weathered bone. Kaia walked beside Elian now, her hand occasionally brushing his coat as if checking he was still real.

They entered through tall iron gates. The garden was bare, the windows shuttered. An older man in a brown waistcoat met them at the entrance, his brows knitted tight.

“You must be Dray.”

“Yes.”

“I’m Tolen Marlin. We’ve been expecting you… though not with Kaia in tow.” His eyes flicked to her. “You were not to leave without escort.”

“She found me,” Elian said. “In the woods.”

Marlin’s mouth opened, then closed. He waved them inside.

The interior was clean but joyless—pale walls, stone floors, and silence that pressed down like a lid. Children walked in pairs, speaking in whispers, eyes always down. Elian’s gut twisted. This was no place for music. And yet—

He taught for two weeks.

The first lesson was met with confusion. The children didn’t know how to respond to kindness or praise. They stiffened when he touched their shoulders, flinched at loud notes. But slowly, they changed. A boy named Wren began humming scales while folding sheets. A girl named Ana tapped rhythms with her spoon.

And Kaia—Kaia bloomed.

She learned with startling speed. By the end of the week, she could mirror his melodies after one listen. She played with ferocity, as though pulling the song from a well buried deep within herself.

“You don’t read music,” he noted.

“It’s just… there,” she whispered.

Elian believed her.

One night, he sat in the courtyard alone, playing under the moonlight. Kaia appeared beside him.

“Will you take me with you when you go?”

He looked at her, startled.

“Why?”

“This place... makes music forget how to live.”

His throat tightened.

“I don’t know if I can,” he said honestly.

But he wanted to.

He desperately wanted to.

Elian watched the town square begin to stir, the slow rustling of awnings being unfurled, carts wheeled out onto cobblestone, and sleepy vendors rubbing their eyes as they arranged apples in neat pyramids. He often found comfort in the rituals of Porthlowe—the sameness of days, the gentle rhythm of life. But that morning, after the letter, the quiet sameness felt like something he'd been inside too long, like air held too long in the lungs. He turned and let his fingers drift over the strings of the violin in his case, not to play, but to feel their presence.

At the music school, he set down his satchel and unlocked the small cupboard that held the loaner instruments. They were battered but functional—gifts from townsfolk, abandoned relics restored with careful hands. He checked the pegs, tightened a chinrest that had come loose, and set up chairs in the usual crescent. The children would arrive soon, their muddy boots clattering down the hallway, laughter echoing despite the rules he'd long since given up enforcing. He welcomed the chaos, the noise that pushed silence away.

At ten sharp, the first to arrive was Clara, a girl of nine with a mop of unruly red hair and an uneven gait from a childhood illness. She smiled shyly and tucked herself into her usual seat. Behind her came Tomas and Mira, siblings who fought often but harmonized beautifully when forced to share a sheet of music. The last was Benjy, always late, always grinning, with a violin too large for his shoulders but a talent that surprised even Elian on good days.

"Let’s warm up with the D major scale," Elian said, his voice calm and low. The children raised their bows in a gesture so familiar it felt sacred.

The sound that filled the room was far from perfect—squeaks, missed notes, uneven rhythm—but it had life. It had breath.

"Again, but think about what you want the note to say," he told them. "Every note you play is a word. And music is how we speak when words fall short."

Benjy snorted, but repeated the scale with more care. Clara closed her eyes, her small hand trembling slightly as she drew the bow slower. Tomas and Mira glanced at each other, adjusted their postures, and played as one.

By the time the lesson ended, Elian felt the weight of the letter again, waiting at the edge of his thoughts like a question unspoken.

After the children had gone and the afternoon light slanted through the windows, he sat alone and played. Not the exercises. Not the waltzes or folk reels. Something of his own making, something woven from the unease in his chest. The notes came like whispers, then like a cry muffled by snowfall. He stopped halfway through and lowered his bow. The silence that followed did not feel gentle.

Later, at the small market inn where he sometimes performed on Saturday nights, Elian took the corner table by the hearth. The barkeep, Randal, slid him a mug of cider without asking.

“You look like someone walked over your grave,” Randal said, leaning on the bar.

“I got a letter,” Elian murmured. “From Greywell.”

Randal's brows lifted. “The orphanage?”

Elian nodded.

“I thought that place was closed.”

“Apparently not.” He sipped the cider. “They’ve got a child. They want me to come teach her.”

Randal chuckled dryly. “Can’t they find someone local?”

Elian didn’t reply.

Randal sobered. “You're actually thinking about going?”

“She came from here, I think,” Elian said. “The way they wrote it, it felt urgent. Like music is the last thing h
