Chapter One: Strings and Shadows

“Dolls are for girls, Eli,” his father said, voice stern as the morning sun cast long shadows through the slats in the workshop wall. “Put that thing down.”

Eli looked down at the porcelain doll in his hands. Its painted blue eyes stared blankly back at him, her dress pale lavender with tiny white buttons, the kind his mother used to sew. His fingers hesitated, the hem of the doll’s skirt caught between his thumb and forefinger. “But she’s broken,” Eli whispered, “and I think I can fix her.”

His father’s boots scuffed the wood floor, a warning sound. “I said put it down.”

So he did. Carefully, like setting down a bird with a wounded wing. Then he turned away, slow, with that familiar shame prickling under his skin like ants.

That night, in the attic where the scent of old cedar and mothballs mixed like something forgotten, Eli found her again. Not the same doll—his father had burned that one in the barrel out back—but another. Cracked jawline, missing an eye. She was buried under old coats and a shattered lampshade, waiting like she’d always been there.

Eli was seven then.

By the time he was twelve, he had learned to hide his repairs. He would take the dolls home from yard sales, dumpsters, left-behinds in alleyways. He gave them new eyes, tiny joints, he even learned how to re-root hair with a felting needle and the fine nylon thread he stole from his mother’s sewing box.

And he never told a soul.

The shop didn’t even have a proper name, just a faded sign above the door that read Fisk’s Antiques & Oddities, half the letters rusted out. It sat between a boarded-up bakery and a laundromat that always smelled faintly of mildew, even on good days. The bell above the door didn’t ring so much as rattle, like a loose tooth, when Eli pushed it open at seventeen.

He had a job interview. Sort of.

Inside was dust and dim light, and a long-limbed man sitting cross-legged on the counter like a praying mantis. His name, he would later learn, was Morven Fisk, and he didn’t believe in clocks or God but had an encyclopedic knowledge of Victorian mourning rituals.

“You’re late,” Morven said, though they’d never set a time.

Eli didn’t respond. His eyes had locked on a glass case in the corner, behind which sat a line of antique dolls, their faces pale with age, their glass eyes sharp and unsettling.

“You like those?” Morven asked.

Eli nodded before he could stop himself.

“Most people don’t.” Morven slid off the counter with unnatural grace. “Come. Let’s see what you can do.”

He handed Eli a doll. China face, cracked down the cheek. One arm missing. The eyes were dulled but not blind.

“Fix her,” Morven said, voice like a challenge. “If you can.”

It took Eli an hour. He didn’t have his usual tools, but he had fingers like surgeons, quick and careful. When he was done, the doll looked nearly new—no, not new. Better. As if she’d lived through something and come out the other side with a quiet kind of pride.

Morven smiled, slow and wide. “You’ll do.”

The back room of Fisk’s was nothing like the front. Where the front was dust and broken things, the back was… precise. Tools arranged like surgical instruments, shelves filled with vials of pigments, glues, waxes, and stranger things. Some of the jars had labels in languages Eli didn’t recognize. Some had no labels at all.

“This is where the real work happens,” Morven said. “Restoration. Preservation. Memory.”

Eli ran a finger along the edge of a glass shelf. It was cold. “Of what?”

Morven’s eyes glittered, catlike. “Of things people want to forget.”

The first odd thing happened two weeks in.

The doll he’d restored—her name had been stitched into her skirt hem: Josephine—was sitting on the front counter. But he hadn’t put her there. She was supposed to be in the back, boxed for pickup.

And she was crying.

Not sobbing. Not loud. Just a quiet drip-drip of porcelain tears, streaking down her cheeks like rain on glass. Eli stared at her for a long time before he touched her, unsure if he was awake.

“She liked you,” Morven said, appearing from nowhere like he always did. “They remember, sometimes.”

Eli wanted to ask what remembered. The dolls? The ghosts in them? The people they belonged to?

But he didn’t.

He just nodded, and got back to work.

By the end of the year, Eli knew every creak of the floorboards and every trick of the glass. He’d learned how to replicate 19th-century wax composition. How to blend pigment into bone china. How to remove stains that had been there longer than he’d been alive.

He’d also learned that some dolls shouldn’t be fixed.

Like the one that arrived in a parcel with no return address. Her mouth sewn shut with gold thread. Her body soft, filled with something that felt like dried lavender and something else—something that crunched.

“She’s not broken,” Morven had said, when Eli reached for his tools.

“But—”

“She’s quieted.”

Eli didn’t ask what that meant. He never saw her again.

It wasn’t until the woman came in—the tall one with eyes like rust—that things began to change.

“I’m looking for something… unique,” she said, voice like silk over stone.

Morven was watching her with an unreadable expression. “A specific kind of unique?”

She smiled, all teeth. “A doll. One that holds memory.”

Morven gestured to the shelves. “You’ll find no shortage here.”

She didn’t even glance at them. Her eyes found Eli instead.

“You’re the one who repairs them.”

He nodded, stiff.

She reached into her coat and pulled out a box, small and wooden, stained darker in one corner like old blood. She set it on the counter and slid it toward him.

“Fix her.”

Eli opened the lid.

Inside was a doll. No taller than his hand. No arms. No face.

But when he looked at it, something looked back.

He closed the lid quickly.

“I don’t know if—”

“She remembers everything,” the woman said, her smile never touching her eyes. “Even the things you’d rather she didn’t.”

Eli looked at Morven. He gave no sign of protest. No help either.

So he took the box.

That night, he dreamed of hands that weren’t his.

It took three days before he even opened the box again. And when he did, he found the doll changed.

There were now threads where her eyes should be. Red and twitching.

And a whisper that followed him down the stairs: “We are still here.”

The doll didn’t want to be repaired.

She resisted. Glue turned to dust. Thread unraveled itself. Paint peeled before it dried. And every night, Eli heard footsteps in the attic, though no one had been up there since he was a child.

“She’s a vessel,” Morven said finally. “Some are.”

“For what?”

But Morven only smiled. “Let me know what she shows you.”

Eli wanted to throw the doll into the furnace.

But he didn’t.

Because part of him wanted to know.

What did she remember?

Who had she been?

And more importantly—what had been taken from her?

Late one night, as rain tapped the windows like curious fingers, Eli stitched a new face onto the doll. Thread like veins, eyes like mirrors. When he finished, he whispered her a name.

“Lilith.”

She blinked.

And smiled.

The attic door creaked open behind him.

And the real story began.

Eli didn’t turn around at the sound. The attic door always creaked—it was part of the house’s language, a voice he’d learned to ignore—but this time it had a different quality. Not just old hinges complaining, but something else, a subtle invitation. The kind of opening that didn't just announce presence, but asked to be noticed. He sat still, the needle still between his fingers, the last stitch in Lilith’s neck glinting in the lamp’s orange glow.

Behind him, the air shifted.

At first it felt like a draft. But then he realized the shift wasn’t in temperature, but in weight. The room grew heavier. As if someone had added something unseen to the air. Or maybe it wasn’t air at all—maybe it was memory.

“Lilith?” he said softly, voice nearly lost in the hush of rain and wood.

She didn’t move. Her eyes, once thread, now small disks of smoky glass, stared blankly at the beam above. Her mouth, stitched delicately with silver filament, seemed poised to speak. But she didn’t. Not yet.

The attic door shut. Slowly. With care.

Eli turned then. But nothing stood in the stairwell. No person, no shadow.

Still, he felt watched.

He gathered Lilith in his arms, wrapping her in the thick cotton cloth he used for transport, and descended the stairs. Each step felt twice as long as it should’ve. Like time had pulled taut around him, the way it did in nightmares—where running felt like drowning, and waking came too late.

The shop below was quiet. The kind of quiet that wasn’t peace, but pressure. Something held its breath here, and he didn’t want to disturb it.

Morven sat behind the counter, his long fingers drumming against a closed ledger. The ticking of the clock above the door was the only rhythm in the room, but even that seemed sluggish. Morven watched Eli approach, his eyes like old coins.

“She’s awake,” Eli said, though he wasn’t sure if it was true.

Morven nodded once. “And what did she say?”

“Nothing. Yet.”

Morven leaned forward, as if the question had teeth. “But she will.”

Eli placed Lilith gently on the velvet cloth laid over the front desk. She looked so small now, so fragile. It was hard to imagine he’d felt fear looking into that face just days ago. But now, with her form complete, her limbs reattached, her torso repainted and sealed, she no longer looked broken. She looked ready.

Morven reached for a small bell beneath the counter, one Eli hadn’t noticed before. It was black iron, shaped more like a chalice than a bell, and when he rang it, the sound was deep—not high and clear, but low and bone-thick, like a hum from beneath the ground. Eli felt it in his chest.

“She’ll speak now,” Morven said.

But she didn’t. Not immediately.

What happened instead was stranger.

The lights dimmed—not flickered, but lowered, as though something enormous had pas
