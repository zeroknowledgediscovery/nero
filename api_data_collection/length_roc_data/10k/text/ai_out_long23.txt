Title: "Dust and Thunder"

Chapter One: The Wind Knows No Master

The morning sun cracked over the horizon like an egg over hot iron, spilling yolk-colored light across the Wyoming plains. The wind ran wild through the buffalo grass, tugging at loose boards on the weather-beaten barn and whispering secrets through the skeletal remains of barbed-wire fences. Hawks circled high overhead, tracing slow ellipses in the pale sky.

Carter Hayes rose before the sun as always. He’d never needed an alarm. His bones told time better than any clock. His dog, Mags, a grizzled blue heeler, limped alongside him as he stepped onto the porch, sipping hot black coffee from a cracked enamel mug. The wood beneath his boots creaked as if protesting the weight of another day.

"Storm’s comin'," Carter muttered to no one but Mags, who just huffed, eyes squinting against the breeze.

Hayes Ranch had been in Carter’s family since 1886. Five generations had plowed, fenced, grazed, and bled on these acres. Now, it was just him and a hired hand named Silas, who hadn't shown up sober in a week and spoke more to his whiskey than to Carter. The cattle were low in number, water scarcer than it ought to be, and debts taller than the tallest cottonwood. Still, Carter couldn’t imagine living anywhere else.

The ranch wasn't just a place. It was the only thing that hadn't walked away.

By midmorning, he was on horseback, riding out to check on a downed fence line near the creek. The wind was fierce, throwing grit into his eyes and whistling a tune older than memory. As he approached the bend in the creek, he spotted tire tracks—fresh ones. Too wide for his truck, too shallow for Silas’s beat-up Ford. His horse, Duke, snorted uneasily.

Carter dismounted, crouching to feel the dirt. Damp. Whoever it was had passed through maybe half an hour ago. And they hadn't gone through the front gate. Trespassers out here didn’t just mean disrespect. They meant danger.

Back at the ranch house that night, Carter stared long into the fire. Mags curled at his feet, twitching in her sleep. The wind had died down, leaving only silence and unease. Someone had been watching. He could feel it—like a weight in the air.

In the town of Clearwater, twenty-three miles east of the ranch, Sheriff Lorraine "Rainey" Bell sipped lukewarm coffee and scowled at the paperwork piling on her desk. She missed the days when being sheriff meant riding out to break up fights at the bar and checking on Miss Harper's chickens. Now there were bigger problems. Meth. Disappearances. Outsiders buying up land with oil money and promises that stank like old blood.

She glanced up when Deputy Kirk poked his head in. "We got a call from the Hayes place. Carter says someone's been poking around."

Rainey leaned back in her chair. "How recent?"

"This morning. He didn’t see anyone, just the tracks."

Her brow furrowed. "Get the cruiser. We’ll pay him a visit."

Carter wasn’t surprised to see the cruiser kick up dust down the long drive around noon. He met Rainey at the gate.

"You look like you haven’t slept in a week," she said, stepping out of the car.

"I sleep fine," Carter lied. "It's the days that wear me down."

"Tell me about the tracks."

As they walked the fence line together, Carter explained what he'd seen. Rainey crouched where he’d pointed, tracing the edges of a print with her gloved hand.

"Not local," she muttered. "Tread pattern’s wrong. And see this?"

Carter nodded. A cigarette butt, the paper crisp and unmarred by moisture. Whoever dropped it hadn’t been here long.

"Think someone’s after your land?"

"Wouldn’t be the first time."

"You still getting letters?"

Carter didn’t answer. His eyes drifted west, toward the hills where the sky seemed lower, heavier. Letters had come. Slick envelopes with corporate logos. Offers that felt more like threats. Oil companies, real estate developers, even a resort chain. But something about this latest intrusion felt different.

That night, Silas came stumbling into the bunkhouse drunk and mumbling about voices in the trees. Carter almost ignored it—Silas often heard things after a bottle—but the way his eyes wouldn’t stop darting around gave him pause.

“Big truck,” Silas whispered. “Blacked-out windows. Parked up on Dead Man’s Ridge. Saw it with my own eyes.”

Carter’s fists clenched.

Three days later, the storm rolled in—an honest-to-God spring squall that darkened the sky like war. Carter was rounding up strays when the wind turned savage, herding clouds like stampeding bulls. Lightning danced over the hills, and thunder cracked like the earth itself was splitting.

Through the sheets of rain, Carter saw it. Headlights—two of them—cutting through the curtain of water just beyond the rise. He pushed Duke hard, hooves throwing up mud as they climbed the ridge. The truck was gone by the time he reached it, but the grass bore fresh tire scars.

This time, there was something more.

Buried just off the side of the road, half-covered in mud and gravel, was a boot. Still on the foot of a man. Dead. Facedown. No ID. No phone.

By the time the sheriff arrived, the rain had stopped but the air hung heavy with ozone and secrets.

“Whoever did this didn’t mean for him to be found,” Rainey muttered, squinting into the gathering dusk.

Carter just stared down at the body. Something in the man’s hand caught his eye—a scrap of cloth. Navy blue. Embroidered with a gold ‘H.’

“Looks like he tried to fight back,” Carter said.

“Know anyone wears that brand?”

Carter’s jaw tightened. “I might.”

In the weeks that followed, the quiet war intensified. Cattle went missing. A shed burned down. Silas vanished one night and was found three days later, nearly frozen and babbling nonsense about black helicopters and men in masks. Rainey tried to investigate, but the body from the ridge disappeared from the morgue before an autopsy could be done. No records. No fingerprints.

One morning, Carter received a package on his porch. No return address. Inside: a photograph of his father, long dead, sitting beside a man Carter didn’t recognize. The same embroidered ‘H’ on the man's coat.

Carter poured himself a stiff drink. “What the hell were you mixed up in, Dad?”

Meanwhile, trouble was brewing in Clearwater. A young woman named Lila Morgan, a journalist from Denver, showed up asking too many questions. She said she was investigating land fraud and water rights, but Carter didn't believe that was the whole story.

“You’re not here for water,” he said when she cornered him in the feed store.

She blinked. “Excuse me?”

“You’ve got city hands. No one drives three hours out here to talk irrigation policy.”

Lila hesitated, then leaned in. “I think there’s something bigger going on out here, Mr. Hayes. Something people have died over.”

“You don’t say.”

“You’ve seen the letters, haven’t you? The ‘offers’? What if I told you some of those companies don’t exist?”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean they’re shells. Fronts. Money moves, names change. And every time a rancher refuses to sell, something bad happens.”

Carter stared at her. “Why you? Why are you looking into this?”

“My father died out here,” she said quietly. “Twenty years ago. They said it was a ranching accident. I don’t believe that anymore.”

The fire in her eyes reminded him of someone. Himself, maybe, back when he still believed the truth could save anything.

“All right,” he said. “But you’d better learn to ride.”

Their uneasy alliance bore fruit faster than either expected. Lila unearthed property records, lease transfers, LLC filings—all pointing to a single name buried deep in the paper trail: Holloway Energy. A conglomerate with more influence than most governments and a reputation for burying problems.

The 'H' on the cloth.

Carter remembered his father’s old stories. Rumors of a deal gone wrong in the seventies. Drilling rigs that poisoned the creek. A whistleblower that vanished. And a debt that had never quite been repaid.

The past was catching up.

One night, as thunder rolled in the distance again, Carter saddled up, rifle slung over his shoulder, and headed for the hills. Lila followed, recorder in her jacket pocket. What they found on Dead Man’s Ridge wasn’t a truck, but a hatch in the earth—half-buried, rusted, and bolted shut.

“I think we just found the real reason they want this land,” Lila whispered.

To be continued...

Carter stood at the edge of the hatch, the toe of his boot nudging aside the weeds and soil clumped around the rusted lip. The thing looked like it hadn't been opened in decades, yet there were fresh scuff marks in the dirt, as if someone had been down there recently. Lila crouched beside it, running her fingers along a welded seam.

“This wasn’t built by ranchers,” she said. “This is military-grade steel. Industrial. And look at that—”

She pointed to a faint symbol etched into the metal. A triangle within a circle, surrounded by a ring of letters too faded to read. Carter squinted, something stirring in the back of his mind, a memory long buried—his father, shouting in the middle of the night, back when Carter was just a boy. Something about “them coming back,” and “the doors that should’ve stayed shut.” It had made no sense then. Now it twisted in his gut like a live wire.

“This goes deeper than water rights,” Carter said, his voice low.

“I think it’s a site. Government. Cold War era, maybe. Whatever it is, they don’t want anyone finding it,” Lila said, her tone brisk, professional, but her eyes betrayed the tremor of unease creeping into her spine.

They didn’t try to open it then. Carter was pragmatic—he didn’t go poking around holes in the ground without knowing what was on the other side. But when they returned to the ridge the next morning with tools, the hatch was gone. Not just closed—gone. Like the earth had never been disturbed. Grass laid neatly, fresh sod in place. It was unnatural, too clean. Lila paled, biting back a curse.

“Someone’s watching us,”
