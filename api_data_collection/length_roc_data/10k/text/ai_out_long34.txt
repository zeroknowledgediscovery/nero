Chapter One: The Stranger with the Blue Pen

It was the sort of rain that painted the windows in streaks and made the trees outside wobble like bad reflections. Eliza sat by the second-floor window of the Glenmore Public Library, the sleeves of her grey sweater tucked over her hands as she pretended to read the same page for the fourth time. Eighteen years old, freshly graduated, and stuck in the sort of limbo that comes after the end of something you thought would matter more.

The library smelled of old paper and lemon cleaner. Eliza found a sort of stubborn comfort in that.

"You're not really reading that, are you?" a voice interrupted, male and too clear, like a piano note played when you didn’t expect it.

Eliza looked up, blinking. Standing over her, half-leaned on the bookcase like he'd been there forever, was a man with a navy coat and wet hair clinging to his forehead. His smile was subtle—tilted at the corner—and his eyes were the color of steel before a storm. He looked young, maybe mid-twenties, but the kind of young that had grown up too fast.

"I'm—uh—" she started, then laughed awkwardly, shutting the book, which was upside down. "Caught red-handed."

He held out a hand. "Adam. I’m your tutor. For English."

Of course. Her mother had set it up without telling her. Something about improving her essay skills before college started. Typical.

“Eliza,” she said, shaking his hand. His grip was firm but not too much. Confident. “You’re late.”

“Fashionably,” he replied with a grin.

They sat across from each other at the long wooden table in the reading room. The walls here were lined with forgotten encyclopedias and empty globe stands. As Adam pulled out a blue pen and clicked it twice, Eliza tried not to notice how well his shirt fit or the curve of his mouth when he concentrated.

“So, tell me,” he said, tapping her notebook with the pen cap, “why do you think The Catcher in the Rye still gets assigned every year?”

She rolled her eyes. “Because adults love to pretend they understand teenagers.”

Adam laughed, not patronizing but with a genuine warmth. “Okay, fair. But I think it’s because it’s a book that admits confusion without trying to solve it.”

He talked differently than other adults. Less like he was teaching, more like he was thinking out loud and she just happened to be listening.

They spent the next hour arguing about metaphors and the futility of symbolism. When the library lights flickered, signaling closing time, Eliza realized she hadn’t looked at the clock once.

As they packed up, Adam looked at her directly, his voice a shade more serious. “You’ve got a good brain, Eliza. Don’t pretend otherwise.”

She flushed. No one had said that to her in years—not without it sounding like an obligation. She watched him walk out into the rain, umbrella-less and careless.

And just like that, the library didn’t feel like such a dead place anymore.

Chapter Two: Of Sonnets and Secrets

By their third session, Eliza had started dressing differently. Nothing obvious—just more deliberate. A touch of mascara, a cleaner sweater, once even a blouse that made her mother raise an eyebrow but say nothing. She wasn’t sure why. Or at least she told herself that.

Adam noticed, of course. He noticed everything. He never said anything, but his eyes flickered, lingered a moment too long, and Eliza felt like a book with pages suddenly interesting.

“So, Shakespeare,” he said that day, dropping a crumpled photocopy of Sonnet 130 on the table. “‘My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun.’ Romantic or tragic?”

“Definitely sarcastic,” she said, leaning forward. “Like he’s mocking those flowery poets.”

Adam raised a brow. “But what if it’s real love? Not idealized. Not dreamy. Just... grounded.”

Eliza tilted her head. “You think that’s more romantic?”

“I think pretending someone’s perfect is lazy,” he replied. “Seeing their flaws and choosing them anyway—that’s something.”

There was a silence that followed. Not awkward. Not quite. Just filled with things unsaid. Her pencil tapped against the paper softly, and she found herself writing down his words in the margin.

Later, while waiting for her bus, Adam walked out of the library with a paperback tucked under his arm. He stopped beside her. “You live near Holloway Road, right?”

“Yeah,” she said slowly.

“I’m headed that way.”

They walked together, leaves crunching underfoot, a light wind teasing Eliza’s scarf. They talked about movies—he hated romantic comedies, she loved them ironically. He confessed a childhood obsession with Greek myths. She told him how her father used to read her fairy tales with tragic endings, because “they were more honest.”

When they reached her street, she hesitated.

“You ever feel,” she said, looking at the cracks in the sidewalk, “like everyone else got a script and you’re just improvising?”

“All the time,” Adam said. “But sometimes that’s where the best lines come from.”

She smiled, unsure whether it was the cold or his words that made her shiver.

Chapter Three: The Tension Between Lines

The sessions continued. Twice a week. Then thrice. Her essays improved, sure. But more than that, Eliza found herself anticipating the hours. The way Adam twirled his pen. The way he’d pause before offering a compliment. The smell of his cologne, woodsy and faint.

Her mother remained unaware. Or pretended to be.

“Make sure you’re not distracting him,” she warned once, when Eliza mentioned how funny Adam was.

“I’m the one being tutored,” Eliza replied, a little too quickly.

In early November, during a lesson on Sylvia Plath, things shifted. Adam read aloud from “Mad Girl’s Love Song,” his voice even, but his eyes didn’t leave hers.

“I think I made you up inside my head.”

The silence after was different. Loaded. Electric.

Eliza exhaled, too loudly. “Isn’t it ironic? That a love poem can sound so lonely.”

Adam nodded. “Loneliness isn’t the opposite of love. Sometimes it’s part of it.”

They didn’t touch. They didn’t move. But something had changed.

That night, Eliza wrote in her journal, the ink smudging as she confessed the things she couldn’t say out loud:

I know this is wrong. I also know I’ve never felt more seen.

Chapter Four: Boundaries and Broken Rules

The first time they touched wasn’t romantic. It was casual—an accidental brush of fingers when they both reached for the same book. But Eliza felt it in her stomach. That sharp, uncontrollable flutter.

Adam, to his credit, pulled his hand away quickly. Too quickly.

“Sorry,” he muttered.

“It’s fine,” she said, though her voice was higher than she intended.

After that, they kept a polite distance. But it was the kind of politeness that felt like pretending.

At one point, he stopped scheduling weekly meetings and instead said, “Let me know when you want help.”

She texted him two days later.

They met at a café this time. Neutral ground. Adam wore a dark sweater and glasses she hadn’t seen before.

“You look different,” she said.

He shrugged. “Just tired.”

The essay topic was Virginia Woolf. But they didn’t get far.

“Eliza, this—” he began, then stopped. “I shouldn’t say this.”

“Then don’t,” she said. But she was smiling, and that was a problem.

“I think about you,” he admitted anyway. “More than I should.”

She stared at him, heart racing.

“I’m not asking for anything,” he added quickly. “I just—if I’m distant, it’s because I have to be.”

She looked down at her untouched tea. “And if I don’t want distance?”

“Eliza.”

His voice was low. Her name sounded different in his mouth—heavier.

She reached across the table, fingertips brushing his hand. He didn’t move away this time.

“I’m not a child,” she whispered.

“I know,” he said, eyes closed. “That’s what makes this so damn hard.”

They sat like that for a while, hands touching but not holding, silence thick between them.

When she finally got up to leave, Adam didn’t follow.

But neither of them pretended it hadn’t happened.

Eliza had always thought of libraries as hushed sanctuaries, more suited to fading voices and dusty stories than moments of unexpected connection. But as she watched Adam cross the lobby, one hand running through his damp hair, she found her reality folding in on itself, reshaping quietly. There was a strange gravity about him—unhurried, like he didn’t mind being late to the rest of the world. She remained seated, unsure whether she should feel irritated at the intrusion or grateful for it.

When he returned, he had a stack of books in his arms. He placed them down with a gentle thump on the table between them, each one looking older than the last. Worn spines. Annotated margins. Eliza raised an eyebrow. "You planning to assign me a dissertation?"

He grinned and slid one toward her. "Not quite. But I figured if you’re going to improve your writing, you might as well steal from the greats."

She flipped the cover open, surprised to see notes in tight cursive inked into the margins. “Whose are these?”

“Mine,” he said, and he wasn’t bragging. “You’ll find I’m incapable of reading anything without arguing with it.”

“Sounds exhausting,” she murmured, running a finger down one of the annotations. “Or maybe just lonely.”

He looked up at her sharply. “Maybe both.”

Something about the way he said it gave her pause. She was used to teachers talking like they lived above the world, floating somewhere in the clouds of authority and detachment. But Adam didn’t talk to her like she was a student. He didn’t tower or condescend. If anything, he made her feel as though the space between them was the only part of the world not governed by some external rule.

They dove into a session that meandered from Hemingway’s restraint to the seductive pull of Virginia Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness. Eliza, who’d once claimed to hate English literature, found herself leaning into the pages, her pen dancing between thoughts she didn’t know she had. Every time Adam posed a question, it felt less like a test and more
