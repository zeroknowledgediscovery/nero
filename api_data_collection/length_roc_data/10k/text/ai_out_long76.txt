Chapter One: The Edge of the Map

The rain had started about twenty miles back, right as the sign for Dovetail had appeared crooked and rust-gnawed in the ditch. Silas Mercer didn’t slow the car. If anything, his foot pressed heavier on the gas, as if he could race the past to the town line and arrive just early enough to pretend it hadn’t followed.

He hadn’t wanted to come back. Not for the funeral. Not for the will. Not for any of it.

The gravel driveway was narrower than he remembered, lined with saplings now that hadn't existed twenty years ago, but the Mercer house stood just the same—slouched between two barren oaks, its paint sun-bleached and shedding like old skin. The porch light flickered dimly in the daylight, a sickly eye blinking on and off, but Silas ignored it. He parked, shut off the engine, and let the silence of the place rush in. Dovetail’s silence wasn’t empty. It hummed.

Inside, the house still smelled like cedar and decay. No one had aired it out since his father died two weeks ago, and the scent of mold laced the edges of the living room, curling up from the floorboards. Silas didn’t set down his bag. He didn’t take off his coat. He just stood and looked. Same green velvet couch. Same cracked photo of the mountain lake. Same silence.

Then a voice: “Took you long enough.”

He turned. Her voice hadn’t changed—Dana’s. She stood in the kitchen doorway, arms crossed over a patched wool sweater, hair tied back the way it always had been when they were kids. He hadn’t known she still lived in town. Or maybe he had, and just didn’t let himself think on it.

“I didn’t think you’d be here,” he said.

“You’re not the only one who gets named in a will.”

They stared for a beat. Dana’s expression was unreadable, the way it had always been. She moved first, brushing past him to the living room. “It’s all still here,” she muttered. “You’d think twenty years would be enough to change a place.”

“Nothing changes in Dovetail,” Silas said.

She gave him a look that was half smirk, half something darker. “Not even the dead.”

The will was on the old roll-top desk, folded neatly inside an envelope that bore his father’s handwriting. Silas didn’t open it. He just stared at it, waiting for it to make sense.

“Are you going to read it or are we going to sit here like ghosts?” Dana asked, lighting a cigarette and leaning against the wall.

He opened it.

The terms were strange. Not surprising. Jeremiah Mercer had always been a man of secrets and conditions. The house was to be split between Silas and Dana. Neither could sell without the other’s agreement. Neither could tear it down. And—most oddly—neither could leave for more than a week at a time for the next year.

“I’m sorry, what?” Dana said, squinting at the paper.

“That’s what it says,” Silas replied, reading it again.

“A year?”

“A year.”

Dana scoffed. “So what, we’re prisoners in this creaking crypt for twelve months or we lose everything?”

“There’s more.” Silas turned the page over. “He says the land hides something. That it belongs to the blood. And that if we leave it unguarded, something old will come back.”

Dana blinked. “He was insane.”

Silas didn’t answer. Because Jeremiah Mercer had not been insane. He had been cruel, obsessive, maybe—but not insane. And he’d been right about other things. Things Silas had tried for decades to forget.

Like the black root they’d found one summer behind the barn, bleeding sap. Or the voices that sometimes echoed from the well even after it had gone dry.

Or the boy from down the ridge who’d gone missing in ‘97, last seen near their land, and never found.

“I’m not staying here a year,” Dana said. “I have a life.”

“So did I.”

They were quiet after that. The house sighed around them.

That night, the floorboards creaked.

Not from them. They were both in their rooms, doors locked out of old habit. But the creaks were different now—heavier. Like the boards remembered other footsteps. Larger ones.

Silas didn’t sleep. He sat at the edge of the bed and listened.

At three-thirteen a.m., the grandfather clock in the hall—long broken—chimed once.

The days that followed unraveled like old rope.

They cleaned. They argued. They discovered the cellar door was nailed shut from the outside.

“There’s no lock,” Dana said. “Just nails.”

Silas didn’t respond. He just went to the garage and got the crowbar.

The cellar was colder than it should’ve been. Not just cool—but cold, breath-visible cold. The light from his phone barely pierced the shadows, and the air smelled like wet stone and rust.

“What’s that?” Dana asked, pointing to the far wall.

He moved closer.

Etched into the stone was a sigil—jagged, intersecting lines, almost tribal, but with something too deliberate about it. The grooves were deep. Fresh.

“Someone’s been down here,” Silas muttered.

“Or something,” Dana said under her breath.

They didn’t stay long in the cellar. When they came back up, they found the front door wide open. Neither of them had opened it.

The town hadn’t changed much.

The diner still served the same watery coffee. Old Mr. Halpern still ran the general store. But people looked at Silas with the same sidelong glances they had when he’d left. The Mercer family was never liked. Jeremiah had made sure of that.

But something had shifted.

At the edge of the woods, the trees looked wrong. Tilted, as if leaning in. And Dana swore she saw a shape—tall, stooped, bone-thin—watching the house from the tree line the second night after they arrived.

“You think this is what he meant?” she asked. “Something old coming back?”

Silas didn’t answer. But he started locking the doors at night.

By the end of the first week, the dreams started.

Silas dreamed of fire and earth. Of hands clawing upward from under the roots. Of a voice like gravel whispering his name from beneath the floorboards.

He woke one morning to find mud on the carpet. Not his. Not Dana’s.

“Check your shoes,” he said.

Dana did. So did he. Clean.

They followed the trail back to the cellar door.

It was open.

“No,” Dana said. “Nope. I am not doing this again.”

“We didn’t open it,” Silas said.

She stared at him. “Are you listening to yourself? Why are we still here?”

“Because if we leave—something worse might.”

Dana hesitated, then looked out the window toward the trees. “It’s already here.”

The next day, they found the first dead animal. A raccoon. Body whole. Eyes missing.

A symbol carved into its side.

It matched the one in the cellar.

They called the sheriff.

He didn’t come.

“Just a prank,” the voice on the line said. “Kids. Animals die. Don’t waste our time.”

That night, the lights went out.

And the clock chimed thirteen.

Silas stood in the foyer holding a flashlight, the only source of light now that the power had gone. The beam jittered slightly in his hand, not from the cold but something more elemental—something beneath the skin that trembled on its own accord. From the living room, Dana emerged with a lantern they had found in the garage, the flame inside flickering erratically as if disturbed by a wind that wasn’t there.

“Power lines must’ve gone down in the storm,” she offered, though the words rang false even as she said them.

“There was no storm,” Silas replied, quietly. “It was clear.”

They both looked toward the windows. No lightning. No wind. Just the heavy, pregnant dark pressing against the glass from outside. The kind of dark that felt full, as if something waited just beyond it, watching through invisible eyes.

“I checked the fuse box,” Dana said. “Everything’s in place.”

“Then it’s not the fuse,” Silas answered, already knowing the answer but needing the words aloud to believe it.

They moved through the house slowly, lighting candles, setting the lantern in the hall. Shadows jumped and shifted along the walls, mimicking them with grotesque exaggerations. The grandfather clock, silent again after its impossible chime, stood like a sentry at the mouth of the hallway, its pendulum unmoving.

In the kitchen, they found the back door ajar. Silas hadn’t noticed it earlier. He approached slowly, cautiously, then pushed it shut with the flat of his palm. It didn’t click into place. The latch hung crooked, as if someone had forced the door open from the outside.

Dana came up behind him. “There’s something in the woods.”

Silas looked at her. “You saw it again?”

She nodded. “It moved this time. Just for a second. But it was tall. Pale. And it knew I was watching.”

“You think it’s a person?”

“I don’t know,” she said, her voice lower now, edged with something near fear. “I don’t think people move like that.”

They didn’t speak much after that. The house had changed. Or perhaps it had simply returned to what it always had been. The place hummed again—not with noise, but with pressure, like standing beneath a heavy sky before a thunderclap.

They slept little that night. When sleep came for Silas, it did so violently. One moment he was staring at the ceiling, the next, he was in a dream too vivid to dismiss. He stood in the cellar, surrounded by those etchings—more of them now, covering the walls, floor, even the beams overhead. Blood ran in thin rivulets between the carvings, and something breathed behind the stone. A slow, gravel-slick inhalation. Then, in the far corner, a door appeared—one that hadn’t been there before, half buried in the dirt. He stepped toward it. The breath quickened.

When he awoke, his feet were muddy. The soles of his socks wet.

He tore them off and threw them into the waste bin. Didn’t tell Dana.

She had her own trouble.

At breakfast, she sat across from him, eyes rimmed red. “It called to me,” she said, barely above a whisper. “Last night. In the dark. It was... under the bed. It whispered my name.”

Silas said nothing.

“What did we come back to?” she asked. “Why would he keep this place? Why would he trap us here?”

“Because he knew,” Silas said. “Because he knew what was buried here, and he knew it was w
