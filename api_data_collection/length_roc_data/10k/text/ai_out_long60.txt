Chapter One: Dust Rising

The sun cracked open the Texas sky like a furnace lid, heat shimmering over the endless stretch of rust-colored plain. Beyond the town of Garza Ridge, where the land forgot how to bend and trees dared not grow too tall, a single engine pickup coughed its way down a dirt road, trailing a cloud of grit and memory.

Cole Maddox sat behind the wheel, a Marlboro clamped in his teeth, flame licking up from a dented Zippo as he lit it. The ashtray overflowed. Country music on the radio crackled between static and heartache. Behind him, strapped under tarp and rope, was a steel case—long, black, and heavy enough to have its own story. He didn’t look back at it. Didn’t have to. He knew what was in there.

Garza Ridge hadn’t changed. That was the first thing he noticed. The feed store still leaned like it was drunk on moonshine, the diner still had its “Open 7 Days” sign half-lit, and Sheriff Buckley's office had the same cracked steps leading to the front porch, where a mutt named Greeley lay sleeping like he owned the place.

Cole rolled down his window as he passed through town, tipped his hat at no one in particular, and turned west where the gravel grew coarser. He wasn’t back for a reunion. He was back because someone had called him in the middle of the night and said one word before the line went dead: “June.”

She’d been dead eight years.

He remembered her laugh—like wind chimes caught in a storm—and her eyes that always looked like they were seeing something two seconds before everyone else. She’d drowned in Redman Lake, or so they said. Her car found wrapped around a cottonwood, keys still in the ignition, a trail of footprints ending at the waterline.

Only they’d never found her body.

Cole pulled up to the edge of the Maddox ranch, a skeletal remnant of better days. The barn roof was caved in on the east side, and buzzards circled lazily above the northern paddock where nothing had grazed in years. He stepped out, boots crunching dirt, and took a long look. The wind had a way of whispering here—sounded like her voice sometimes.

“Cole.”

He turned. Sheriff Buckley stood by a squad car, his thumbs looped through his belt. Still wore that faded Stetson, still looked like he hadn’t smiled since the Nixon years.

“Figured I’d see you,” Buckley said.

Cole nodded. “Did you make the call?”

Buckley didn’t answer right away. He looked past Cole, at the truck. “Nope. Thought it mighta been you playin’ some game.”

Cole shook his head. “I got the call same as you.”

That put a wrinkle in Buckley’s already creased brow. “What’d they say?”

“One word. Her name.”

“June.”

Silence hung between them, thick as the heat.

“I’m guessin’ you didn’t come back just to ask questions.”

“I came back to bury something,” Cole said, glancing at the steel case. “And maybe dig something else up.”

Inside the ranch house, the air was stale with memory. Cole walked through it like a man wading through ghosts. Photos still hung on the walls—his dad with his rifle, his mom in a Sunday dress, and June, framed by a crooked smile, standing beside Cole in front of a bonfire that burned thirty feet high.

He poured himself a drink. Whiskey. The bottle hadn’t moved since the funeral.

That night, sleep didn’t come. Around two a.m., he heard the knock. Slow. Deliberate. Three taps.

He opened the door, and there was no one there. Just wind and dust.

Then he looked down.

A Polaroid lay on the doormat. It was a picture of June. But not old. Not faded. She was older. Today older. Her hair cut different. A scar on her cheek that hadn’t been there before. And behind her, something that made his blood chill: the old well near the Tarry Creek bend. The one they’d sealed up in ‘96.

Cole pocketed the photo and went back inside. Poured another glass. This time it trembled in his hand.

Chapter Two: Blood in the Well

The next morning, Cole drove to Tarry Creek. He hadn’t been out that way in a decade. The bridge was half-rotted, the creek little more than a trickle now, but the well was still there. A rusted ring of stones hidden under thorn brush, covered in dead vines and whispers.

He parked, checked the case in the back again, then stepped into the brush. The air grew cooler the closer he got, like the well pulled heat out of the ground itself.

Something shimmered in the shadows.

“June?” he called, voice catching on the silence.

Then he saw it—bootprints. Fresh. Smaller than his.

A voice behind him: “You’re not supposed to be here.”

He turned.

A girl—sixteen maybe, with dark eyes and a familiar crooked smile—stood on the edge of the brush, arms crossed. “My mom told me if anyone came lookin’ for the well, I should tell ‘em to leave.”

“Your mom?”

She nodded.

“What’s her name?”

The girl hesitated, then said, “June.”

Cole’s stomach twisted. “Where is she?”

The girl pointed down. At the well.

“She’s waitin’.”

Cole stepped forward, brush snapping underfoot. The girl didn’t stop him.

He dropped to one knee, cleared away the vines, and peered down.

Darkness.

Then a voice echoed up, thin as mist: “Cole…”

His heart stopped.

Later that night, Cole sat on the back porch of the ranch house, polishing the old revolver that had belonged to his grandfather. The steel case lay open beside him. Inside was a rifle, custom-made, with etchings on the barrel in Spanish: “Para los que no mueren” — For those who do not die.

He remembered the first time he heard the legend. He’d been ten. His uncle Tom drunk on mescal, telling ghost stories about the well at Tarry Creek. How something crawled out of it every twenty years. How it took a piece of whoever listened.

He thought they were stories.

He didn’t think they’d take June.

Buckley showed up again the next day. “There’s been… incidents,” he said. “Animals turned up gutted. Two drifters found torn open outside county lines. You know anything about that?”

“No,” Cole said. “But I’m about to.”

“What’s in the case?”

“Insurance.”

Buckley nodded like he understood, but Cole could see the fear behind his eyes. This wasn’t law and order stuff. This was old. Older than the town. Older than maps.

“What do you plan to do?”

“Bring her back.”

“Or bury her for good.”

Chapter Three: The Hollow Ones

Garza Ridge started feeling strange by the fourth day. Power flickered. Radios buzzed with voices that shouldn’t be there. People saw things in mirrors they didn’t recognize. And the little girl—the one who said her mother was June—vanished without a trace. Her trailer left open. Breakfast half-cooked on the stove. Her name was Clara.

Cole found a note in her room, written in shaky, uneven print.

“They're not asleep anymore.”

He went back to the well that night. Brought the rifle. He could feel something watching. Not eyes. Not exactly. But a pressure, like memory turned inside out. A figure stood at the edge of the woods. Pale. Thin. Almost human. But not.

“Who are you?” Cole demanded.

The figure didn’t answer. Just pointed at the well, then vanished.

Back at the house, the Polaroid had changed. Now June’s eyes were bleeding. And her mouth was stitched shut.

Cole lit a match and burned it. It screamed.

The next day, he found Clara’s necklace on the porch swing. It was wet. Not with water.

He knew he couldn’t do it alone. He drove east, to Houston, where a man named Elias Varn kept to himself in a warehouse full of relics and banned books. Elias owed him a favor.

“What you’re dealing with,” Elias said, pulling open a book bound in leather that didn’t smell like animal, “isn’t just some curse. It’s a fracture. A place where the world split wrong. The well is older than time, Cole. You don’t close something like that. You bargain with it. Or you feed it.”

Cole didn’t like either of those options.

Elias shrugged. “You asked for truth, not comfort.”

They loaded up. Spells. Salt. Blood markers. A hound that could smell the dead and hadn’t barked in twelve years.

They returned to Garza Ridge. The wind smelled wrong.

“Tell me something,” Elias said as they passed the county line. “If she’s really down there… do you plan to bring her back?”

Cole didn’t answer.

Not yet.

Buckley lingered longer than he needed to, his hand resting on the butt of his holster like he thought trouble might spring out of the dirt. Cole didn’t blame him. The land out here held secrets like tree bark held old nails—hard to see, but always waiting to cut. The sheriff’s eyes kept flicking to the truck bed, to the steel case that sat there mute and heavy, like it knew its own purpose. Cole could feel the questions building behind Buckley’s leathery face, but none came.

Instead, Buckley shifted, spat a brown stream into the dust, and said, “You sure you’re up for this? Ain’t been back ten years, and now you come ridin’ in like the past didn’t leave scars.”

Cole didn’t look at him. He stared out over the paddock, where the weeds had taken back what the horses once trampled. “I’m not here for the past,” he said. “I’m here for what’s left.”

The sheriff gave a short grunt, half amusement, half warning. “Just be careful, son. Dead things don’t always stay buried around here. And sometimes, they’re the lucky ones.”

With that, Buckley turned and walked back to his cruiser, the engine groaning to life before he drove off in a cloud of white dust. Cole watched him disappear down the road, then turned toward the house, the boards creaking beneath his boots like old bones shifting under a shallow grave. The wind had picked up again, hissing through the broken slats of the porch like something whispering its last rites.

Inside, the place smelled of rot and rust. His mother’s rocking chair still faced the window, though it was covered in dust thick enough to write a confession. The couch had collapsed in the center, and what had once been a proud rifle rack on the mantle now held only dust and one empty hook. The photographs on the wall tilted at angles that suggested they’d been disturbed by something more t
