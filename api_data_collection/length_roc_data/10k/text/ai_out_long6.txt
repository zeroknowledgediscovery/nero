La Última Luz: A Novel
Chapter One: El Umbral

In the crumbling heart of Guadalajara, down a graffiti-scribbled alley choked by bougainvillea vines and the stink of old grease, there was a door. Rusted, green once, maybe, but now just a flake-mottled whisper of color. Above it hung a crooked wooden sign etched by a careless hand: La Última Luz. The Last Light. Some said the name came from the one bare bulb that flickered defiantly over the bar's narrow threshold. Others murmured it was something else—some final glimmer before darkness.

Inside, time sank its claws into every surface. The stools were stitched together with duct tape and curses, the countertop slick with three decades of sweat and tequila. Smoke clawed up to the ceiling in lazy spirals from patrons who seemed more like ghosts than customers. And in the center of it all, tending the bar like a priest at a forsaken altar, stood Tito.

Tito had been there since anyone remembered, though no one could quite agree on how old he was. His face was an earthquake of wrinkles and pockmarks, his eyes twin obsidian chips forever scanning, calculating. He moved like a man both drunk and deadly sober, all slow grace and unexpected sharpness. They said Tito once killed a man with a broken beer bottle for cheating at cards. Others said it was a myth. Tito never confirmed, never denied.

On a Wednesday that smelled of rain and regret, a new shadow fell through the doorway.

She wore denim like armor—jacket, jeans, the works—and boots that clacked like punctuation. Her name, she claimed, was Marisol. Just Marisol. No last name, no origin story offered, none asked. She took the farthest stool, the one with a missing leg that wobbled like a drunkard's promise. She didn’t complain.

“What’ll it be?” Tito grunted, wiping a glass with a rag that might once have been white.

“Mescal,” she said, voice like ash and honey. “No salt. No lime.”

Tito nodded. He poured. She drank. And with that, something shifted. A thread pulled in the tapestry.

That night, the regulars watched her with sideways glances and whispered over stale beer and watery rum. There was Old Ramón, who swore he once played trumpet with Celia Cruz in Havana but now barely played the lottery. There was Julián, who sold knock-off Viagra by day and poems by night. And Lupita, who never spoke above a whisper and whose left eye drifted like a lost fish. They watched because La Última Luz never got newcomers. Not really. You didn't stumble into a bar like this. You came here on purpose—or you were running.

Tito didn’t ask questions, but he watched.

Days slipped by, or maybe weeks—time bent strangely in the bar’s tobacco-stained light. Marisol became a fixture, silent mostly, but always there by sundown. She drank in threes: three shots of mescal, spaced like rosary beads through the evening. She never got drunk, never stumbled, and never left with anyone. That alone made her different.

It was Julián who first tried. He swaggered over one Thursday, cheeks pink with cheap rum and poetry he hadn't written yet.

“You know,” he said, swaying slightly, “they say heartbreak is the best muse. I could write a sonnet about your silence.”

Marisol didn’t look at him. “Try haiku. Less commitment.”

The bar howled. Julián retreated. Tito poured her a fourth shot. Exception made.

Then came the stranger.

A man in a gray suit too clean for the barrio. He looked like money, or like he wanted to. Slick hair, polished shoes, and a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. He walked in like he owned it and paused, letting the room smell his cologne.

“Looking for someone,” he said, more to the air than the people.

“You found no one,” Tito replied, voice low as a basement.

But the man ignored him. His eyes scanned, landed on Marisol. “María? That you?”

She didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

“Sorry,” she said. “You got the wrong girl.”

“I don’t think so,” he said, stepping closer. “You always had that same scar on your chin.”

The bar held its breath.

Tito’s hand slipped beneath the counter. Marisol slowly turned on her stool. Her eyes, dark and endless, bored into the stranger’s.

“You say one more word, and you’re gonna wish you lost your tongue before you found my face.”

The man blinked. Tito spoke. “Out.”

The man hesitated. Tito raised what might’ve been a revolver. It wasn’t clear. It didn’t need to be. The man backed out slowly, muttering something in English. When he was gone, Marisol downed her third shot.

Silence returned, heavier this time.

That night, after the others had gone, Marisol stayed. She helped Tito close up—sweeping, flipping stools, emptying ashtrays.

“You gonna tell me?” he asked finally, not looking up.

She shook her head. “Not tonight.”

He grunted. “Fair.”

But the seed was planted.

Over the next few weeks, more men came. Never the same twice, but all polished, all too clean. They never made it past Tito. Wordless threats, sometimes a flash of metal, always enough.

“She in trouble?” Lupita whispered one night.

“Aren’t we all,” Ramón said, exhaling a line of smoke like punctuation.

But the men kept coming, and Marisol started showing signs—tense shoulders, a twitch in her jaw, fingers tapping nervous rhythms on the bar. One night, she didn’t come.

Then the next.

By the third, Tito went looking.

He found her in a rented room above a pawn shop two blocks down. The door had been kicked in. The room tossed. Blood on the floor, not a lot, but enough to quicken his pulse.

No sign of her.

He lit a cigarette and stared out the cracked window at the city’s bleeding neon.

This wasn’t over. Not yet.

Tito returned to La Última Luz and opened early the next day.

He turned on the jukebox—track 17, a scratchy ranchera with a weeping trumpet—and waited.

Because Marisol wasn’t just a customer.

And Tito hadn’t just been watching.

He had been remembering.

**

Tito hadn’t thought about the war in fifteen years. Not the one with rifles and jungle rot—no, not that one. The other war. The private one. The one where he’d lost his brother, his bar, and almost his soul in a mess of narco money, betrayal, and a woman who smoked menthols and told stories with her legs crossed. But Marisol’s disappearance had peeled back the gauze he’d carefully wrapped over old wounds. He stared at the wall of dusty bottles behind the bar and saw nothing but shadows.

He opened a bottle of Herradura and poured himself a double, neat. He didn’t drink during working hours—not since '96—but today wasn’t about routine. It was about memory. He took the shot, hissed as it slid down, and set the glass back down with finality. The bar was empty, save for the flies that never left and the hum of the busted refrigerator compressor in the back. Tito walked to the jukebox and turned it off. Silence clung to the air like humidity.

He remembered her first night again—the way she sat like she owned her space, like nothing behind her was worth looking back at. That’s what stayed with him. He’d seen people run before. They looked behind them too often. They drank to forget. They clung. Marisol hadn’t clung. She’d settled like she’d chosen the storm. That kind of posture doesn’t come without history.

By sundown, the regulars had drifted in. Lupita first, then Ramón, Julián, and two guys Tito didn’t like but tolerated because they tipped decent and fought rarely. When they noticed the absence, they didn’t speak it. They just looked to the corner stool—still missing its leg—and turned their eyes away.

“You heard anything?” Lupita asked eventually, folding her hands like a nun in confession.

“No,” Tito said. “But I’m going to.”

Julián raised an eyebrow. “You going looking?”

“Already did,” Tito said, pouring himself a soda this time. “Room’s a mess. She’s gone.”

“Gone like ran?” Ramón asked.

“Gone like taken.”

That shut everyone up. Even the jukebox, though off, seemed quieter.

Two days passed, and then something strange happened. A man walked in carrying a duffel bag. Skinny, twitchy, lips too wet, eyes too dry. Tito clocked him instantly—low-level runner, probably hooked on the same shit he moved. He sat at the bar, didn’t order anything. Just put the bag on the counter and said, “She said you’d know what to do with this.”

Tito didn’t touch the bag.

“Who said?”

The man licked his lips. “Marisol.”

“Where?”

“She didn’t say. Just said give you this. Swear to God.”

Ramón reached over and unzipped the bag before Tito could stop him. Inside was a gun. A revolver. Silver, long barrel, like something from a cowboy movie. And next to it, neatly wrapped in a dirty white shirt, was a thumb drive.

Tito stared. “Go,” he said to the runner.

“Man, I don’t want no—”

“Now.”

The man fled like a kicked dog. Tito picked up the bag, took it to the backroom, and shut the door. The bar buzzed with whispers, but no one dared ask. He plugged the drive into an old laptop that wheezed and clanked as it woke up. It took five minutes to open the folder. One file: “CIRCA_KNOWN.doc.” Another: “PIEDRA.BAK.” He clicked the first.

The document was a list—names, dates, locations. All in Spanish, some in English. Cross-references, maybe. Tito recognized a few names from the news. Politicians, businesspeople, a cardinal. Dead men. Some not yet dead. Near the bottom was a photo. Grainy, low-res. A man in a suit, standing with two cartel bosses in front of a hacienda. Tito’s stomach turned. It was the man from the bar—the one who’d called her María.

He opened the second file. Encrypted. Useless without a password. He shut the laptop and locked the room.

That night, he didn’t close. The bar stayed open until the sky turned blue again, not from revelry, but because sleep was a luxury none of them could afford. Marisol had dropped a stone in a well, and now the ripples were coming back hard.

It was three days later that they found her.

Or rather, she found them.

She walked in just past midnight, limping, face swollen, a cut above her eye crusted dry. She looked like s
