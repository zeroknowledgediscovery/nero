Title: "The Light Giver"

Chapter One: A Smile for the Camera

There was no city like Halberton. Gleaming towers reached toward the heavens like fingers grasping for divinity, and at their base, the streets writhed with people clawing for purpose. Somewhere between the penthouses and pavement, Eliot Voss built his kingdom—block by block, deed by deed, grant by grant. A savior, they called him. A man who gave without asking, who lifted neighborhoods and washed them in gold.

That morning, Eliot Voss was on the 37th floor of the Lucent Foundation building, standing before the cameras, smile practiced to perfection.

“…and with this pledge of two hundred million dollars,” he said, voice smooth as satin, “we’re not just building a hospital—we're ensuring Halberton’s children will never have to travel for treatment again.”

Applause thundered through the room. Rows of journalists snapped photos. Behind them, donors and officials nodded, sipping champagne. The mayor clapped too hard, clearly aware of the power of proximity.

Then came the handshake—the long, firm clasp with the hospital board’s chair. Flashes burst like fireworks. The photo would be in every major outlet by morning.

But Eliot’s eyes, calm and pale like lake ice, flickered past the lens. Beyond the applause. Past the veneer.

He saw someone.

A man in the back.

Thin. Sallow. Watching too intently.

The smile faltered for a fraction of a second, so brief no one noticed.

Except the man.

He raised a single hand and tapped two fingers to his temple, like a salute. Then he was gone.

The rest of the day passed in measured excellence. Meetings, speeches, signatures on crisp linen paper. Eliot’s secretary, Lena, kept everything to the minute. No wasted motion, no deviation.

Until the drive home.

The rain began the moment he stepped outside the building—Halberton’s skies often timed themselves for cinematic effect. His town car purred at the curb, doors unlocked as always.

As he slid into the leather seat, Eliot removed the smile from his face like a mask. The driver didn’t speak. They never did.

It was nearly ten by the time they reached the Northpoint District. Trees lined the avenues here, centuries old, gnarled like arthritic hands. The gates of the Voss estate opened slowly, metal teeth pulling apart.

Inside, everything was in its place. Polished wood floors. Brushed steel fixtures. Art too expensive to comment on. Still-life silence. Home.

But Eliot did not rest.

He went underground.

Behind the wine cellar, a biometric scanner read his retina. The hidden door slid open with a hiss. Fluorescent lights flickered to life in the corridor beyond.

He descended.

Below, the room was white, windowless, surgical. A single computer sat in the center, surrounded by shelves lined with files—not digital, but real. Paper. Folders. Ink.

He pulled one down.

A name: “Branick, Joseph. Age 32. Status: Released. Condition: Unstable.”

He flipped through photos. A hospital ID. A grainy image of the man in a crowd—taken hours ago.

Him.

The man from the press conference.

Eliot sat down at the terminal. Entered a code. A screen glowed.

“Command: TRACE SUBJECT.”

He waited.

Outside, thunder cracked.

Chapter Two: The First Echo

Joseph Branick had been presumed dead two years ago. That was no accident.

It had been part of a "containment protocol," a phrase Eliot had long ago stopped finding unsettling. But Branick had resurfaced. And he remembered.

That could not be allowed.

Yet Eliot hesitated.

He stared at the flickering monitor, the red pulse tracking the last known signal. Branick's burner phone had pinged in the Croft District—one of the few places in Halberton Eliot’s reach barely grazed.

He would have to go there himself.

Lena found him the next morning sipping coffee in the rooftop garden, back in his public skin.

“You’re scheduled with the Education Trust at nine,” she said. “Then a lunch with the ambassador. Do you want to skip the governor’s gala tonight?”

He smiled faintly. “No. I rather enjoy pretending I like the governor.”

Lena didn’t laugh, but the corner of her mouth twitched. “I’ll prepare your notes.”

As she turned, Eliot said, “Lena. Have I ever asked you to look into someone’s disappearance?”

She froze.

“You mean outside of Foundation business?”

“Yes.”

She glanced toward the garden’s edge, where a gust of wind rattled the ivy. “A few times. Discreetly. You always had reasons.”

“I still do.”

She nodded slowly. “Name?”

“Joseph Branick.”

The name hit like a dropped plate.

“I’ll start digging,” she said softly.

He watched her go. She had never asked questions. Eliot didn’t know whether that made her loyal or complicit. Or both.

Later, as he stood at the podium of a youth outreach event, shaking hands and posing with check recipients, he thought about the first time he'd met Branick.

It had been in the Orpheum Project.

Ten years ago, the Orpheum had been Halberton’s ugliest secret—a state-run institution for children with nowhere else to go. Voss had bought it, “reformed” it, turned it into a state-of-the-art educational facility.

That was the headline.

The truth had been... messier.

Branick had been a counselor there. Young, brilliant, empathetic. He had believed in real change. Until he found out what was happening in the lower levels—what Voss had authorized.

Experimentation.

Surveillance.

Correctional procedures.

Nothing officially criminal, of course—there never was—but enough to break Branick’s soul.

Eliot had seen it happen in real time.

He hadn’t flinched then.

So why now?

Why did Branick’s return gnaw at the edges of his sleep?

That night, Eliot skipped the gala.

He went to Croft.

Croft smelled like rust and secrets. The streets were narrow, hemmed in by buildings that had stopped pretending to be anything but forgotten.

He walked alone. No bodyguard. No escort. Just a black coat and a steady pace.

He found the tenement easily—Branick’s old hideout. The door was locked, but Eliot knew the code. He stepped inside.

The apartment was bare, save for a mattress and a single corkboard on the wall. Scribbled notes. Newspaper clippings. A photo of Eliot, circled in red.

Then a sound.

Behind him.

Eliot turned, just as a figure burst from the closet.

Branick.

Older. Gaunter. Eyes wild.

He had a knife.

It came at Eliot in a blur. He ducked, grabbed the wrist, twisted hard. The knife clattered to the floor. They grappled.

Eliot pinned him.

"Joseph," he said, breathing hard. "You're making a mistake."

Branick spat. "You made it first. You made all of this."

“I saved you.”

“You ruined me.”

Their faces inches apart, Eliot saw it—the despair beneath the fury. The haunted, human cost.

“I should kill you,” Branick hissed.

“But you won’t,” Eliot said softly.

They stared.

Finally, Branick sagged.

"Why did you come?" he asked.

"Because I need to know why you’re still alive.”

Branick laughed bitterly. “Then you don’t understand a thing about what you built.”

He passed out.

Eliot caught him before he fell.

Back at the estate, Branick was locked in the underground suite. Not a prison—technically. But he wouldn’t leave without a conversation.

Eliot stood outside the glass wall.

“You’re safe,” he said.

Branick looked at him through one bruised eye.

“You think that matters now?”

“I think it’s all that ever has.”

Outside, dawn began to claw its way into the sky.

Halberton gleamed.

But the cracks had started to show.

Branick hadn’t moved from the narrow cot in the glass room for hours. The lights were kept dim to soothe his frayed nerves, but Eliot knew from the twitch of his fingers, from the hard angles of his shoulder against the white bedding, that he wasn’t sleeping. A man who’s tasted erasure doesn’t sleep lightly. Eliot sat beyond the glass, a quiet observer, his hands steepled under his chin. It was the third hour of silence. He preferred it that way—silence wasn’t absence, it was space. In space, people gave themselves away.

“Why me?” Branick finally asked, his voice ragged, as though unused for years. “Why not just finish it?”

Eliot leaned forward slightly, elbows on his knees, watching his former subordinate through the haze of reflection. “Because I thought you were already dead. And because someone—somewhere—has helped you crawl back out. I want to know who.”

Branick turned his head slowly, his face a ruin of old injuries and new fears. “So you can erase them too?”

Eliot didn’t answer at first. The question sat between them, heavy and dense, like lead. Then he said, “If they’re a threat, yes. I will.”

“You’re a goddamn machine,” Branick whispered, sitting up and swinging his legs over the edge of the cot. His eyes were sunken, feverish. “Do you even remember why you started all of this?”

Eliot’s silence was colder this time.

“Do you remember Orpheum?” Branick asked, rising to his feet. “Not the facility, not the program. The smell. The kids. The files. Do you remember what it felt like?”

Eliot stood as well, though he did not move closer. “I remember.”

“I used to believe in you.” Branick’s voice cracked. “You said we could fix it all. Not just the city, but the sickness inside it. You said—”

“I know what I said.” Eliot cut him off, not angrily, but firmly. “And I meant it. But there is a line between fixing a system and being devoured by it. You crossed it the day you took those files and ran.”

“They were children,” Branick shouted, hands curling into fists. “You were experimenting on children!”

“I was researching behavior under stress,” Eliot said. “I was tracking trauma, resilience. You think corporations don’t do worse? You think governments don’t?” He took a step closer. “I did it to learn. To stop the patterns from repeating.”

“They were screaming.”

Eliot stopped moving.

“You can coat it in any language you want, Eliot,” Branick said, his voice low now, trembling. “You lost the thread a long time ago. Maybe you think the hospitals, the scholarships, the mon
