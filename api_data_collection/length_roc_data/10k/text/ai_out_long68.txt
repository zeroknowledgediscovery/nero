CHAPTER ONE: THE DEBTOR'S CHOICE

The air in the motel room tasted like old cigarettes and mold. Joshua "Joss" Kincaid stood by the narrow window, watching the rain streak down the pane like tears trying to escape. The television buzzed low with some infomercial about miracle knives that could cut through shoes. His hands trembled slightly—not from the cold, though there was plenty of that—but from the weight of the envelope on the rickety table behind him.

He hadn’t opened it yet.

Didn’t need to.

He already knew what was inside.

It had arrived just past midnight, slipped beneath the door in silence like a whisper with fangs. White envelope. No return address. Marked with a simple wax seal—black, bearing the insignia of a serpent devouring its tail. The Ouroboros. Everyone in his world knew what that meant.

It was a name.

And if the seal was black, that meant someone had to die.

And if you received it, it meant that someone had to die by your hand—or you would die in their place.

He turned from the window, jaw tight. Rain still whispering on the glass.

He opened the envelope.

The paper inside was thick and creamy, the name printed in elegant serifed type.

ELIZA ROWE.

His heart sank.

He sat down, hard, the chair giving a protesting creak.

He knew that name.

Hadn’t heard it in nearly eight years, but there it was again, like a ghost pulling up the roots of his past.

Eliza Rowe.

She had been everything once. A friend. A rival. An almost-lover in the months before everything went to hell.

She had disappeared, too, after the job in Caracas. Everyone assumed she was dead—or buried so deep no one would ever find her.

Now she was alive.

And the Ouroboros wanted her dead.

Joss’s mouth went dry. This wasn’t just another contract. It was a sentence—one that demanded action by dawn three nights from now. That was the rule. Three days. No extensions. No mercy.

He reached into his duffel bag and pulled out the Glock 19 he kept wrapped in a towel. It had served him well. He checked the chamber. Loaded.

He had done this before. More times than he could count. The difference was, none of them had been her.

What did she do? he wondered. Why now?

Two hours later, he was in the driver’s seat of a rented Ford sedan, heading north through the wet night. Wipers squeaking. The GPS silent. He didn’t need it. He remembered where she used to go when she needed to vanish—one of the few things she had shared in a rare vulnerable moment. A place in upstate New York. An old house left to her by her grandmother, nestled in the woods near a lake with no name.

He might be wrong.

She might not be there.

But the Ouroboros didn’t make mistakes.

The last time someone tried to defy them, their body was mailed in five different boxes to five different post offices, each addressed to a person from their past.

Joss had received one of the boxes.

He hadn’t opened it.

Just burned it in a trash barrel behind a motel in Detroit.

The rain had finally stopped by the time he reached the forest road. Branches brushed the roof like skeletal fingers. He killed the lights and coasted the last quarter mile.

The house was still there.

Lights on.

She was home.

He parked under the cover of trees and got out slowly. The cold bit at his skin, but he welcomed it. Grounded him. He pulled the hood of his jacket up and moved toward the side door.

Every step brought memories flooding back.

The way she laughed. The way her eyes crinkled at the corners when she was up to something. The last time he saw her—bloodied, wild-eyed, clutching the diamonds they were supposed to split before the job went sideways and she vanished into smoke.

He reached the porch.

Took a breath.

Knocked.

No response.

He knocked again, louder.

Still nothing.

He reached for the doorknob. Unlocked.

Of course it was.

She had never believed in locks.

The house smelled like cedar and something faintly metallic. He stepped inside.

“Joss.”

Her voice came from the dark.

He froze.

She stepped into the light from the kitchen, holding a revolver aimed at his chest. Her hair was shorter now, dark curls falling just above her jaw. Her eyes were sharp and tired.

“Close the door,” she said.

He did.

“Put the gun on the table.”

He hesitated.

“Now.”

He did as she said.

“Hands where I can see them.”

He raised them slowly.

“I figured you’d come eventually,” she said. “But I didn’t think it’d be this.”

He frowned. “You knew?”

“I heard the rustling. When the Ouroboros wakes up, it always comes for the ones who left.” She lowered the gun just slightly. “So. Who’s the mark?”

He didn’t answer.

She laughed, bitter. “It’s me, isn’t it.”

“I didn’t ask for this.”

“No one ever does.” She moved past him, poured herself a glass of something amber and strong. “And you came anyway.”

He didn’t move. “What did you do, Eliza?”

She sipped. “That’s a long story.”

“I’ve got three days.”

“You’ve got one, Joss. You were late.”

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, she said, “I can’t let you kill me.”

“I know.”

“Then what now?”

“I don’t know.”

Outside, thunder rolled.

Inside, the past snapped its claws.

That night, he slept on the couch. The revolver was gone. She didn’t offer it back. He didn’t ask.

He dreamed of Caracas. Of blood in the sand. Of eyes that never closed.

In the morning, she was gone.

But she left a note.

Meet me at the pier. Come alone.

It wasn’t a trap.

He knew her better than that.

But he also knew: the moment he stepped onto that dock, the rules would shift again. And someone—maybe both of them—wasn’t walking away.

Joss didn’t rush to the pier.

He took his time, walking the tree-lined road like a man heading toward something he couldn’t yet name. Mist clung low to the ground, curling around his boots like the memory of ghosts, thick and silver under the cloudy sky. The lake had always felt otherworldly, more myth than real place—he remembered her calling it “a hiding place for people who were no longer quite human.” He hadn’t understood then. He was starting to.

The wooden boards of the dock groaned under his steps. At the end of it stood Eliza, hands in the pockets of a long gray coat, staring out over the still water. She didn’t turn around when he approached.

“You ever think about jumping?” she asked quietly, voice muffled by the mist.

He stopped a few feet behind her. “What, into the lake?”

“No. Off the edge of everything.” She finally turned, meeting his eyes. “Sometimes I wonder if that’s what we’ve been doing since Caracas.”

He didn't answer. There wasn’t one that mattered.

Eliza gestured toward the bench bolted to the dock. He sat without thinking. She stayed standing, pacing slow circles.

“They sent the same envelope to me, you know. A month ago. Red seal.”

His breath caught. Red meant choice. Red was different.

“I didn’t open it,” she continued. “But I knew. When they wake up, they want blood. You know what happens when you don’t play.”

“They send someone else,” Joss muttered.

She nodded. “They must’ve been watching. They knew we were tied.”

Joss shifted on the bench. “Why now?”

Eliza stopped pacing. Her eyes were distant. “Because I broke the one rule that matters. I stole something from them. Something they thought was theirs.”

He stared at her. “You kept the diamonds.”

“That was nothing,” she said with a scoff. “Shiny rocks. I sold them and burned the cash years ago. No. This is bigger. I took something they couldn’t replace.”

“And now they want your head.”

“No. They want to erase me. Remove the piece from the board entirely. But if I go quietly, they win.”

Joss let that sit a moment. “And if you don’t?”

“Then they send another wave. They keep sending people like you until someone pulls the trigger.”

Joss looked out at the lake. The water didn’t move. It was so still, it seemed painted. “You’ve had time to run. Why stay?”

“Because I’m tired. And I’ve got something to finish.”

He turned back to her. “What is it?”

“You’ll see.”

The next day, Joss followed her into town.

They didn’t talk much. She walked like someone who had already made peace with the worst outcome. The town itself was little more than a main street and a gas station, but the people there seemed to know her—or know enough not to ask questions.

She led him into an old library with dust dancing in beams of morning light. Inside, she retrieved a small lockbox from behind a loose board in the floor. It was dented, fire-scorched, and wrapped in faded cloth.

“What is that?” he asked.

“Insurance,” she said, and nothing more.

She tucked it into her satchel, and they left.

Later, they sat in a diner, the kind with cracked booths and a jukebox that hadn’t worked in years. The waitress brought black coffee and left them alone.

“I could tell them you’re dead,” Joss said after a long silence.

“They’d send someone to confirm.”

“I could fake it.”

“You’re not that good.”

He flinched at that, not because it was false, but because it wasn’t.

She softened. “Sorry. Old habits.”

He stirred his coffee, watching the surface swirl. “They want proof. Blood. Body. Finality.”

“Then we give them something they’ll believe.”

Joss looked up. “You have a plan?”

Eliza hesitated, then reached into her coat and pulled out a phone—burner, unmarked. She showed him the screen. There was a video paused at the halfway mark. A face stared out, distorted by static and grain.

“That’s Marin Vex,” she said.

Joss blinked. “She’s dead.”

“No. She went underground. With my help.”

Vex had been one of the old order, a commander in the Ouroboros before it turned darker, more cult than syndicate. Her death had been made public with photos and evidence.

“They buried the wrong woman,” Eliza said. “And Vex has been waiting for the right moment.”

“For what?”

“To burn them down from the inside.”

Joss sat back. The implications made his stomach turn. “You’re telling me you’ve got a plan to dismantle the Ouroboros. With Vex?”

Eliza nodded. “And we’re almost ready.”
