Title: The Dust That Remains
Chapter One: Threads in the Dark

The first thing Matthew felt was the sticky tension of cobwebs clinging to his face. They stretched across the doorway like forgotten curtains, resisting his passage with delicate insistence. He flinched, instinctively brushing them away, their gossamer threads catching in his stubble. The air inside the house was stale, a mixture of rot, mold, and something older—something harder to name. He paused in the threshold, squinting into the gloom as his flashlight flickered once, then held steady.

The floor creaked underfoot with every step he took. His boots sent echoes crawling through the hollow rooms like whispers. This was the old Welden property, shuttered since the early '90s. Locals said it was cursed. Of course they did. Any house left to crumble breeds stories. But Matthew wasn’t here for ghost tales. He was here because the trail of a man he’d been hunting for four months ended here—cold, silent, and sudden.

A photo of the suspect, Alan Cross, had surfaced weeks ago, blurry and smudged, taken by a wildlife camera at the edge of the Welden woods. Cross, with his crooked smile and long coat, had disappeared into myth—until now. Something in Matthew, some taut string of intuition, had pulled him here.

He ducked beneath a broken lintel and stepped into what had once been the sitting room. Plaster flaked from the ceiling in damp curls, and the wallpaper peeled like sunburned skin. A mummified rat lay in the corner, its bones drawn tight by time. The beam from his flashlight swept across the mantle. A porcelain doll stared back at him from the dust, its glass eyes still and knowing.

“This is stupid,” Matthew muttered to himself, voice too loud in the silence.

He moved deeper into the house, finding the kitchen gutted. Cabinet doors hung open like broken wings. A calendar from 1992 still clung to the wall—November. The page was marked with a red X over the 13th. Below it, someone had scrawled “no going back” in pencil. The words were faint, but unmistakable.

He snapped a photo with his phone. Something about it—it didn’t feel like a prank or a leftover relic from squatters. It felt recent.

A thump came from above.

Matthew froze.

Not the creak of settling beams. Not the scuttle of raccoons. A deliberate, solid sound. He drew his gun slowly, every muscle stiff with cold adrenaline. For a moment, the silence stretched again—holding its breath.

Then another thump.

He climbed the stairs, one slow step at a time. Each tread felt ready to collapse under him. The hallway above was pitch black. His flashlight beam jittered against warped picture frames and broken doors. Something darted across the floor ahead of him—too fast to see, too silent for comfort.

He reached the last door on the left. It was closed. Unlike the others, which gaped open like mouths, this one had resisted time. He turned the knob. It stuck, then gave way with a groan.

Inside was a bedroom. Sheets still clung to the bedframe, and a mirror leaned against the wall, veiled in grime. But the scent—different here. Less mildew. More copper.

Matthew took a step forward—and saw the writing on the walls.

Names. Dozens of them, scratched in with what looked like fingernails or a blade. Some were recent. Some nearly faded to nothing. All arranged in uneven rows. And there, near the top, was the name "Alan Cross."

A chill rippled down his spine.

Then the mirror moved.

Not from touch. Not from tremor. Its surface warped like heat off asphalt. And in the shimmer, he saw—not his reflection—but a woman.

Pale. Hair tangled like roots. Eyes the color of rust.

"Don't stay here," she said.

And vanished.

Matthew staggered back, nearly dropping his flashlight. The mirror was just a mirror again. His own face stared back, wild-eyed, pale.

“What the hell is this place?”

Back in town, no one spoke of the Welden house after dark. When Matthew returned to his motel, he found his laptop open on the bed, though he was sure he’d locked it before leaving. On the screen was a single document:

"They watch through the glass."

He checked the webcam—taped over, always. No sign of tampering. But the file wasn’t his. Hadn’t been there this morning. He scoured it for metadata, timestamps. Nothing useful. Whoever had left it knew what they were doing.

He closed the laptop and poured himself a glass of bourbon from the tiny bottle he kept for nerves. The taste was sharp, unpleasant. But it grounded him. Mostly.

That night, he dreamed of the woman. Her eyes stared into him through a thousand mirrors. Every time he turned, she was behind him. Every time he moved, he felt cobwebs clinging, tightening, turning to chains.

The next morning, he visited the local records office. The woman behind the desk, Nadine, looked up with tired suspicion as he approached.

“You FBI?”

“Private investigator,” Matthew said, flashing his ID. “Looking into a missing person. Alan Cross.”

She flinched at the name.

“You’d do better to leave it alone,” she muttered.

“I’m not looking for trouble. Just answers.”

“Then you’re in the wrong place.”

He leaned forward. “You know something.”

She hesitated. Looked around. Then motioned him to follow her into the back, past shelves of aging files and curling microfilm. She pulled a box down—labeled "Welden: 1991–1993."

From it, she retrieved a thin, yellowed folder. Inside were photographs. A family—mother, father, two daughters. The youngest wore a red dress, the same color as the woman’s rust-colored eyes in the mirror. On the back of one photo, written in a neat, looping hand: Lilith, age 9.

“This is the Welden family?”

“Was.”

“What happened?”

“They say one night the father went mad. Killed the mother and both girls. Then disappeared. House sat empty ever since.”

“But I saw—”

Nadine closed the folder.

“Doesn’t matter what you saw. That place... it holds things. People who go there either come back different—or don’t come back at all.”

Matthew stared at the photograph.

Lilith’s eyes followed him even now.

He returned that evening, just before dusk. The shadows were longer. The air thicker. He brought a recorder, infrared camera, fresh batteries. Every tool of the trade.

Inside, the cobwebs were gone.

As if something had swept them away.

He made his way back upstairs, past the name-wall. In the mirror’s reflection, he saw the bed—but also something else. Something moving.

He turned, but the room was still.

Then the mirror shimmered again.

This time, it didn’t show the room.

It showed a corridor. Narrow. Dimly lit by flickering bulbs. On the walls, more names. At the far end, a door opened slowly.

He stared, transfixed. The corridor felt real. Like he could reach in.

And then he did.

The surface of the mirror gave way like water.

And he stepped through.

Beyond the glass, the air was different. Charged. Metallic.

The hallway stretched farther than it should. The walls pulsed slightly, as if breathing. He looked back—no mirror. No way out.

A voice whispered behind him: “You shouldn’t have come.”

He turned, heart hammering.

Lilith stood there, older now. Twenty-something. Skin paper-white. Hair like midnight.

“Where is Alan Cross?” he demanded.

Her eyes narrowed.

“You don’t find him. He finds you.”

Then she pointed to a door. “He’s waiting.”

Matthew walked slowly. The floor throbbed beneath his feet. When he opened the door, he found a room identical to the Welden bedroom—but reversed, mirrored. And in the chair beside the bed sat a man.

Cross.

Gaunt. Pale. Eyes hollow.

“I warned you,” Cross said softly.

“Warned me?”

“You can’t leave now. You’re part of it.”

“Part of what?”

Cross smiled. Not cruelly. Sadly.

“The house remembers. The house keeps. And once it shows you the mirror, it won’t let go.”

Matthew felt it then—the pull. The weight in his limbs. His reflection no longer matched his movements. It watched. And smiled.

Behind him, Lilith whispered, “No going back.”

Matthew tried to blink it all away—the mirror, the reversed room, the weight building in his chest like a rising tide. But the world didn’t shift back to normal. The sense of unreality, of something having been turned inside-out and made to wear the skin of the familiar, had rooted itself into the floorboards. Cross sat motionless, his long fingers folded like a prayer in his lap. His eyes, deep-set and rimmed in shadow, didn’t blink. He looked like a man half-digested by time.

“You were investigating me,” Cross said, his voice dry and unhurried. “You followed the crumbs like a good dog. And now you’re here.”

Matthew kept the gun raised, though his hand had begun to tremble. He hated that. He tried to control it with breath, grounding himself in what he could feel—trigger pressure, sweat trickling down his neck, the scrape of rough wood under his boots. Anything real. Anything not bent by whatever this place was.

“I want answers,” Matthew said, steadier than he felt.

“And I want forgiveness,” Cross replied, rising slowly from the chair like an old ghost. “But we don’t always get what we want.”

“Where are we? This place—it isn’t the Welden house.”

“Oh, it is. It’s the part behind the mirrors. The truth under the skin.”

“What does that even mean?”

Cross didn’t answer. Instead, he walked to the wall where the mirror should’ve been. It was blank now, just faded wallpaper and the outline of a frame that never held glass. He placed his palm flat against it, and the wall pulsed—flesh-like, wet-sounding.

“It’s alive,” Cross murmured. “It feeds. And it never forgets.”

Matthew edged back, heart hammering. “Feeds on what?”

“Memory. Regret. Guilt. The soft spots in people.” Cross turned to face him again, and there was no madness in his expression—only a deep, exhausted grief. “I didn’t come here by accident. I was drawn. The house—Lilith—it called me.”

“Lilith?”

“She’s part of it now. Has been for years. I think she was the first one it took whole. Maybe her mind couldn’t
