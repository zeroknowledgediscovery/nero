THE BLOODLESS HEX
By Ellison Grimm
Chapter One: The Red Thread

Fog hung like gauze over the crooked spires of Hallowmere, as if the town itself were trying to hide from the dawn. A bell tolled somewhere, though the hour was wrong and the sound too thin, too distant, as if it passed through layers of cotton before reaching the ear. In the uppermost room of an ancient, leaning townhouse, a warlock sat rigidly still, watching a single drop of blood inch down the side of a porcelain teacup.

It was not his blood.

“Out,” whispered Elric, voice barely audible above the ticking of the long-dead grandfather clock in the corner. His hands trembled, long fingers curled with restraint. “Out, you damned thing.”

The drop persisted, defying his command. It meandered lazily toward the lip of the saucer, thick and glistening. It didn’t matter that the blood came from a clumsy cut on the apprentice’s finger. It was blood. And Elric Varn was very, very afraid of blood.

“Master Varn?” The girl’s voice pierced his dread. “Should I fetch a cloth?”

“Out,” he repeated. “Just—go. Fetch nothing. Take the cup with you. All of it.”

Marla hesitated. She had only arrived in Hallowmere two weeks ago, a curious, sharp-eyed girl of fifteen who claimed her dreams were haunted by books that whispered incantations. She’d come to study magic under Elric, unaware of his peculiar affliction. Or perhaps she had known and was testing him—she had the look of someone who enjoyed unraveling things.

“I’ll take it,” she said finally, and gathered the teacup, her own bleeding finger wrapped hastily in her sleeve. The door shut behind her with a tired creak.

Elric exhaled sharply, realizing he had been holding his breath.

He rose with effort and moved to the window. Outside, the fog was giving way to the sallow light of morning, casting everything in an off-kilter pallor. The cobbled streets gleamed with moisture, and here and there the figures of early risers moved like shadows caught in amber.

Elric touched his temple. The flesh there throbbed faintly, an echo of some deeper pain. The visions were returning. Blood in cups. Blood on mirrors. A well filled with blood. And always the laughter—mocking, lilting, impossible to locate.

He had to do something.

In the town square, a procession was forming. Black banners, embroidered with silver vines, flapped without wind. A group of cloaked figures gathered near the base of the old gallows, now draped in white silk. They were the Silents, members of a reclusive order that spoke only through gestures. Their presence here was rare, and never good.

Marla watched from the edge of the crowd. Her bandaged finger pulsed where the needle had pricked her. She scanned the square for Elric, but the warlock was not one for public appearances. Especially not at ceremonies that might involve even the slightest bloodletting.

The Mayor, a tall woman with a face like a stern candle, raised her hands. “Citizens of Hallowmere,” she began. “This day marks the tenth year since the Crimson Collapse. Let us bow our heads in remembrance.”

Heads lowered. Marla did not bow. Her eyes flicked toward the platform where a man in iron manacles knelt. He was young, perhaps nineteen, and his eyes were glassy with either drug or despair.

“By decree of the Ninefold Tribunal, Elias Quarn is condemned,” the Mayor continued. “His blood bears the Mark of the Splinter, and shall be spilt to cleanse the air and warn the dark.”

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Elias struggled against his bonds. The Silents stepped forward, a silver knife cradled like a holy relic between two palms.

Marla felt sick.

Then the fog thickened. Not mist. Not weather.

Magic.

A gust scattered the banners. People gasped and stumbled. And with a sound like a page tearing from a book, Elric Varn appeared atop the gallows platform.

“Stop,” he said, voice flat.

The Silents froze, the knife suspended in air. The Mayor looked outraged.

“This is Tribunal business, Varn,” she snapped. “You will not interfere.”

“I will,” Elric said, “because the blood of this boy is corrupted, yes—but not by choice. Something has returned. Something from the old wood.”

The crowd shifted uneasily. Even the Silents looked to one another.

Elric walked forward carefully, his eyes on the knife. “Let me take him.”

“On whose authority?”

“Mine.” He extended his hand. “And by pact with the Diaphanous Covenant.”

Gasps again. The Mayor turned pale.

“You haven’t invoked that name in a decade,” she said.

“I know,” Elric replied, and winced. The throb in his temple surged. “But it’s come again. The Thread is bleeding.”

Elias Quarn sat in Elric’s study later that night, wrapped in a blanket and silence. He had not spoken since his release. Marla watched him from a stool by the hearth, her curiosity tempered by caution. The boy’s eyes flicked constantly toward the corners of the room, as if something waited just beyond the candlelight.

“Who gave you the mark?” Elric asked.

Elias didn’t answer.

“Elric,” Marla said quietly. “Look at this.”

She held up a sliver of parchment she’d found in Elias’s boot. It was old, brittle, and written in a cramped, spiraling hand. The letters twisted as if alive.

Elric’s lips pressed thin. “Where did you get this?” he asked Elias.

“I don’t remember,” the boy whispered. “I found it, maybe. Or it found me. There was a well. North of the Karklin pass. I heard… something.”

Marla’s fingers went cold. “You heard whispering?”

Elias nodded. “It said my blood was a gate. It showed me a face—no eyes, only mouths. I thought I dreamed it.”

Elric took the parchment and studied it. His skin went visibly pale.

“This is a bloodcall,” he said. “Old magic. Forbidden magic. It shouldn’t exist anymore.”

“But it does,” Marla said.

Elric turned to the fire and threw the parchment in. Flames swallowed it greedily, flickering green for a moment.

“I will take you north,” he told Elias. “To the well. If it’s speaking again, we must hear what it says.”

“But you hate blood,” Marla said.

“I do,” Elric replied. “But I hate what comes from blood left unlistened to even more.”

The road to Karklin wound through fields of pale wheat and gnarled black trees. The three travelers moved quietly, each preoccupied. Elias murmured in his sleep, though he never remembered doing so. Marla wrote in her journal, recording symbols she didn’t understand. And Elric felt the pressure behind his eyes grow worse with every mile.

They reached the well at dusk.

It was hidden in a copse of dead ash trees, the stones around it sunk with time and moss. A rope still hung from the beam above, though the bucket had long since rotted away. Flies buzzed, though there was no water to attract them.

Elias stepped forward and knelt beside the well. “It’s down there,” he said.

Marla held her breath.

Elric looked. At first, only darkness. Then—a glint. Red. Moving.

“Back,” Elric said. “Now.”

But it was too late. The rope lashed out like a living thing and wrapped around Elias’s wrist. Blood spurted as the skin split. He screamed, but did not resist. His eyes were wide and unblinking.

“Elric!” Marla shouted.

The warlock moved forward, mouth already shaping a spell. “Unbind the tether, break the thread, silence what should not have fled—”

The well howled.

A sound like a thousand mouths moaning. Wind surged from the pit. Symbols burst into light around its rim, written in blood, not ink. Elias was pulled to the edge, his feet dragging grooves in the dirt.

Then—Elric cut the rope with a blade of raw glyph-light. The tether snapped. Elias fell back, unconscious. The well screamed one final time, then fell silent.

Only then did Elric notice the blood on his hands. Thick, warm, real.

He stumbled away, retching.

Elric Varn did not sleep that night. He sat in the farthest corner of the small cabin they had taken shelter in, a threadbare wool blanket wrapped tight around his shoulders like armor. Outside, the wind muttered through the skeleton trees, and the dying embers of the fire cast sickly shadows that crawled like fingers across the walls. His gaze fixed on his palms—scrubbed raw and red, the skin nearly torn from the effort of cleansing them. Still he saw it: blood, gleaming and persistent, a memory that clung to his flesh like smoke.

The whispering had not stopped. Even now, it dripped between the cracks of his thoughts, curling behind his ears, murmuring in a tongue older than bone. Not words, not truly—more like impressions, emotion wrapped in the shape of language. It had started the moment he touched the blood on Elias’s arm. And now it would not let go.

He thought of running. Of disappearing back into the winding alleys of Hallowmere or deeper still, into the wildlands where magic could be muffled and minds forgotten. But the rope—the bloodcall—the well—these things had returned. That meant the seal had weakened. The old seals. And that meant something was pushing from the other side.

“Are you hearing it too?”

Marla’s voice was low, but not hesitant. She stood in the doorway to the cabin, her frame outlined by moonlight. Her long coat was dusted with frost, and a satchel bulged at her hip. She had gone out for firewood, but the bundle in her arms was sparse—more bark than branches.

Elric nodded slowly, his mouth dry. “You shouldn’t be able to yet.”

“I’m not like you.” She crossed the room and dropped the wood into the hearth, scattering ash. “Or like him.”

Elric raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.

Marla crouched, striking a flint to spark the tinder. The fire hissed and flared, throwing the light back into Elric’s face. He winced. “What do you mean?”

“I dream in runes,” she said without turning. “Not words. Shapes. Symbols. When Elias screamed, I saw one of them flash in my head. Bright and hot. The same symbol that burned around the well.”

“You should have told me this before,” Elric said, rubbing his temple. “Those are signs of attunement. Dangerous signs.”

“Dangerous to
