Beneath the Ashes

Chapter One: The Quiet End of Winter

The town of Halberd’s Hollow was the kind of place people forgot unless they had to remember it. It wasn’t on the way to anything. Tucked between pine-choked hills and a half-dead river that carried more silt than water, Halberd’s Hollow felt like a bruise on the map—dark, spreading, ignored. And that was exactly what Eli Varn needed.

He arrived under a soft snow, not a storm, just the kind that seemed to keep falling forever. His boots were salt-stained, and the cuffs of his jeans were stiff with ice. At the bus stop—just a rust-bitten bench nailed under a wooden awning—he waited ten full minutes before moving. The driver hadn’t looked at him once. Neither had the two other passengers.

Eli liked that.

The Hollow smelled like pine needles, old chimney smoke, and diesel. He kept his head down as he walked. The only bag he had was a canvas duffel that swung low against his thigh with every step. It had once been military green, but too many years and too many nights had turned it the color of dry moss. Everything he owned fit inside.

He rented a room above the gas station, a long-forgotten place called Brewer’s Stop. The sign was busted at the corner, and the “r” flickered every third second like a heartbeat. It didn’t ask questions. Mr. Brewer, a thick-necked man with a scar over one eye and hands that looked like they’d fought sheet metal and lost, gave him the key and said, “First week up front. You break it, you pay. That includes the bedframe.”

“Got it.”

Brewer looked him up and down once. “You look like a man with reasons to be somewhere else.”

“Everyone does,” Eli said.

That was the end of it.

The room smelled like mildew and stale heat. The radiator coughed to life once every hour and moaned like a dying animal. But the door locked, the blinds closed, and the mattress didn’t squeal when he sat on it.

That night, he dreamed of fire.

And the faces in it.

Eli had once been someone. Not famous. Not remarkable. But he’d worn a badge. A detective in a city too big to care about anything unless it bled on the headlines. He was good—maybe too good. The kind of good that got noticed. The kind of good that made other people nervous.

Her name had been Dani. Not Danielle, she always corrected. Dani like dynamite. She was too loud, too sharp, too fearless for the life Eli had wanted, but he loved her the way addicts love their poison—hopelessly and with open arms. She lit him up, and eventually, she burned him down.

They’d found the bodies in November, half buried in construction rubble on the east side. Eli and Dani had been first on the scene. What they found—what they covered up—was never meant to be known. But secrets rot from the inside.

It wasn’t just what they saw.

It was what they did after.

When everything fell apart, Dani disappeared. Eli ran. That had been nine months ago. Halberd’s Hollow was his last card.

**

The town had rules.

Don’t ask about anyone’s past.

Don’t stay after midnight near the river bend.

And don’t, under any circumstances, go into the old coal tunnels up in Banner’s Hill.

Eli learned them one at a time.

His first week, he took odd jobs—fixing shelves in the general store, hauling firewood, painting a church fence that hadn’t seen a brushstroke in a decade. He kept quiet, worked hard, and let the townsfolk fill in the blanks about who he was. They said he was a vet. They said he was a drifter. They said he had that look in his eyes—like he’d seen things and didn’t much care to explain them.

He didn’t correct them.

The girl at the diner was the first to talk to him like a person. Her name was Marnie, and she looked like trouble wrapped in a waitress apron. Red hair, too many freckles to count, and a voice that sounded like a song left on a jukebox too long. She brought him coffee without asking, and on the third day, she sat across from him during her break.

“You’re not from around here.”

Eli sipped. “You figured that out all on your own?”

“You’re wearing boots that cost more than my car. And you cut your eggs like a man trained not to waste a bite.”

Eli smiled. A rare, real thing. “Military?”

“Ex-boyfriend. Big shoulders. Small brain.”

He chuckled. “Fair trade.”

She leaned closer. “You got a name?”

“Eli.”

“No last name?”

“Nope.”

Marnie grinned. “Mysterious. I like it.”

**

By the end of his second week, Eli knew something was off about the Hollow. Not just the way people spoke in half-sentences or how the town square emptied the moment the sun dipped behind the trees. There was something else. A silence beneath the silence. Like the ground itself held its breath.

He heard about the boy from two towns over who went into the mines on a dare and came out wrong. Not hurt. Not mad. Just wrong. Wouldn’t speak. Wouldn’t sleep. And then one morning, he’d vanished. Left only a note on his pillow that read: “It’s not gone.”

Eli didn’t ask questions. Not yet.

But he started to listen.

And one night, the past came looking.

**

It was just after two a.m. when the knock came. Three hard raps. No hesitation.

Eli was already awake. Nightmares again. The dream with the lake of hands and Dani’s voice screaming through the smoke. He moved to the door slowly, slid the knife from under his pillow, and held it low.

“Who is it?”

Silence.

He waited. Thirty seconds. Nothing.

He opened the door.

The hallway was empty. Only the hum of the vending machine at the far end and the burnt-out smell of something electric.

Then he saw it—taped to the wall beside his door.

A photograph. Weathered. Creased.

Him and Dani. Smiling. Younger. Happier. Before the Hollow.

On the back, a single word written in red ink:

"RUN."

Chapter Two: Smoke in the Trees

The next morning, Eli went to Brewer. He didn’t show the photo. Just asked if anyone had been by.

“No one but you and the rats,” Brewer grunted. “Unless ghosts are paying in cash these days.”

Eli didn’t laugh. He walked to the diner. Marnie was already there, pouring coffee and laughing with Old Man Terrow, who sat at the corner table like he owned the place.

She noticed his face the moment he walked in.

“You look like hell,” she said.

“Feel like it too.”

She poured him a cup. “Nightmares?”

“Worse.”

Marnie leaned in, her voice dropping. “They come sometimes, you know. When something’s out of place.”

Eli stared at her. “What do you mean?”

“I mean... you ever seen deer freeze? Ears straight, tails stiff, won’t move an inch even if a fire started around ‘em? That’s how this town gets. When something’s out of place. Something unnatural.”

“And I’m the something?”

“I didn’t say that.”

“You didn’t have to.”

She hesitated. “What did you see?”

Eli tapped the edge of his cup. Thought about lying. Thought better of it.

“Someone left me a photo. From my past.”

Marnie’s face didn’t change. But her hands stopped moving.

“Did you burn it?”

“No.”

“You should.”

He studied her. “You’re not surprised.”

“This town... it doesn’t like things following people in. Especially things with faces.”

**

Eli spent the next few days in the woods.

There was an old cabin up past the north ridge. Not much more than a pile of rotten logs and a roof held together by moss and memory. But it gave him perspective. From there, he could see the town shrink beneath the frostbit hills, see the way the clouds refused to pass overhead after sundown.

He wasn’t alone up there.

On the third day, he saw someone watching him from the treeline.

Too far to see clearly, but the shape was wrong. Too still. Too tall.

He didn’t go back to the cabin after that.

**

At night, the knocking returned.

Sometimes it was on the door. Sometimes the window. Once, it was from the inside of the closet.

Always three knocks.

Always the same photo left behind.

But now, each time, a new word on the back.

“RUN.”
“REMEMBER.”
“PAY.”

By the fifth night, Eli didn’t sleep at all.

**

He knew he couldn’t stay. But he didn’t want to leave. Not yet. He needed to find Dani. If she was the one leaving the photos, she was close. If it wasn’t her…

He didn’t know what that meant.

One night, Marnie met him outside his room. Her eyes were wide. Her hands shook.

“You need to come with me,” she whispered.

“Why?”

“They’re coming for you. The town’s decided.”

“Decided what?”

“That you brought it back.”

Eli frowned. “Brought what back?”

Marnie’s voice cracked. “The fire. The thing that sleeps in the mines. The reason people don’t come here unless they’re running.”

She handed him something—a key. Old. Iron. Cold as ice.

“Go to the church. Below the altar, there’s a trapdoor. Use this.”

“Why?”

“Because if you don’t start finding the truth, you won’t have a past left to run from.”

Eli stared at the key.

And the shadows began to move behind her.

Eli didn’t sleep the rest of that night. He sat in the single chair by the radiator, his knife in his lap, the photo in his hands. The creases along the edges felt familiar beneath his fingertips, like scar tissue. He turned it over again and again, studying Dani’s face. The way she tilted toward him, just a little, the way her hand had curled instinctively over his wrist. It was the look of two people who had survived something and thought the worst was behind them. They had no idea then what was still coming.

By dawn, he made a decision.

If someone had followed him to Halberd’s Hollow, they wouldn’t have done it on a whim. This wasn’t a coincidence or a ghost from his mind. Someone knew. Someone remembered. And whoever they were, they had a message.

But what the hell did they want?

He dressed slowly, layering against the frost that clung stubbornly to the windowpane. The mirror by the door showed him someone older than he expected. Shadows pooled beneath his eyes, his hair was longer now, streaked with more gray than before. He looked like a man waiting to be buried. He turned away from his reflection and pocketed the photograph.

The street was still, qu
