ZOMBIE DOMINION
Chapter One: Ashes of the Living

The sky hung low, swollen with soot and rot. A dark umber haze swept over what had once been Chicago. Now it was just a carcass of a city, cracked streets lined with husks of buildings, cars abandoned mid-escape, and a silence so thick it felt sentient. In the shadow of the apocalypse, silence was no longer peace. Silence was stalking.

Juno Carrington pressed her back to a crumbling brick wall, her rifle slung low, her breath sharp in the cold morning air. The wind rattled a broken stop sign like a distant death knell. She squinted past the rubble, scanning for movement. Anything. The Dead didn’t sleep. And now they didn’t hide.

“They’re late,” muttered Tomas, crouched beside her, the barrel of his shotgun resting on one knee. He was a mountain of a man, grizzled and grey, his eyes always darting, always expecting the worst.

Juno checked the horizon. Nothing but ash. “Maybe they got caught.”

“Or maybe they turned.”

She shot him a look. “Don’t.”

But Tomas was already rising, restless. “We shouldn’t have come back to the surface. This run’s not worth it.”

“We need the generator parts,” Juno snapped. “Unless you want to keep rationing power down in the Vault. You want cold showers and pitch black nights again?”

He grunted, muttering under his breath, but didn’t argue further. Just then, a low growl sliced through the silence.

Not a beast. Not a man. Somewhere between.

Juno spun, rifle up. A figure staggered into view — then another. At first glance they looked human: tattered coats, shuffling steps, dragging limbs. But their eyes. Their eyes gave them away. Glassy. Hollow. Staring but not seeing.

“Zeds,” Tomas said, voice a whisper. “Two of ‘em. Might be scouts.”

“Scouts don’t breathe,” Juno replied grimly.

The two undead stopped as if hearing her. Their heads tilted in uncanny unison. Then they shrieked — high-pitched, sharp, like metal grinding on bone.

“Shit!” Juno fired.

The first shot blew a hole through the lead zombie’s head. The second kept coming.

Tomas stepped forward, swinging his shotgun like a bat. Skull shattered. The creature collapsed.

But the shriek had been a signal.

Moments later, the alley echoed with the telltale scrape-thump of approaching hordes. Dozens — maybe more — pouring in from the ruins.

“Fall back!” Juno barked.

They ran.

Beneath the earth, deep inside the reinforced remains of the Green Line metro, was Sanctuary 12 — one of the last known human shelters. What was once a transit tunnel had been retrofitted into a makeshift civilization. Metal walls, rigged wiring, rusting pipes all jerry-rigged to keep 120 souls alive. For now.

Juno slammed the steel door shut behind her and hit the lockdown lever. Sirens flashed red briefly before dying again. Power was intermittent at best. Sweat slicked her forehead, but it wasn’t from the run. She glanced at the control panel. Four hours of charge left.

Tomas collapsed on a crate nearby, sucking air. “That was too close.”

“We’re getting sloppy,” Juno said. “We used to be ghosts. Now we’re targets.”

A young girl poked her head out from a doorway. “Did you find it?”

It was Iris — ten years old, wiry, barefoot. One of the orphans the Vault had adopted.

Juno forced a smile. “Not this time.”

The girl nodded solemnly and vanished. No tantrum. No pleading. Children of the Fall didn’t cry.

Later, in the Command Room — a small converted maintenance office where old maps of the city had been tacked on concrete walls — Juno met with the Council.

“There’s no time left,” said Gareth Reed, the eldest and most cynical of the lot. “We’ve got four working generators. One of them’s dying. We have to go north.”

“The North’s a graveyard,” Juno replied. “Everyone who’s tried—”

“Then we die here.” Gareth tapped a finger against the cracked map. “We make a push. Or we rot in this tunnel with the rest of them.”

A murmur spread through the Council. Some nodded. Some looked away.

Juno studied their faces. All tired. All desperate. The same faces she’d seen every week, and yet every time, more lined, more skeletal.

Tomas finally spoke. “There might be another way.”

All eyes turned.

“There’s a signal. A repeat broadcast. Been hearing it on the shortwave for weeks. Says there’s a stronghold out west. Colorado. Human-run. Solar-powered. Zombie-free.”

Juno blinked. “Why didn’t you say anything?”

“Didn’t believe it myself. Still don’t. Could be a trap.”

Gareth scoffed. “A trap. Set by who? The undead?”

Tomas looked him dead in the eye. “You haven’t seen the smart ones yet.”

The room fell silent.

“The smart ones?” someone whispered.

“Call ‘em Alphas,” Tomas said. “They move in formation. Coordinate. Even talk sometimes. Not like us, but… strategy. Tactics. I saw one order a retreat last month. Swear to God.”

Juno’s stomach turned. “That’s not possible.”

“You sure?” he asked.

She wasn’t. No one was.

The Vault voted the next morning.

It was unanimous.

The Exodus would begin in three days.

Chapter Two: The Alpha King

A thousand miles away, in the shell of what used to be Denver, something was building.

On a jagged spire of steel and bone, the one they called King stood gazing over the broken skyline. He was tall — unnaturally tall — his skin taut over calcified muscle, his mouth a rictus of fangs, but his eyes… his eyes thought.

Around him, thousands knelt.

They weren’t mindless. Not anymore.

Some bore armor scavenged from the dead. Others carried weapons — makeshift clubs, rebar, knives. But most used teeth. They didn’t need more.

The King raised a hand.

Silence fell. Even the wind obeyed.

Behind him, a figure emerged from the shadows — smaller, lithe, feminine in shape, but with eyes like black fire.

“Your scouts have not returned,” she hissed.

“They were seen,” he replied in a voice like rust scraping marble. “We let them run.”

“You let them lead.”

He nodded.

“They’ll come,” he said. “And when they do, they’ll bring more. The final city.”

She grinned. “Shall I prepare the hounds?”

“No,” he said, stepping down from the dais. “Let them come. Let them hope.”

Then, after a pause: “Break their hope.”

Back beneath the earth, Juno packed her bag.

Rations. Water. A single photo of her sister, long dead.

She didn’t believe in miracles. But she believed in movement.

She would lead the Exodus.

Out into the dead world.

Toward the rumor of a sanctuary.

Unaware that the sanctuary was already watching.

Unaware that the King was waiting.

And hungering.

That night, the Vault was not quiet. Murmurs drifted through the corridors like smoke—fears, half-truths, wishes. Some still clung to the idea of rebuilding, others had given up long ago. The air felt damp and heavy, filled with the accumulated breath of too many people in too small a space. The hum of the emergency lights buzzed overhead like a dying insect.

Juno sat on her cot, knees drawn to her chest, watching the flame of a single candle flicker against the stone. Across from her, Tomas cleaned his shotgun in silence, the rhythmic clicking of the barrel and bolt oddly soothing.

“I saw something today,” she said suddenly.

Tomas didn’t look up. “We saw a lot of things.”

“No. Something different. One of the Zeds—he looked at me. Not just like a target, not like prey. He... recognized me. His eyes didn’t just reflect light—they tracked. Calculated.”

Tomas paused his cleaning. He set the shotgun down, exhaled slow through his nose. “You’re not crazy. I’ve seen it, too. More and more. They’re... evolving. Changing. Not all of them. Not yet. But it’s starting.”

“How?”

He shrugged. “Maybe the virus was never just a virus. Maybe it’s learning, adapting. Maybe this is what comes after humanity.”

A chill ran down her back. She’d grown used to death. She’d even accepted it. But replacement—that was something else entirely.

“I won’t let them win,” she said, more to herself than him.

“They already have,” he replied softly. “But we can still steal something back.”

She looked at him, surprised. He never said things like that. Tomas, the eternal pragmatist. The one who warned against hope because hope could get you killed.

“What changed?”

He met her gaze. “You did.”

Before she could respond, the sirens wailed again—short, sharp bursts.

Not a breach. Not an attack.

A meeting call.

They rose, grabbed their gear, and followed the dimly lit tunnel toward the Commons.

**

The Vault Commons was a hollowed-out train junction converted into a gathering space. Faded murals of public transit safety messages still clung to the tile walls, cracked and soot-smudged. A rusting “L” train car had been repurposed into the Council’s quarters, its windows blacked out, its door guarded by two teens with rifles nearly as tall as they were.

Inside, the Council was already assembled. Gareth sat at the center, his bony hands folded before him like a preacher ready to scold. Beside him sat Mara, the Vault’s chief engineer, her jumpsuit stained with oil and blood. Across from them, Doctor Enid—the last known surgeon south of the Lakes—stood with arms crossed and a sour expression.

“We’ve had a breach,” Gareth announced before they’d even fully stepped inside. “Two Zeds, through tunnel seven.”

“That’s sealed,” Tomas said. “It’s been sealed for months.”

“Someone opened it,” Mara said grimly. “The weld was burned through from inside. Someone let them in.”

Juno felt the blood drain from her face. “Are you saying we’ve got a traitor?”

“I’m saying,” Gareth said slowly, “that we may no longer be alone in this Vault.”

The room chilled. The walls felt closer. Every shadow lengthened.

Enid spoke. “Could be a survivor. A scavenger, gone rogue. Or a drifter from another shelter. We don’t know it’s sabotage.”

“Then who opened the damn door?” Mara asked. “The Zeds aren’t carrying blowtorches.”

The room descended into a flurry of accusations and wild theories. Tomas leaned close to Juno.

“If we’ve got infiltrators,” he whis
