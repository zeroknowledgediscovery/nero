CHAPTER ONE: THE BARREL AND THE BREATH

The steel of the barrel pressed against Theo Mercer’s temple was cold enough to draw his attention away from the pounding bass of the nightclub. That bass—like the pulse of the city itself—throbbed against the walls and inside his ribcage. But that sound, that life, receded to a hollow echo as the shape of death clarified in his peripheral vision. It smelled of oil and the tang of metal, like blood left out in the rain.

"Don’t move," a voice rasped behind him, close enough that he could feel breath against the fine hairs of his neck. Female, mid-thirties, maybe younger. American, but not quite. There was something flat and broken about the vowels, like the speaker had learned to un-feel things in multiple languages.

"I wasn’t planning on dancing," Theo said quietly, eyes scanning the mirror across from the bar. The reflection was blurred by condensation and neon, but he caught the silhouette of the woman—a sharp jawline, blonde hair twisted into a knot like it had been done in a rush. Her left hand wasn’t visible.

"You're going to stand up," she said, "and you're going to walk with me. If you even twitch like you’re reaching for that thing in your coat, I’ll ventilate your skull and step over your corpse before the first scream."

Theo stood. The bar stool scraped behind him, unnoticed by everyone except the bartender, who gave a glance, then went back to wiping down a glass with the kind of intensity reserved for ignoring danger.

They moved toward the back exit. Past a couple entangled in a booth. Past the wall of flickering CRTs that displayed closed-circuit footage of nothing in particular. Every footstep Theo took was calculated, measured, his thoughts already racing ten seconds ahead.

“Did Mercer send you?” he asked.

“No,” the woman replied.

That meant it was worse than he thought.

Outside, the air was damp and smelled of carbon and fried meat. Rain painted streaks along the sides of abandoned cabs and delivery drones that squatted like dormant insects. The woman nudged him with the muzzle of the gun.

"Keep walking."

They moved down an alley that twisted behind the nightclub, narrow enough that the dumpsters formed a tunnel of rust and graffiti. Water dripped steadily from an overhang, splashing into a puddle so black it looked bottomless. That’s when Theo pivoted.

It was a practiced move—drop, twist, grab, pull.

He caught her wrist, shoved the gun upward as it discharged, a shot ripping through the rain and silence. The bullet struck the wall. Sparks. Brick dust. She cursed in Russian, surprisingly guttural for someone with such delicate bone structure.

She brought her knee up, clipped him in the ribs. He retaliated with an elbow, sending her staggering back, and for a moment he had the gun—but she was fast, impossibly fast. Her boot caught his ankle, and he slammed into the wet concrete, dazed.

They both rose, breath heaving.

"You trained with the Directorate," Theo said.

"Once."

"Why are you trying to kill me?"

"I'm not."

The answer landed like a stone dropped into still water.

She lowered the weapon, just a fraction. “Not yet.”

He narrowed his eyes, rubbing the side of his face. Blood trickled from his lip. “Then what the hell is this?”

She looked around. No one had come to investigate the shot. Not in this neighborhood. Not at this hour.

“I need you to come with me,” she said. “We don’t have much time.”

Her name was Elira Vos. At least, that’s what she gave him. Theo didn’t ask for ID. People like them didn’t carry real ones anyway. They moved through a series of winding alleys, then into a subterranean garage where an old Tremont hover sedan waited, paint peeling, a digital console flickering with half-lit glyphs.

"Get in," she ordered.

"Where are we going?"

"Somewhere I can explain without being recorded."

"Are we being recorded?"

She didn’t answer, which meant yes.

The sedan lifted on a hum of displaced air and slid out of the garage like a ghost through fog. Theo watched the rearview. No tails. Not yet. But he didn’t believe in luck anymore. Only distractions.

He studied her hands on the wheel. Strong. Calloused. Fingers that had held knives and pulled triggers. Her expression remained unreadable, carved from experience and regret.

“So,” he said, “you going to explain why I was almost murdered in front of a DJ booth?”

Elira glanced at him. “Someone put a contract on your life. A very expensive one.”

Theo exhaled, slow. “Not my first.”

“It might be your last.”

“And you’re here to... what? Save me?”

Her jaw tightened. “I’m here because I need you alive long enough to help me find something.”

“That’s new,” Theo said. “Usually people need me dead because I found something.”

“It’s a file.”

“Of course it is.”

She ignored the sarcasm. “Encrypted. Buried in a dead-drop server under the old city. I have a key fragment. You have the rest.”

Theo went still. “No, I don’t.”

“Yes,” she said. “You just don’t know you do.”

They stopped at an abandoned observatory in the hills north of the city. The dome had collapsed years ago, and twisted metal ribs reached toward the stars like the skeleton of some great beast. Inside, the air smelled of mold and ozone. Terminals lined the walls, ancient and inert.

Elira powered up a portable unit from her bag. A flicker of code danced across the cracked screen. She plugged in a datastick.

Theo stood beside her, watching the lines scroll.

“What’s on the file?”

“Names,” she said. “Coordinates. Kill orders. Dirty assets. The kind of data that makes entire governments sweat blood.”

“And you think I’m involved.”

“I know you were part of Project Amaranth. Before it was scrubbed.”

Theo’s heart skipped. “That was a decade ago.”

“They don’t forget.”

He turned away, hands shaking. “That project was a lie. We thought we were building intelligence systems. Behavioral prediction. It turned into... something else. They were feeding us manipulated variables. Real-time political shifts, stock crashes, targeted destabilizations. We were predicting atrocities before they happened—and someone was making sure they happened anyway.”

Elira nodded slowly. “And you walked away.”

“I buried the work. Or so I thought.”

“You left behind a trigger code,” she said. “Hidden in the logic frame. Encrypted with a fractal key only you could reconstruct.”

Theo stared at her, suddenly ice-cold. “You said you had half the key.”

“I do.”

“And you expect me to remember the rest after ten years?”

“You don’t need to remember,” she said. “You just need to dream.”

He froze.

Because he understood then. She wasn’t just here to find a file. She was here to reawaken something he had tried very, very hard to forget.

In the corner of the observatory, a low hum began. One of the old auxiliary generators sputtered to life, summoned by code injected remotely.

Elira raised an eyebrow. “We have company.”

Theo moved to the window. Two vehicles. Black. No plates. Moving slow.

“They found us?”

“Maybe,” she said. “Or maybe they were always here.”

Gunfire shattered the silence.

Elira dropped behind a steel console, returned fire with practiced calm. Theo ducked low, heart pounding. The past was no longer in the past.

It had come back—wearing the same suits, firing the same bullets.

And it wanted to erase everything he was.

Theo scrambled toward a toppled pillar of concrete, his hands scraping against fractured stone as more rounds punched through the rusted dome overhead. Elira’s sidearm barked in controlled bursts, forcing their assailants into cover behind one of the blacked-out vehicles. Every shot she took was aimed, disciplined. Not suppressing fire. Target elimination. This wasn’t her first siege.

One bullet came too close. It snapped past Theo’s ear with the whine of a wasp, embedding itself in a nearby terminal, which exploded in a shower of sparks. The air was thick with ozone, smoke, and the cloying scent of heated circuitry. He crawled on his stomach behind a collapsed shelf, one hand feeling blindly in the dark for something—anything—that could help. A metal rod. A broken power conduit. Debris. None of it would do.

“Elira!” he shouted over the gunfire. “Options?”

“Two shooters,” she called back. “One flanking left, the other covering. They’re using comms, probably infrared targeting. Not freelancers—too tight, too clean.”

Theo risked a glance. The one on the left wore a visor with a dull green glow, movements crisp and silent. The kind of silence that screamed training. Government? Private military? Something worse?

“Elira,” Theo said again, lower this time. “I need a weapon.”

She glanced at him, assessed. “You know how to use one?”

“I designed six.”

She slid her backup pistol across the floor with a flick of her fingers. It skidded to a stop near his hand, cool and matte black. Theo picked it up, checked the chamber—full mag, safety off, no signs of overuse. He nodded to her, and she nodded back.

With a deep breath, he moved to the side of the pillar, counting seconds, tracking the rhythm of the enemy’s fire. A lull. A shift. Then—

He popped out, fired twice. The man with the visor ducked just a beat too slow. The first shot clipped his shoulder. The second took him low in the abdomen. He crumpled.

The other one retaliated fast, a burst of three shots hammering into the base of the pillar, sending chips of ancient mortar flying into Theo’s cheek. He ducked again, heart stuttering.

Elira had already moved. Silent as a shadow, she flanked through the ruined observatory's south corridor, a crumbled tunnel of collapsed ceiling and vines. Theo heard her footsteps only because he knew to listen. A few seconds passed. Then a sharp cry, a brief scuffle, and silence.

She emerged dragging the second attacker by the collar. His mask was gone, revealing a square-jawed man in his forties with a facial scar crossing the corner of his lip. Ex-military, judging by the posture and the stubborn defiance in his bloodi
