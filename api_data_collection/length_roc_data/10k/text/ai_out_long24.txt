Title: Ink Beneath the Skin
Chapter One: Black Lines, Bright Eyes

The sharp buzz of the tattoo machine pierced the silence of the studio like a wasp's warning. Rain pattered against the blacked-out windows of the shop, streaking the glass like nervous tears. Inside, the air smelled of antiseptic, old leather, and the sweet metallic tang of ink. Flickering fluorescents above cast a sickly yellow over the walls, half-covered with flash art and faded Polaroids.

Micah Delaney hunched over the inner arm of a college kid who smelled of too much Axe and nervous sweat. His hand, calloused and steady, moved with near surgical precision, guiding the vibrating needle over pale flesh. He was adding the final shadow to a crude koi fish swimming upstream, the young man's idea of perseverance immortalized in grayscale.

"Almost done," Micah muttered without looking up.

The kid flinched as the needle kissed bone. "It—it hurts more than I thought it would."

"That’s the point."

Micah finished the line and leaned back, wiping away the excess ink and blood. He studied the piece with a practiced eye, then gave a small nod. "You’ll live."

The kid tried a grin, but his lips were tight. "Thanks, man. This, uh, means a lot."

Micah offered a grunt and motioned toward the front desk. "Pay up front. Tip if you got morals."

He cleaned his tools in silence after the kid left, the studio once again swallowed by quiet. The buzz of the machine still rang in his ears, even with it off. Some said you never forget the sound—like a ghost brushing your eardrums.

The shop, Skin Scripture, had been his for five years, but it felt like a relic older than the bones it branded. The walls held pieces of stories: the snake coiled around a dagger inked on a widow who couldn't cry anymore, the matching runes etched into the shoulders of two brothers who stopped speaking the day after they got them. Ink told truths, even if people lied.

Micah turned off the lights and stepped into the rain, the city soaked in the bruised twilight of another Seattle evening.

Chapter Two: Ghosts in the Needle

The next morning, the bell over the door rang at exactly 10:04 a.m.—four minutes after opening. Micah, nursing coffee black as motor oil, glanced up to see her.

She walked in with a stiff posture, the kind learned from ballet or trauma. She had a folded sketchpad under one arm and a streak of red in her otherwise black hair. Her boots were wet. She looked like she hadn’t slept well in weeks.

“I need a cover-up,” she said without preamble.

Micah raised an eyebrow. "What kind?"

“The kind that erases mistakes.”

He gestured to the worn leather couch by the desk. “Sit. Let’s see it.”

She hesitated, then peeled back the sleeve of her hoodie. On her forearm was a name, clumsily scrawled in cursive: Tomás. The ink had bled with age, the letters smudged and twisted like a regret whispered too many times.

“I was eighteen,” she said.

Micah nodded. “A lot of bad tattoos start that way.”

She opened her sketchpad and handed it to him. A rough drawing of a fox curled among tangled vines, its eye open and watchful. The lines were shaky but sincere.

“You draw this?” he asked.

She nodded. “I want it to go here. Over it. Replace him.”

Micah flipped the pad shut and set it on the counter. “Come back Thursday. Noon.”

“Just like that?”

“I do cover-ups. Not therapy.”

She almost smiled. “Fair.”

Chapter Three: Beneath the Surface

Her name was Ren. Short for Serenity, which she said with a roll of her eyes. “My mom was into yoga. Real into it.” She returned Thursday, right on time, a thermos of tea in one hand and a look that dared him to judge her in the other.

As he worked the design over her arm, she told him bits and pieces. Not the whole story—never the whole story—but enough for him to hear the outline of something cracked. A musician, she said, used to play cello until her wrist shattered in a motorcycle accident.

“Tomás?” he asked.

“Bassist. Left me in a Motel 6 after a gig in Tucson. Took my wallet and my backup strings.”

Micah didn’t respond. The needle did the talking, stitching lines of fur and vine over old regrets.

“I read somewhere,” Ren said, wincing, “that tattoo ink never really leaves your body. Like, even if you laser it, traces stay in your lymph nodes.”

“That’s true.”

“So... you never really get rid of it.”

“You just bury it.”

She stared at the wall, eyes glazed. “That’s the most honest thing I’ve heard all year.”

Chapter Four: Red Ink

The fox was finished in three sessions. Each time, Ren returned with more stories, more tea, fewer defenses.

Micah found himself looking forward to her visits. She spoke with hands as much as with words. Her laughter, rare but real, cracked the silence of the shop like sunshine through a boarded window.

One night, after her final appointment, they shared a cigarette out back under the flickering alley light. She smoked like someone who had quit five times and still hoped the sixth would stick.

“Ever get inked yourself?” she asked.

Micah lifted the sleeve of his shirt. On his shoulder was a complex geometric design, inked in obsidian black. “First one I did. Sixteen. Homemade gun.”

“Dare?”

“Dare to survive.”

She looked at it a long time. “Looks like a maze.”

“It is.”

She flicked ash. “Do you ever regret it?”

Micah didn’t answer.

She stayed another minute, then left without saying goodbye.

Chapter Five: The Hollow Needle

Business picked up. Word of Micah’s cover-up skills spread quietly. People came with names, scars, symbols they no longer believed in. He didn’t ask for backstories anymore. Not unless they offered.

A man in his sixties wanted a Nazi symbol covered with a phoenix. “I was a different man once,” he said, voice shaking. “This isn’t who I am anymore.”

Micah inked the phoenix with slow, deliberate lines. The man cried when it was finished.

Then Ren didn’t come back. Weeks passed. Her number rang once and went straight to voicemail.

Micah didn’t know why it bothered him. People vanished all the time. But Ren had become a fixture in the quiet corner of his world, and now she was gone, leaving behind a fox with watchful eyes.

He started sketching again at night. Designs that didn’t belong to anyone yet. Strange patterns. Symbols that meant something only to him.

The rain returned. Seattle’s version of consistency.

Then, one Thursday, she came back.

Her right hand was wrapped in gauze. Her eyes were glassy. She didn’t bring tea.

“I need another cover-up,” she said.

Micah stared at the bandage. “What happened?”

“I made a mistake. Again.”

He let her sit before asking.

“This one’s on my side,” she said. “It’s fresh. I did it myself.”

She unzipped her jacket, lifted her shirt just enough to reveal angry, jagged letters near her ribs: STAY GONE.

Micah stared at the damage. “You want that gone?”

“No,” she said quietly. “I want it hidden. Not gone.”

He nodded once. “Come back Monday.”

Micah didn’t drive. He had a truck, sure—an old Chevy with more rust than metal—but most days, he walked. The city streets offered a kind of muted static that helped him think. As he stepped through puddles that reflected streetlamps like bruised halos, he lit a cigarette and let the cold drizzle soak into the seams of his hoodie.

Beneath the ash and smoke, his thoughts wandered. Tattoos weren’t just ink. They were stories etched into skin, warnings and wishes, prayers wrapped in muscle and memory. He remembered the first one he’d ever seen: a spider crawling out of the webbed elbow of a man who used to crash on his mother’s couch. He was six then, and the man had let him trace the lines with a finger.

“Spiders trap liars,” the man had said. “That’s why I keep one close.”

Micah hadn’t believed him, but he never forgot it.

The streets around Pioneer Square were quiet, the usual clusters of nightlife scattered thin by the rain. He passed shuttered cafes, graffiti-tagged dumpsters, and an old man who slept under a canopy of cardboard. His name was Arlo, a Vietnam vet with a sharp wit and a phantom leg.

“Evenin’, Ink Man,” Arlo rasped through the dark.

Micah pulled a twenty from his wallet and handed it over. No words. Just a nod. Arlo pocketed it with a grin full of gaps.

Micah made it to his apartment above a Thai bakery just as the wind picked up. The smell of lemongrass and fried oil clung to the stairwell. His place was a second-floor walk-up, walls bare save for one cracked mirror and a shelf with a dozen sketchbooks arranged like scripture.

He sat at the desk by the window, turned on a low lamp, and opened a pad at random. Page after page of designs stared back at him—wings, thorns, knives wrapped in roses, eyes with ink-dripping lashes, sacred geometry patterns spiraling into nothing. Some were good. Some weren’t. He didn’t care. He drew because it kept the silence from swallowing him.

An hour passed. Maybe two. He wasn’t sure when the knocking started.

It was soft at first. Then sharper. Persistent.

Micah went to the door, one hand instinctively brushing the pocketknife clipped to his jeans. He opened it to find a kid—no more than seventeen—soaked to the bone, hoodie plastered to his ribs. His lip was split and his eye swollen.

“You open?” the kid asked. His voice trembled, whether from cold or fear, Micah couldn’t tell.

“No appointments now,” Micah said. “Come back tomorrow.”

“I got cash.”

Micah looked at him again. There was blood on the collar of the kid’s shirt, and not all of it looked fresh. His hands were shaking, fingers clenched into fists like he was trying to hold something in.

“What do you want?”

“A name. Just a name. On my back.”

Micah exhaled, long and slow. He stepped aside.

The kid sat stiff in the chair while Micah prepped the tools.

“What’s the name?”

“Delia.”

“Who is she?”

The kid’s face twisted. “My sister.”

Micah didn’t press. He laid the stencil, adjusted the lighting, and began the linework across the kid’s upper back. The rain kept whisperin
