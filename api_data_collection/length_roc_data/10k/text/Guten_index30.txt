The King James Bible   Notes from the previous editions:  This is a modified version of: The Project Gutenberg Edition of the King James Bible.  The only changes made were the addition of the book numbers to the verse numbers to make it easier to find desired passages of text in this work and the addition of a Table Of Contents.  **** This version of the King James Bible was created by taking several public domain copies and painstakingly comparing them to find all the differences, and selecting the most common version. Each of the differences was also compared to printed versions for verification.   Table Of Contents  Book 01 Genesis Book 02 Exodus Book 03 Leviticus Book 04 Numbers Book 05 Deuteronomy Book 06 Joshua Book 07 Judges Book 08 Ruth Book 09 1 Samuel Book 10 2 Samuel Book 11 1 Kings Book 12 2 Kings Book 13 1 Chronicles Book 14 2 Chronicles Book 15 Ezra Book 16 Nehemiah Book 17 Esther Book 18 Job Book 19 Psalms Book 20 Proverbs Book 21 Ecclesiastes Book 22 Song of Solomon Book 23 Isaiah Book 24 Jeremiah Book 25 Lamentations Book 26 Ezekiel Book 27 Daniel Book 28 Hosea Book 29 Joel Book 30 Amos Book 31 Obadiah Book 32 Jonah Book 33 Micah Book 34 Nahum Book 35 Habakkuk Book 36 Zephaniah Book 37 Haggai Book 38 Zechariah Book 39 Malachi  Book 40 Matthew Book 41 Mark Book 42 Luke Book 43 John Book 44 Acts Book 45 Romans Book 46 1 Corinthians Book 47 2 Corinthians Book 48 Galatians Book 49 Ephesians Book 50 Philippians Book 51 Colossians Book 52 1 Thessalonians Book 53 2 Thessalonians Book 54 1 Timothy Book 55 2 Timothy Book 56 Titus Book 57 Philemon Book 58 Hebrews Book 59 James Book 60 1 Peter Book 61 2 Peter Book 62 1 John Book 63 2 John Book 64 3 John Book 65 Jude Book 66 Revelation     Book 01 Genesis   01:001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  01:001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  01:001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  01:001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.  01:001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.  01:001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  01:001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.  01:001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.  01:001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  01:001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  01:001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  01:001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  01:001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.  01:001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  01:001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  01:001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  01:001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  01:001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  01:001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  01:001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  01:001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  01:001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  01:001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  01:001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  01:001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  01:001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  01:001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  01:001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  01:001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  01:001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  01:001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.  01:002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.  01:002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.  01:002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.  01:002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,  01:002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.  01:002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.  01:002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  01:002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.  01:002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  01:002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.  01:002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;  01:002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.  01:002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.  01:002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.  01:002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.  01:002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:  01:002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.  01:002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  01:002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.  01:002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.  01:002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;  01:002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.  01:002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.  01:002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.  01:002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.  01:003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  01:003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:  01:003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not e
