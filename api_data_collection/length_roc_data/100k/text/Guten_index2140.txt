He was the youngest of the three sons who survived their father Edward Bray, Esq. George the eldest, who was in the Church, and the second son Edward, who was in the Army, both died unmarried; and, on the death of George the survivor, in 1803, Mr. Bray succeeded to the possession of the Manors of Shere and Gumshall, which had belonged to his ancestors from the reign of Henry the Eighth.  When ten years old he was placed at Rugby, where he remained until he was articled to Mr. Martyr, an Attorney of Guildford. In 1761, he was appointed a Clerk of the Board of Green Cloth, at St. James’s, through the patronage of Sir John Evelyn.  His attendance at the Board did not prevent his practising as an Attorney, and it introduced him to many clients.  In 1777, he published a ‘Tour in Derbyshire and Yorkshire,’ and a second edition of it in 1783.  In 1797, he was chosen one of the Council, and a few years afterwards Treasurer, of the Society of Antiquaries, many of his communications to which are printed in the ‘Archæologia.’  In 1801, on the death of the Revd. Mr. Manning, who had been engaged for some years in compiling the ‘History of Surrey,’ Mr. Bray undertook to complete the work.  The first volume was published in 1804, the second in 1809, and the third in 1814.  His next and last literary undertaking was the editing of the ‘Evelyn Memoirs,’ which he completed in 1817. {6}  Although in his 80th year, he transcribed in his own handwriting nearly the whole of Mr. Evelyn’s Journal.  He died from weakness, and without any disorder, on the 21st of December, 1832, having entered his 97th year on the 15th of the preceding month.  His habits before marriage did not promise either an industrious or a very long life.  He spent almost every night at cards, and many of his mornings in other amusements.  After his marriage he became more attentive to his professional business; but he continued for many years to live more like a bachelor than a married man, spending most of his evenings in the society of his numerous friends, or at a coffee-house. He was very hospitable both in bed and board, but in the plainest way. His surplus income was laid out in purchases at Shere and in planting, and he left no personal property except his life insurances.  The family estate devolved on his death to his grandson Edward, who lived at Shere, and died in 1866, at the age of 72.     EXTRACTS.   1756, _Jan._ 1_st_.—Called on Miss Stevens {7a} this morning.

MEMORANDA   1806, _Nov._ 15_th_.—This day, I completed my 70th year, without having ever met with any accident of consequence and with very little interruption to my health, except in January last, when I had a very serious attack by an inflammation in my lungs, but from which I am perfectly recovered.  My eyesight is so good that I can and generally do use my eyes in reading or writing from the time of getting up in the morning till 10 at night.  My hearing is in no way impaired.  I have not lost one front tooth and very few others.  I am able to walk or ride 4 or 5 hours together, but I do not ride fast.  My memory is perhaps not so good as it has been.  On the whole I seem to be in a perfect good state of health, thanks be to God.  1808, _Nov._ 15_th_.—This day I completed my 72nd year; and thanks to God’s mercies I find myself in as perfect health as I ever enjoyed in my life, and the only perceivable difference in any of my senses that I am aware of is a little degree of deafness in my right ear, but as the other is perfect, I do pretty well.  My left eye I think has not perfectly recovered the severe inflammation which I had two or three years ago, but the other being sound, I read and write as well and as much as ever.  My teeth remain perfect in front and without any additional loss to those which decayed some years ago.  1810, _April_ 5_th_.—I quitted the Board of Green Cloth, after having had a place there for 49 years and a half.  I was put on the superannuation list at my request, the Lord Steward having kindly procured leave for it. He also, unsolicited, gave me leave to resign my place of Clerk of the Verge to my son.  _Nov._ 14_th_.—After dinner, I found a giddiness in my head making me unable to walk, and a kind of dumb confusion in my head.  I wrote to Mr. Heaviside to come, which he did and ordered immediate cupping. {51}  The next morning my complaint was gone.  1814, _May_ 30_th_.—Received from Mr. Sydenham Malthus the melancholy news of my son’s death at Exmouth, from the rupture of a blood-vessel in the lungs.  1817, _Feb._ 15_th_.—My grandson Henry died this morning.  1826, _June_ 16_th_.—In chaise to Guildford, the County election, voted for Mr. Sumner and Mr. Denison. {52a}  _Sept._ 19_th_.—With Mary and Miss Davis, in a chaise, by Horsham and Henfold to the ‘Albion’ at Brighton.  Dined and lay there; walked on the Chain Pier.  20_th_.—To Seaford, Eastbourne.  Dined and lay at the ‘Hope’ in the Sea-houses.  21_st_.—To the Castle Hotel, Hastings; through Winchelsea to Rye; New Romney, dined and lay there.  22_nd_.—To Hythe, through Folkestone to Dover; saw the harbour; returned to Hythe, the ‘Sun,’ dined there.  To Ashford, and lay there.  _Sept._ 23_rd_.—To Lenham ‘Star’ at Maidstone; Wrotham Heath; Sevenoaks; Godstone to Reigate; Called on Mr. Glover; Dorking; Shere before 7. {52b}  1828, _Dec._ 24_th_.—Such has been the decay in my eyesight the whole of this year that I have not been able to read either print or MS., though I have continued to write letters, as I am writing on this 24th of December.  I cannot read it when written.  I have also lost my hearing in one ear in a great degree; subject to this, my bodily health has been what may be called good.  I have been obliged to pay more than £1,100 by the treachery of a clerk, and the malice of one who had been long attempting, and at last effected a loss of long friendship with Mrs. Wigzell. {53a}  1832, _July_ 5_th_.—Mr. Linnell, a portrait painter was sent by my grandson Reginald to paint a portrait of me.  I had five sittings.  _Oct._ 18_th_.—I sent my curious MS. of the Bishops’ estates seized and sold by Cromwell to Mr. Ellis, {53b} to be presented to the Trustees of the British Museum.     MR. BRAY’S LAST MEMORANDUM   _Dec._ 17_th_.—A little rain; at home.

She was the daughter of Mr. Stevens, of Perry Hill, Worplesdon, and lived with her aunt, Mrs. Norwood, at Guildford.  She was two years older than Mr. Bray, who was then only two months past 19.  {7b}  Mr. Flutter and his brother were Mayors of Guildford more than once, and the name of Flutter appears twice in the list of Mayors in the reign of Charles II.  {7c}  A lad of nineteen.  {7d}  Mr. Duncumb was Rector of Shere.  His father had purchased the advowson from Mr. Edward Bray, and was a connexion by marriage.  {8a}  Mr. Wilpley was what was then called an Apothecary.  {8b}  Mr. Emily was his cousin, their grandfathers having married the daughters of Vincent Randyll, of Chilworth.  {9a}  Jacky was Mr. Martyr’s son.  He was called to the Bar, and lived at Guildford to an advanced age.  {9b}  The medical charge for the inoculation was £4 4_s._  {11}  He had very little to do at Mr. Martyr’s.  In the summer he was often at the Bowling-green, and took long walks with his friends, male and female.  It was not required that any married lady should join the walking parties.  {14a}  A Hessian regiment was quartered at Guildford for some time. Their band was a great attraction.  {14b}  An attorney at Guildford.  Grandfather of the Rev. John Chandler.  {14c}  Being of age and out of his articles to Mr. Martyr, he went to London, and took lodgings there.  Mr. Adderley, of New Inn, received him in his chambers for instruction in his profession, but his attendance there was not regular.  {15a}  Mr. Jenkins was in Mr. Adderley’s office, and afterwards entered into partnership with Mr. Bray.  Mr. James was also in the same office.  {15b}  He went to his French master for some months, an hour at a time; not regularly.  {16}  About this time he bought many books, all at low prices, at stalls and auctions.  {17a}  Playing at cards almost every night, and always for coin, he had a purse on purpose.  {17b}  Whilst at Guildford he lodged at Baptist’s for 7_s._ a week.  He dined at the ‘White Hart,’ for 10_d._  {18}  He sold this stock to pay £23. 12_s._ 6_d._ for Viner’s ‘Abridgment of the Law.’  {20a}  He visited Miss Stevens almost every day, but he was not much less in other society than formerly, and he was seldom alone at any time of the day or evening.  {20b}  Daughters of Dr. Adee, a physician, who afterwards went to Oxford and practised there.  {21a}  He went to the morning service on Wednesdays in most weeks, usually to the Middle Church.  {21b}  Mr. Webb was Solicitor to the Treasury.  This appointment is now given to barristers.  {21c}  He only paid 10_d._ for his dinners (without wine) at the ‘White Hart’ and the ‘Tuns,’ and 6_s._ a week for his lodgings in the town.  {22a}  Miss Adee and Betsy Stevens were the bridesmaids.  {22b}  Mrs. C.’s was the lodging Mr. Jenkins had taken for him in Lothbury.  {22c}  He left a particular account of his expenses on his marriage.  The following are some of them:—                                                       £    _s._    _d._ Licence                                              1      11       6 Pair of gloves                                       0       1       0 Mr. Burdett’s fee                                    1       1       0 The clerk                                            0      10       6 Mrs. Norwood’s maid                                  0       7       6 Middle Parish ringers                                1       1       0 Dinner at Epsom                                      0       5       6 Chaise from Epsom to London                          0      14       0 Driver and hostler                                   0       2       0 Two bottles of Lisbon at the ‘White Hart’            0       3       4 For fifty oysters                                    0       0      7½ A pound of cheese                                    0       0      3½ A pound and a half of salmon                         0       1       0 Paid Jenkins for the ring                            0       6       6 [Jenkins got the ring and sent it to him with a humourous letter.] Mr. Shrubb for a tabby nightgown                     7      14       0 Ear-rings and necklace                               0      14       0 Coffee with Boughton at the Lincoln’s Inn            0       0       5 Coffee House (on the afternoon of his wedding)  {23a}  They received friends to tea every evening this week.  They lived in a house with a garden, in which Mr. Bray planted fruit trees and shrubs, but where it was does not appear in the Diary.  {23b}  He went to the Bowling-green to play at whist in the winter, and at howls in the summer.  {24a}  He had been the first performance of Marplot by Garrick.  {24b}  When he took the horse as far as Dorking it was 2_s._ 6_d._  {25a}  The son of the Member for the County.  {25b}  Mr. Godschall, of Weston House, Albury.  An accomplished gentleman, LL.D. of Oxford, cousin of Lady Palmerston, the mother of the late Lord Palmerston.  {25c}  Of Parkhurst, where Rousseau was his guest for some time.  {25d}   Who built the Leith Hill Tower, and was buried there.  {25e}  It is remarkable that a young attorney of 22 should have been invited to the social meetings of elderly and middle-aged gentlemen of the highest position in the neighbourhood.  His grandson, the late Mr. Edward Bray, inherited his companionable qualities, and was welcome in every house he visited.  {26a}  The Member for the County.  {26b}  Of Betchworth Castle.  The author of ‘The Light of Nature.’  {27a}  The father of the late Sir Henry Austen.  He had been articled, as well as Mr. Bray, to Mr. Martyr.  He afterwards purchased a Clerkship in the Six Clerks’ Office in Chancery.  {27b}  Mr. Bray’s marriage made little difference in his habits this year.  He was almost every night with his friends at cards or backgammon; in the summer evenings at bowls; frequently at the morning services on week days at the Middle Church.  He had very little to do at this time in his profession.  {28a}  Mr. Lane, of East Horsley Park.  {28b}  Mr. Evelyn, afterwards Sir John, then M.P. for Helstone, had offered him an appointment at the Board of Green Cloth, which he at first, by the wish of his wife, declined to accept; but a few days afterwards, being better advised, he was glad to find that he could still have it.  The following note was among the Memoranda which he left of his early life.—‘Nothing could be pleasanter than our situation at the Board of Green Cloth.  The Principals were all members of the House of Commons. We sat in the same room, at the same green cloth table, with them, by whom we were treated rather as associates than as clerks.’  Mr. Bray was at first only an assistant, together with Mr. Selwyn, a barrister, afterwards in large practice; Mr. Blenman, also of the Bar, and Mr. Fanshawe, but they rose to be chief clerks.  His usual attendance was from 11 to 3.  He took a house in Holles Street, and settled there December 14th, but in the following year he moved to Great Russell Street.  {29}  This child died in July,  {30a} After a Royal birth caudle was given to the Clerks of the Green Cloth and others in office at St. James’s.  {30b}  Of Bury Hill, now Mr. Barclay’s.  {30c}  Of the Rookery, now Mr. Fuller’s.  His son, Thomas Robert Malthus, was the great writer on Population.  His youngest daughter married Mr. Bray’s son Edward.  {31}  His son Edward, who married Miss Malthus, and left a large family. His other sons died in childhood.  Mr. Bray had no collateral relations of his name after the death of his uncle and brothers within many generations.  His ancestor, Sir Edward Bray, was the heir male of Edmund, Lord Bray, and succeeded to the family estates; but the title descended to Lord Bray’s daughters, and was in abeyance until obtained by the late Baroness Bray.

On Sundays he went for an hour to the Buffalo.  {34a}  He had a house at Shere, which his mother lived in, and made a home for him during his frequent visits, and at little expense, for riding round in the neighbourhood he got his dinner at one house and tea at another.  To general information he could now add the gossip of St. James’s, and he was welcome wherever he went.  {34b}  He kept what he called a chaise or whisky, and two horses.  {34c}  Mr. Penneck was Keeper of the Reading-room at the British Museum and Rector of Abinger.  {35a}  Betchworth Castle.  {35b}  He had become acquainted with Dr. Osborn and Dr. Price on the institution of the Equitable Assurance Office, of which he was a director.

The inflammation was subdued with difficulty by the great oculist Mr. Phipps, afterwards Sir Watken Waller.  The eye affected became gradually weaker, and the sight of it was entirely gone for some years before his death, although exactly when he did not notice.  At the beginning of the 19th century he was 64; and his son’s attention to the business of the office in Great Russell Street enabled him to live more at Shere, but when in London his habits were little changed.  He dined with the Antiquaries’ Club almost every week during the season until he was 90.  He did not so frequently take his meals at the houses of his friends, but at his own table they were always welcome, and many came.  {51}  He was frequently bled according to the usual practice in those days.  He was bled the last time when he was 84.  {52a}  Mr. Bray cared very little for politics, but he was not a Tory, and would not have voted for Mr. Summer if he had not represented the county for many years and been much respected.  {52b}  Mr. Bray was within a few weeks of 90.  He took no servant with him.  {53a}  After this shameful affair, neither Mr. Taylor his clerk, nor Mr. Wigzell had any communications with Mr. Bray or his partners; but as a mark of repentance Mrs. Wigzell left Mr. Bray’s grandson a legacy of £100, and Mr. Taylor left £100 to the firm of Bray and Warren.  {53b}  Principal Librarian at the British Museum; afterwards Sir Henry Ellis.

His last guest at Shere was his old friend Mr. Carlisle, one of the Secretaries of the Antiquary Society, who came to Shere on Saturday, the 28th of October, and remained till Monday.  His grandson Reginald was with him for a day or two every week, and played at piquette with him three days before his death, which took place on the 21st.
