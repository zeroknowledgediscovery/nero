Title: Under the Floodlights

Chapter One: The Boy from Darrington

Darrington was a town most people drove through without stopping. Two motels, a gas station with a fading “Eat Here” sign, and a high school with a football team that hadn’t seen a playoff game since the Bush administration. But it was also the place where Elijah “Eli” Brandt grew up, the son of a truck mechanic and a diner waitress, and the place where he first threw a football clean across old Coach Donnelly’s pasture.

Eli wasn’t supposed to be a star. Skinny kid, always with bruised elbows and knobby knees, walking to school with hand-me-down cleats slung over his shoulder. But he had something in his arm—something sharp, something with heat—and when he let that ball fly, the whole town leaned in.

“Jesus,” Coach Donnelly muttered the first time he saw the boy throw. “Kid’s got a cannon.”

By junior year, the cannon had turned Darrington High from a 2–8 team to a 10–1 contender. College scouts started showing up in rusted-out pickups pretending to be uncles or distant cousins. People began to ask his mama what kind of vitamins she’d fed him. The local paper called him “Friday Night Eli.”

But Eli didn't care about the attention. Not really. He was still cleaning spark plugs at his dad’s garage after practice and still counting coins when he ordered a milkshake at Roscoe’s. What he cared about was the ball, the feel of the leather under his fingers, the way it spun like a planet when it left his hand.

And then came the night of the Ridgeview game.

The stands were full—too full. People stood on car roofs, lined up behind the chain-link fence, eyes hungry. Ridgeview had three players with Division I offers, a line that averaged 270 pounds, and a quarterback named Jordan Price who’d been on ESPN’s Top 300.

Eli walked out of the locker room silent. He didn’t pray, didn’t slap his teammates’ pads. He just stood under the lights like they were the sun and he was built for it. When the kickoff came, it was like the universe leaned forward.

Three touchdowns. Four hundred passing yards. One game-winning drive with less than a minute left.

By the time Eli knelt to run out the clock, the place was shaking. Donnelly threw his hat ten feet in the air. His mom cried. His dad just nodded, the way men do when words are too small.

That night, Eli got his first real offer—from Texas Southern. More followed. Oklahoma. Florida State. Even Stanford called. The boy who once played catch with tire irons and cinder blocks had become Darrington’s miracle.

But miracles are heavy things. And when something shines that bright, it starts to cast long shadows.

Chapter Two: The Offer

The envelope arrived in early December, three weeks before Christmas. Thick paper, deep blue seal—University of Michigan. It sat on the kitchen table like a foreign object while Eli’s mom stirred gravy with her good spoon.

“You gonna open that or wait till the roast dries up?” she said, glancing over her shoulder.

Eli didn’t answer. He was staring at it like it might explode. Finally, he picked it up and tore the edge with careful fingers.

“Dear Mr. Brandt,” it began. “We are pleased to offer you a full athletic scholarship…”

He didn’t finish the letter. He just laughed—one short bark of disbelief—and then looked at his mom.

“Mama,” he said. “They want me.”

She wiped her hands on her apron and crossed the linoleum in three quick steps. The hug was tight, bone-pressing. For a second, Eli thought about his dad. He was out back in the garage, probably elbow-deep in a transmission, grease in every pore. Eli wanted to tell him, wanted to see his face when he heard.

But there was a voice in the back of his head that whispered, “He already knows.”

The next few weeks were a blur of phone calls, press clippings, and the soft terror of choice. USC’s coach flew in on a private jet. Ohio State sent a box of gear so big they thought it was furniture. The whole town had an opinion—Roscoe, Coach Donnelly, even Miss Lila at the church. Everyone except Eli.

Then came the call from Detroit.

It was a Friday. Cold. The sort of gray sky that felt like winter’s yawn. Eli was throwing balls into an old tire swing when his mom hollered through the screen door.

“It’s Coach Radley,” she said.

Radley. Michigan’s offensive coordinator. The man who’d called Eli “the next Rodgers” on ESPN. Eli wiped his hands on his jeans and took the phone.

“Elijah,” Radley said, his voice like gravel dipped in honey. “We want you to start. Not redshirt. Not sit behind some legacy kid. Start. You ready for that?”

Eli swallowed. His voice felt small in his own mouth.

“Yeah,” he said. “I think I am.”

And that was that.

He signed his letter of intent in the Darrington High gym, with flashbulbs popping and a local news anchor fumbling his name. Eli Brandt was going to Michigan. He didn’t know it then, but he’d just walked into a storm.

Chapter Three: Ann Arbor

Ann Arbor hit him like a different planet. Snow on the ground in October, lectures bigger than his entire town, roommates who had never heard of Darrington. But football was the same. Same turf, same sweat, same ache in the shoulders.

Only difference was, everyone was fast. Everyone had been “the guy” somewhere. And none of them were ready to give that up.

The first time Eli walked into the weight room, a linebacker named J.Q. Dallas looked him up and down.

“You the freshman?” J.Q. said.

Eli nodded. “Brandt.”

J.Q. smirked. “Heard you broke records back in cow-town. Let’s see how you do without your mama in the bleachers.”

Eli didn’t answer. He just picked up a barbell and got to work.

Coach Radley was waiting for him after the first scrimmage. He pulled Eli aside, looked him dead in the eye.

“You’ve got the arm,” Radley said. “But you hold the ball too long. College ain't Friday night lights. You hesitate, you die. You got me?”

“Yeah,” Eli said, chest still heaving. “I got you.”

They started him against Minnesota. A soft game. Supposedly.

The first snap was a sack. Second, a fumble. The crowd turned on him by the second quarter. Boos. Groans. Chants for the backup, Marcus Daniels, a junior with smooth hair and a bigger Instagram following.

Eli shook it off. Third quarter, down by 10, he hit a seam route so perfect it split two safeties like scissors through cloth. Touchdown.

Fourth quarter, tie game, two minutes left. Michigan at their own 30. Radley leaned in, eyes like coals.

“You want it?” he asked.

Eli nodded.

“Then take it.”

He did. Twelve plays, eighty yards, twenty-eight seconds on the clock. Game-winning touchdown.

Afterward, in the tunnel, Radley clapped him on the back.

“Welcome to the Big Ten.”

But not everything was gold.

Classes were drowning him. Media wanted soundbites he didn’t know how to give. And Daniels wasn’t sitting still. He smiled in public, but in practice, he threw like he wanted Eli’s scholarship.

Then there was Kira.

Chapter Four: Off the Field

She was different from the girls back home. Kira James—broadcast journalism major, daughter of a state senator, hair like jet and eyes like no mercy.

They met at a team interview. She asked him a question he didn’t understand and didn’t pretend to.

“Why’d you come here?” she said. “Really.”

Eli blinked. “To play,” he said.

She raised an eyebrow. “Everyone plays. What are you running from?”

He didn’t answer. But she smiled anyway.

They started seeing each other in secret. A coffee here, a walk there. She wasn’t interested in jersey-chasers. Said so to his face. She liked the way he looked like he was trying not to drown.

“You ever think about what comes after football?” she asked once.

“No,” he said. “Football is the after.”

She kissed him like that was a lie.

Things got faster after that. Wins piled up. So did bruises. So did attention.

Then came the scandal.

Chapter Five: Smoke

It started with a tweet.

Some blurry photo of Eli at a party, red cup in hand, Daniels in the background, something white on the table that looked a lot like cocaine.

The caption read: This your QB1, Michigan?

The media exploded. Kira called him that night.

“You didn’t,” she said.

“No,” he said. “I didn’t.”

“Then prove it.”

They couldn’t. Not fully. No test, no confirmation. But the damage was done.

Daniels went on ESPN and said, “We’re supposed to be leaders. If some people can’t handle the responsibility, maybe they shouldn’t wear the M.”

Coach Radley benched Eli for the next game.

It was like drowning, but this time, no ball to throw, no miracle to save him.

But Eli wasn’t done yet.

Not by a long shot.

After the Ridgeview game, things started to change in Darrington, and not all of it felt like celebration. The attention that followed Eli’s performance wasn’t just from college scouts. Local businesses began offering him free milkshakes, car washes, even a new set of cleats. He never took the cleats. Something about accepting them felt like crossing a line, even if no one could name exactly where that line was.

Coach Donnelly noticed the shift too. He started locking the field gate after practice, something he’d never done in twenty years. “Too many cameras, too many people pokin’ around,” he said. “Ain’t a zoo exhibit. It’s a football team.” But even with the gate closed, they still found ways to watch. Drones hovered above during practice. A blog out of Jackson posted grainy footage of Eli rolling out of the pocket and hitting a deep curl. The caption read: Darrington’s Diamond. Remember the name.

It was hard for Eli to remember what life had been like before people stared at him in the grocery store. His best friend, Isaiah Merrick, tried to keep things normal. Isaiah was the team’s left tackle, broad as a barn door, with a laugh that made windows rattle. He’d been blocking for Eli since they were in Pop Warner, and he didn’t care about rankings or scouts. Only cared about pancakes—both the football and breakfast kind.

“Man,” Isaiah said one night, sitting on the hood of his Chevy while Eli tossed a ball in the air, “you ever think we peaked too early? Like, what if this is it? What if this is the best we ever get?”

Eli caught the ball, spun it in his hands. “Then I guess we better make it count.”

“Hell of a way to live,” Isaiah muttered, lighting a cigarette. “I’m just saying, things change. People don’t stay the same once they see lights. And these days, all I see is people trying to get a little shine off your name.”

Eli didn’t answer. He knew what Isaiah meant. There was a girl at school, Rebecca Trammell, who hadn’t spoken to him since freshman year. After the Ridgeview game, she asked him to prom in the middle of algebra. There were kids in younger grades who started dressing like him, taping their wrists the same way, wearing their hats backward. Even Coach Donnelly seemed to look at him different now—like he wasn’t a player anymore but a symbol of something bigger.

His mom kept telling him to stay grounded. “Don’t let the fog of praise cloud your steps,” she’d say, setting dinner on the table like a sermon. His dad didn’t say much. He never did. But when Eli walked into the garage after practice, the old man would just nod and pass him a wrench. They’d work side by side in silence, the rhythm of socket wrenches and the smell of oil filling the gaps words couldn’t.

One night, after an interview with a local radio station, Eli sat on the porch swing and listened to the frogs in the creek. His little sister, Laney, padded out in oversized slippers, a sketchpad tucked under one arm.

“You looked stiff on that interview,” she said bluntly, swinging her feet.

“I was nervous.”

“You don’t get nervous when you throw the ball.”

“That’s different.”

“Why?”

He paused. “Because when I throw, I know who I am. Talking… they want you to be someone else.”

Laney nodded like she understood. She was ten and liked to draw superheroes with crooked masks and neon capes. She held up a page. “I made you one. See? You’ve got a helmet and lightning in your eyes.”

Eli laughed softly, then tucked the sketch under his arm.

“You think I’m a superhero, huh?”

“No. But I think you’re trying to be one.”

He didn’t sleep much that night. Too many thoughts churning, too many voices echoing. He was getting letters every day now, hand-delivered by the principal herself. One of them had the Alabama elephant stamped right on the envelope. Another came with a handwritten note from an NFL player who had “been where you are, kid.”

Coach Donnelly tried to keep him focused. Practices grew harder. Drills ran long. Film sessions turned into interrogations. Eli didn’t complain. Not once. But the pressure started to crack around the edges. He was shorter with teammates, colder with his mom, quieter at school. He snapped at Isaiah during a scrimmage when the left side collapsed.

“What the hell was that?” Eli barked.

Isaiah stared at him. “Don’t start thinking you’re untouchable, man. Not out here.”

They didn’t talk for three days after that.

Then came the injury scare.

Late November. Final game of the regular season. Darrington versus Elmore Heights, a rivalry older than the county itself. The night air was bitter, the kind that made your breath turn to steam. Eli had thrown two touchdowns already when he rolled out right, looked downfield, and caught a helmet to the ribs.

He didn’t get up.

For a moment, the stadium went completely silent. Then came the scramble—trainers running, Donnelly cursing, his mom pushing through the stands. Eli couldn’t breathe. Every inhale felt like gravel in his lungs. They carted him off, strapped to a board. His head never stopped spinning.

At the hospital, the x-rays came back clean. Bruised ribs, no breaks. But the headlines ran with it anyway.

Darrington’s Star Downed. Future in Question.

He stayed home from school for a week. During that time, the world felt distant. Recruiters sent flowers and texts. Teammates sent messages that felt forced. Only Isaiah came by in person, carrying a box of doughnuts and two Gatorades.

“You’re not dead,” Isaiah said, plopping into the chair beside Eli’s bed.

“Felt like it.”

“You’ll be fine. Just don’t pull a Romo.”

Eli smirked. “Low blow.”

They ate in silence for a while. Then Isaiah said, “You know, we all thought you were gonna leave after this season. That maybe you’d skip the playoffs, protect the investment.”

“I’m not built like that,” Eli said quietly.

“I know,” Isaiah replied. “That’s why we block so damn hard for you.”

When Eli returned, the team was waiting. Coach Donnelly had written “ALL IN” on the whiteboard in capital letters. He pointed at Eli.

“He’s not going anywhere. So neither are we.”

The locker room roared.

Playoffs were coming.

And Eli Brandt was back.

But somewhere in the back of his mind, there was a whisper now. A new kind of voice. One that asked: What happens if this all goes away?

He pushed it down.

There was still more to throw.

Chapter Two: The Offer

Winter came heavy to Darrington, blanketing the brittle fields and blacktop roads with a layer of ice that made every step uncertain. The cold seemed to linger longer than it used to, like the seasons themselves were holding their breath. But inside the Brandt house, the heater hummed, and the kitchen smelled like cinnamon and burnt toast. That’s where Eli sat, hunched over the table with a pen in hand and six official letters spread out like a royal flush in poker.

Each envelope bore the seal of a powerhouse. Alabama’s script “A,” LSU’s purple tiger eye, the interlocking “OU” of Oklahoma, Clemson’s paw print, Georgia’s “G,” and finally, the crisp maize and blue of Michigan. They were the kind of letters kids used to frame, mount on their walls, brag about online. But Eli just stared at them, unmoved, like he was watching a test he hadn’t studied for.

“You gonna sign one?” his mother asked, pouring coffee with that gentle rhythm she always kept in the mornings.

Eli looked up, lips tight. “Feels like choosing a different life each time I look at one.”

“That’s because you are. Doesn’t mean you can’t live it right.”

His father didn’t say anything, but he was sitting at the counter, quietly reading the classifieds even though they all knew he wasn’t looking for a job. That was his way. When something mattered, he let the silence speak.

Coach Donnelly came over that night, carrying a binder so thick it looked like a law textbook. He set it on the kitchen table and flipped it open to a color-coded spreadsheet.

“These are the visits,” he said, tapping the page. “They’ll fly you out, give you a tour, some steak dinners, a whole lotta pretty words. But remember—every coach that smiles at you has an agenda. This ain’t personal. It’s business dressed up in pep rallies.”

Eli nodded, flipping through the pages. “You ever see this many offers in one season?”

Donnelly chuckled. “Once. Back when a kid from Gulfport got ranked five stars and everybody thought he’d be the next Cam Newton. Blew his knee out first year at Florida. Now he sells insurance.”

That stuck with Eli. The fragility of it all. He could feel it in his ribs, still sore from the Elmore Heights hit. The game gave, but it took too. And it didn’t care how many letters you had.

Eli narrowed his list down to three: Oklahoma, Alabama, and Michigan. Oklahoma had the flash—the air raid offense, the big stage, the legacy of Heisman quarterbacks. Alabama had the rings, the dynasty, the factory-like precision that turned boys into NFL millionaires. But Michigan… Michigan had Radley.

Coach Radley was different. He didn’t smile much during their call, didn’t promise trophies or fame. What he said was simple: “I watched your tape. You don’t blink. We need a guy like that.”

It wasn’t poetry, but it hit deeper than the polished lines the other coaches gave. And there was something about the way Radley said “we,” like he meant family more than factory.

The visit to Michigan sealed it.

Ann Arbor was frozen in late December snow, the campus like a postcard—buildings with ivy-draped brick, students wrapped in scarves and talking fast. Eli walked through the Big House, stood on the fifty-yard line while an assistant coach recited facts he’d already memorized. But it wasn’t the grandeur that got him. It was the quiet. The weight. The sense that this place demanded something sacred.

Kira James was the one who gave him the tour of the journalism school. A junior with fierce eyes and a voice made for TV, she didn’t care about football.

“You’re the quarterback everyone’s talking about,” she said without much enthusiasm. “I’ve had four of you in three years. They all say the same thing—‘just trying to focus on the team.’ You gonna say that too?”

“No,” Eli said. “I’m trying to find the place I don’t disappear.”

She raised an eyebrow. “That’s different.”

The rest of the visit passed in a blur—dinners with boosters, meetings with coordinators, a sit-down with the head coach that felt more like an FBI interview. But Eli kept thinking about that field. About how the snow had fallen on it like quiet approval.

On the flight back, he made the decision.

“I’m going to Michigan,” he said, out of nowhere.

His mom blinked. “You sure?”

“Yeah. I want to earn something there. Not just be the next guy in line.”

She didn’t say anything else. She just took his hand and squeezed it.

The announcement came a week later. In the Darrington High gym, beneath a handmade banner that read “No. 1 with a Bullet,” Eli put on the Michigan cap and signed the letter in front of his classmates, teachers, and the entire town. Cameras flashed. Applause rang out like gunfire. Coach Donnelly slapped him on the shoulder, pride written in every wrinkle on his face.

“Remember what got you here,” he said. “And don’t let 'em turn you into something you’re not.”

Eli tried to believe that would be easy.

But it wouldn’t be.

The day he left for Michigan, Darrington stood still. Isaiah helped him pack the last of his bags into the bed of the truck, his huge frame oddly quiet.

“You still mad about that scrimmage?” Eli asked.

Isaiah shook his head. “Nah. Just wondering what it’s gonna be like next year when you ain’t there. When it’s just me and a bunch of sophomores who think high school ends in a mixtape.”

Eli closed the tailgate, wiped his hands on his jeans. “You’ll make ‘em ready.”

“You better stay ready too,” Isaiah said. “Those college boys don’t care where you came from. They’ll eat you if you blink too long.”

Eli nodded. “I ain’t blinking.”

They embraced like brothers—short, tight, no words needed. Then Eli got in the truck, started the engine, and pulled out of the gravel lot.

As the town faded in the rearview, he didn’t cry. Didn’t wave. He just kept driving, eyes forward, hands firm on the wheel.

Because that was the only direction left now.

Forward.

The first time Eli stepped onto the Michigan campus as an official student, the cold punched through his coat like a linebacker through a weak-side block. It was the kind of cold that belonged to the north, the kind that made every inhale feel like chewing ice. He walked past snow-blanketed brick halls and black iron lampposts crowned with frost, clutching a campus map in one hand and the keys to his freshman dorm in the other.

His roommate, Cam Torres, was already there when he arrived—half unpacked, wearing headphones the size of soup bowls and muttering lyrics under his breath. Cam played wide receiver, lightning fast and twitchy like a street cat, with dyed blond tips in his curls and a tattoo of a broken hourglass on his forearm.

“You the QB?” Cam asked without removing his headphones.

“Yeah,” Eli said, setting his duffel on the bed nearest the window.

Cam nodded, then tossed a bag of trail mix in his direction. “Welcome to hell, rookie.”

Eli caught it midair. “Thought that was for the season.”

“Nah, man. That’s for spring ball. Winter’s a whole different beast. You’ll see.”

Classes started two days later, and within a week, Eli was already behind. The pace was blistering. He went from being the smartest guy in film room to sitting at the back of lecture halls full of students who spoke in full paragraphs and referenced books he’d never read. Intro to Political Theory felt like a punishment; Calculus might as well have been ancient Greek.

One morning, after three hours of back-to-back classes, he stumbled into the football facility half-frozen and half-starving. The smell of disinfectant and turf rubber hit him as he passed through the hall of framed All-Americans. A trainer nodded at him. One of the older tight ends, Ellis Rowe, walked by and smirked.

“Welcome to the show, hotshot.”

Eli didn’t respond. He just kept walking until he reached the quarterback room.

Radley was waiting.

“Close the door,” he said without looking up.

Eli obeyed.

The room was small and windowless, lined with whiteboards and film reels. Radley tapped a pen against his notepad, eyes scanning a tablet.

“You’re behind in footwork. Your reads are late. You’ve got happy feet in the pocket, and you’re missing flat defenders because you’re locked on the deep post.”

“I’m adjusting—” Eli started.

Radley cut him off. “Don’t adjust. Adapt. Adjusting is what you do when your shoelace is loose. Adapting is what you do when the bullets are flying.”

Eli stared at the board, jaw tight. “Yes, sir.”

Radley sighed and leaned back. “You’re smart. You see the game better than most. But this ain’t Darrington. That arm doesn’t buy you time here. You need to trust the system. And if you don’t understand it, you need to live in it until you do.”

“I am.”

“Not enough.” Radley leaned forward. “You want to start this fall?”

“Yes.”

“Then start acting like it. No more late arrivals. No more missing reads in practice. You’re being handed the keys to a war machine. Drive like it.”

After the meeting, Eli walked back to the dorm, notebook in hand, head down. He didn’t even notice the snow falling again.

Cam dragged him out that weekend. Said they needed to “breathe before we both drown in blitz packages and midterms.” They went to a house party on the edge of campus, a sprawling three-story place with loud music, flashing lights, and the smell of beer in every corner. Eli wasn’t much for parties, but he figured pretending to be normal for a night might ease the weight.

That’s where he saw Kira again.

She stood in the kitchen, surrounded by people but untouched by them, like she moved on a different frequency. She was sipping a bottle of ginger ale and watching Eli with one eyebrow arched, like she’d been waiting for him to show.

“You get lost?” she asked as he approached.

“Maybe.”

“You don’t look like you’re enjoying yourself.”

“I’m not.”

“Then why come?”

Eli shrugged. “Trying to be social.”

“You’re a quarterback. You don’t need to try.”

“Maybe I don’t want to be just a quarterback.”

Kira tilted her head, studying him. “Then you better stop acting like one.”

They didn’t talk much after that, but when she left, she looked back over her shoulder—and Eli followed.

They walked the frozen sidewalk in silence until she asked, “What’s it like? Having all these people bet their Saturdays on you?”

Eli took a long breath. “It’s like holding your breath for four quarters and pretending it doesn’t hurt.”

“Sounds lonely.”

“Sometimes.”

They parted ways near the journalism building. She didn’t give him her number, didn’t ask for his. But two days later, she showed up outside the practice field with a thermos and handed it to him without a word. Inside was hot cocoa.

From then on, she came by once or twice a week. Never during games. Never when the cameras were around. She didn’t want to be part of the noise.

“You already have enough people orbiting you,” she said. “I don’t need to be another satellite.”

He appreciated that more than she knew.

As winter deepened, so did the weight on Eli’s shoulders. Spring practice loomed. Daniels—junior, polished, media-savvy Daniels—was still the presumed starter in the eyes of many. He had swagger, connections, a sponsorship deal for a protein brand, and the trust of half the locker room.

Eli had none of that. What he had was tape. Clips of throws on the run. Quick feet. A deep ball that turned heads. But he needed more than potential now.

One night, after a brutal practice, Radley called him into the film room again.

“I’ve been watching,” Radley said. “You’ve cleaned up your footwork. Timing’s sharper. But I’ve still got one question.”

Eli looked up from the screen.

“Do you want to win, or do you want to be a star?”

“I want both.”

“Then prove it. Starting tomorrow, I’m rotating you with the first team.”

Eli’s breath caught.

“That mean I’m the guy?”

Radley shook his head. “No. It means you have a chance. Nothing more.”

That night, Eli didn’t sleep. He lay awake staring at the ceiling, hearing the roar of invisible crowds, feeling the tension in his knuckles, in his calves, in the space behind his eyes. He had come so far, but it still felt like he was only inches from falling.

He got up before dawn, threw on his gear, and jogged to the facility in the snow. No one else was there yet. He stepped onto the practice field, breath rising like smoke, and stood on the fifty.

This was where it would be decided.

Not in interviews. Not in rankings.

Here. Under the cold. With nothing but turf, time, and a ball in his hands.

Spring practices at Michigan were different. They weren’t just about refining skills; they were about survival. Every rep was a battle, every drop-back a test. Eli found himself under constant scrutiny—not just from Radley and the quarterback coach, but from his own teammates. The linemen looked at him differently now, testing his authority. Receivers wanted timing and trust. Defensive players, especially the upperclassmen, seemed eager to rattle him, maybe to see if he’d crack.

During one particularly aggressive practice, linebacker Devin Cromer—a fifth-year senior who was built like a refrigerator with legs—blitzed on a non-contact drill and drove Eli into the ground harder than necessary. The thud echoed across the practice field, drawing silence. Eli’s helmet rolled a few feet before he pushed himself up.

Coach Radley barked, “Whistle was blown, Cromer!”

Devin shrugged. “Didn’t hear it.”

Eli didn’t flinch. He stood, picked up his helmet, and walked back to the huddle. Cam Torres, who was lined up wide, jogged over and clapped him on the back.

“They smell blood,” he said under his breath. “You gotta make them respect you.”

Next play, Eli called an audible. Cromer blitzed again—Eli read it early, stepped up into the pocket, and zipped a laser across the middle to Torres for a 25-yard gain. No celebration, no taunting. Just quiet execution.

After practice, Radley pulled him aside.

“That audible,” he said. “You break protocol?”

“Yes, sir.”

Radley was silent for a moment, then nodded. “Good. That’s what a quarterback does.”

The confidence grew from there, bit by bit. Eli stayed late after practices, throwing routes with Cam, reviewing protection packages with the O-line, even watching film with backup tight ends who didn’t see the field much. He asked questions. He listened. He learned.

But still, Daniels loomed.

Marcus Daniels was everything a college program loved—charismatic, media-polished, good-looking in that quarterback-commercial kind of way. And he knew how to play the politics of the position. He slapped backs, smiled for reporters, ran clean practices. He wasn’t flashy on the field, but he was consistent, safe, and familiar.

The team was split. Some players, especially the younger ones, leaned toward Eli. They saw the fire, the raw edge. Others stuck with Daniels, preferring the comfort of the known.

In March, Radley announced the spring game would be the final public audition before the depth chart was set for summer camp. The game would be open to alumni, students, media—anyone who wanted to watch the quarterback duel unfold.

Tension followed Eli like a shadow that week. Kira noticed it too.

“Something’s different about you lately,” she said one night as they sat outside a bookstore near campus, sipping coffee. “You used to talk. Now you just stare at the sidewalk like it insulted your mother.”

Eli smiled weakly. “I’ve got the biggest audition of my life in a few days.”

She tilted her head. “I thought you already got the part.”

“No,” he said. “I just got a foot in the door.”

She studied him for a moment, then reached into her bag and handed him a small notebook.

“What’s this?”

“Blank pages. For the stuff you can’t say out loud.”

He opened it. On the inside cover, she’d written: Whatever happens, don’t forget who you were before the lights.

That night, Eli wrote a single line on the first page: I am not afraid of failing. I am afraid of being average.

The day of the spring game dawned gray and cold. The Big House wasn’t packed, but it was loud enough. Students, former players, alumni, all buzzing with anticipation.

Eli wore number ten, crisp white against navy blue, and stood on the sideline next to Daniels as the national anthem played. Cam gave him a nod. So did the offensive coordinator. Even Radley, ever stoic, placed a firm hand on his shoulder before the coin toss.

Daniels started the first half. He was solid—nothing special. Moved the chains. Completed short passes. Avoided mistakes. One touchdown, no turnovers. Predictable.

Then came the second half.

Eli trotted onto the field with the second team offense, but the defense didn’t ease up. First play, a quick out to Torres—twelve yards. Second play, a fake handoff and a deep corner—twenty-four yards. Third play, Eli rolled left, pump-faked, then fired a dart into a tight window between two safeties. Touchdown.

The crowd erupted.

On the sideline, Daniels scowled beneath his helmet.

Eli didn’t celebrate. He jogged back to the bench, took his tablet, and reviewed the play like it was a math quiz. When the coach asked what he saw on the coverage, he answered calmly: “Safety bit the drag route. Corner gave too much cushion.”

Three more drives. Two more touchdowns. One perfect scramble that turned into a 30-yard gain, ending with a slide that showed just the right balance of aggression and control.

By the end of the game, whispers had become roars. The reporters stopped surrounding Daniels. They migrated toward Eli.

One of them—a young guy from the student newspaper—asked the question directly. “Do you think you just won the starting job today?”

Eli glanced at Radley, who stood in the background watching him like a hawk.

“I think I showed what I can do,” Eli said. “That’s all you can ask for.”

That night, the headline on the university sports page read: Brandt Breaks Through. Is It His Time?

Radley didn’t make an official announcement until the following week. They were in the quarterback room, all three QBs seated—Daniels, Eli, and Reggie Hall, the redshirt freshman who rarely saw reps.

Radley paced, eyes sharp.

“This isn’t about politics. It’s not about who smiled more or who made friends with the boosters. It’s about who gives us the best shot to win come fall.”

He paused, then turned toward Eli.

“You’re QB1.”

Silence. Then a faint exhale from Daniels.

Eli didn’t react. Not outwardly. But inside, something shifted—like a gear finally catching.

“Don’t let this go to your head,” Radley said. “This means nothing if you don’t deliver in August.”

After the meeting, Daniels caught him outside the facility.

“Congrats,” he said, though it came out stiff.

“Thanks.”

“I’ll be ready if you screw up.”

Eli met his gaze. “You better be.”

It wasn’t personal. Not really. It was the game.

But games don’t forgive.

That night, Eli walked across campus, notebook in hand. He sat under a streetlight near the engineering building and opened it to a fresh page.

I didn’t come here to be the backup. I came here to change the game.

He closed the notebook and looked up.

The lights of the Big House were still on, glowing in the distance like a beacon.

Fall was coming.

And now, the real work would begin.

Chapter Three: Ann Arbor

Fall descended on Ann Arbor like a war drum, steady and loud and impossible to ignore. The leaves burned into oranges and reds, their colors as defiant as the people who walked beneath them. There was something in the air—a hum, a weight, a rising tension that seemed to pull the whole campus into its rhythm. For Eli Brandt, it was the first time he’d truly felt the city in his chest. It wasn’t just about football anymore. This place had teeth, and now that he was QB1, he was standing inside its open mouth.

The first official practice of the season opened under a blazing sun that did nothing to warm the nerves. Coaches shouted, whistles shrieked, and cleats chewed the turf in perfect, chaotic unison. Eli stood at the front of the offensive unit, helmet under one arm, eyes scanning the field like a general before battle. The weight of leadership pressed into his spine—not just to play well, but to guide, to demand, to believe when everyone else doubted.

Radley was quieter now. More clinical. He no longer barked at Eli after every throw. He’d watch from the sideline, arms folded, expression unreadable. That silence was more frightening than any yelling.

Cam Torres was still his go-to. The chemistry they’d built over spring had only strengthened. On the field, they communicated without words—glances, gestures, subtle tilts of the head. Cam had the burst, the hands, and most importantly, the memory. He remembered every coverage he’d ever beaten and every defender who had dared to press him.

In the locker room, there were still divides. Daniels hadn’t said much since losing the job, but his silence had shape and color. He was still a leader to many, and Eli could feel the tension in meetings, in drills, in the weight room. There were subtle signs—late handoffs in practice, overthrown routes, missed blocks. Nothing obvious enough to report, but enough to notice.

Coach Radley wasn’t blind to it. One afternoon, after a rough scrimmage where Eli got hit three times in as many plays, Radley called a full offensive meeting.

“Let me be crystal clear,” he said, voice low but sharp. “You don’t have to like each other. Hell, I don’t care if you never say another damn word off the field. But when you’re on that line, when the snap comes, you protect your quarterback like he’s carrying your future—because guess what? He is. If anyone’s got a problem with that, now’s the time to leave.”

No one moved. But the temperature in the room dropped a few degrees.

Outside football, Eli’s life was becoming a balancing act he barely controlled. Media demands increased by the week. He had a press handler now, a senior intern named Liv who followed him with a tablet and a schedule and a worried look in her eyes. Reporters wanted to know about everything—his upbringing, his thoughts on rival defenses, his favorite cereal. He had to remind himself not to speak in soundbites, to hold on to his own voice in a sea of microphones.

Kira was the only one who didn’t ask for anything. She still showed up randomly, sometimes dropping off food during long film sessions, sometimes sneaking into the bleachers during practice just to wave, then disappearing before anyone could notice. She never mentioned interviews. Never posted about him. Never asked what the scouts were saying.

“You ever wonder what happens after all this?” she asked one night as they sat on the roof of the communications building, watching the stars blur above the city.

“All the time,” he said. “But I don’t think I’m allowed to.”

“Why not?”

“Because if I think too far ahead, I’ll lose the play in front of me.”

She considered that. “Sounds exhausting.”

“It is.”

But it was worth it—at least, he hoped it was.

The season opener was against Northwestern. A night game. ESPN cameras. National audience.

The locker room before kickoff was electric and hushed all at once. Players moved with purpose, some praying, some shouting, some wrapped in their own private rituals. Eli sat at his locker, lacing his cleats with slow, deliberate hands. He didn’t hear the music. Didn’t hear the crowd. All he heard was the familiar rhythm of his breathing.

Cam slapped his shoulder. “You good?”

“Never been better.”

“Liar.”

Eli smiled.

As they jogged onto the field, the roar was overwhelming. Lights. Chants. Cell phones glowing like stars. Eli glanced around, took it in for one second, then shut it out.

The first drive was clean. A balanced mix of runs and short passes to settle the nerves. On third and six, he zipped a slant to Cam that turned into a forty-yard gain. The crowd erupted. Momentum was theirs.

By the end of the first half, Michigan led 17–10. Eli had one touchdown pass, no turnovers, and a passer rating that would make any coordinator smile. But the second half brought pressure—real pressure. Northwestern came out aggressive. Blitzes disguised as zone coverage, linebackers coming off the edge faster than the line could react. Eli took two sacks in the third quarter and nearly threw a pick on a deep post that Cam managed to break up.

Radley pulled him aside after the drive.

“They’re baiting you with the deep shell. Run the goddamn check-down.”

“I can beat that corner.”

“Sure you can. And if you miss by an inch, we’re down six. Play smart, not proud.”

The next drive, Eli dumped it off twice to the tight end, then hit a draw play that moved the chains. The drive ended in a field goal. Not flashy, but efficient. And it kept the defense on the field.

Final possession. Michigan led by four. Northwestern had one timeout and two minutes left. Eli needed a first down to ice the game.

Third and three.

Radley sent in the call. A safe inside handoff.

Eli looked to the sideline, then looked back at the defense. They were stacking the box.

He changed the play.

Quick slant to Cam. Snap. Throw. Catch. First down.

Game over.

As they knelt to run out the clock, Radley met his eyes across the sideline. No words. Just a nod.

In the post-game conference, Eli kept it short.

“We executed. We adjusted. We finished.”

Reporters asked about the audible.

“I saw the defense. Made a call. That’s football.”

They pressed him about taking over from Daniels.

He didn’t bite. “Marcus is a great player. He helped prepare me for this moment. This win is all of ours.”

Back in the locker room, Radley finally spoke up.

“You made the right read. But don’t make a habit of freelancing without checking the clock.”

Eli grinned. “Yes, sir.”

Later that night, he found himself alone on campus, walking aimlessly through the quiet spaces between buildings. His legs ached. His ribs throbbed. His throat burned from shouting calls all night. But he felt more alive than he ever had.

Kira called.

“You did it.”

“We did it,” he said, smiling.

“No,” she replied. “That was all you.”

There was a pause.

“You still breathing?” she asked.

“Barely.”

“Good. Means you care.”

He sat on a bench beneath an old elm, looking up at the dark sky above the glowing spires of the stadium.

The season had started.

He had won.

But the road ahead was long.

And winning once wasn’t enough.

Not here.

Not now.

With the win over Northwestern behind them, the team moved into what the coaching staff called "the grind phase"—those unforgiving middle weeks of the season where nothing felt new anymore, and everything began to hurt. Gone were the opening jitters and the fresh energy of fall camp. Now it was bruises that didn’t heal and ankle tape that peeled off skin. The practices felt longer. The days ran together. The air got colder, but no one really noticed. All that mattered were the next five opponents and the long road to the Big Ten Championship.

Eli had to learn the difference between endurance and resilience. The body could be trained to withstand—ice baths, stretching, two hours in the film room before breakfast. But the mind, that was trickier. That took repetition. He forced himself into a rhythm: wake up before sunrise, review red-zone film with Radley, then head to his morning lectures, usually half-listening while running plays in his head. Lunch came and went, barely touched. Afternoon practice was full-contact, and the quarterbacks weren’t always spared. Then dinner, team meetings, more film, and maybe—if his body didn’t give out first—homework.

Despite the routine, pressure crept in from every side. Fans started to recognize him around campus. Social media lit up after every game, dissecting his performance with clinical detachment. Every decision was analyzed by people who’d never held a football. Even wins weren’t always enough. Against Indiana, they’d won by a touchdown, but Eli had thrown two interceptions. The student paper ran the headline: Can Brandt Keep Us in Contention?

That one stung more than he expected.

Kira noticed it in the way he shut down, started answering her in half-sentences, retreating into himself between practices and classes. One night, she came over with a six-pack of root beer and a box of crackers shaped like footballs.

“You need to unplug,” she said, tossing him a bottle.

He cracked it open and took a sip without looking at her. “Can’t.”

“Why not?”

“Because if I don’t stay sharp, someone else will.”

“Isn’t that the point of a team? To not have to carry it all alone?”

Eli didn’t respond. He just stared at the flickering light from the desk lamp, jaw tight.

Kira leaned forward. “You know, every time you get hit, I flinch.”

He blinked, caught off guard. “Why?”

“Because I know you won’t say anything if it actually hurts.”

He wanted to argue. But she was right. He was hurting. His ribs from the blitz against Purdue. His wrist from a fall against Iowa. His legs, always his legs, tight as rope from weeks of sprint-outs and scrambles.

But pain was part of it.

That’s what he kept telling himself.

The real test came in late October—Penn State. A ranked opponent, undefeated, with a defense that had allowed fewer points than any team in the country. Their defensive coordinator had a reputation for breaking young quarterbacks. He disguised coverage, baited mistakes, and sent complex blitzes on third down.

Radley was nervous, though he didn’t show it in words. Instead, he doubled Eli’s film workload, brought in extra walk-ons to simulate Penn State’s coverage shells, and put Eli through decision-speed drills until his eyes watered.

“You’re going to be hit,” Radley said flatly. “The question is, will you throw before it happens?”

Game day arrived cold and hostile. The stadium shook with white-out energy, fans waving towels like they were trying to summon a storm. The Michigan sideline was stoic. The players knew what this meant—not just for their record, but for their reputation.

The first quarter was a disaster. Eli misread a coverage on the opening drive and threw a pick-six. The second possession ended in a fumble on a blindside hit. By the time he jogged to the sideline after their third three-and-out, Michigan was down 14–0 and the crowd was louder than thunder.

Radley met him at the bench, calm as always.

“What are you seeing?”

Eli wiped sweat from his forehead. “They’re dropping the safeties late. Showing man, then sliding into zone.”

“Good. So what do you do?”

“Run slants. Use motion. Force them to declare.”

“Do it.”

The next drive, he started in shotgun, called for Cam to motion across the formation, then fired a slant into a window so tight it could’ve sliced his fingers. First down. Then a draw. Then a bootleg rollout to the tight end. They scored six plays later.

Momentum shifted. Not all at once, but enough to feel it.

The second half was a war of attrition. Both teams trading field goals, drives stalling in the red zone. Every yard felt like an argument. But Eli stayed composed. He trusted his reads. Took hits. Bounced up. Called his own protections at the line. Earned the respect of linemen who hadn’t believed in him two months earlier.

With four minutes left in the fourth quarter, tied 20–20, Eli stood in the huddle and looked at the faces around him—Cam, Ellis, Marcus Greene the left guard, and Jalen the third-string tight end who’d stepped up after an injury.

“We’re winning this,” he said. “Right now. This drive. Let’s go.”

They moved 65 yards in ten plays. No huge gainers. Just steady, patient football. On third and six from the 12-yard line, Eli dropped back, saw the pressure, rolled left, pump-faked, then sprinted for the corner. He dove. The pylon flew.

Touchdown.

Silence, then a roar.

Michigan 27. Penn State 20.

The final whistle blew.

Eli stood in the middle of the field, helmet off, hands on his hips, chest heaving.

He’d passed the test.

Back in Ann Arbor, everything changed.

Students who’d barely noticed him in August now stopped him for photos. Professors referenced his stats during lectures. Brands started reaching out through his NIL agent—apparel lines, protein drinks, even a car dealership offering a six-month lease “just for visibility.” He didn’t accept most of it. Not yet. It felt like taking the reward before the battle was done.

But the noise grew louder. ESPN started running segments comparing him to Michigan greats. Some pundits mentioned him in the Heisman conversation. Others said it was too early, that he was just on a hot streak. Either way, his name was in their mouths. The nation had noticed.

Eli stayed focused. At least, he tried to. But there were cracks now. His body was slowing down. His throws came out a half-beat later than before. He woke up sore and didn’t loosen up until halfway through practice. Sleep was hard to come by, and when it came, it was filled with jumbled dreams of playbooks and screaming fans.

One evening, as he sat in the film room alone, Radley walked in and sat beside him.

“You know what makes quarterbacks great?”

Eli looked over, waiting.

“They don’t just play well. They survive. Through hype. Through injury. Through the moments when everyone wants a piece of them and they have nothing left to give. You’re about to walk into that.”

Eli nodded slowly. “I already feel it.”

Radley clapped a hand on his shoulder. “Good. Means you’re awake.”

They watched film in silence for a while after that. Just two men staring at glowing tape, looking for something more than mistakes. Looking for a way to keep it all together.

Because the season wasn’t over.

And the hardest games were still ahead.

Chapter Four: Smoke

The trouble didn’t come with a bang—it came with a flicker. A photograph. A screen. A caption. A whisper that turned into a wildfire before anyone even lit the match. Eli had just wrapped up a Tuesday night film session, his mind still circling a missed read on a zone blitz from the last game, when Cam tossed his phone on the bench with a frown.

“You’ve seen this yet?” Cam asked, rubbing a hand through his curls.

Eli picked up the phone. The screen showed an image—blurry, low-res, but clear enough. He was at a party. Not recent. A few weeks back, after the Illinois win. There was a red Solo cup in his hand. In the background, slightly out of focus, was Marcus Daniels, leaning over a table with a dollar bill in one hand and what looked—maybe—like a white line in front of him. The caption read: Your golden boy QB1. Leaders eat last, right?

Eli didn’t speak. His stomach sank through the concrete.

Cam took the phone back. “It’s all over. Twitter. Reddit. A couple sports blogs already running with it. They’re calling it ‘White Line Wednesday.’”

Eli ran both hands through his hair. “I wasn’t doing anything.”

“I know. But it’s not about truth. It’s about optics. And this? This looks bad.”

The first call came from Liv, his press handler. Her voice was sharp and fast, like someone juggling knives.

“Do not post. Do not comment. Do not like. Do not breathe in a direction that seems defensive. We’re drafting a statement now—denial without sounding too defensive, emphasis on accountability. You’re going to need to sit down with Coach Radley first thing tomorrow. He’s already seen it.”

Eli hung up and sat in silence. The locker room emptied around him.

The storm had begun.

The next morning, the athletic facility buzzed with quiet tension. Players walked with their heads down, whispering to one another in the hallway. Eli entered Radley’s office and found him seated at his desk, tablet in hand, expression unreadable.

“Sit,” Radley said.

Eli obeyed.

For a long time, the only sound was the hum of the heating vent.

“Tell me what happened,” Radley finally said, voice even.

“It was after the Illinois game. We went to a party. Cam was with me. Daniels showed up later. I didn’t know he was going to be there. I had one drink, maybe two. I left early.”

“Were you doing anything illegal?”

“No, sir.”

“Do you know if he was?”

Eli hesitated. “I didn’t see it.”

Radley studied him like he was weighing every breath.

“You understand how this works. There doesn’t need to be proof. Just perception. And right now, the perception is that our quarterback is partying during a playoff run with a former starter who’s possibly doing drugs in the same room.”

“I didn’t even know that picture existed until last night.”

“Doesn’t matter.”

Radley set the tablet down and leaned forward.

“You’re going to issue a statement. Something short. You’ll deny involvement, express responsibility for your image, and remind the public that your focus is on football and your team. You’ll meet with the athletic director and compliance this afternoon. You’ll do a drug test—today. Understood?”

Eli nodded. “Yes, sir.”

Radley softened slightly. “I believe you. But that’s not always enough.”

The test came back clean, as Eli knew it would. But the news cycle had already spun out of control. Pundits questioned his leadership. Anonymous scouts told ESPN he had “maturity concerns.” Talk radio vultures picked his image apart. Daniels issued a statement of his own—cryptic, half-sincere, something about “accountability” and “missteps.”

Even some of the team started acting differently. The locker room got quieter when Eli entered. A few younger players avoided eye contact. The tight end group made a joke during warmups about “checking the air for residue.” Eli kept his face neutral, but the cracks deepened.

After practice, Kira waited outside.

He hadn’t told her about the photo yet, but of course she knew.

She didn’t say hello.

“You have any idea how fast these things move?” she asked. “I saw a segment about you on a morning show that usually talks about celebrity divorces.”

“I didn’t do anything.”

“I know. But they don’t care.”

Eli exhaled, shoulders slumping. “What am I supposed to do? Lie low? Act like it didn’t happen?”

“No. You own what you can. The rest? You ride it out. Let people talk. They’ll move on.”

He looked at her, eyes dark. “Will they?”

“Yes,” she said. “Unless you give them a reason not to.”

The next game was away at Minnesota. The weather was brutal—sleeting rain and wind that whipped across the field like a blade. The stands were half-full, the atmosphere dampened by the conditions and the scandal. Michigan’s offense was sluggish. Eli’s rhythm was off. His throws came late, low, behind the receivers. Cam dropped two passes he normally would’ve caught in his sleep.

Late in the second quarter, with Michigan trailing by six, Eli dropped back and tried to force a throw into a narrow seam. A linebacker read it, stepped in front, and returned it to the 20-yard line. Minnesota scored three plays later.

As he jogged to the sideline, he could feel Radley’s eyes like fire. But the coach said nothing.

Halftime was tense. Eli sat alone in the corner of the locker room, towel over his head, the sound of rain beating on the roof.

Cam came over and sat next to him.

“You’re gripping the ball like it owes you money,” he said.

Eli didn’t respond.

“You want the truth?”

Eli nodded.

Cam leaned in. “You’re playing scared. You’re trying not to screw up. That ain’t the guy who won us Penn State.”

“What if they’re right?” Eli asked quietly.

“They’re not.”

“You sure?”

Cam stood. “No. But I’d rather bet on you than anyone else in this room.”

The second half was a blur. Eli came out calm, focused. He threw short at first, letting the backs and tight ends do the work. Then he started to open it up—slants, out routes, timing patterns that beat the rush by milliseconds. One touchdown. Then another.

Final drive, 78 yards in under two minutes. Rain pouring so hard the yard markers looked like ghosts. On fourth and goal, Eli rolled out, saw no one open, and dove headfirst into the end zone.

Touchdown. Win.

The locker room erupted. Eli stood in the middle of it all, drenched and gasping, his ribs screaming. Cam hugged him. Even a few of the doubters clapped him on the back.

Radley approached, towel in hand.

“Still a long road,” he said.

“I know,” Eli answered.

“But that… that was something.”

He didn’t smile, but his eyes said enough.

The next morning, Eli woke to a new headline: Scandal to Savior: Brandt Silences Doubters in the Rain.

Kira texted a link and wrote, Told you. Don’t give them a reason to keep talking.

He smiled for the first time in days.

The smoke hadn’t cleared.

But he could breathe again.

And the fire was still burning.

Despite the win over Minnesota, the sting of the controversy lingered. It clung to Eli’s image like smoke clings to fabric—persistent, invisible, and impossible to ignore. Even when the headlines began to fade and the late-night pundits moved on to newer scandals, Eli could still feel the judgment. Every time a professor glanced at him in class a second too long, every time a fan hesitated before asking for a photo, it reminded him of what had happened. Not the party. Not the picture. But the feeling—of being one step away from the whole dream unraveling.

The coaching staff tried to keep the focus internal. “Circle the wagons,” Radley called it. They moved meetings behind closed doors, restricted media access, and drilled the players harder than ever. Every practice turned into a gauntlet, not just for conditioning, but for discipline. Miss a read, and you ran. Drop a pass, and the entire unit repeated the rep until it was perfect. It was football stripped of glamour, and Radley liked it that way.

“This is where seasons are made,” he told them in the locker room after a Thursday practice. “Not in the headlines. Not on the field. In the grind. In the spaces between the lights.”

Eli lived in that space now. He rarely left the facility except for class and the occasional late-night walk to clear his mind. His body hurt in ways he didn’t understand. There were bruises on his arms that never seemed to fade, stiffness in his fingers each morning, and a dull ache in his throwing shoulder that even ice baths couldn’t cure. But worse than the physical pain was the quiet battle he fought every time he stepped onto the field—the pressure not just to win, but to prove something. That he deserved to be there. That the picture hadn’t changed who he was.

Kira remained his one escape. She didn’t press him for details about football. She never asked about playbooks or opponents or media spins. Instead, she asked about him. About what it felt like to grow up with the whole town watching. About why he always tapped the football three times before every snap. About the scar on his collarbone that he got from diving off the garage roof when he was twelve.

“Most people want the legend,” she said one night as they sat under the overhang of an old amphitheater just off campus, hidden from the wind. “I want the story.”

He looked at her, half-smiling. “The story’s not always pretty.”

“No good ones are.”

They didn’t label what they were. It wasn’t love, not yet. But it was something solid in a world where everything else felt like it was built on sand.

The team kept winning. Ugly games. Close games. But wins nonetheless. They edged out Michigan State with a last-minute field goal. Survived a triple-overtime thriller against Wisconsin that left half the team limping. Each win pushed them higher in the national rankings, closer to the playoff picture. And each win added weight to Eli’s shoulders.

Daniels, to his credit, stayed silent. He didn’t start drama, didn’t leak anything to the press. But his presence was felt in every quarterback meeting. He took notes. He ran scout team reps with clean mechanics and perfect attitude. And yet, whenever he passed Eli in the hallway or during warmups, there was an edge to his eyes. Not hate. Not jealousy. Just unfinished business.

The team’s leadership council—voted by the players—finally met without the coaches in early November. Eli didn’t expect to be invited. But Cam pulled him aside and handed him a folded note with a time and a location.

“You’re the quarterback,” Cam said. “That means you lead. Whether they trust you yet or not.”

The meeting was held in a rec room beneath the south dorms. Ten players. All starters. Offensive linemen, senior defenders, even Ellis Rowe, the team’s hardest-nosed safety. Eli sat down, silent at first, letting the room gauge him.

One of the guards, Mason King, finally spoke. “Look. You’ve been balling. No one can deny that. But this team ain’t built on stats. It’s built on trust. And that photo… that shook some of us.”

Eli nodded slowly. “I get that.”

“Do you?” Mason leaned forward. “Because from where we sit, it looked like the program was one bad decision from collapsing. And none of us were in that room with you.”

“I get it,” Eli said again. “I didn’t plan for that to happen. I didn’t do anything wrong. But I let my guard down. And I let it become a distraction. That’s on me.”

The room was quiet.

Then Ellis spoke up. “I don’t care about the photo. What I care about is that we’re winning. And that when you took those hits at Wisconsin, you didn’t flinch. That’s leadership.”

“I’m not perfect,” Eli said. “I never claimed to be. But I’m here. I’m committed. And I’ll bleed for this team if I have to. That’s all I know how to do.”

That was the turning point.

The silence shifted. The posture of the players relaxed. And when Cam clapped a hand on Eli’s back as they walked out, it felt heavier than before—not a gesture of support, but of recognition.

With Ohio State looming on the schedule, the pressure reached a new level. The rivalry meant everything. It always had. Legends were made and broken on that field. And for Michigan to make the playoffs, they had to win.

Radley intensified prep. Every meeting dissected Ohio State’s defense like a crime scene. Their safeties were fast. Their defensive ends could bend like rubber bands. Their middle linebacker, a five-star junior named Travis Finch, was known for one thing—hitting quarterbacks until they heard footsteps long after the whistle.

Eli studied Finch. Watched hours of tape. Learned his tendencies. How he tilted his shoulders before a blitz. How he always took a false step to the left before crashing right. Eli didn’t just want to avoid him—he wanted to beat him. Outthink him.

The week leading up to the game was full of tension. Reporters camped outside the facility. A national columnist called Eli “fragile but talented.” ESPN analysts debated whether Michigan’s defense could carry him. Daniels was seen with an NFL scout on the sideline during warmups. Even Kira seemed more distant—buried in a journalism project, she said, though Eli suspected she was also preparing for what might happen if he fell apart.

The night before the game, Eli lay in bed, fully dressed, staring at the ceiling. The quiet was unbearable.

Then came a knock at the door.

He opened it and found Kira there, holding two coffees.

“I figured you wouldn’t sleep,” she said.

He stepped aside, and they sat on the floor, back against the bed, drinking in silence.

“You know what tomorrow is,” he said.

“Yeah. It’s Saturday.”

He smiled faintly. “You always do that. Make things small.”

“They are small. You just forget that sometimes.”

He looked at her, his face hard with the weight of everything.

“What if I lose?” he asked.

She set her cup down. “Then you lose. And you get back up. And you don’t let that be the end of the story.”

“Easy for you to say.”

“No,” she said. “Hard. Because I care.”

The silence returned, but it was softer now.

Outside, the snow had started to fall again.

And tomorrow, the biggest game of Eli’s life waited.

Chapter Five: The Turning Point

The air in Columbus was different. It had a bite to it, not from the cold alone but from something more primal—hate, history, hunger. This was Ohio State. This was the line in the sand that every Michigan player, every fan, every soul who had ever put on the maize and blue circled the day the schedule was released. For Eli Brandt, it was more than just the next game. It was a reckoning.

The morning of the game, Eli stood in the tunnel beneath Ohio Stadium with his helmet in one hand and his nerves coiled tight inside his chest. The crowd above was already roaring, a sea of scarlet that wanted nothing more than to see him fail. All week he had been told about the stakes—by coaches, by analysts, by classmates who whispered good lucks like they were blessings against a coming storm. But no amount of talk could prepare him for the moment when the marching band’s drums faded and the announcer called his name over the speakers. The boos rained down like hail.

Coach Radley walked past him, clapped his shoulder, and said without looking back, “They don’t boo nobodies.”

Eli nodded, rolled his shoulders, and stepped out onto the field.

The opening drive was textbook. Michigan’s line held firm, giving him enough time to complete a series of crisp passes that moved the chains and quieted the jeering—if only a little. Cam Torres broke free on a deep post, and Eli hit him in stride for a thirty-eight-yard gain. The offense stalled near the red zone, but they walked away with three points and momentum.

Ohio State responded quickly. Their quarterback, a polished senior named R.J. Kessler, orchestrated a no-huddle drive that sliced through Michigan’s secondary like a scalpel. They scored in five plays. Just like that, 7–3.

The next few possessions were a blur of hard hits, missed opportunities, and small battles fought in the trenches. Finch—Ohio State’s middle linebacker—lived up to the hype. He stuffed runs, disrupted passing lanes, and knocked Eli to the turf twice in the second quarter. Each time, Finch stood over him with cold eyes, no taunt, just presence. That was worse somehow. It wasn’t personal. It was surgical.

At halftime, the score was 14–13, Ohio State by one. The locker room was tight with tension. The air buzzed with adrenaline and doubt. Coach Radley paced silently while the players gulped water and studied their tablets. Eli sat at the far end, arms wrapped in ice packs, head tilted back against the cool metal of his locker.

“You good?” Cam asked, sitting beside him.

“Yeah,” Eli lied.

“You sure?”

Eli nodded slowly. “He’s fast.”

“Then be faster.”

That was all Cam said.

Radley finally stepped to the center of the room. “It’s a one-point game,” he said. “You think you’re tired? So are they. You think you’ve taken hits? So have they. What separates good from great isn’t talent. It’s what you do when there’s nothing left. When your body says no, and your mind whispers yes.”

He turned to Eli. “You lead.”

The third quarter was brutal. Ohio State turned up the pressure. They blitzed on nearly every passing down, forcing Eli to throw off-balance, off-schedule. He took another sack, this time landing hard on his elbow. He winced, but got up, shook it out, and kept going. Pain was irrelevant. Survival was the mission.

Late in the third, Michigan’s defense made a stand, forcing a fumble and giving Eli the ball at the Ohio State 45-yard line. On first down, he faked a handoff, dropped back, and saw Cam streaking across the field on a deep crossing route. He planted, fired, and felt Finch crashing into him just as the ball left his hand.

The crowd gasped.

The ball flew.

Cam caught it.

Touchdown.

The sideline erupted. Eli lay on the ground for a second longer than usual. The hit had knocked the wind out of him. Trainers rushed over, but he waved them off. He stood up, slowly, chest burning, ribs screaming.

When he made it to the sideline, Radley grabbed his face mask and pulled him close.

“You want to come out?”

Eli didn’t even answer. He just shook his head and picked up his helmet.

The fourth quarter was a war of attrition. Field goals exchanged. A near interception dropped by Ohio State’s cornerback. Another hit from Finch that left Eli’s ears ringing. Still, he kept playing, kept throwing, kept reading the defense like a book with fire at the edges.

With just under two minutes left, Michigan trailed 27–26. One drive. Seventy-five yards. Season on the line.

Eli walked into the huddle and looked at each player.

“We’re gonna win this,” he said.

“No trick plays,” Ellis muttered.

“No tricks,” Eli said. “Just heart.”

The first play was a checkdown to the running back. Nine yards. The second, a quick slant to Cam. First down. The third, a rollout to the left, where Eli had to duck under a linebacker and slide for the gain.

Forty-five seconds.

Thirty-four yards to go.

They lined up in trips right. Eli read the safety drifting toward the boundary and called an audible. Cam nodded, adjusted his stance.

Snap.

He dropped back.

Pressure again—Finch this time, coming clean up the middle.

Eli stepped into the throw, even as the linebacker closed in.

The ball arced.

It hung in the air, slicing through the roar.

Cam reached. Leapt.

Caught.

Touchdown.

Michigan 32. Ohio State 27.

Eli didn’t see the aftermath. His vision blurred as he hit the turf, Finch’s helmet clipping his jaw as they collided mid-release. Trainers rushed to him. The crowd was a screaming blur. The lights above looked like stars flickering too fast.

He came to on the sideline, blinking up at Radley.

“We win?” he croaked.

Radley smiled. “You did.”

The post-game whirlwind was a storm of cameras, interviews, celebration, and chaos. Eli was named MVP. The media called it “a legendary performance.” Analysts compared him to Tom Brady, to Deshaun Watson, to every other clutch quarterback who had stared down the odds and walked away with history in their wake.

But none of that stayed with him as much as the quiet moment after the tunnel cleared. Kira was there, standing near the team bus, her coat zipped to her chin, hands shoved in her pockets. When he saw her, she smiled—but it wasn’t a wide grin. It was something else. Something proud. Something tired.

He walked up, bruised, sore, helmet still in hand.

“Told you I’d get back up,” he said.

She reached up and touched the cut on his chin gently.

“And you didn’t give them a reason to keep talking,” she replied.

They stood there for a moment, the night cold around them, the noise of the stadium fading behind them.

“I think,” she said softly, “you just became the story.”

Eli looked down, not smiling, but not frowning either.

“No,” he said.

“I just turned the page.”

Back in Ann Arbor, the victory over Ohio State transformed everything. The campus buzzed like a struck bell. Students blasted fight songs out of dorm windows. Faculty wore team sweatshirts to lectures. Bars stayed open late, serving blue-and-yellow shots and looping highlights of Eli’s game-winning throw to Cam Torres on the mounted screens. The air in town had shifted—it was fuller, louder, vibrating with collective belief.

For Eli, it was a surreal kind of aftermath. He couldn’t walk across the Diag without being stopped for pictures or handshakes. Even professors began using his name metaphorically in lectures—“Don’t just guess on the midterm. Be like Brandt: know when to throw.” At first, it made him smile. But quickly, it became something else—heavier. No one saw the bruises still forming on his ribs, or the tightness in his back every morning, or the pressure behind his eyes that never seemed to go away. They saw the highlight reel. The legend. But not the work. Not the toll.

The team had earned a spot in the Big Ten Championship against Wisconsin—a rematch. The stakes were higher now. If they won, they were guaranteed a playoff berth. National title contention. A shot at the biggest stage in college football. But everyone knew it would take more than talent to get there. Wisconsin had improved since their last meeting. Their defense had become nastier, more disciplined, their run game almost impossible to stop.

Coach Radley didn’t celebrate the Ohio State win for long. At Monday morning practice, he stepped into the film room with his typical gravel-voiced authority and laid it bare.

“That was a war. You survived. Good. But surviving last week doesn’t win this one. You are not champions yet. You are just tired. And now you have to win again.”

Radley’s tone filtered into every part of the program that week. The trainers doubled their efforts. Practices were sharper, tighter, shorter. There was less talk of legacy and more about assignments. Less about emotion, more about execution.

Eli led like he always had—by example. He ran every sprint to the line, even when his calves screamed. He stayed after drills to walk through blitz pickups with his running backs. He studied Wisconsin’s front seven late into the night, finding tells, patterns, the smallest details that might give him an edge. Finch had left bruises on his body, but Kessler, the Wisconsin quarterback, would be trying to erase all of that. This was no longer about a rivalry. It was about destiny.

The night before the Big Ten Championship, the team stayed in a hotel in downtown Indianapolis. Eli’s room was high above the city, his window looking down on the glowing streets. He stood at the glass with the playbook in his hand, not reading anymore—just holding it. His body ached. Not just from hits, but from everything. From pressure. From fear. From the weight of carrying so much hope.

Cam was lying on the bed behind him, headphones on, tapping one hand against his chest like he was keeping time with his heartbeat.

“You ever think about what happens if we lose?” Eli asked without turning.

Cam sat up, slid the headphones off. “Yeah.”

“And?”

“Then we get back up.”

Eli nodded slowly. “Everyone keeps saying that.”

“That’s because it’s true,” Cam said. “But also, we’re not going to lose. You know why?”

“Why?”

“Because we already did that. Against them. In triple overtime. And we bled for it. We gave them their scare. This time, we take everything.”

Eli didn’t answer. But the weight in his shoulders shifted. Just slightly.

Game day.

Lucas Oil Stadium was packed to the rafters, split down the middle with red and navy. The noise was deafening from the start. The air itself felt tight, charged like static before a lightning strike. Eli stood at midfield for the coin toss, eyes locked with Wisconsin’s captain. There was no handshake, no nod of respect. This wasn’t that kind of game.

Michigan won the toss. Deferred.

The defense took the field first and made a statement with a three-and-out. Wisconsin couldn’t move the ball. The sideline roared. It was exactly the tone-setter they needed.

Eli’s first snap was a handoff—safe, controlled. Second play, a slant to Cam, caught and run for 12. Third, a fake, rollout, and a dart to the tight end. Momentum. Confidence. By the time they reached the red zone, the Wisconsin linebackers had begun hesitating. Eli called a designed run, followed a pulling guard, and dove forward for the touchdown.

He didn’t celebrate. He just pointed to his line and jogged back to the sideline.

Radley met him with a rare glimmer of approval. “Good start. But it’s a long game.”

It was.

Wisconsin answered with a slow, grinding drive that ate clock and ended in seven. The second quarter was a stalemate. The defenses hardened. Both quarterbacks began taking hits. Cam left the field briefly after twisting his ankle on a comeback route. The backup receiver dropped a key third-down pass. Wisconsin hit a 52-yard field goal as time expired in the half.

Halftime: 13–10, Wisconsin.

In the locker room, Eli sat alone at first, legs stretched out, ice wrapped around his left wrist. The atmosphere was different from the Ohio State game. Tighter. More clinical. The tension didn’t feel like nerves—it felt like potential coiled too tightly.

Radley stepped into the center of the room.

“You’ve been here before,” he said. “Down at half. Gas in the tank. And everything still ahead. I’m not going to give you a speech. I don’t need to. You already know what to do.”

Then he looked at Eli. “It’s your game. Finish it.”

The second half was like trench warfare. Every yard was earned. Eli ran more than usual, not by design but by necessity. The pocket kept collapsing, and he had to make plays with his legs. He scrambled for a third down early in the third quarter that left him limping. Cam returned, heavily taped, and pulled in two clutch catches to keep drives alive.

Midway through the fourth quarter, the score was tied 20–20.

Then came the fumble.

Eli dropped back on second-and-eight, pressure came off the edge, and before he could step up, the ball was swatted loose. Wisconsin recovered at midfield. The air left the stadium. Radley didn’t scream. He just put his hands on his head, then turned back to the defense.

The Wolverines held, miraculously. A huge sack pushed Wisconsin out of field goal range.

Eli got the ball back with just over four minutes to play. One last chance.

He stepped into the huddle, out of breath, his shoulder throbbing.

“Alright,” he said, voice steady. “Eighty yards. This is where we live now.”

Cam nodded. “All day.”

The drive started slow—checkdowns, short runs, a screen pass that almost broke for a touchdown. They crossed midfield. Then came a brutal third-and-twelve. Radley called in a conservative pass play.

Eli waved it off.

He saw the safeties creeping, the linebacker sliding to the flat too early.

He called a vertical seam route for the backup tight end.

Snap.

Drop.

Throw.

Strike.

Caught.

Thirty-seven yards.

The stadium erupted.

Two plays later, Michigan was at the six-yard line. Time ticked under a minute.

They handed off on first down—no gain.

Timeout.

Second down—quick slant to Cam. Incomplete. Nearly intercepted.

Timeout.

Third and goal.

Radley didn’t send in a play.

He looked at Eli from the sideline and simply nodded.

This was his moment.

Eli stepped under center, scanned the field.

Wisconsin showed blitz.

He changed the protection, checked into an option read.

Snap.

He rolled right, tucked the ball, and at the last second, flipped it forward to Cam, who dove over the goal line.

Touchdown.

Game.

Michigan 27, Wisconsin 20.

Eli collapsed in the end zone, arms outstretched, chest heaving.

He didn’t move for a long moment.

Then Cam pulled him up.

“You did it,” Cam said, voice raw.

“No,” Eli said. “We did.”

After the trophy ceremony, after the confetti, after the interviews, Eli stood alone on the field. The stadium lights were beginning to dim, the noise had faded, but he remained there, staring into the distance.

Kira found him there, hands in her coat pockets.

“You alright?” she asked.

“I think so.”

She stepped closer. “You made it.”

He looked at her, his voice hoarse. “I don’t even know what that means anymore.”

She smiled. “Then keep going until you figure it out.”

And so, under the dimming lights of the championship stage, Eli Brandt—quarterback, survivor, leader—stood tall, not because he had all the answers, but because he had earned the right to keep asking the questions.

The playoffs were next.

But the story was already bigger than the score.

Chapter Six: The Edge of Glory

December in Ann Arbor turned the world into glass. Sidewalks slicked with frost, windows glowing with holiday lights, and snow layered rooftops like icing on a gingerbread city. Finals week came and went in a blur of caffeine and sleepless nights. Students left for winter break in waves, their laughter echoing through the half-empty campus, but Eli Brandt remained behind—no suitcase, no plans, just a playbook in his backpack and the weight of January ahead.

The playoffs.

Michigan was in. Official. Cemented. The Big Ten champions were headed to the semifinals, where they would face the USC Trojans, a team that had made a habit of humiliating opponents with speed, flash, and swagger. USC didn’t just win—they scored like it was an art form. Their quarterback, Trey Mills, was a finalist for the Heisman and had already graced the cover of Sports Illustrated with a headline that read: The New Prince of the Pocket.

Eli studied his tape the way a hunter might study a predator. He watched Mills shift in the pocket, roll with grace, flick touchdowns with barely a bend of the elbow. But it wasn’t awe he felt. It was focus. Measured, hungry focus.

Coach Radley pushed harder than ever. The practices leading up to the semifinal were brutal, often stretching into cold nights under floodlights that buzzed like angry hornets. The staff flew in former players to run scout-team looks. Everything was sharper, more exacting. Every second on the field had to mean something.

“You made it this far,” Radley told them in a meeting. “But don’t let the success fool you. You’re still prey. Everyone outside this room wants to see you fold. They think the Big Ten was a fluke. They think your quarterback isn’t ready. So let’s prove them wrong.”

The team responded with grim intensity.

But the pressure began to leak into other parts of Eli’s life. The media presence swelled again. Journalists called his high school coach, his neighbors, even the diner his mother used to work at. Speculation turned personal. One article questioned whether Eli’s father—who had not attended a single Michigan game—was estranged. Another suggested that Eli’s rise to fame was “a carefully crafted PR tale of blue-collar redemption.”

He stopped reading the articles.

Kira noticed.

“You’re shutting down again,” she said during a walk near the frozen river, her scarf pulled tight against her chin.

“I’m fine.”

“You’re lying.”

He kicked at the snow. “I just want to play.”

“You want to win.”

“There’s no difference anymore.”

She looked at him, eyes softening. “There is. And if you forget that, you’ll start playing scared again.”

He didn’t respond. But the truth of her words sank deep.

The team arrived in Pasadena three days before the game. The Rose Bowl. The setting was surreal—sunshine and palm trees in December, blue skies with no trace of the Michigan cold. Reporters swarmed the hotel. Cameras followed their buses like hounds. Fans in maize and blue flooded the streets.

Eli tried to block it all out. He wore headphones whenever he left his room. He kept his hoodie up, head down. But every now and then, someone would break through—an old man offering a handshake and a thank-you, a teenager who asked to take a selfie and then cried quietly afterward. It reminded Eli why this mattered. Why it had to matter.

At practice, the tempo was relentless. USC’s defense was speed-oriented, built on chaos—stunts, disguises, edge pressure. Eli spent hours going over their nickel formations. Radley quizzed him constantly, often mid-practice.

“Safety rotates—what now?”

“Hot read. Inside slant.”

“Linebacker blitzes off weakside?”

“Step up, swing pass, trust the chip.”

Radley nodded but didn’t praise. He never did. Not verbally. His approval came through more subtle means—calling more complex packages for Eli to run, letting him adjust plays at the line, giving him room to lead.

Still, the nerves came at night.

Eli couldn’t sleep. He’d lie in the dark of the hotel room, watching the ceiling fan spin, listening to the sound of his own heartbeat. His mind ran plays in sequence—first down, second down, checkdowns, audibles, escape routes. Each time he closed his eyes, he saw the snap, felt the rush, saw the moment he had to decide. It wasn’t fear exactly. But it was close. Fear of wasting it. Fear of blinking. Fear of not becoming who everyone thought he already was.

On the eve of the game, he found himself wandering the empty stadium. The Rose Bowl loomed in silence, its seats like endless rows of watchers waiting to judge. The grass had already been painted with the playoff logos. The end zones shined in school colors under the moonlight.

Eli sat on the fifty-yard line, legs crossed, hands resting on his knees. He didn’t pray. He didn’t ask for a miracle. He just listened to the quiet.

Then footsteps.

Radley appeared beside him, wearing a simple windbreaker, holding two coffees. He handed one to Eli and sat down without a word.

They sipped in silence for a long time.

Finally, Radley spoke.

“I played here once. Backup quarterback. Didn’t see the field. Held the clipboard so tight, I thought it might shatter.”

Eli smiled faintly.

Radley continued. “Everyone always wants to know what it feels like to win. But they never ask about the fear. The kind that doesn’t go away when the whistle blows. The kind that lives in your chest no matter how well you prepare.”

“I know that kind,” Eli said.

“Then you’re ready.”

Eli nodded, more to himself than to Radley.

They sat a while longer, two men on the edge of everything, the stadium holding its breath around them.

Game day. Clear skies. Seventy degrees. A sellout crowd packed with color and noise. The Rose Bowl shimmered like a dream. But to Eli, it felt more like a test.

The opening drive was disastrous.

Michigan’s offensive line was slow to adjust to USC’s speed. Eli was sacked on the second play. A false start followed. They punted after three downs.

USC responded with a long, methodical drive that ended in a touchdown.

7–0.

The second possession went no better. Eli scrambled out of pressure, only to throw behind his receiver. Another punt.

Panic started to creep in—not just in the crowd, but in the team. Linemen barked at each other. The receivers dropped shoulders. Even Cam, usually composed, slammed his helmet after a missed block.

Radley called a timeout midway through the second quarter. On the sideline, he got in Eli’s face.

“You’re playing their game,” he said. “Fast, panicked, reactive. Slow it down. Make it yours.”

Eli nodded, sweat stinging his eyes.

The next drive changed everything.

He called an audible on the second play, shifting to a delayed screen. It worked—22 yards. Then a quick slant to Cam. Then a deep fade to the tight end, caught at the sideline. The offense found its rhythm, not with force, but with calm.

With thirty seconds left in the half, Eli faked a handoff, bootlegged right, and dove into the end zone.

7–7.

Momentum shifted. The crowd felt it. So did USC.

The second half was a blur of speed and violence. Mills and Eli traded touchdowns like boxers trading punches. Eli ran for one. Threw for two. Took a helmet to the hip on a late hit that wasn’t called. He didn’t flinch.

The final drive came with the game tied 28–28 and under two minutes remaining.

They started on their own 25.

Eli completed a screen for seven.

A crossing route for twelve.

A scramble for six.

A deep comeback for seventeen.

Ticking clock. Burning lungs. Hands trembling.

Third and ten from the USC 31.

Eli stepped up to the line, scanned the defense. He saw the safety cheating toward Cam. Knew the corner would jump the route. He looked to the weak side, nodded to his second receiver—Jalen, the backup tight end, untested, overlooked.

Snap.

Pressure came.

Eli sidestepped the rush, stepped up, and fired over the middle.

Jalen caught it. Broke one tackle.

Touchdown.

The stadium erupted.

Eli raised his arms, not in celebration, but in release. The months, the hits, the doubts, the noise—all of it left him in that moment.

Michigan won.

They were going to the National Championship.

And Eli Brandt had just crossed from story to legend.

The flight back to Michigan felt unreal. Not because of the victory—they’d earned that—but because of the quiet. The plane was filled with players passed out in awkward positions, still wearing the remnants of celebration: grass-stained sweats, Rose Bowl patches, confetti in their shoelaces. The adrenaline had drained, leaving behind only exhaustion and a strange sort of peace. No one needed to talk. The game had said everything.

Eli sat by the window, headphones over his ears, not playing music, just using them as a barrier. The sky outside was dark, endless, but the light above his seat glowed softly, illuminating the notebook in his lap. He turned to a fresh page and stared at it for a long time.

One more game.

That’s all he wrote.

Kira met him at the airport. She wasn’t in the crowd of fans and parents that waited with banners and shouts, but parked down the block, leaning against her car with a quiet smile. Eli saw her and exhaled, tension slipping from his shoulders.

“You look like you just crawled out of a war,” she said as he approached.

“I feel worse.”

“Was it worth it?”

He nodded. “Every second.”

They didn’t talk about the game. Not about the throws or the bruises or the crowd. Instead, they drove through the empty streets of Ann Arbor, windows down, cold air stinging their faces, music low and steady. It was their ritual now, these drives. A way to find something real amid the noise.

“You’ve got the title game in two weeks,” she said as they parked in front of his dorm. “You ready?”

“I don’t know,” he admitted. “But I want it.”

“Then you are.”

He leaned in, forehead against hers.

“Stay close,” he said.

“Always.”

The lead-up to the national championship wasn’t like before. The press was heavier. The demands higher. The stakes—somehow—felt larger, even though they were already as big as they could get. Michigan would face Georgia, the defending champions, and the team most analysts had already crowned.

Georgia was the machine. They didn’t make mistakes. Their quarterback was surgical, their defense monstrous. Watching their film was like watching a tutorial in dismantling opponents. They were bigger, stronger, more experienced. The Vegas odds gave Michigan a fifteen-point disadvantage.

Radley loved it.

He opened the first team meeting with a single line.

“No one thinks we belong here.”

He let the silence sit, then added, “So let’s ruin their math.”

Training intensified. There were no more learning curves, no more coddling. The coaches ran each play like it was the final one. Mistakes were corrected instantly. No time wasted. No corners cut. They practiced in the cold. They practiced with crowd noise pumped through speakers until their ears rang. Every detail mattered now.

For Eli, the week was a blur. Wake up. Lift. Watch film. Practice. Hydrate. Run walkthroughs. Stretch. Sleep—barely.

And yet, somewhere in the chaos, something inside him began to settle.

This wasn’t fear anymore.

It was readiness.

Three days before the flight to Houston, where the championship would be played, Radley called Eli into his office. He didn’t have a tablet or notes—just sat behind his desk, arms crossed.

“You’ve come a long way,” he said.

Eli nodded. “We all have.”

“No,” Radley said. “I’m not talking about the team. I’m talking about you. The kid who walked into my office nine months ago didn’t know how to lead. He knew how to throw. He knew how to fight. But he didn’t know how to carry.”

“I’m still learning.”

“You’ll keep learning. But I want you to understand something before we take that flight.”

Radley leaned forward.

“Win or lose, you’ve changed this place. You’ve changed this team. You’ve taken us back to the top of the mountain.”

Eli didn’t speak. The weight of those words settled in his chest.

“I won’t tell you to win for me,” Radley said. “Win for you. For the road it took to get here. For Darrington. For every cracked rib and sleepless night and punchline you ate on the way up.”

Eli left the office and stood in the hallway for a long time, staring at the national title banner from 1997.

He touched it once.

Then walked away.

The team arrived in Houston to warm weather and fanfare. ESPN reporters lined the baggage claim. Fans camped outside the hotel. Georgia’s team arrived an hour later, with cameras broadcasting every step.

The media tried to stir tension. Eli was asked whether he felt “intimidated” by Georgia’s defense.

“They’re a great team,” he said. “But we didn’t come this far to watch.”

At the official press conference, Georgia’s coach called Michigan “tough, physical, and dangerous.”

When a reporter asked Mills, the Georgia quarterback, about Eli’s rise, he smirked slightly.

“He’s played well. But we’ve seen flash-in-the-pan before.”

The quote was everywhere by nightfall.

Eli didn’t respond.

But Cam taped a photo of it inside his locker, circled the quote, and wrote, BURN IT DOWN.

Game night.

NRG Stadium lit up like a supernova. Over 70,000 fans packed the seats, with millions more watching at home. The tunnel was loud, the turf soft under cleats, and the lights so bright they seemed to pierce the sky.

Eli stood behind the offensive line, waiting for the first snap. The crowd roared. Georgia’s defense crouched like wolves ready to pounce.

He breathed in through his nose.

Out through his mouth.

Snap.

The first drive ended in a sack.

The second, a three-and-out.

Georgia’s pressure was relentless, their coverage airtight. Eli took hit after hit, and the scoreboard began to reflect it.

By halftime, Michigan trailed 17–3.

The locker room was tense. Players rubbed their arms, shook out their legs, avoided eye contact. Eli sat on the bench, helmet in hand, staring at nothing.

Then Cam spoke up.

“You remember Penn State?” he said.

The room looked up.

“You remember being down? Everyone thinking we were cooked?”

No one spoke.

“You remember what happened when we stopped playing scared?”

Eli stood.

“We’re not finished,” he said. “We’re not folding. We didn’t come this far to be a good story. We came to write the ending.”

They clapped. They stood. They believed.

The second half was war.

Eli scrambled for yards. He slid through pressure. He took hits and kept getting up. One touchdown. Then another. The score tightened. 20–17.

Fourth quarter. Michigan had the ball, trailing by three, two minutes on the clock.

Eli looked to the sideline. Radley gave no signal. Just nodded.

Snap.

The drive was poetry—quick reads, perfect blocks, timing routes that made the stadium tilt on its axis. They reached the red zone with thirty seconds remaining.

Third and goal.

Eli stepped up, saw the blitz.

He rolled right, looked for Cam—but he was covered.

Time slowing.

Then Jalen flashed across the end zone, uncovered for a split second.

Eli threw.

Touchdown.

The crowd erupted.

Michigan 24. Georgia 20.

Seconds bled off the clock. Georgia’s final Hail Mary fell incomplete.

Game over.

Eli dropped to one knee as the team poured onto the field.

He’d done it.

They’d done it.

National Champions.

Confetti fell.

Cameras flashed.

But Eli didn’t smile for the crowd.

He smiled when he saw Kira waiting at the edge of the field, hands trembling, tears streaking down her cheeks.

He ran to her.

They didn’t speak.

They just held on.

Tight.

Like nothing else mattered.

Because right then—nothing else did.

Chapter Seven: The Morning After

In the quiet hours after the celebration faded, long after the last chants had died down and the stadium lights dimmed to a hum, Eli sat alone on the edge of his hotel bed staring at the national championship cap crumpled in his hands. Around him, the suite was still littered with reminders of the win—towels thrown over chairs, game wristbands on the desk, the faint smell of Gatorade still clinging to the air. The trophy sat upright on the table like it didn’t belong, too polished, too surreal.

His body ached in ways he couldn’t begin to describe. Not just sore—depleted. His ribs were bruised, his legs stiff, his throwing shoulder sore down to the joint. But what struck him most was the emptiness. Not disappointment, but a strange calm. For months, he’d lived with the throttle wide open, every thought dominated by the next play, the next opponent, the next mountain. Now, with the summit reached, he felt as if he were hovering above the moment—watching it, rather than living it.

Cam had passed out in the other room after the afterparty, snoring lightly beneath a pile of branded blankets. The rest of the team had split up—some to family, some to press, some to celebrations that might stretch into morning. Radley had hugged Eli hard after the trophy presentation, whispered something that sounded like “You earned this,” and disappeared into the crowd of alumni and staff.

Eli turned the cap over in his hands again.

He should’ve felt triumphant.

He should’ve felt like the king of the world.

But all he could think about was what came next.

The next day, the world exploded around them. News vans camped outside the team hotel. Twitter trended with Brandt Delivers, Michigan Rises, and QB1 for the Ages. Sports talk shows debated if Eli’s performance ranked among the greatest ever seen in a championship game. NFL scouts began leaking projections. First-round pick. Possibly top ten. The whispers that had once felt like dreams now took the shape of decisions.

Eli tried to block it out. He rode the team bus in silence, answered every interview with poise, and kept the spotlight at arm’s length. But every hour brought a new headline. ESPN analysts said he should strike while his stock was high. A popular college football blogger wrote that “there’s nothing left for him to prove.” Even Radley, who always guarded his opinions, told Eli during a quiet moment, “The window only stays open so long.”

But for Eli, it wasn’t about windows.

It was about what he owed—to himself, to the team, to Darrington.

Back in Ann Arbor, he avoided the press for a few days. Stayed off social media. Walked the campus in the early mornings when it was just snow and silence. The world expected an answer.

He didn’t have one yet.

One evening, he walked into Coach Radley’s office without knocking. The old man was watching film from the Georgia game, rewinding a third-quarter blitz Michigan had narrowly escaped.

“You thinking about it?” Radley asked without turning.

Eli sat.

“Yeah.”

Radley let the footage roll. “If I tell you to stay, I’m selfish. If I tell you to go, I’m giving up on next season. So I won’t say either.”

“I’m not scared of the NFL,” Eli said.

“I know.”

“But I’m scared of walking away before I’m ready.”

Radley nodded. “Only you can answer that.”

They sat for a while, just watching film. No words. Just the game they both loved flickering on the screen.

That night, Eli found himself in the practice facility, standing at the fifty-yard line under dimmed lights. The field was empty, the air cold. He threw passes into the darkness, one after another, until his shoulder burned and his breath came in steam. He wasn’t practicing. He was listening. Searching.

Footsteps echoed behind him.

Kira.

“You always find the weirdest places to think,” she said, arms wrapped tightly around herself.

“It’s quiet here.”

“You like quiet.”

“Sometimes.”

She stepped beside him, watching the stillness.

“They’re saying you’ll go top ten,” she said.

“I know.”

“You thinking about it?”

“I’m thinking about everything.”

She waited, letting him wrestle with it.

“I came here to play football,” he said finally. “To see what I was made of. I didn’t come here for glory. Not really.”

“And?”

“I’m not done.”

Kira looked up at him. “You sure?”

He nodded. “One more year.”

Strangers high-fived him in the halls like they’d shared blood on the field. Even the faculty janitor, who never spoke a word in the three
