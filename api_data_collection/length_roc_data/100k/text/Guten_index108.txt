The public has already learned those particulars       of the crime which came out in the police investigation, but a       good deal was suppressed upon that occasion, since the case for       the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not       necessary to bring forward all the facts. Only now, at the end of       nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those missing links       which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. The crime was       of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to me       compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the       greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life.       Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I       think of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy,       amazement, and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind. Let       me say to that public, which has shown some interest in those       glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and       actions of a very remarkable man, that they are not to blame me       if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I should have       considered it my first duty to do so, had I not been barred by a       positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn       upon the third of last month.        It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes       had interested me deeply in crime, and that after his       disappearance I never failed to read with care the various       problems which came before the public. And I even attempted, more       than once, for my own private satisfaction, to employ his methods       in their solution, though with indifferent success. There was       none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald       Adair. As I read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a       verdict of willful murder against some person or persons unknown,       I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss which the       community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes. There       were points about this strange business which would, I was sure,       have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police       would have been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by       the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal       agent in Europe. All day, as I drove upon my round, I turned over       the case in my mind and found no explanation which appeared to me       to be adequate. At the risk of telling a twice-told tale, I will       recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the       conclusion of the inquest.        The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of       Maynooth, at that time governor of one of the Australian       colonies. Adair’s mother had returned from Australia to undergo       the operation for cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her       daughter Hilda were living together at 427, Park Lane. The youth       moved in the best society—had, so far as was known, no enemies       and no particular vices. He had been engaged to Miss Edith       Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by       mutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it       had left any very profound feeling behind it. For the rest, the       man’s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his       habits were quiet and his nature unemotional. Yet it was upon       this easy-going young aristocrat that death came, in most strange       and unexpected form, between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty       on the night of March 30, 1894.        Ronald Adair was fond of cards—playing continually, but never for       such stakes as would hurt him. He was a member of the Baldwin,       the Cavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs. It was shown that,       after dinner on the day of his death, he had played a rubber of       whist at the latter club. He had also played there in the       afternoon. The evidence of those who had played with him—Mr.       Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran—showed that the game       was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards.       Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more. His fortune was       a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way affect       him. He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he       was a cautious player, and usually rose a winner. It came out in       evidence that, in partnership with Colonel Moran, he had actually       won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting, some       weeks before, from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral. So much for       his recent history as it came out at the inquest.        On the evening of the crime, he returned from the club exactly at       ten. His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a       relation. The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front       room on the second floor, generally used as his sitting-room. She       had lit a fire there, and as it smoked she had opened the window.       No sound was heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the hour of       the return of Lady Maynooth and her daughter. Desiring to say       good-night, she attempted to enter her son’s room. The door was       locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to their cries       and knocking. Help was obtained, and the door forced. The       unfortunate young man was found lying near the table. His head       had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but       no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room. On the table       lay two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in       silver and gold, the money arranged in little piles of varying       amount. There were some figures also upon a sheet of paper, with       the names of some club friends opposite to them, from which it       was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make       out his losses or winnings at cards.        A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the       case more complex. In the first place, no reason could be given       why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside.       There was the possibility that the murderer had done this, and       had afterwards escaped by the window. The drop was at least       twenty feet, however, and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay       beneath. Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of       having been disturbed, nor were there any marks upon the narrow       strip of grass which separated the house from the road.       Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had       fastened the door. But how did he come by his death? No one could       have climbed up to the window without leaving traces. Suppose a       man had fired through the window, he would indeed be a remarkable       shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound. Again,       Park Lane is a frequented thoroughfare; there is a cab stand       within a hundred yards of the house. No one had heard a shot. And       yet there was the dead man and there the revolver bullet, which       had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so inflicted       a wound which must have caused instantaneous death. Such were the       circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery, which were further       complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said,       young Adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had       been made to remove the money or valuables in the room.        All day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit       upon some theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that       line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be       the starting-point of every investigation. I confess that I made       little progress. In the evening I strolled across the Park, and       found myself about six o’clock at the Oxford Street end of Park       Lane. A group of loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a       particular window, directed me to the house which I had come to       see. A tall, thin man with coloured glasses, whom I strongly       suspected of being a plain-clothes detective, was pointing out       some theory of his own, while the others crowded round to listen       to what he said. I got as near him as I could, but his       observations seemed to me to be absurd, so I withdrew again in       some disgust. As I did so I struck against an elderly, deformed       man, who had been behind me, and I knocked down several books       which he was carrying. I remember that as I picked them up, I       observed the title of one of them, _The Origin of Tree Worship_,       and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile,       who, either as a trade or as a hobby, was a collector of obscure       volumes. I endeavoured to apologize for the accident, but it was       evident that these books which I had so unfortunately maltreated       were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner. With a       snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I saw his curved       back and white side-whiskers disappear among the throng.        My observations of No. 427, Park Lane did little to clear up the       problem in which I was interested. The house was separated from       the street by a low wall and railing, the whole not more than       five feet high. It was perfectly easy, therefore, for anyone to       get into the garden, but the window was entirely inaccessible,       since there was no waterpipe or anything which could help the       most active man to climb it. More puzzled than ever, I retraced       my steps to Kensington. I had not been in my study five minutes       when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me. To       my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book       collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of       white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least,       wedged under his right arm.        “You’re surprised to see me, sir,” said he, in a strange,       croaking voice.        I acknowledged that I was.        “Well, I’ve a conscience, sir, and when I chanced to see you go       into this house, as I came hobbling after you, I thought to       myself, I’ll just step in and see that kind gentleman, and tell       him that if I was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm       meant, and that I am much obliged to him for picking up my       books.”        “You make too much of a trifle,” said I. “May I ask how you knew       who I was?”        “Well, sir, if it isn’t too great a liberty, I am a neighbour of       yours, for you’ll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church       Street, and very happy to see you, I am sure. Maybe you collect       yourself, sir. Here’s _British Birds_, and _Catullus_, and _The       Holy War_—a bargain, every one of them. With five volumes you       could just fill that gap on that second shelf. It looks untidy,       does it not, sir?”        I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. When I turned       again, Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study       table. I rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter       amazement, and then it appears that I must have fainted for the       first and the last time in my life. Certainly a grey mist swirled       before my eyes, and when it cleared I found my collar-ends undone       and the tingling after-taste of brandy upon my lips. Holmes was       bending over my chair, his flask in his hand.        “My dear Watson,” said the well-remembered voice, “I owe you a       thousand apologies. I had no idea that you would be so affected.”        I gripped him by the arms.        “Holmes!” I cried. “Is it really you? Can it indeed be that you       are alive? Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of       that awful abyss?”        “Wait a moment,” said he. “Are you sure that you are really fit       to discuss things? I have given you a serious shock by my       unnecessarily dramatic reappearance.”        “I am all right, but indeed, Holmes, I can hardly believe my       eyes. Good heavens! to think that you—you of all men—should be       standing in my study.” Again I gripped him by the sleeve, and       felt the thin, sinewy arm beneath it. “Well, you’re not a spirit       anyhow,” said I. “My dear chap, I’m overjoyed to see you. Sit       down, and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm.”        He sat opposite to me, and lit a cigarette in his old, nonchalant       manner. He was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book       merchant, but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white       hair and old books upon the table. Holmes looked even thinner and       keener than of old, but there was a dead-white tinge in his       aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a       healthy one.        “I am glad to stretch myself, Watson,” said he. “It is no joke       when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several       hours on end. Now, my dear fellow, in the matter of these       explanations, we have, if I may ask for your cooperation, a hard       and dangerous night’s work in front of us. Perhaps it would be       better if I gave you an account of the whole situation when that       work is finished.”        “I am full of curiosity. I should much prefer to hear now.”        “You’ll come with me to-night?”        “When you like and where you like.”        “This is, indeed, like the old days. We shall have time for a       mouthful of dinner before we need go. Well, then, about that       chasm. I had no serious difficulty in getting out of it, for the       very simple reason that I never was in it.”        “You never were in it?”        “No, Watson, I never was in it. My note to you was absolutely       genuine. I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my       career when I perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late       Professor Moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to       safety. I read an inexorable purpose in his grey eyes. I       exchanged some remarks with him, therefore, and obtained his       courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards       received. I left it with my cigarette-box and my stick, and I       walked along the pathway, Moriarty still at my heels. When I       reached the end I stood at bay. He drew no weapon, but he rushed       at me and threw his long arms around me. He knew that his own       game was up, and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me. We       tottered together upon the brink of the fall. I have some       knowledge, however, of baritsu, or the Japanese system of       wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me. I       slipped through his grip, and he with a horrible scream kicked       madly for a few seconds, and clawed the air with both his hands.       But for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over he       went. With my face over the brink, I saw him fall for a long way.       Then he struck a rock, bounded off, and splashed into the water.”        I listened with amazement to this explanation, which Holmes       delivered between the puffs of his cigarette.        “But the tracks!” I cried. “I saw, with my own eyes, that two       went down the path and none returned.”        “It came about in this way. The instant that the Professor had       disappeared, it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky       chance Fate had placed in my way. I knew that Moriarty was not       the only man who had sworn my death. There were at least three       others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased       by the death of their leader. They were all most dangerous men.       One or other would certainly get me. On the other hand, if all       the world was convinced that I was dead they would take       liberties, these men, they would soon lay themselves open, and       sooner or later I could destroy them. Then it would be time for       me to announce that I was still in the land of the living. So       rapidly does the brain act that I believe I had thought this all       out before Professor Moriarty had reached the bottom of the       Reichenbach Fall.        “I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me. In your       picturesque account of the matter, which I read with great       interest some months later, you assert that the wall was sheer.       That was not literally true. A few small footholds presented       themselves, and there was some indication of a ledge. The cliff       is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility, and       it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path       without leaving some tracks. I might, it is true, have reversed       my boots, as I have done on similar occasions, but the sight of       three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have       suggested a deception. On the whole, then, it was best that I       should risk the climb. It was not a pleasant business, Watson.       The fall roared beneath me. I am not a fanciful person, but I       give you my word that I seemed to hear Moriarty’s voice screaming       at me out of the abyss. A mistake would have been fatal. More       than once, as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot       slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I thought that I was       gone. But I struggled upward, and at last I reached a ledge       several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where I could       lie unseen, in the most perfect comfort. There I was stretched,       when you, my dear Watson, and all your following were       investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the       circumstances of my death.        “At last, when you had all formed your inevitable and totally       erroneous conclusions, you departed for the hotel, and I was left       alone. I had imagined that I had reached the end of my       adventures, but a very unexpected occurrence showed me that there       were surprises still in store for me. A huge rock, falling from       above, boomed past me, struck the path, and bounded over into the       chasm. For an instant I thought that it was an accident, but a       moment later, looking up, I saw a man’s head against the       darkening sky, and another stone struck the very ledge upon which       I was stretched, within a foot of my head. Of course, the meaning       of this was obvious. Moriarty had not been alone. A       confederate—and even that one glance had told me how dangerous a       man that confederate was—had kept guard while the Professor had       attacked me. From a distance, unseen by me, he had been a witness       of his friend’s death and of my escape. He had waited, and then       making his way round to the top of the cliff, he had endeavoured       to succeed where his comrade had failed.        “I did not take long to think about it, Watson. Again I saw that       grim face look over the cliff, and I knew that it was the       precursor of another stone. I scrambled down on to the path. I       don’t think I could have done it in cold blood. It was a hundred       times more difficult than getting up. But I had no time to think       of the danger, for another stone sang past me as I hung by my       hands from the edge of the ledge. Halfway down I slipped, but, by       the blessing of God, I landed, torn and bleeding, upon the path.       I took to my heels, did ten miles over the mountains in the       darkness, and a week later I found myself in Florence, with the       certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me.        “I had only one confidant—my brother Mycroft. I owe you many       apologies, my dear Watson, but it was all-important that it       should be thought I was dead, and it is quite certain that you       would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end       had you not yourself thought that it was true. Several times       during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to       you, but always I feared lest your affectionate regard for me       should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my       secret. For that reason I turned away from you this evening when       you upset my books, for I was in danger at the time, and any show       of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention       to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable       results. As to Mycroft, I had to confide in him in order to       obtain the money which I needed. The course of events in London       did not run so well as I had hoped, for the trial of the Moriarty       gang left two of its most dangerous members, my own most       vindictive enemies, at liberty. I travelled for two years in       Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa, and       spending some days with the head lama. You may have read of the       remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am       sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news       of your friend. I then passed through Persia, looked in at Mecca,       and paid a short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum       the results of which I have communicated to the Foreign Office.       Returning to France, I spent some months in a research into the       coal-tar derivatives, which I conducted in a laboratory at       Montpellier, in the south of France. Having concluded this to my       satisfaction and learning that only one of my enemies was now       left in London, I was about to return when my movements were       hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery,       which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed       to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities. I came over       at once to London, called in my own person at Baker Street, threw       Mrs. Hudson into violent hysterics, and found that Mycroft had       preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been.       So it was, my dear Watson, that at two o’clock to-day I found       myself in my old armchair in my own old room, and only wishing       that I could have seen my old friend Watson in the other chair       which he has so often adorned.”        Such was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that       April evening—a narrative which would have been utterly       incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of       the tall, spare figure and the keen, eager face, which I had       never thought to see again. In some manner he had learned of my       own sad bereavement, and his sympathy was shown in his manner       rather than in his words. “Work is the best antidote to sorrow,       my dear Watson,” said he; “and I have a piece of work for us both       to-night which, if we can bring it to a successful conclusion,       will in itself justify a man’s life on this planet.” In vain I       begged him to tell me more. “You will hear and see enough before       morning,” he answered. “We have three years of the past to       discuss. Let that suffice until half-past nine, when we start       upon the notable adventure of the empty house.”        It was indeed like old times when, at that hour, I found myself       seated beside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket, and the       thrill of adventure in my heart. Holmes was cold and stern and       silent. As the gleam of the street-lamps flashed upon his austere       features, I saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his       thin lips compressed. I knew not what wild beast we were about to       hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal London, but I was well       assured, from the bearing of this master huntsman, that the       adventure was a most grave one—while the sardonic smile which       occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good       for the object of our quest.        I had imagined that we were bound for Baker Street, but Holmes       stopped the cab at the corner of Cavendish Square. I observed       that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right       and left, and at every subsequent street corner he took the       utmost pains to assure that he was not followed. Our route was       certainly a singular one. Holmes’s knowledge of the byways of       London was extraordinary, and on this occasion he passed rapidly       and with an assured step through a network of mews and stables,       the very existence of which I had never known. We emerged at last       into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses, which led us       into Manchester Street, and so to Blandford Street. Here he       turned swiftly down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden       gate into a deserted yard, and then opened with a key the back       door of a house. We entered together, and he closed it behind us.        The place was pitch dark, but it was evident to me that it was an       empty house. Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare       planking, and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the       paper was hanging in ribbons. Holmes’s cold, thin fingers closed       round my wrist and led me forward down a long hall, until I dimly       saw the murky fanlight over the door. Here Holmes turned suddenly       to the right and we found ourselves in a large, square, empty       room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but faintly lit in the       centre from the lights of the street beyond. There was no lamp       near, and the window was thick with dust, so that we could only       just discern each other’s figures within. My companion put his       hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear.        “Do you know where we are?” he whispered.        “Surely that is Baker Street,” I answered, staring through the       dim window.        “Exactly. We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our       own old quarters.”        “But why are we here?”        “Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque       pile. Might I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little       nearer to the window, taking every precaution not to show       yourself, and then to look up at our old rooms—the starting-point       of so many of your little fairy-tales? We will see if my three       years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise       you.”        I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. As my       eyes fell upon it, I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. The       blind was down, and a strong light was burning in the room. The       shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in       hard, black outline upon the luminous screen of the window. There       was no mistaking the poise of the head, the squareness of the       shoulders, the sharpness of the features. The face was turned       half-round, and the effect was that of one of those black       silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. It was a       perfect reproduction of Holmes. So amazed was I that I threw out       my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me.       He was quivering with silent laughter.        “Well?” said he.        “Good heavens!” I cried. “It is marvellous.”        “I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite       variety,” said he, and I recognized in his voice the joy and       pride which the artist takes in his own creation. “It really is       rather like me, is it not?”        “I should be prepared to swear that it was you.”        “The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier, of       Grenoble, who spent some days in doing the moulding. It is a bust       in wax. The rest I arranged myself during my visit to Baker       Street this afternoon.”        “But why?”        “Because, my dear Watson, I had the strongest possible reason for       wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was       really elsewhere.”        “And you thought the rooms were watched?”        “I _knew_ that they were watched.”        “By whom?”        “By my old enemies, Watson. By the charming society whose leader       lies in the Reichenbach Fall. You must remember that they knew,       and only they knew, that I was still alive. Sooner or later they       believed that I should come back to my rooms. They watched them       continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive.”        “How do you know?”        “Because I recognized their sentinel when I glanced out of my       window. He is a harmless enough fellow, Parker by name, a       garroter by trade, and a remarkable performer upon the       jew’s-harp. I cared nothing for him. But I cared a great deal for       the much more formidable person who was behind him, the bosom       friend of Moriarty, the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff,       the most cunning and dangerous criminal in London. That is the       man who is after me to-night Watson, and that is the man who is       quite unaware that we are after _him_.”        My friend’s plans were gradually revealing themselves. From this       convenient retreat, the watchers were being watched and the       trackers tracked. That angular shadow up yonder was the bait, and       we were the hunters. In silence we stood together in the darkness       and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front       of us. Holmes was silent and motionless; but I could tell that he       was keenly alert, and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the       stream of passers-by. It was a bleak and boisterous night and the       wind whistled shrilly down the long street. Many people were       moving to and fro, most of them muffled in their coats and       cravats. Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen the same       figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared to       be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house       some distance up the street. I tried to draw my companion’s       attention to them; but he gave a little ejaculation of       impatience, and continued to stare into the street. More than       once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his       fingers upon the wall. It was evident to me that he was becoming       uneasy, and that his plans were not working out altogether as he       had hoped. At last, as midnight approached and the street       gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in       uncontrollable agitation. I was about to make some remark to him,       when I raised my eyes to the lighted window, and again       experienced almost as great a surprise as before. I clutched       Holmes’s arm, and pointed upward.        “The shadow has moved!” I cried.        It was indeed no longer the profile, but the back, which was       turned towards us.        Three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his       temper or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his       own.        “Of course it has moved,” said he. “Am I such a farcical bungler,       Watson, that I should erect an obvious dummy, and expect that       some of the sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it? We       have been in this room two hours, and Mrs. Hudson has made some       change in that figure eight times, or once in every quarter of an       hour. She works it from the front, so that her shadow may never       be seen. Ah!” He drew in his breath with a shrill, excited       intake. In the dim light I saw his head thrown forward, his whole       attitude rigid with attention. Outside the street was absolutely       deserted. Those two men might still be crouching in the doorway,       but I could no longer see them. All was still and dark, save only       that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure       outlined upon its centre. Again in the utter silence I heard that       thin, sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement.       An instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of       the room, and I felt his warning hand upon my lips. The fingers       which clutched me were quivering. Never had I known my friend       more moved, and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and       motionless before us.        But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had       already distinguished. A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not       from the direction of Baker Street, but from the back of the very       house in which we lay concealed. A door opened and shut. An       instant later steps crept down the passage—steps which were meant       to be silent, but which reverberated harshly through the empty       house. Holmes crouched back against the wall, and I did the same,       my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver. Peering through       the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker than       the blackness of the open door. He stood for an instant, and then       he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room. He was       within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had braced       myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea       of our presence. He passed close beside us, stole over to the       window, and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a       foot. As he sank to the level of this opening, the light of the       street, no longer dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon his       face. The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement. His       two eyes shone like stars, and his features were working       convulsively. He was an elderly man, with a thin, projecting       nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache. An       opera hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening       dress shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. His face       was gaunt and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his       hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it       down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang. Then from the       pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object, and he busied       himself in some task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if       a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still kneeling upon       the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength       upon some lever, with the result that there came a long,       whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click.       He straightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his       hand was a sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. He       opened it at the breech, put something in, and snapped the       breech-lock. Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the       barrel upon the ledge of the open window, and I saw his long       moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered       along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he       cuddled the butt into his shoulder; and saw that amazing target,       the black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of       his foresight. For an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then       his finger tightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud       whiz and a long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant       Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman’s back, and hurled       him flat upon his face. He was up again in a moment, and with       convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat, but I struck       him on the head with the butt of my revolver, and he dropped       again upon the floor. I fell upon him, and as I held him my       comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the clatter       of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform,       with one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front       entrance and into the room.        “That you, Lestrade?” said Holmes.        “Yes, Mr. Holmes. I took the job myself. It’s good to see you       back in London, sir.”        “I think you want a little unofficial help. Three undetected       murders in one year won’t do, Lestrade. But you handled the       Molesey Mystery with less than your usual—that’s to say, you       handled it fairly well.”        We had all risen to our feet, our prisoner breathing hard, with a       stalwart constable on each side of him. Already a few loiterers       had begun to collect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the       window, closed it, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade had produced       two candles, and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns. I       was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner.        It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was       turned towards us. With the brow of a philosopher above and the       jaw of a sensualist below, the man must have started with great       capacities for good or for evil. But one could not look upon his       cruel blue eyes, with their drooping, cynical lids, or upon the       fierce, aggressive nose and the threatening, deep-lined brow,       without reading Nature’s plainest danger-signals. He took no heed       of any of us, but his eyes were fixed upon Holmes’s face with an       expression in which hatred and amazement were equally blended.       “You fiend!” he kept on muttering. “You clever, clever fiend!”        “Ah, Colonel!” said Holmes, arranging his rumpled collar.       “‘Journeys end in lovers’ meetings,’ as the old play says. I       don’t think I have had the pleasure of seeing you since you       favoured me with those attentions as I lay on the ledge above the       Reichenbach Fall.”        The colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance.       “You cunning, cunning fiend!” was all that he could say.        “I have not introduced you yet,” said Holmes. “This, gentlemen,       is Colonel Sebastian Moran, once of Her Majesty’s Indian Army,       and the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever       produced. I believe I am correct Colonel, in saying that your bag       of tigers still remains unrivalled?”        The fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my       companion. With his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was       wonderfully like a tiger himself.        “I wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a       _shikari_,” said Holmes. “It must be very familiar to you. Have       you not tethered a young kid under a tree, lain above it with       your rifle, and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger? This       empty house is my tree, and you are my tiger. You have possibly       had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers,       or in the unlikely supposition of your own aim failing you.       These,” he pointed around, “are my other guns. The parallel is       exact.”        Colonel Moran sprang forward with a snarl of rage, but the       constables dragged him back. The fury upon his face was terrible       to look at.        “I confess that you had one small surprise for me,” said Holmes.       “I did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this       empty house and this convenient front window. I had imagined you       as operating from the street, where my friend, Lestrade and his       merry men were awaiting you. With that exception, all has gone as       I expected.”        Colonel Moran turned to the official detective.        “You may or may not have just cause for arresting me,” said he,       “but at least there can be no reason why I should submit to the       gibes of this person. If I am in the hands of the law, let things       be done in a legal way.”        “Well, that’s reasonable enough,” said Lestrade. “Nothing further       you have to say, Mr. Holmes, before we go?”        Holmes had picked up the powerful air-gun from the floor, and was       examining its mechanism.        “An admirable and unique weapon,” said he, “noiseless and of       tremendous power: I knew Von Herder, the blind German mechanic,       who constructed it to the order of the late Professor Moriarty.       For years I have been aware of its existence though I have never       before had the opportunity of handling it. I commend it very       specially to your attention, Lestrade and also the bullets which       fit it.”        “You can trust us to look after that, Mr. Holmes,” said Lestrade,       as the whole party moved towards the door. “Anything further to       say?”        “Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer?”        “What charge, sir? Why, of course, the attempted murder of Mr.       Sherlock Holmes.”        “Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose to appear in the matter at       all. To you, and to you only, belongs the credit of the       remarkable arrest which you have effected. Yes, Lestrade, I       congratulate you! With your usual happy mixture of cunning and       audacity, you have got him.”        “Got him! Got whom, Mr. Holmes?”        “The man that the whole force has been seeking in vain—Colonel       Sebastian Moran, who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an       expanding bullet from an air-gun through the open window of the       second-floor front of No. 427, Park Lane, upon the thirtieth of       last month. That’s the charge, Lestrade. And now, Watson, if you       can endure the draught from a broken window, I think that half an       hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable       amusement.”        Our old chambers had been left unchanged through the supervision       of Mycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson. As I       entered I saw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness, but the old       landmarks were all in their place. There were the chemical corner       and the acid-stained, deal-topped table. There upon a shelf was       the row of formidable scrap-books and books of reference which       many of our fellow-citizens would have been so glad to burn. The       diagrams, the violin-case, and the pipe-rack—even the Persian       slipper which contained the tobacco—all met my eyes as I glanced       round me. There were two occupants of the room—one, Mrs. Hudson,       who beamed upon us both as we entered—the other, the strange       dummy which had played so important a part in the evening’s       adventures. It was a wax-coloured model of my friend, so       admirably done that it was a perfect facsimile. It stood on a       small pedestal table with an old dressing-gown of Holmes’s so       draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely       perfect.        “I hope you observed all precautions, Mrs. Hudson?” said Holmes.        “I went to it on my knees, sir, just as you told me.”        “Excellent. You carried the thing out very well. Did you observe       where the bullet went?”        “Yes, sir. I’m afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust, for it       passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall. I       picked it up from the carpet. Here it is!”        Holmes held it out to me. “A soft revolver bullet, as you       perceive, Watson. There’s genius in that, for who would expect to       find such a thing fired from an airgun? All right, Mrs. Hudson. I       am much obliged for your assistance. And now, Watson, let me see       you in your old seat once more, for there are several points       which I should like to discuss with you.”        He had thrown off the seedy frockcoat, and now he was the Holmes       of old in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown which he took from his       effigy.        “The old _shikari’s_ nerves have not lost their steadiness, nor       his eyes their keenness,” said he, with a laugh, as he inspected       the shattered forehead of his bust.        “Plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through       the brain. He was the best shot in India, and I expect that there       are few better in London. Have you heard the name?”        “No, I have not.”        “Well, well, such is fame! But, then, if I remember right, you       had not heard the name of Professor James Moriarty, who had one       of the great brains of the century. Just give me down my index of       biographies from the shelf.”        He turned over the pages lazily, leaning back in his chair and       blowing great clouds from his cigar.        “My collection of M’s is a fine one,” said he. “Moriarty himself       is enough to make any letter illustrious, and here is Morgan the       poisoner, and Merridew of abominable memory, and Mathews, who       knocked out my left canine in the waiting-room at Charing Cross,       and, finally, here is our friend of to-night.”        He handed over the book, and I read:        _Moran_, _Sebastian_, _Colonel_. Unemployed. Formerly 1st       Bangalore Pioneers. Born London, 1840. Son of Sir Augustus Moran,       C.B., once British Minister to Persia. Educated Eton and Oxford.       Served in Jowaki Campaign, Afghan Campaign, Charasiab       (despatches), Sherpur, and Cabul. Author of _Heavy Game of the       Western Himalayas_ (1881); _Three Months in the Jungle_ (1884).       Address: Conduit Street. Clubs: The Anglo-Indian, the       Tankerville, the Bagatelle Card Club.        On the margin was written, in Holmes’s precise hand:        The second most dangerous man in London.        “This is astonishing,” said I, as I handed back the volume. “The       man’s career is that of an honourable soldier.”        “It is true,” Holmes answered. “Up to a certain point he did       well. He was always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still       told in India how he crawled down a drain after a wounded       man-eating tiger. There are some trees, Watson, which grow to a       certain height, and then suddenly develop some unsightly       eccentricity. You will see it often in humans. I have a theory       that the individual represents in his development the whole       procession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden turn to good       or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line       of his pedigree. The person becomes, as it were, the epitome of       the history of his own family.”        “It is surely rather fanciful.”        “Well, I don’t insist upon it. Whatever the cause, Colonel Moran       began to go wrong. Without any open scandal, he still made India       too hot to hold him. He retired, came to London, and again       acquired an evil name. It was at this time that he was sought out       by Professor Moriarty, to whom for a time he was chief of the       staff. Moriarty supplied him liberally with money, and used him       only in one or two very high-class jobs, which no ordinary       criminal could have undertaken. You may have some recollection of       the death of Mrs. Stewart, of Lauder, in 1887. Not? Well, I am       sure Moran was at the bottom of it, but nothing could be proved.       So cleverly was the colonel concealed that, even when the       Moriarty gang was broken up, we could not incriminate him. You       remember at that date, when I called upon you in your rooms, how       I put up the shutters for fear of air-guns? No doubt you thought       me fanciful. I knew exactly what I was doing, for I knew of the       existence of this remarkable gun, and I knew also that one of the       best shots in the world would be behind it. When we were in       Switzerland he followed us with Moriarty, and it was undoubtedly       he who gave me that evil five minutes on the Reichenbach ledge.        “You may think that I read the papers with some attention during       my sojourn in France, on the look-out for any chance of laying       him by the heels. So long as he was free in London, my life would       really not have been worth living. Night and day the shadow would       have been over me, and sooner or later his chance must have come.       What could I do? I could not shoot him at sight, or I should       myself be in the dock. There was no use appealing to a       magistrate. They cannot interfere on the strength of what would       appear to them to be a wild suspicion. So I could do nothing. But       I watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner or later I       should get him. Then came the death of this Ronald Adair. My       chance had come at last. Knowing what I did, was it not certain       that Colonel Moran had done it? He had played cards with the lad,       he had followed him home from the club, he had shot him through       the open window. There was not a doubt of it. The bullets alone       are enough to put his head in a noose. I came over at once. I was       seen by the sentinel, who would, I knew, direct the colonel’s       attention to my presence. He could not fail to connect my sudden       return with his crime, and to be terribly alarmed. I was sure       that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way _at once_,       and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose. I       left him an excellent mark in the window, and, having warned the       police that they might be needed—by the way, Watson, you spotted       their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracy—I took up       what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation, never       dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack. Now,       my dear Watson, does anything remain for me to explain?”        “Yes,” said I. “You have not made it clear what was Colonel       Moran’s motive in murdering the Honourable Ronald Adair?”        “Ah! my dear Watson, there we come into those realms of       conjecture, where the most logical mind may be at fault. Each may       form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence, and yours is       as likely to be correct as mine.”        “You have formed one, then?”        “I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts. It came       out in evidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had, between       them, won a considerable amount of money. Now, Moran undoubtedly       played foul—of that I have long been aware. I believe that on the       day of the murder Adair had discovered that Moran was cheating.       Very likely he had spoken to him privately, and had threatened to       expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the       club, and promised not to play cards again. It is unlikely that a       youngster like Adair would at once make a hideous scandal by       exposing a well-known man so much older than himself. Probably he       acted as I suggest. The exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin       to Moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card-gains. He therefore       murdered Adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how       much money he should himself return, since he could not profit by       his partner’s foul play. He locked the door lest the ladies       should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing       with these names and coins. Will it pass?”        “I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth.”        “It will be verified or disproved at the trial. Meanwhile, come       what may, Colonel Moran will trouble us no more. The famous       air-gun of Von Herder will embellish the Scotland Yard Museum,       and once again Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to       examining those interesting little problems which the complex       life of London so plentifully presents.”     THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER         “From the point of view of the criminal expert,” said Mr.       Sherlock Holmes, “London has become a singularly uninteresting       city since the death of the late lamented Professor Moriarty.”        “I can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to       agree with you,” I answered.        “Well, well, I must not be selfish,” said he, with a smile, as he       pushed back his chair from the breakfast-table. “The community is       certainly the gainer, and no one the loser, save the poor       out-of-work specialist, whose occupation has gone. With that man       in the field, one’s morning paper presented infinite       possibilities. Often it was only the smallest trace, Watson, the       faintest indication, and yet it was enough to tell me that the       great malignant brain was there, as the gentlest tremors of the       edges of the web remind one of the foul spider which lurks in the       centre. Petty thefts, wanton assaults, purposeless outrage—to the       man who held the clue all could be worked into one connected       whole. To the scientific student of the higher criminal world, no       capital in Europe offered the advantages which London then       possessed. But now——” He shrugged his shoulders in humorous       deprecation of the state of things which he had himself done so       much to produce.        At the time of which I speak, Holmes had been back for some       months, and I at his request had sold my practice and returned to       share the old quarters in Baker Street. A young doctor, named       Verner, had purchased my small Kensington practice, and given       with astonishingly little demur the highest price that I ventured       to ask—an incident which only explained itself some years later,       when I found that Verner was a distant relation of Holmes, and       that it was my friend who had really found the money.        Our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had       stated, for I find, on looking over my notes, that this period       includes the case of the papers of ex-President Murillo, and also       the shocking affair of the Dutch steamship _Friesland_, which so       nearly cost us both our lives. His cold and proud nature was       always averse, however, from anything in the shape of public       applause, and he bound me in the most stringent terms to say no       further word of himself, his methods, or his successes—a       prohibition which, as I have explained, has only now been       removed.        Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair after his       whimsical protest, and was unfolding his morning paper in a       leisurely fashion, when our attention was arrested by a       tremendous ring at the bell, followed immediately by a hollow       drumming sound, as if someone were beating on the outer door with       his fist. As it opened there came a tumultuous rush into the       hall, rapid feet clattered up the stair, and an instant later a       wild-eyed and frantic young man, pale, disheveled, and       palpitating, burst into the room. He looked from one to the other       of us, and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that       some apology was needed for this unceremonious entry.        “I’m sorry, Mr. Holmes,” he cried. “You mustn’t blame me. I am       nearly mad. Mr. Holmes, I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane.”        He made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both       his visit and its manner, but I could see, by my companion’s       unresponsive face, that it meant no more to him than to me.        “Have a cigarette, Mr. McFarlane,” said he, pushing his case       across. “I am sure that, with your symptoms, my friend Dr. Watson       here would prescribe a sedative. The weather has been so very       warm these last few days. Now, if you feel a little more       composed, I should be glad if you would sit down in that chair,       and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are, and what it is       that you want. You mentioned your name, as if I should recognize       it, but I assure you that, beyond the obvious facts that you are       a bachelor, a solicitor, a Freemason, and an asthmatic, I know       nothing whatever about you.”        Familiar as I was with my friend’s methods, it was not difficult       for me to follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of       attire, the sheaf of legal papers, the watch-charm, and the       breathing which had prompted them. Our client, however, stared in       amazement.        “Yes, I am all that, Mr. Holmes; and, in addition, I am the most       unfortunate man at this moment in London. For heaven’s sake,       don’t abandon me, Mr. Holmes! If they come to arrest me before I       have finished my story, make them give me time, so that I may       tell you the whole truth. I could go to jail happy if I knew that       you were working for me outside.”        “Arrest you!” said Holmes. “This is really most grati—most       interesting. On what charge do you expect to be arrested?”        “Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower       Norwood.”        My companion’s expressive face showed a sympathy which was not, I       am afraid, entirely unmixed with satisfaction.        “Dear me,” said he, “it was only this moment at breakfast that I       was saying to my friend, Dr. Watson, that sensational cases had       disappeared out of our papers.”        Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the       _Daily Telegraph_, which still lay upon Holmes’s knee.        “If you had looked at it, sir, you would have seen at a glance       what the errand is on which I have come to you this morning. I       feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every man’s       mouth.” He turned it over to expose the central page. “Here it       is, and with your permission I will read it to you. Listen to       this, Mr. Holmes. The headlines are: ‘Mysterious Affair at Lower       Norwood. Disappearance of a Well-known Builder. Suspicion of       Murder and Arson. A Clue to the Criminal.’ That is the clue which       they are already following, Mr. Holmes, and I know that it leads       infallibly to me. I have been followed from London Bridge       Station, and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant       to arrest me. It will break my mother’s heart—it will break her       heart!” He wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension, and       swayed backward and forward in his chair.        I looked with interest upon this man, who was accused of being       the perpetrator of a crime of violence. He was flaxen-haired and       handsome, in a washed-out negative fashion, with frightened blue       eyes, and a clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth. His       age may have been about twenty-seven, his dress and bearing that       of a gentleman. From the pocket of his light summer overcoat       protruded the bundle of indorsed papers which proclaimed his       profession.        “We must use what time we have,” said Holmes. “Watson, would you       have the kindness to take the paper and to read the paragraph in       question?”        Underneath the vigorous headlines which our client had quoted, I       read the following suggestive narrative:        “Late last night, or early this morning, an incident occurred at       Lower Norwood which points, it is feared, to a serious crime. Mr.       Jonas Oldacre is a well-known resident of that suburb, where he       has carried on his business as a builder for many years. Mr.       Oldacre is a bachelor, fifty-two years of age, and lives in Deep       Dene House, at the Sydenham end of the road of that name. He has       had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits, secretive       and retiring. For some years he has practically withdrawn from       the business, in which he is said to have massed considerable       wealth. A small timber-yard still exists, however, at the back of       the house, and last night, about twelve o’clock, an alarm was       given that one of the stacks was on fire. The engines were soon       upon the spot, but the dry wood burned with great fury, and it       was impossible to arrest the conflagration until the stack had       been entirely consumed. Up to this point the incident bore the       appearance of an ordinary accident, but fresh indications seem to       point to serious crime. Surprise was expressed at the absence of       the master of the establishment from the scene of the fire, and       an inquiry followed, which showed that he had disappeared from       the house. An examination of his room revealed that the bed had       not been slept in, that a safe which stood in it was open, that a       number of important papers were scattered about the room, and       finally, that there were signs of a murderous struggle, slight       traces of blood being found within the room, and an oaken       walking-stick, which also showed stains of blood upon the handle.       It is known that Mr. Jonas Oldacre had received a late visitor in       his bedroom upon that night, and the stick found has been       identified as the property of this person, who is a young London       solicitor named John Hector McFarlane, junior partner of Graham       and McFarlane, of 426, Gresham Buildings, E.C. The police believe       that they have evidence in their possession which supplies a very       convincing motive for the crime, and altogether it cannot be       doubted that sensational developments will follow.           “LATER.—It is rumoured as we go to press that Mr. John Hector           McFarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the           murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre. It is at least certain that a           warrant has been issued. There have been further and sinister           developments in the investigation at Norwood. Besides the           signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate builder it           is now known that the French windows of his bedroom (which is           on the ground floor) were found to be open, that there were           marks as if some bulky object had been dragged across to the           wood-pile, and, finally, it is asserted that charred remains           have been found among the charcoal ashes of the fire. The           police theory is that a most sensational crime has been           committed, that the victim was clubbed to death in his own           bedroom, his papers rifled, and his dead body dragged across           to the wood-stack, which was then ignited so as to hide all           traces of the crime. The conduct of the criminal           investigation has been left in the experienced hands of           Inspector Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, who is following up the           clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity.”        Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and fingertips together       to this remarkable account.        “The case has certainly some points of interest,” said he, in his       languid fashion. “May I ask, in the first place, Mr. McFarlane,       how it is that you are still at liberty, since there appears to       be enough evidence to justify your arrest?”        “I live at Torrington Lodge, Blackheath, with my parents, Mr.       Holmes, but last night, having to do business very late with Mr.       Jonas Oldacre, I stayed at an hotel in Norwood, and came to my       business from there. I knew nothing of this affair until I was in       the train, when I read what you have just heard. I at once saw       the horrible danger of my position, and I hurried to put the case       into your hands. I have no doubt that I should have been arrested       either at my city office or at my home. A man followed me from       London Bridge Station, and I have no doubt—Great heaven! what is       that?”        It was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by heavy steps       upon the stair. A moment later, our old friend Lestrade appeared       in the doorway. Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or       two uniformed policemen outside.        “Mr. John Hector McFarlane?” said Lestrade.        Our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face.        “I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of       Lower Norwood.”        McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair, and sank into       his chair once more like one who is crushed.        “One moment, Lestrade,” said Holmes. “Half an hour more or less       can make no difference to you, and the gentleman was about to       give us an account of this very interesting affair, which might       aid us in clearing it up.”        “I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up,” said       Lestrade, grimly.        “None the less, with your permission, I should be much interested       to hear his account.”        “Well, Mr. Holmes, it is difficult for me to refuse you anything,       for you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past,       and we owe you a good turn at Scotland Yard,” said Lestrade. “At       the same time I must remain with my prisoner, and I am bound to       warn him that anything he may say will appear in evidence against       him.”        “I wish nothing better,” said our client. “All I ask is that you       should hear and recognize the absolute truth.”        Lestrade looked at his watch. “I’ll give you half an hour,” said       he.        “I must explain first,” said McFarlane, “that I knew nothing of       Mr. Jonas Oldacre. His name was familiar to me, for many years       ago my parents were acquainted with him, but they drifted apart.       I was very much surprised therefore, when yesterday, about three       o’clock in the afternoon, he walked into my office in the city.       But I was still more astonished when he told me the object of his       visit. He had in his hand several sheets of a notebook, covered       with scribbled writing—here they are—and he laid them on my       table.        “‘Here is my will,’ said he. ‘I want you, Mr. McFarlane, to cast       it into proper legal shape. I will sit here while you do so.’        “I set myself to copy it, and you can imagine my astonishment       when I found that, with some reservations, he had left all his       property to me. He was a strange little ferret-like man, with       white eyelashes, and when I looked up at him I found his keen       grey eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression. I could hardly       believe my own as I read the terms of the will; but he explained       that he was a bachelor with hardly any living relation, that he       had known my parents in his youth, and that he had always heard       of me as a very deserving young man, and was assured that his       money would be in worthy hands. Of course, I could only stammer       out my thanks. The will was duly finished, signed, and witnessed       by my clerk. This is it on the blue paper, and these slips, as I       have explained, are the rough draft. Mr. Jonas Oldacre then       informed me that there were a number of documents—building       leases, title-deeds, mortgages, scrip, and so forth—which it was       necessary that I should see and understand. He said that his mind       would not be easy until the whole thing was settled, and he       begged me to come out to his house at Norwood that night,       bringing the will with me, and to arrange matters. ‘Remember, my       boy, not one word to your parents about the affair until       everything is settled. We will keep it as a little surprise for       them.’ He was very insistent upon this point, and made me promise       it faithfully.        “You can imagine, Mr. Holmes, that I was not in a humour to       refuse him anything that he might ask. He was my benefactor, and       all my desire was to carry out his wishes in every particular. I       sent a telegram home, therefore, to say that I had important       business on hand, and that it was impossible for me to say how       late I might be. Mr. Oldacre had told me that he would like me to       have supper with him at nine, as he might not be home before that       hour. I had some difficulty in finding his house, however, and it       was nearly half-past before I reached it. I found him——”        “One moment!” said Holmes. “Who opened the door?”        “A middle-aged woman, who was, I suppose, his housekeeper.”        “And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?”        “Exactly,” said McFarlane.        “Pray proceed.”        McFarlane wiped his damp brow, and then continued his narrative:        “I was shown by this woman into a sitting-room, where a frugal       supper was laid out. Afterwards, Mr. Jonas Oldacre led me into       his bedroom, in which there stood a heavy safe. This he opened       and took out a mass of documents, which we went over together. It       was between eleven and twelve when we finished. He remarked that       we must not disturb the housekeeper. He showed me out through his       own French window, which had been open all this time.”        “Was the blind down?” asked Holmes.        “I will not be sure, but I believe that it was only half down.       Yes, I remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the       window. I could not find my stick, and he said, ‘Never mind, my       boy, I shall see a good deal of you now, I hope, and I will keep       your stick until you come back to claim it.’ I left him there,       the safe open, and the papers made up in packets upon the table.       It was so late that I could not get back to Blackheath, so I       spent the night at the Anerley Arms, and I knew nothing more       until I read of this horrible affair in the morning.”        “Anything more that you would like to ask, Mr. Holmes?” said       Lestrade, whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this       remarkable explanation.        “Not until I have been to Blackheath.”        “You mean to Norwood,” said Lestrade.        “Oh, yes, no doubt that is what I must have meant,” said Holmes,       with his enigmatical smile. Lestrade had learned by more       experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that brain       could cut through that which was impenetrable to him. I saw him       look curiously at my companion.        “I think I should like to have a word with you presently, Mr.       Sherlock Holmes,” said he. “Now, Mr. McFarlane, two of my       constables are at the door, and there is a four-wheeler waiting.”       The wretched young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance       at us walked from the room. The officers conducted him to the       cab, but Lestrade remained.        Holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of       the will, and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon       his face.        “There are some points about that document, Lestrade, are there       not?” said he, pushing them over.        The official looked at them with a puzzled expression.        “I can read the first few lines and these in the middle of the       second page, and one or two at the end. Those are as clear as       print,” said he, “but the writing in between is very bad, and       there are three places where I cannot read it at all.”        “What do you make of that?” said Holmes.        “Well, what do _you_ make of it?”        “That it was written in a train. The good writing represents       stations, the bad writing movement, and the very bad writing       passing over points. A scientific expert would pronounce at once       that this was drawn up on a suburban line, since nowhere save in       the immediate vicinity of a great city could there be so quick a       succession of points. Granting that his whole journey was       occupied in drawing up the will, then the train was an express,       only stopping once between Norwood and London Bridge.”        Lestrade began to laugh.        “You are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories,       Mr. Holmes,” said he. “How does this bear on the case?”        “Well, it corroborates the young man’s story to the extent that       the will was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday.       It is curious—is it not?—that a man should draw up so important a       document in so haphazard a fashion. It suggests that he did not       think it was going to be of much practical importance. If a man       drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective, he       might do it so.”        “Well, he drew up his own death warrant at the same time,” said       Lestrade.        “Oh, you think so?”        “Don’t you?”        “Well, it is quite possible, but the case is not clear to me       yet.”        “Not clear? Well, if that isn’t clear, what _could_ be clearer?       Here is a young man who learns suddenly that, if a certain older       man dies, he will succeed to a fortune. What does he do? He says       nothing to anyone, but he arranges that he shall go out on some       pretext to see his client that night. He waits until the only       other person in the house is in bed, and then in the solitude of       a man’s room he murders him, burns his body in the wood-pile, and       departs to a neighbouring hotel. The blood-stains in the room and       also on the stick are very slight. It is probable that he       imagined his crime to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the       body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his       death—traces which, for some reason, must have pointed to him. Is       not all this obvious?”        “It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just a trifle too       obvious,” said Holmes. “You do not add imagination to your other       great qualities, but if you could for one moment put yourself in       the place of this young man, would you choose the very night       after the will had been made to commit your crime? Would it not       seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between       the two incidents? Again, would you choose an occasion when you       are known to be in the house, when a servant has let you in? And,       finally, would you take the great pains to conceal the body, and       yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal?       Confess, Lestrade, that all this is very unlikely.”        “As to the stick, Mr. Holmes, you know as well as I do that a       criminal is often flurried, and does such things, which a cool       man would avoid. He was very likely afraid to go back to the       room. Give me another theory that would fit the facts.”        “I could very easily give you half a dozen,” said Holmes. “Here       for example, is a very possible and even probable one. I make you       a free present of it. The older man is showing documents which       are of evident value. A passing tramp sees them through the       window, the blind of which is only half down. Exit the solicitor.       Enter the tramp! He seizes a stick, which he observes there,       kills Oldacre, and departs after burning the body.”        “Why should the tramp burn the body?”        “For the matter of that, why should McFarlane?”        “To hide some evidence.”        “Possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had       been committed.”        “And why did the tramp take nothing?”        “Because they were papers that he could not negotiate.”        Lestrade shook his head, though it seemed to me that his manner       was less absolutely assured than before.        “Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you may look for your tramp, and       while you are finding him we will hold on to our man. The future       will show which is right. Just notice this point, Mr. Holmes:       that so far as we know, none of the papers were removed, and that       the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for       removing them, since he was heir-at-law, and would come into them       in any case.”        My friend seemed struck by this remark.        “I don’t mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very       strongly in favour of your theory,” said he. “I only wish to       point out that there are other theories possible. As you say, the       future will decide. Good-morning! I dare say that in the course       of the day I shall drop in at Norwood and see how you are getting       on.”        When the detective departed, my friend rose and made his       preparations for the day’s work with the alert air of a man who       has a congenial task before him.        “My first movement Watson,” said he, as he bustled into his       frockcoat, “must, as I said, be in the direction of Blackheath.”        “And why not Norwood?”        “Because we have in this case one singular incident coming close       to the heels of another singular incident. The police are making       the mistake of concentrating their attention upon the second,       because it happens to be the one which is actually criminal. But       it is evident to me that the logical way to approach the case is       to begin by trying to throw some light upon the first       incident—the curious will, so suddenly made, and to so unexpected       an heir. It may do something to simplify what followed. No, my       dear fellow, I don’t think you can help me. There is no prospect       of danger, or I should not dream of stirring out without you. I       trust that when I see you in the evening, I will be able to       report that I have been able to do something for this unfortunate       youngster, who has thrown himself upon my protection.”        It was late when my friend returned, and I could see, by a glance       at his haggard and anxious face, that the high hopes with which       he had started had not been fulfilled. For an hour he droned away       upon his violin, endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits.       At last he flung down the instrument, and plunged into a detailed       account of his misadventures.        “It’s all going wrong, Watson—all as wrong as it can go. I kept a       bold face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for       once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong.       All my instincts are one way, and all the facts are the other,       and I much fear that British juries have not yet attained that       pitch of intelligence when they will give the preference to my       theories over Lestrade’s facts.”        “Did you go to Blackheath?”        “Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very quickly that the       late lamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable blackguard. The       father was away in search of his son. The mother was at home—a       little, fluffy, blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and       indignation. Of course, she would not admit even the possibility       of his guilt. But she would not express either surprise or regret       over the fate of Oldacre. On the contrary, she spoke of him with       such bitterness that she was unconsciously considerably       strengthening the case of the police for, of course, if her son       had heard her speak of the man in this fashion, it would       predispose him towards hatred and violence. ‘He was more like a       malignant and cunning ape than a human being,’ said she, ‘and he       always was, ever since he was a young man.’        “‘You knew him at that time?’ said I.        “‘Yes, I knew him well, in fact, he was an old suitor of mine.       Thank heaven that I had the sense to turn away from him and to       marry a better, if poorer, man. I was engaged to him, Mr. Holmes,       when I heard a shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in       an aviary, and I was so horrified at his brutal cruelty that I       would have nothing more to do with him.’ She rummaged in a       bureau, and presently she produced a photograph of a woman,       shamefully defaced and mutilated with a knife. ‘That is my own       photograph,’ she said. ‘He sent it to me in that state, with his       curse, upon my wedding morning.’        “‘Well,’ said I, ‘at least he has forgiven you now, since he has       left all his property to your son.’        “‘Neither my son nor I want anything from Jonas Oldacre, dead or       alive!’ she cried, with a proper spirit. ‘There is a God in       heaven, Mr. Holmes, and that same God who has punished that       wicked man will show, in His own good time, that my son’s hands       are guiltless of his blood.’        “Well, I tried one or two leads, but could get at nothing which       would help our hypothesis, and several points which would make       against it. I gave it up at last and off I went to Norwood.        “This place, Deep Dene House, is a big modern villa of staring       brick, standing back in its own grounds, with a laurel-clumped       lawn in front of it. To the right and some distance back from the       road was the timber-yard which had been the scene of the fire.       Here’s a rough plan on a leaf of my notebook. This window on the       left is the one which opens into Oldacre’s room. You can look       into it from the road, you see. That is about the only bit of       consolation I have had to-day. Lestrade was not there, but his       head constable did the honours. They had just found a great       treasure-trove. They had spent the morning raking among the ashes       of the burned wood-pile, and besides the charred organic remains       they had secured several discoloured metal discs. I examined them       with care, and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons.       I even distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of       ‘Hyams,’ who was Oldacres tailor. I then worked the lawn very       carefully for signs and traces, but this drought has made       everything as hard as iron. Nothing was to be seen save that some       body or bundle had been dragged through a low privet hedge which       is in a line with the wood-pile. All that, of course, fits in       with the official theory. I crawled about the lawn with an August       sun on my back, but I got up at the end of an hour no wiser than       before.        “Well, after this fiasco I went into the bedroom and examined       that also. The blood-stains were very slight, mere smears and       discolourations, but undoubtedly fresh. The stick had been       removed, but there also the marks were slight. There is no doubt       about the stick belonging to our client. He admits it. Footmarks       of both men could be made out on the carpet, but none of any       third person, which again is a trick for the other side. They       were piling up their score all the time and we were at a       standstill.        “Only one little gleam of hope did I get—and yet it amounted to       nothing. I examined the contents of the safe, most of which had       been taken out and left on the table. The papers had been made up       into sealed envelopes, one or two of which had been opened by the       police. They were not, so far as I could judge, of any great       value, nor did the bank-book show that Mr. Oldacre was in such       very affluent circumstances. But it seemed to me that all the       papers were not there. There were allusions to some       deeds—possibly the more valuable—which I could not find. This, of       course, if we could definitely prove it, would turn Lestrade’s       argument against himself, for who would steal a thing if he knew       that he would shortly inherit it?        “Finally, having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent,       I tried my luck with the housekeeper. Mrs. Lexington is her       name—a little, dark, silent person, with suspicious and sidelong       eyes. She could tell us something if she would—I am convinced of       it. But she was as close as wax. Yes, she had let Mr. McFarlane       in at half-past nine. She wished her hand had withered before she       had done so. She had gone to bed at half-past ten. Her room was       at the other end of the house, and she could hear nothing of what       had passed. Mr. McFarlane had left his hat, and to the best of       her belief his stick, in the hall. She had been awakened by the       alarm of fire. Her poor, dear master had certainly been murdered.       Had he any enemies? Well, every man had enemies, but Mr. Oldacre       kept himself very much to himself, and only met people in the way       of business. She had seen the buttons, and was sure that they       belonged to the clothes which he had worn last night. The       wood-pile was very dry, for it had not rained for a month. It       burned like tinder, and by the time she reached the spot, nothing       could be seen but flames. She and all the firemen smelled the       burned flesh from inside it. She knew nothing of the papers, nor       of Mr. Oldacre’s private affairs.        “So, my dear Watson, there’s my report of a failure. And yet—and       yet—” he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction—“I       _know_ it’s all wrong. I feel it in my bones. There is something       that has not come out, and that housekeeper knows it. There was a       sort of sulky defiance in her eyes, which only goes with guilty       knowledge. However, there’s no good talking any more about it,       Watson; but unless some lucky chance comes our way I fear that       the Norwood Disappearance Case will not figure in that chronicle       of our successes which I foresee that a patient public will       sooner or later have to endure.”        “Surely,” said I, “the man’s appearance would go far with any       jury?”        “That is a dangerous argument my dear Watson. You remember that       terrible murderer, Bert Stevens, who wanted us to get him off in       ’87? Was there ever a more mild-mannered, Sunday-school young       man?”        “It is true.”        “Unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory, this       man is lost. You can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now       be presented against him, and all further investigation has       served to strengthen it. By the way, there is one curious little       point about those papers which may serve us as the starting-point       for an inquiry. On looking over the bank-book I found that the       low state of the balance was principally due to large checks       which have been made out during the last year to Mr. Cornelius. I       confess that I should be interested to know who this Mr.       Cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large       transactions. Is it possible that he has had a hand in the       affair? Cornelius might be a broker, but we have found no scrip       to correspond with these large payments. Failing any other       indication, my researches must now take the direction of an       inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these       checks. But I fear, my dear fellow, that our case will end       ingloriously by Lestrade hanging our client, which will certainly       be a triumph for Scotland Yard.”        I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night,       but when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed,       his bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. The       carpet round his chair was littered with cigarette-ends and with       the early editions of the morning papers. An open telegram lay       upon the table.        “What do you think of this, Watson?” he asked, tossing it across.        It was from Norwood, and ran as follows:        Important fresh evidence to hand. McFarlane’s guilt definitely       established. Advise you to abandon case.—LESTRADE.        “This sounds serious,” said I.        “It is Lestrade’s little cock-a-doodle of victory,” Holmes       answered, with a bitter smile. “And yet it may be premature to       abandon the case. After all, important fresh evidence is a       two-edged thing, and may possibly cut in a very different       direction to that which Lestrade imagines. Take your breakfast,       Watson, and we will go out together and see what we can do. I       feel as if I shall need your company and your moral support       today.”        My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his       peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit       himself no food, and I have known him presume upon his iron       strength until he has fainted from pure inanition. “At present I       cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion,” he would say       in answer to my medical remonstrances. I was not surprised,       therefore, when this morning he left his untouched meal behind       him, and started with me for Norwood. A crowd of morbid       sightseers were still gathered round Deep Dene House, which was       just such a suburban villa as I had pictured. Within the gates       Lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his manner       grossly triumphant.        “Well, Mr. Holmes, have you proved us to be wrong yet? Have you       found your tramp?” he cried.        “I have formed no conclusion whatever,” my companion answered.        “But we formed ours yesterday, and now it proves to be correct,       so you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of       you this time, Mr. Holmes.”        “You certainly have the air of something unusual having       occurred,” said Holmes.        Lestrade laughed loudly.        “You don’t like being beaten any more than the rest of us do,”       said he. “A man can’t expect always to have it his own way, can       he, Dr. Watson? Step this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I       think I can convince you once for all that it was John McFarlane       who did this crime.”        He led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond.        “This is where young McFarlane must have come out to get his hat       after the crime was done,” said he. “Now look at this.” With       dramatic suddenness he struck a match, and by its light exposed a       stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall. As he held the match       nearer, I saw that it was more than a stain. It was the       well-marked print of a thumb.        “Look at that with your magnifying glass, Mr. Holmes.”        “Yes, I am doing so.”        “You are aware that no two thumb-marks are alike?”        “I have heard something of the kind.”        “Well, then, will you please compare that print with this wax       impression of young McFarlane’s right thumb, taken by my orders       this morning?”        As he held the waxen print close to the blood-stain, it did not       take a magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from       the same thumb. It was evident to me that our unfortunate client       was lost.        “That is final,” said Lestrade.        “Yes, that is final,” I involuntarily echoed.        “It is final,” said Holmes.        Something in his tone caught my ear, and I turned to look at him.       An extraordinary change had come over his face. It was writhing       with inward merriment. His two eyes were shining like stars. It       seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a       convulsive attack of laughter.        “Dear me! Dear me!” he said at last. “Well, now, who would have       thought it? And how deceptive appearances may be, to be sure!       Such a nice young man to look at! It is a lesson to us not to       trust our own judgment, is it not, Lestrade?”        “Yes, some of us are a little too much inclined to be cock-sure,       Mr. Holmes,” said Lestrade. The man’s insolence was maddening,       but we could not resent it.        “What a providential thing that this young man should press his       right thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg! Such       a very natural action, too, if you come to think of it.” Holmes       was outwardly calm, but his whole body gave a wriggle of       suppressed excitement as he spoke.        “By the way, Lestrade, who made this remarkable discovery?”        “It was the housekeeper, Mrs. Lexington, who drew the night       constable’s attention to it.”        “Where was the night constable?”        “He remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was       committed, so as to see that nothing was touched.”        “But why didn’t the police see this mark yesterday?”        “Well, we had no particular reason to make a careful examination       of the hall. Besides, it’s not in a very prominent place, as you       see.”        “No, no—of course not. I suppose there is no doubt that the mark       was there yesterday?”        Lestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he was going out of       his mind. I confess that I was myself surprised both at his       hilarious manner and at his rather wild observation.        “I don’t know whether you think that McFarlane came out of jail       in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence       against himself,” said Lestrade. “I leave it to any expert in the       world whether that is not the mark of his thumb.”        “It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb.”        “There, that’s enough,” said Lestrade. “I am a practical man, Mr.       Holmes, and when I have got my evidence I come to my conclusions.       If you have anything to say, you will find me writing my report       in the sitting-room.”        Holmes had recovered his equanimity, though I still seemed to       detect gleams of amusement in his expression.        “Dear me, this is a very sad development, Watson, is it not?”       said he. “And yet there are singular points about it which hold       out some hopes for our client.”        “I am delighted to hear it,” said I, heartily. “I was afraid it       was all up with him.”        “I would hardly go so far as to say that, my dear Watson. The       fact is that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to       which our friend attaches so much importance.”        “Indeed, Holmes! What is it?”        “Only this: that I _know_ that that mark was not there when I       examined the hall yesterday. And now, Watson, let us have a       little stroll round in the sunshine.”        With a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of       hope was returning, I accompanied my friend in a walk round the       garden. Holmes took each face of the house in turn, and examined       it with great interest. He then led the way inside, and went over       the whole building from basement to attic. Most of the rooms were       unfurnished, but none the less Holmes inspected them all       minutely. Finally, on the top corridor, which ran outside three       untenanted bedrooms, he again was seized with a spasm of       merriment.        “There are really some very unique features about this case,       Watson,” said he. “I think it is time now that we took our friend       Lestrade into our confidence. He has had his little smile at our       expense, and perhaps we may do as much by him, if my reading of       this problem proves to be correct. Yes, yes, I think I see how we       should approach it.”        The Scotland Yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when       Holmes interrupted him.        “I understood that you were writing a report of this case,” said       he.        “So I am.”        “Don’t you think it may be a little premature? I can’t help       thinking that your evidence is not complete.”        Lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words. He laid       down his pen and looked curiously at him.        “What do you mean, Mr. Holmes?”        “Only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen.”        “Can you produce him?”        “I think I can.”        “Then do so.”        “I will do my best. How many constables have you?”        “There are three within call.”        “Excellent!” said Holmes. “May I ask if they are all large,       able-bodied men with powerful voices?”        “I have no doubt they are, though I fail to see what their voices       have to do with it.”        “Perhaps I can help you to see that and one or two other things       as well,” said Holmes. “Kindly summon your men, and I will try.”        Five minutes later, three policemen had assembled in the hall.        “In the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw,”       said Holmes. “I will ask you to carry in two bundles of it. I       think it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the       witness whom I require. Thank you very much. I believe you have       some matches in your pocket Watson. Now, Mr. Lestrade, I will ask       you all to accompany me to the top landing.”        As I have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran       outside three empty bedrooms. At one end of the corridor we were       all marshalled by Sherlock Holmes, the constables grinning and       Lestrade staring at my friend with amazement, expectation, and       derision chasing each other across his features. Holmes stood       before us with the air of a conjurer who is performing a trick.        “Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of       water? Put the straw on the floor here, free from the wall on       either side. Now I think that we are all ready.”        Lestrade’s face had begun to grow red and angry. “I don’t know       whether you are playing a game with us, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”       said he. “If you know anything, you can surely say it without all       this tomfoolery.”        “I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an excellent reason       for everything that I do. You may possibly remember that you       chaffed me a little, some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your       side of the hedge, so you must not grudge me a little pomp and       ceremony now. Might I ask you, Watson, to open that window, and       then to put a match to the edge of the straw?”        I did so, and driven by the draught a coil of grey smoke swirled       down the corridor, while the dry straw crackled and flamed.        “Now we must see if we can find this witness for you, Lestrade.       Might I ask you all to join in the cry of ‘Fire!’? Now then; one,       two, three——”        “Fire!” we all yelled.        “Thank you. I will trouble you once again.”        “Fire!”        “Just once more, gentlemen, and all together.”        “Fire!” The shout must have rung over Norwood.        It had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened. A door       suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the       end of the corridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of it,       like a rabbit out of its burrow.        “Capital!” said Holmes, calmly. “Watson, a bucket of water over       the straw. That will do! Lestrade, allow me to present you with       your principal missing witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre.”        The detective stared at the newcomer with blank amazement. The       l
