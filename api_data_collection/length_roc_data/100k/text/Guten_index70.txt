WHAT IS MAN?  I  a. Man the Machine. b. Personal Merit  [The Old Man and the Young Man had been conversing. The Old Man had asserted that the human being is merely a machine, and nothing more. The Young Man objected, and asked him to go into particulars and furnish his reasons for his position.]  Old Man. What are the materials of which a steam-engine is made?  Young Man. Iron, steel, brass, white-metal, and so on.  O.M. Where are these found?  Y.M. In the rocks.  O.M. In a pure state?  Y.M. No—in ores.  O.M. Are the metals suddenly deposited in the ores?  Y.M. No—it is the patient work of countless ages.  O.M. You could make the engine out of the rocks themselves?  Y.M. Yes, a brittle one and not valuable.  O.M. You would not require much, of such an engine as that?  Y.M. No—substantially nothing.  O.M. To make a fine and capable engine, how would you proceed?  Y.M. Drive tunnels and shafts into the hills; blast out the iron ore; crush it, smelt it, reduce it to pig-iron; put some of it through the Bessemer process and make steel of it. Mine and treat and combine several metals of which brass is made.  O.M. Then?  Y.M. Out of the perfected result, build the fine engine.  O.M. You would require much of this one?  Y.M. Oh, indeed yes.  O.M. It could drive lathes, drills, planers, punches, polishers, in a word all the cunning machines of a great factory?  Y.M. It could.  O.M. What could the stone engine do?  Y.M. Drive a sewing-machine, possibly—nothing more, perhaps.  O.M. Men would admire the other engine and rapturously praise it?  Y.M. Yes.  O.M. But not the stone one?  Y.M. No.  O.M. The merits of the metal machine would be far above those of the stone one?  Y.M. Of course.  O.M. Personal merits?  Y.M. _Personal_ merits? How do you mean?  O.M. It would be personally entitled to the credit of its own performance?  Y.M. The engine? Certainly not.  O.M. Why not?  Y.M. Because its performance is not personal. It is the result of the law of construction. It is not a _merit_ that it does the things which it is set to do—it can’t _help_ doing them.  O.M. And it is not a personal demerit in the stone machine that it does so little?  Y.M. Certainly not. It does no more and no less than the law of its make permits and compels it to do. There is nothing _personal_ about it; it cannot choose. In this process of “working up to the matter” is it your idea to work up to the proposition that man and a machine are about the same thing, and that there is no personal merit in the performance of either?  O.M. Yes—but do not be offended; I am meaning no offense. What makes the grand difference between the stone engine and the steel one? Shall we call it training, education? Shall we call the stone engine a savage and the steel one a civilized man? The original rock contained the stuff of which the steel one was built—but along with a lot of sulphur and stone and other obstructing inborn heredities, brought down from the old geologic ages—prejudices, let us call them. Prejudices which nothing within the rock itself had either _power_ to remove or any _desire_ to remove. Will you take note of that phrase?  Y.M. Yes. I have written it down; “Prejudices which nothing within the rock itself had either power to remove or any desire to remove.” Go on.  O.M. Prejudices must be removed by _outside influences_ or not at all. Put that down.  Y.M. Very well; “Must be removed by outside influences or not at all.” Go on.  O.M. The iron’s prejudice against ridding itself of the cumbering rock. To make it more exact, the iron’s absolute _indifference_ as to whether the rock be removed or not. Then comes the _outside influence_ and grinds the rock to powder and sets the ore free. The _iron_ in the ore is still captive. An _outside influence_ smelts it free of the clogging ore. The iron is emancipated iron, now, but indifferent to further progress. An _outside influence_ beguiles it into the Bessemer furnace and refines it into steel of the first quality. It is educated, now—its training is complete. And it has reached its limit. By no possible process can it be educated into _gold_. Will you set that down?  Y.M. Yes. “Everything has its limit—iron ore cannot be educated into gold.”  O.M. There are gold men, and tin men, and copper men, and leaden men, and steel men, and so on—and each has the limitations of his nature, his heredities, his training, and his environment. You can build engines out of each of these metals, and they will all perform, but you must not require the weak ones to do equal work with the strong ones. In each case, to get the best results, you must free the metal from its obstructing prejudicial ones by education—smelting, refining, and so forth.  Y.M. You have arrived at man, now?  O.M. Yes. Man the machine—man the impersonal engine. Whatsoever a man is, is due to his _make_, and to the _influences_ brought to bear upon it by his heredities, his habitat, his associations. He is moved, directed, _commanded_, by _exterior_ influences—_solely_. He _originates_ nothing, not even a thought.  Y.M. Oh, come! Where did I get my opinion that this which you are talking is all foolishness?  O.M. It is a quite natural opinion—indeed an inevitable opinion—but _you _did not create the materials out of which it is formed. They are odds and ends of thoughts, impressions, feelings, gathered unconsciously from a thousand books, a thousand conversations, and from streams of thought and feeling which have flowed down into your heart and brain out of the hearts and brains of centuries of ancestors. _Personally_ you did not create even the smallest microscopic fragment of the materials out of which your opinion is made; and personally you cannot claim even the slender merit of _putting the borrowed materials together_. That was done _automatically_—by your mental machinery, in strict accordance with the law of that machinery’s construction. And you not only did not make that machinery yourself, but you have _not even any command over it_.  Y.M. This is too much. You think I could have formed no opinion but that one?  O.M. Spontaneously? No. And _you did not form that one_; your machinery did it for you—automatically and instantly, without reflection or the need of it.  Y.M. Suppose I had reflected? How then?  O.M. Suppose you try?  Y.M. (_After a quarter of an hour_.) I have reflected.  O.M. You mean you have tried to change your opinion—as an experiment?  Y.M. Yes.  O.M. With success?  Y.M. No. It remains the same; it is impossible to change it.  O.M. I am sorry, but you see, yourself, that your mind is merely a machine, nothing more. You have no command over it, it has no command over itself—it is worked _solely from the outside_. That is the law of its make; it is the law of all machines.  Y.M. Can’t I _ever_ change one of these automatic opinions?  O.M. No. You can’t yourself, but _exterior influences_ can do it.  Y.M. And exterior ones _only_?  O.M. Yes—exterior ones only.  Y.M. That position is untenable—I may say ludicrously untenable.  O.M. What makes you think so?  Y.M. I don’t merely think it, I know it. Suppose I resolve to enter upon a course of thought, and study, and reading, with the deliberate purpose of changing that opinion; and suppose I succeed. _That _is not the work of an exterior impulse, the whole of it is mine and personal; for I originated the project.  O.M. Not a shred of it. _It grew out of this talk with me_. But for that it would not have occurred to you. No man ever originates anything. All his thoughts, all his impulses, come _from the outside_.  Y.M. It’s an exasperating subject. The _first_ man had original thoughts, anyway; there was nobody to draw from.  O.M. It is a mistake. Adam’s thoughts came to him from the outside. _You_ have a fear of death. You did not invent that—you got it from outside, from talking and teaching. Adam had no fear of death—none in the world.  Y.M. Yes, he had.  O.M. When he was created?  Y.M. No.  O.M. When, then?  Y.M. When he was threatened with it.  O.M. Then it came from _outside_. Adam is quite big enough; let us not try to make a god of him. _None but gods have ever had a thought which did not come from the outside_. Adam probably had a good head, but it was of no sort of use to him until it was filled up _from the outside_. He was not able to invent the triflingest little thing with it. He had not a shadow of a notion of the difference between good and evil—he had to get the idea _from the outside_. Neither he nor Eve was able to originate the idea that it was immodest to go naked; the knowledge came in with the apple _from the outside_. A man’s brain is so constructed that _it can originate nothing whatsoever_. It can only use material obtained _outside_. It is merely a machine; and it works automatically, not by will-power. _It has no command over itself, its owner has no command over it_.  Y.M. Well, never mind Adam: but certainly Shakespeare’s creations—  O.M. No, you mean Shakespeare’s _imitations_. Shakespeare created nothing. He correctly observed, and he marvelously painted. He exactly portrayed people whom _God_ had created; but he created none himself. Let us spare him the slander of charging him with trying. Shakespeare could not create. _He was a machine, and machines do not create_.  Y.M. Where _was_ his excellence, then?  O.M. In this. He was not a sewing-machine, like you and me; he was a Gobelin loom. The threads and the colors came into him _from the outside_; outside influences, suggestions, _experiences_ (reading, seeing plays, playing plays, borrowing ideas, and so on), framed the patterns in his mind and started up his complex and admirable machinery, and _it automatically_ turned out that pictured and gorgeous fabric which still compels the astonishment of the world. If Shakespeare had been born and bred on a barren and unvisited rock in the ocean his mighty intellect would have had no _outside material_ to work with, and could have invented none; and _no outside influences_, teachings, moldings, persuasions, inspirations, of a valuable sort, and could have invented none; and so Shakespeare would have produced nothing. In Turkey he would have produced something—something up to the highest limit of Turkish influences, associations, and training. In France he would have produced something better—something up to the highest limit of the French influences and training. In England he rose to the highest limit attainable through the _outside helps afforded by that land’s ideals, influences, and training_. You and I are but sewing-machines. We must turn out what we can; we must do our endeavor and care nothing at all when the unthinking reproach us for not turning out Gobelins.  Y.M. And so we are mere machines! And machines may not boast, nor feel proud of their performance, nor claim personal merit for it, nor applause and praise. It is an infamous doctrine.  O.M. It isn’t a doctrine, it is merely a fact.  Y.M. I suppose, then, there is no more merit in being brave than in being a coward?  O.M. _Personal_ merit? No. A brave man does not _create_ his bravery. He is entitled to no personal credit for possessing it. It is born to him. A baby born with a billion dollars—where is the personal merit in that? A baby born with nothing—where is the personal demerit in that? The one is fawned upon, admired, worshiped, by sycophants, the other is neglected and despised—where is the sense in it?  Y.M. Sometimes a timid man sets himself the task of conquering his cowardice and becoming brave—and succeeds. What do you say to that?  O.M. That it shows the value of _training in right directions over training in wrong ones_. Inestimably valuable is training, influence, education, in right directions—_training one’s self-approbation to elevate its ideals_.  Y.M. But as to merit—the personal merit of the victorious coward’s project and achievement?  O.M. There isn’t any. In the world’s view he is a worthier man than he was before, but _he_ didn’t achieve the change—the merit of it is not his.  Y.M. Whose, then?  O.M. His _make_, and the influences which wrought upon it from the outside.  Y.M. His make?  O.M. To start with, he was _not_ utterly and completely a coward, or the influences would have had nothing to work upon. He was not afraid of a cow, though perhaps of a bull: not afraid of a woman, but afraid of a man. There was something to build upon. There was a _seed_. No seed, no plant. Did he make that seed himself, or was it born in him? It was no merit of _his_ that the seed was there.  Y.M. Well, anyway, the idea of _cultivating_ it, the resolution to cultivate it, was meritorious, and he originated that.  O.M. He did nothing of the kind. It came whence _all_ impulses, good or bad, come—from _outside_. If that timid man had lived all his life in a community of human rabbits, had never read of brave deeds, had never heard speak of them, had never heard any one praise them nor express envy of the heroes that had done them, he would have had no more idea of bravery than Adam had of modesty, and it could never by any possibility have occurred to him to _resolve_ to become brave. He _could not originate the idea_—it had to come to him from the _outside_. And so, when he heard bravery extolled and cowardice derided, it woke him up. He was ashamed. Perhaps his sweetheart turned up her nose and said, “I am told that you are a coward!” It was not _he_ that turned over the new leaf—she did it for him. _He_ must not strut around in the merit of it —it is not his.  Y.M. But, anyway, he reared the plant after she watered the seed.  O.M. No. _Outside influences_ reared it. At the command—and trembling—he marched out into the field—with other soldiers and in the daytime, not alone and in the dark. He had the _influence of example_, he drew courage from his comrades’ courage; he was afraid, and wanted to run, but he did not dare; he was _afraid_ to run, with all those soldiers looking on. He was progressing, you see—the moral fear of shame had risen superior to the physical fear of harm. By the end of the campaign experience will have taught him that not _all_ who go into battle get hurt—an outside influence which will be helpful to him; and he will also have learned how sweet it is to be praised for courage and be huzza’d at with tear-choked voices as the war-worn regiment marches past the worshiping multitude with flags flying and the drums beating. After that he will be as securely brave as any veteran in the army—and there will not be a shade nor suggestion of _personal merit_ in it anywhere; it will all have come from the _outside_. The Victoria Cross breeds more heroes than—  Y.M. Hang it, where is the sense in his becoming brave if he is to get no credit for it?  O.M. Your question will answer itself presently. It involves an important detail of man’s make which we have not yet touched upon.  Y.M. What detail is that?  O.M. The impulse which moves a person to do things—the only impulse that ever moves a person to do a thing.  Y.M. The _only_ one! Is there but one?  O.M. That is all. There is only one.  Y.M. Well, certainly that is a strange enough doctrine. What is the sole impulse that ever moves a person to do a thing?  O.M. The impulse to _content his own spirit_—the _necessity_ of contenting his own spirit and _winning its approval_.  Y.M. Oh, come, that won’t do!  O.M. Why won’t it?  Y.M. Because it puts him in the attitude of always looking out for his own comfort and advantage; whereas an unselfish man often does a thing solely for another person’s good when it is a positive disadvantage to himself.  O.M. It is a mistake. The act must do _him_ good, _first_; otherwise he will not do it. He may _think_ he is doing it solely for the other person’s sake, but it is not so; he is contenting his own spirit first—the other’s person’s benefit has to always take _second_ place.  Y.M. What a fantastic idea! What becomes of self—sacrifice? Please answer me that.  O.M. What is self-sacrifice?  Y.M. The doing good to another person where no shadow nor suggestion of benefit to one’s self can result from it.  II  Man’s Sole Impulse—the Securing of His Own Approval  Old Man. There have been instances of it—you think?  Young Man. _Instances_? Millions of them!  O.M. You have not jumped to conclusions? You have examined them—critically?  Y.M. They don’t need it: the acts themselves reveal the golden impulse back of them.  O.M. For instance?  Y.M. Well, then, for instance. Take the case in the book here. The man lives three miles up-town. It is bitter cold, snowing hard, midnight. He is about to enter the horse-car when a gray and ragged old woman, a touching picture of misery, puts out her lean hand and begs for rescue from hunger and death. The man finds that he has a quarter in his pocket, but he does not hesitate: he gives it her and trudges home through the storm. There—it is noble, it is beautiful; its grace is marred by no fleck or blemish or suggestion of self-interest.  O.M. What makes you think that?  Y.M. Pray what else could I think? Do you imagine that there is some other way of looking at it?  O.M. Can you put yourself in the man’s place and tell me what he felt and what he thought?  Y.M. Easily. The sight of that suffering old face pierced his generous heart with a sharp pain. He could not bear it. He could endure the three-mile walk in the storm, but he could not endure the tortures his conscience would suffer if he turned his back and left that poor old creature to perish. He would not have been able to sleep, for thinking of it.  O.M. What was his state of mind on his way home?  Y.M. It was a state of joy which only the self-sacrificer knows. His heart sang, he was unconscious of the storm.  O.M. He felt well?  Y.M. One cannot doubt it.  O.M. Very well. Now let us add up the details and see how much he got for his twenty-five cents. Let us try to find out the _real_ why of his making the investment. In the first place _he_ couldn’t bear the pain which the old suffering face gave him. So he was thinking of _his_ pain—this good man. He must buy a salve for it. If he did not succor the old woman _his_ conscience would torture him all the way home. Thinking of _his_ pain again. He must buy relief for that. If he didn’t relieve the old woman _he_ would not get any sleep. He must buy some sleep—still thinking of _himself_, you see. Thus, to sum up, he bought himself free of a sharp pain in his heart, he bought himself free of the tortures of a waiting conscience, he bought a whole night’s sleep—all for twenty-five cents! It should make Wall Street ashamed of itself. On his way home his heart was joyful, and it sang—profit on top of profit! The impulse which moved the man to succor the old woman was—_first_—to _content his own spirit_; secondly to relieve _her_ sufferings. Is it your opinion that men’s acts proceed from one central and unchanging and inalterable impulse, or from a variety of impulses?  Y.M. From a variety, of course—some high and fine and noble, others not. What is your opinion?  O.M. Then there is but _one_ law, one source.  Y.M. That both the noblest impulses and the basest proceed from that one source?  O.M. Yes.  Y.M. Will you put that law into words?  O.M. Yes. This is the law, keep it in your mind. _From his cradle to his grave a man never does a single thing which has any_ FIRST AND FOREMOST _object_ _but one_—_to secure peace of mind, spiritual comfort_, _for_ HIMSELF.  Y.M. Come! He never does anything for any one else’s comfort, spiritual or physical?  O.M. No. _except on those distinct terms_—that it shall _first_ secure _his own_ spiritual comfort. Otherwise he will not do it.  Y.M. It will be easy to expose the falsity of that proposition.  O.M. For instance?  Y.M. Take that noble passion, love of country, patriotism. A man who loves peace and dreads pain, leaves his pleasant home and his weeping family and marches out to manfully expose himself to hunger, cold, wounds, and death. Is that seeking spiritual comfort?  O.M. He loves peace and dreads pain?  Y.M. Yes.  O.M. Then perhaps there is something that he loves _more_ than he loves peace—_the approval of his neighbors and the public_. And perhaps there is something which he dreads more than he dreads pain—the _disapproval_ of his neighbors and the public. If he is sensitive to shame he will go to the field—not because his spirit will be _entirely_ comfortable there, but because it will be more comfortable there than it would be if he remained at home. He will always do the thing which will bring him the _most_ mental comfort—for that is _the sole law of his life_. He leaves the weeping family behind; he is sorry to make them uncomfortable, but not sorry enough to sacrifice his _own_ comfort to secure theirs.  Y.M. Do you really believe that mere public opinion could force a timid and peaceful man to—  O.M. Go to war? Yes—public opinion can force some men to do _anything_.  Y.M. _Anything_?  O.M. Yes—anything.  Y.M. I don’t believe that. Can it force a right-principled man to do a wrong thing?  O.M. Yes.  Y.M. Can it force a kind man to do a cruel thing?  O.M. Yes.  Y.M. Give an instance.  O.M. Alexander Hamilton was a conspicuously high-principled man. He regarded dueling as wrong, and as opposed to the teachings of religion—but in deference to _public opinion_ he fought a duel. He deeply loved his family, but to buy public approval he treacherously deserted them and threw his life away, ungenerously leaving them to lifelong sorrow in order that he might stand well with a foolish world. In the then condition of the public standards of honor he could not have been comfortable with the stigma upon him of having refused to fight. The teachings of religion, his devotion to his family, his kindness of heart, his high principles, all went for nothing when they stood in the way of his spiritual comfort. A man will do _anything_, no matter what it is, _to secure his spiritual comfort_; and he can neither be forced nor persuaded to any act which has not that goal for its object. Hamilton’s act was compelled by the inborn necessity of contenting his own spirit; in this it was like all the other acts of his life, and like all the acts of all men’s lives. Do you see where the kernel of the matter lies? A man cannot be comfortable without _his own_ approval. He will secure the largest share possible of that, at all costs, all sacrifices.  Y.M. A minute ago you said Hamilton fought that duel to get _public_ approval.  O.M. I did. By refusing to fight the duel he would have secured his family’s approval and a large share of his own; but the public approval was more valuable in his eyes than all other approvals put together—in the earth or above it; to secure that would furnish him the _most_ comfort of mind, the most _self_—approval; so he sacrificed all other values to get it.  Y.M. Some noble souls have refused to fight duels, and have manfully braved the public contempt.  O.M. They acted _according to their make_. They valued their principles and the approval of their families _above_ the public approval. They took the thing they valued _most_ and let the rest go. They took what would give them the _largest_ share of _personal contentment and approval_—a man _always_ does. Public opinion cannot force that kind of men to go to the wars. When they go it is for other reasons. Other spirit-contenting reasons.  Y.M. Always spirit-contenting reasons?  O.M. There are no others.  Y.M. When a man sacrifices his life to save a little child from a burning building, what do you call that?  O.M. When he does it, it is the law of _his_ make. _He_ can’t bear to see the child in that peril (a man of a different make _could_), and so he tries to save the child, and loses his life. But he has got what he was after—_his own approval_.  Y.M. What do you call Love, Hate, Charity, Revenge, Humanity, Magnanimity, Forgiveness?  O.M. Different results of the one Master Impulse: the necessity of securing one’s self approval. They wear diverse clothes and are subject to diverse moods, but in whatsoever ways they masquerade they are the _same person_ all the time. To change the figure, the _compulsion_ that moves a man—and there is but the one—is the necessity of securing the contentment of his own spirit. When it stops, the man is dead.  Y.M. That is foolishness. Love—  O.M. Why, love is that impulse, that law, in its most uncompromising form. It will squander life and everything else on its object. Not _primarily_ for the object’s sake, but for _its own_. When its object is happy _it_ is happy—and that is what it is unconsciously after.  Y.M. You do not even except the lofty and gracious passion of mother-love?  O.M. No, _it _is the absolute slave of that law. The mother will go naked to clothe her child; she will starve that it may have food; suffer torture to save it from pain; die that it may live. She takes a living _pleasure_ in making these sacrifices. _She does it for that reward_—that self-approval, that contentment, that peace, that comfort. _She would do it for your child_ IF SHE COULD GET THE SAME PAY.  Y.M. This is an infernal philosophy of yours.  O.M. It isn’t a philosophy, it is a fact.  Y.M. Of course you must admit that there are some acts which—  O.M. No. There is _no_ act, large or small, fine or mean, which springs from any motive but the one—the necessity of appeasing and contenting one’s own spirit.  Y.M. The world’s philanthropists—  O.M. I honor them, I uncover my head to them—from habit and training; and _they_ could not know comfort or happiness or self-approval if they did not work and spend for the unfortunate. It makes _them_ happy to see others happy; and so with money and labor they buy what they are after—_happiness, self-approval_. Why don’t miners do the same thing? Because they can get a thousandfold more happiness by _not_ doing it. There is no other reason. They follow the law of their make.  Y.M. What do you say of duty for duty’s sake?  O.M. That _it does not exist_. Duties are not performed for duty’s _sake_, but because their _neglect_ would make the man _uncomfortable_. A man performs but _one_ duty—the duty of contenting his spirit, the duty of making himself agreeable to himself. If he can most satisfyingly perform this sole and only duty by _helping_ his neighbor, he will do it; if he can most satisfyingly perform it by _swindling_ his neighbor, he will do it. But he always looks out for Number One—_first_; the effects upon others are a _secondary_ matter. Men pretend to self-sacrifices, but this is a thing which, in the ordinary value of the phrase, _does not exist and has not existed_. A man often honestly _thinks_ he is sacrificing himself merely and solely for some one else, but he is deceived; his bottom impulse is to content a requirement of his nature and training, and thus acquire peace for his soul.  Y.M. Apparently, then, all men, both good and bad ones, devote their lives to contenting their consciences.  O.M. Yes. That is a good enough name for it: Conscience—that independent Sovereign, that insolent absolute Monarch inside of a man who is the man’s Master. There are all kinds of consciences, because there are all kinds of men. You satisfy an assassin’s conscience in one way, a philanthropist’s in another, a miser’s in another, a burglar’s in still another. As a _guide_ or _incentive_ to any authoritatively prescribed line of morals or conduct (leaving _training_ out of the account), a man’s conscience is totally valueless. I know a kind-hearted Kentuckian whose self-approval was lacking—whose conscience was troubling him, to phrase it with exactness—_because he had neglected to kill a certain man_—a man whom he had never seen. The stranger had killed this man’s friend in a fight, this man’s Kentucky training made it a duty to kill the stranger for it. He neglected his duty—kept dodging it, shirking it, putting it off, and his unrelenting conscience kept persecuting him for this conduct. At last, to get ease of mind, comfort, self-approval, he hunted up the stranger and took his life. It was an immense act of _self-sacrifice_ (as per the usual definition), for he did not want to do it, and he never would have done it if he could have bought a contented spirit and an unworried mind at smaller cost. But we are so made that we will pay _anything_ for that contentment—even another man’s life.  Y.M. You spoke a moment ago of _trained_ consciences. You mean that we are not _born_ with consciences competent to guide us aright?  O.M. If we were, children and savages would know right from wrong, and not have to be taught it.  Y.M. But consciences can be _trained_?  O.M. Yes.  Y.M. Of course by parents, teachers, the pulpit, and books.  O.M. Yes—they do their share; they do what they can.  Y.M. And the rest is done by—  O.M. Oh, a million unnoticed influences—for good or bad: influences which work without rest during every waking moment of a man’s life, from cradle to grave.  Y.M. You have tabulated these?  O.M. Many of them—yes.  Y.M. Will you read me the result?  O.M. Another time, yes. It would take an hour.  Y.M. A conscience can be trained to shun evil and prefer good?  O.M. Yes.  Y.M. But will it for spirit-contenting reasons only?  O.M. It _can’t_ be trained to do a thing for any _other_ reason. The thing is impossible.  Y.M. There _must_ be a genuinely and utterly self-sacrificing act recorded in human history somewhere.  O.M. You are young. You have many years before you. Search one out.  Y.M. It does seem to me that when a man sees a fellow-being struggling in the water and jumps in at the risk of his life to save him—  O.M. Wait. Describe the _man_. Describe the _fellow-being_. State if there is an _audience_ present; or if they are _alone_.  Y.M. What have these things to do with the splendid act?  O.M. Very much. Shall we suppose, as a beginning, that the two are alone, in a solitary place, at midnight?  Y.M. If you choose.  O.M. And that the fellow-being is the man’s daughter?  Y.M. Well, n-no—make it someone else.  O.M. A filthy, drunken ruffian, then?  Y.M. I see. Circumstances alter cases. I suppose that if there was no audience to observe the act, the man wouldn’t perform it.  O.M. But there is here and there a man who _would_. People, for instance, like the man who lost his life trying to save the child from the fire; and the man who gave the needy old woman his twenty-five cents and walked home in the storm—there are here and there men like that who would do it. And why? Because they couldn’t _bear_ to see a fellow-being struggling in the water and not jump in and help. It would give _them_ pain. They would save the fellow-being on that account. _They wouldn’t do it otherwise_. They strictly obey the law which I have been insisting upon. You must remember and always distinguish the people who _can’t bear_ things from people who _can_. It will throw light upon a number of apparently “self-sacrificing” cases.  Y.M. Oh, dear, it’s all so disgusting.  O.M. Yes. And so true.  Y.M. Come—take the good boy who does things he doesn’t want to do, in order to gratify his mother.  O.M. He does seven-tenths of the act because it gratifies _him_ to gratify his mother. Throw the bulk of advantage the other way and the good boy would not do the act. He _must_ obey the iron law. None can escape it.  Y.M. Well, take the case of a bad boy who—  O.M. You needn’t mention it, it is a waste of time. It is no matter about the bad boy’s act. Whatever it was, he had a spirit-contenting reason for it. Otherwise you have been misinformed, and he didn’t do it.  Y.M. It is very exasperating. A while ago you said that man’s conscience is not a born judge of morals and conduct, but has to be taught and trained. Now I think a conscience can get drowsy and lazy, but I don’t think it can go wrong; if you wake it up—  _A Little Story_  O.M. I will tell you a little story:  Once upon a time an Infidel was guest in the house of a Christian widow whose little boy was ill and near to death. The Infidel often watched by the bedside and entertained the boy with talk, and he used these opportunities to satisfy a strong longing in his nature—that desire which is in us all to better other people’s condition by having them think as we think. He was successful. But the dying boy, in his last moments, reproached him and said:  “_I believed, and was happy in it; you have taken my belief away, and my comfort. Now I have nothing left, and I die miserable; for the things which you have told me do not take the place of that which I have lost_.”  And the mother, also, reproached the Infidel, and said:  “_My child is forever lost, and my heart is broken. How could you do this cruel thing? We have done you no harm, but only kindness; we made our house your home, you were welcome to all we had, and this is our reward.”_  The heart of the Infidel was filled with remorse for what he had done, and he said:  “_It was wrong—I see it now; but I was only trying to do him good. In my view he was in error; it seemed my duty to teach him the truth_.”  Then the mother said:  “_I had taught him, all his little life, what I believed to be the truth, and in his believing faith both of us were happy. Now he is dead,—and lost; and I am miserable. Our faith came down to us through centuries of believing ancestors; what right had you, or any one, to disturb it? Where was your honor, where was your shame_?”  Y.M. He was a miscreant, and deserved death!  O.M. He thought so himself, and said so.  Y.M. Ah—you see, _his conscience was awakened_!  O.M. Yes, his Self-Disapproval was. It _pained_ him to see the mother suffer. He was sorry he had done a thing which brought _him_ pain. It did not occur to him to think of the mother when he was misteaching the boy, for he was absorbed in providing _pleasure_ for himself, then. Providing it by satisfying what he believed to be a call of duty.  Y.M. Call it what you please, it is to me a case of _awakened conscience_. That awakened conscience could never get itself into that species of trouble again. A cure like that is a _permanent_ cure.  O.M. Pardon—I had not finished the story. We are creatures of _outside influences_—we originate _nothing_ within. Whenever we take a new line of thought and drift into a new line of belief and action, the impulse is _always_ suggested from the _outside_. Remorse so preyed upon the Infidel that it dissolved his harshness toward the boy’s religion and made him come to regard it with tolerance, next with kindness, for the boy’s sake and the mother’s. Finally he found himself examining it. From that moment his progress in his new trend was steady and rapid. He became a believing Christian. And now his remorse for having robbed the dying boy of his faith and his salvation was bitterer than ever. It gave him no rest, no peace. He _must_ have rest and peace—it is the law of nature. There seemed but one way to get it; he must devote himself to saving imperiled souls. He became a missionary. He landed in a pagan country ill and helpless. A native widow took him into her humble home and nursed him back to convalescence. Then her young boy was taken hopelessly ill, and the grateful missionary helped her tend him. Here was his first opportunity to repair a part of the wrong done to the other boy by doing a precious service for this one by undermining his foolish faith in his false gods. He was successful. But the dying boy in his last moments reproached him and said:  “_I believed, and was happy in it; you have taken my belief away, and my comfort. Now I have nothing left, and I die miserable; for the things which you have told me do not take the place of that which I have lost_.”  And the mother, also, reproached the missionary, and said:  “_My child is forever lost, and my heart is broken. How could you do this cruel thing? We had done you no harm, but only kindness; we made our house your home, you were welcome to all we had, and this is our reward_.”  The heart of the missionary was filled with remorse for what he had done, and he said:  “_It was wrong—I see it now; but I was only trying to do him good. In my view he was in error; it seemed my duty to teach him the truth_.”  Then the mother said:  “_I had taught him, all his little life, what I believed to be the truth, and in his believing faith both of us were happy. Now he is dead—and lost; and I am miserable. Our faith came down to us through centuries of believing ancestors; what right had you, or any one, to disturb it? Where was your honor, where was your shame_?”  The missionary’s anguish of remorse and sense of treachery were as bitter and persecuting and unappeasable, now, as they had been in the former case. The story is finished. What is your comment?  Y.M. The man’s conscience is a fool! It was morbid. It didn’t know right from wrong.  O.M. I am not sorry to hear you say that. If you grant that _one_ man’s conscience doesn’t know right from wrong, it is an admission that there are others like it. This single admission pulls down the whole doctrine of infallibility of judgment in consciences. Meantime there is one thing which I ask you to notice.  Y.M. What is that?  O.M. That in both cases the man’s _act_ gave him no spiritual discomfort, and that he was quite satisfied with it and got pleasure out of it. But afterward when it resulted in _pain_ to _him_, he was sorry. Sorry it had inflicted pain upon the others, _but for no reason under the sun except that their pain gave him pain_. Our consciences take _no_ notice of pain inflicted upon others until it reaches a point where it gives pain to _us_. In _all_ cases without exception we are absolutely indifferent to another person’s pain until his sufferings make us uncomfortable. Many an infidel would not have been troubled by that Christian mother’s distress. Don’t you believe that?  Y.M. Yes. You might almost say it of the _average_ infidel, I think.  O.M. And many a missionary, sternly fortified by his sense of duty, would not have been troubled by the pagan mother’s distress—Jesuit missionaries in Canada in the early French times, for instance; see episodes quoted by Parkman.  Y.M. Well, let us adjourn. Where have we arrived?  O.M. At this. That we (mankind) have ticketed ourselves with a number of qualities to which we have given misleading names. Love, Hate, Charity, Compassion, Avarice, Benevolence, and so on. I mean we attach misleading _meanings_ to the names. They are all forms of self-contentment, self-gratification, but the names so disguise them that they distract our attention from the fact. Also we have smuggled a word into the dictionary which ought not to be there at all—Self-Sacrifice. It describes a thing which does not exist. But worst of all, we ignore and never mention the Sole Impulse which dictates and compels a man’s every act: the imperious necessity of securing his own approval, in every emergency and at all costs. To it we owe all that we are. It is our breath, our heart, our blood. It is our only spur, our whip, our goad, our only impelling power; we have no other. Without it we should be mere inert images, corpses; no one would do anything, there would be no progress, the world would stand still. We ought to stand reverently uncovered when the name of that stupendous power is uttered.  Y.M. I am not convinced.  O.M. You will be when you think.  III  Instances in Point  Old Man. Have you given thought to the Gospel of Self—Approval since we talked?  Young Man. I have.  O.M. It was I that moved you to it. That is to say an _outside influence_ moved you to it—not one that originated in your head. Will you try to keep that in mind and not forget it?  Y.M. Yes. Why?  O.M. Because by and by in one of our talks, I wish to further impress upon you that neither you, nor I, nor any man ever originates a thought in his own head. _The utterer of a thought always utters a second-hand one_.  Y.M. Oh, now—  O.M. Wait. Reserve your remark till we get to that part of our discussion—tomorrow or next day, say. Now, then, have you been considering the proposition that no act is ever born of any but a self-contenting impulse—(primarily). You have sought. What have you found?  Y.M. I have not been very fortunate. I have examined many fine and apparently self-sacrificing deeds in romances and biographies, but—  O.M. Under searching analysis the ostensible self-sacrifice disappeared? It naturally would.  Y.M. But here in this novel is one which seems to promise. In the Adirondack woods is a wage-earner and lay preacher in the lumber-camps who is of noble character and deeply religious. An earnest and practical laborer in the New York slums comes up there on vacation—he is leader of a section of the University Settlement. Holme, the lumberman, is fired with a desire to throw away his excellent worldly prospects and go down and save souls on the East Side. He counts it happiness to make this sacrifice for the glory of God and for the cause of Christ. He resigns his place, makes the sacrifice cheerfully, and goes to the East Side and preaches Christ and Him crucified every day and every night to little groups of half-civilized foreign paupers who scoff at him. But he rejoices in the scoffings, since he is suffering them in the great cause of Christ. You have so filled my mind with suspicions that I was constantly expecting to find a hidden questionable impulse back of all this, but I am thankful to say I have failed. This man saw his duty, and for _duty’s sake_ he sacrificed self and assumed the burden it imposed.  O.M. Is that as far as you have read?  Y.M. Yes.  O.M. Let us read further, presently. Meantime, in sacrificing himself—_not_ for the glory of God, _primarily_, as _he_ imagined, but _first_ to content that exacting and inflexible master within him—_did he sacrifice anybody else_?  Y.M. How do you mean?  O.M. He relinquished a lucrative post and got mere food and lodging in place of it. Had he dependents?  Y.M. Well—yes.  O.M. In what way and to what extend did his self-sacrifice affect _them_?  Y.M. He was the support of a superannuated father. He had a young sister with a remarkable voice—he was giving her a musical education, so that her longing to be self-supporting might be gratified. He was furnishing the money to put a young brother through a polytechnic school and satisfy his desire to become a civil engineer.  O.M. The old father’s comforts were now curtailed?  Y.M. Quite seriously. Yes.  O.M. The sister’s music-lessens had to stop?  Y.M. Yes.  O.M. The young brother’s education—well, an extinguishing blight fell upon that happy dream, and he had to go to sawing wood to support the old father, or something like that?  Y.M. It is about what happened. Yes.  O.M. What a handsome job of self-sacrificing he did do! It seems to me that he sacrificed everybody _except_ himself. Haven’t I told you that no man _ever_ sacrifices himself; that there is no instance of it upon record anywhere; and that when a man’s Interior Monarch requires a thing of its slave for either its _momentary_ or its _permanent_ contentment, that thing must and will be furnished and that command obeyed, no matter who may stand in the way and suffer disaster by it? That man _ruined his family_ to please and content his Interior Monarch—  Y.M. And help Christ’s cause.  O.M. Yes—_secondly_. Not firstly. _He_ thought it was firstly.  Y.M. Very well, have it so, if you will. But it could be that he argued that if he saved a hundred souls in New York—  O.M. The sacrifice of the _family_ would be justified by that great profit upon the—the—what shall we call it?  Y.M. Investment?  O.M. Hardly. How would _speculation_ do? How would _gamble_ do? Not a solitary soul-capture was sure. He played for a possible thirty-three-hundred-per-cent profit. It was _gambling_—with his family for “chips.” However let us see how the game came out. Maybe we can get on the track of the secret original impulse, the _real_ impulse, that moved him to so nobly self—sacrifice his family in the Savior’s cause under the superstition that he was sacrificing himself. I will read a chapter or so.... Here we have it! It was bound to expose itself sooner or later. He preached to the East-Side rabble a season, then went back to his old dull, obscure life in the lumber-camps “_hurt to the heart, his pride humbled_.” Why? Were not his efforts acceptable to the Savior, for Whom alone they were made? Dear me, that detail is _lost sight of_, is not even referred to, the fact that it started out as a motive is entirely forgotten! Then what is the trouble? The authoress quite innocently and unconsciously gives the whole business away. The trouble was this: this man merely _preached_ to the poor; that is not the University Settlement’s way; it deals in larger and better things than that, and it did not enthuse over that crude Salvation-Army eloquence. It was courteous to Holme—but cool. It did not pet him, did not take him to its bosom. “_Perished were all his dreams of distinction, the praise and grateful approval_—” Of whom? The Savior? No; the Savior is not mentioned. Of whom, then? Of “his _fellow-workers_.” Why did he want that? Because the Master inside of him wanted it, and would not be content without it. That emphasized sentence quoted above, reveals the secret we have been seeking, the original impulse, the _real_ impulse, which moved the obscure and unappreciated Adirondack lumberman to sacrifice his family and go on that crusade to the East Side—which said original impulse was this, to wit: without knowing it _he went there to show a neglected world the large talent that was in him, and rise to distinction_. As I have warned you before, _no_ act springs from any but the one law, the one motive. But I pray you, do not accept this law upon my say-so; but diligently examine for yourself. Whenever you read of a self-sacrificing act or hear of one, or of a duty done for _duty’s sake_, take it to pieces and look for the _real_ motive. It is always there.  Y.M. I do it every day. I cannot help it, now that I have gotten started upon the degrading and exasperating quest. For it is hatefully interesting!—in fact, fascinating is the word. As soon as I come across a golden deed in a book I have to stop and take it apart and examine it, I cannot help myself.  O.M. Have you ever found one that defeated the rule?  Y.M. No—at least, not yet. But take the case of servant—tipping in Europe. You pay the _hotel_ for service; you owe the servants _nothing_, yet you pay them besides. Doesn’t that defeat it?  O.M. In what way?  Y.M. You are not _obliged_ to do it, therefore its source is compassion for their ill-paid condition, and—  O.M. Has that custom ever vexed you, annoyed you, irritated you?  Y.M. Well, yes.  O.M. Still you succumbed to it?  Y.M. Of course.  O.M. Why of course?  Y.M. Well, custom is law, in a way, and laws must be submitted to—everybody recognizes it as a _duty_.  O.M. Then you pay for the irritating tax for _duty’s_ sake?  Y.M. I suppose it amounts to that.  O.M. Then the impulse which moves you to submit to the tax is not _all_ compassion, charity, benevolence?  Y.M. Well—perhaps not.  O.M. Is _any_ of it?  Y.M. I—perhaps I was too hasty in locating its source.  O.M. Perhaps so. In case you ignored the custom would you get prompt and effective service from the servants?  Y.M. Oh, hear yourself talk! Those European servants? Why, you wouldn’t get any at all, to speak of.  O.M. Couldn’t _that_ work as an impulse to move you to pay the tax?  Y.M. I am not denying it.  O.M. Apparently, then, it is a case of for-duty’s-sake with a little self-interest added?  Y.M. Yes, it has the look of it. But here is a point: we pay that tax knowing it to be unjust and an extortion; yet we go away with a pain at the heart if we think we have been stingy with the poor fellows; and we heartily wish we were back again, so that we could do the right thing, and _more_ than the right thing, the _generous_ thing. I think it will be difficult for you to find any thought of self in that impulse.  O.M. I wonder why you should think so. When you find service charged in the _hotel_ bill does it annoy you?  Y.M. No.  O.M. Do you ever complain of the amount of it?  Y.M. No, it would not occur to me.  O.M. The _expense_, then, is not the annoying detail. It is a fixed charge, and you pay it cheerfully, you pay it without a murmur. When you came to pay the servants, how would you like it if each of the men and maids had a fixed charge?  Y.M. Like it? I should rejoice!  O.M. Even if the fixed tax were a shade _more_ than you had been in the habit of paying in the form of tips?  Y.M. Indeed, yes!  O.M. Very well, then. As I understand it, it isn’t really compassion nor yet duty that moves you to pay the tax, and it isn’t the _amount_ of the tax that annoys you. Yet _something_ annoys you. What is it?  Y.M. Well, the trouble is, you never know _what_ to pay, the tax varies so, all over Europe.  O.M. So you have to guess?  Y.M. There is no other way. So you go on thinking and thinking, and calculating and guessing, and consulting with other people and getting their views; and it spoils your sleep nights, and makes you distraught in the daytime, and while you are pretending to look at the sights you are only guessing and guessing and guessing all the time, and being worried and miserable.  O.M. And all about a debt which you don’t owe and don’t have to pay unless you want to! Strange. What is the purpose of the guessing?  Y.M. To guess out what is right to give them, and not be unfair to any of them.  O.M. It has quite a noble look—taking so much pains and using up so much valuable time in order to be just and fair to a poor servant to whom you owe nothing, but who needs money and is ill paid.  Y.M. I think, myself, that if there is any ungracious motive back of it it will be hard to find.  O.M. How do you know when you have not paid a servant fairly?  Y.M. Why, he is silent; does not thank you. Sometimes he gives you a look that makes you ashamed. You are too proud to rectify your mistake there, with people looking, but afterward you keep on wishing and wishing you _had_ done it. My, the shame and the pain of it! Sometimes you see, by the signs, that you have it _just right_, and you go away mightily satisfied. Sometimes the man is so effusively thankful that you know you have given him a good deal _more_ than was necessary.  O.M. _Necessary_? Necessary for what?  Y.M. To content him.  O.M. How do you feel _then_?  Y.M. Repentant.  O.M. It is my belief that you have _not_ been concerning yourself in guessing out his just dues, but only in ciphering out what would _content_ him. And I think you have a self-deluding reason for that.  Y.M. What was it?  O.M. If you fell short of what he was expecting and wanting, you would get a look which would _shame you before folk_. That would give you _pain_. _You_—for you are only working for yourself, not _him_. If you gave him too much you would be _ashamed of yourself_ for it, and that would give _you_ pain—another case of thinking of _yourself_, protecting yourself, _saving yourself from discomfort_. You never think of the servant once—except to guess out how to get _his approval_. If you get that, you get your _own _approval, and that is the sole and only thing you are after. The Master inside of you is then satisfied, contented, comfortable; there was _no other_ thing at stake, as a matter of _first_ interest, anywhere in the transaction.  _Further Instances_  Y.M. Well, to think of it; Self-Sacrifice for others, the grandest thing in man, ruled out! non-existent!  O.M. Are you accusing me of saying that?  Y.M. Why, certainly.  O.M. I haven’t said it.  Y.M. What did you say, then?  O.M. That no man has ever sacrificed himself in the common meaning of that phrase—which is, self-sacrifice for another _alone_. Men make daily sacrifices for others, but it is for their own sake _first_. The act must content their own spirit _first_. The other beneficiaries come second.  Y.M. And the same with duty for duty’s sake?  O.M. Yes. No man performs a duty for mere duty’s sake; the act must content his spirit _first_. He must feel better for _doing_ the duty than he would for shirking it. Otherwise he will not do it.  Y.M. Take the case of the _Berkeley Castle_.  O.M. It was a noble duty, greatly performed. Take it to pieces and examine it, if you like.  Y.M. A British troop-ship crowded with soldiers and their wives and children. She struck a rock and began to sink. There was room in the boats for the women and children only. The colonel lined up his regiment on the deck and said “it is our duty to die, that they may be saved.” There was no murmur, no protest. The boats carried away the women and children. When the death-moment was come, the colonel and his officers took their several posts, the men stood at shoulder-arms, and so, as on dress-parade, with their flag flying and the drums beating, they went down, a sacrifice to duty for duty’s sake. Can you view it as other than that?  O.M. It was something as fine as that, as exalted as that. Could you have remained in those ranks and gone down to your death in that unflinching way?  Y.M. Could I? No, I could not.  O.M. Think. Imagine yourself there, with that watery doom creeping higher and higher around you.  Y.M. I can imagine it. I feel all the horror of it. I could not have endured it, I could not have remained in my place. I know it.  O.M. Why?  Y.M. There is no why about it: I know myself, and I know I couldn’t _do_ it.  O.M. But it would be your _duty_ to do it.  Y.M. Yes, I know—but I couldn’t.  O.M. It was more than thousand men, yet not one of them flinched. Some of them must have been born with your temperament; if they could do that great duty for duty’s _sake_, why not you? Don’t you know that you could go out and gather together a thousand clerks and mechanics and put them on that deck and ask them to die for duty’s sake, and not two dozen of them would stay in the ranks to the end?  Y.M. Yes, I know that.  O.M. But you _train_ them, and put them through a campaign or two; then they would be soldiers; soldiers, with a soldier’s pride, a soldier’s self-respect, a soldier’s ideals. They would have to content a _soldier’s_ spirit then, not a clerk’s, not a mechanic’s. They could not content that spirit by shirking a soldier’s duty, could they?  Y.M. I suppose not.  O.M. Then they would do the duty not for the _duty’s_ sake, but for their _own _sake—primarily. The _duty_ was _just the same_, and just as imperative, when they were clerks, mechanics, raw recruits, but they wouldn’t perform it for that. As clerks and mechanics they had other ideals, another spirit to satisfy, and they satisfied it. They _had_ to; it is the law. _Training _is potent. Training toward higher and higher, and ever higher ideals is worth any man’s thought and labor and diligence.  Y.M. Consider the man who stands by his duty and goes to the stake rather than be recreant to it.  O.M. It is his make and his training. He has to content the spirit that is in him, though it cost him his life. Another man, just as sincerely religious, but of different temperament, will fail of that duty, though recognizing it as a duty, and grieving to be unequal to it: but he must content the spirit that is in him—he cannot help it. He could not perform that duty for duty’s _sake_, for that would not content his spirit, and the contenting of his spirit must be looked to _first_. It takes precedence of all other duties.  Y.M. Take the case of a clergyman of stainless private morals who votes for a thief for public office, on his own party’s ticket, and against an honest man on the other ticket.  O.M. He has to content his spirit. He has no public morals; he has no private ones, where his party’s prosperity is at stake. He will always be true to his make and training.  IV  Training  Young Man. You keep using that word—training. By it do you particularly mean—  Old Man. Study, instruction, lectures, sermons? That is a part of it—but not a large part. I mean _all _the outside influences. There are a million of them. From the cradle to the grave, during all his waking hours, the human being is under training. In the very first rank of his trainers stands _association_. It is his human environment which influences his mind and his feelings, furnishes him his ideals, and sets him on his road and keeps him in it. If he leave[s] that road he will find himself shunned by the people whom he most loves and esteems, and whose approval he most values. He is a chameleon; by the law of his nature he takes the color of his place of resort. The influences about him create his preferences, his aversions, his politics, his tastes, his morals, his religion. He creates none of these things for himself. He _thinks _he does, but that is because he has not examined into the matter. You have seen Presbyterians?  Y.M. Many.  O.M. How did they happen to be Presbyterians and not Congregationalists? And why were the Congregationalists not Baptists, and the Baptists Roman Catholics, and the Roman Catholics Buddhists, and the Buddhists Quakers, and the Quakers Episcopalians, and the Episcopalians Millerites and the Millerites Hindus, and the Hindus Atheists, and the Atheists Spiritualists, and the Spiritualists Agnostics, and the Agnostics Methodists, and the Methodists Confucians, and the Confucians Unitarians, and the Unitarians Mohammedans, and the Mohammedans Salvation Warriors, and the Salvation Warriors Zoroastrians, and the Zoroastrians Christian Scientists, and the Christian Scientists Mormons—and so on?  Y.M. You may answer your question yourself.  O.M. That list of sects is not a record of _studies_, searchings, seekings after light; it mainly (and sarcastically) indicates what _association _can do. If you know a man’s nationality you can come within a split hair of guessing the complexion of his religion: English—Protestant; American—ditto; Spaniard, Frenchman, Irishman, Italian, South American—Roman Catholic; Russian—Greek Catholic; Turk—Mohammedan; and so on. And when you know the man’s religious complexion, you know what sort of religious books he reads when he wants some more light, and what sort of books he avoids, lest by accident he get more light than he wants. In America if you know which party-collar a voter wears, you know what his associations are, and how he came by his politics, and which breed of newspaper he reads to get light, and which breed he diligently avoids, and which breed of mass-meetings he attends in order to broaden his political knowledge, and which breed of mass-meetings he doesn’t attend, except to refute its doctrines with brickbats. We are always hearing of people who are around _seeking after truth_. I have never seen a (permanent) specimen. I think he had never lived. But I have seen several entirely sincere people who _thought _they were (permanent) Seekers after Truth. They sought diligently, persistently, carefully, cautiously, profoundly, with perfect honesty and nicely adjusted judgment—until they believed that without doubt or question they had found the Truth. _That was the end of the search. _The man spent the rest of his life hunting up shingles wherewith to protect his Truth from the weather. If he was seeking after political Truth he found it in one or another of the hundred political gospels which govern men in the earth; if he was seeking after the Only True Religion he found it in one or another of the three thousand that are on the market. In any case, when he found the Truth _he sought no further; _but from that day forth, with his soldering-iron in one hand and his bludgeon in the other he tinkered its leaks and reasoned with objectors. There have been innumerable Temporary Seekers of Truth—have you ever heard of a permanent one? In the very nature of man such a person is impossible. However, to drop back to the text—training: all training is one form or another of _outside influence, _and _association _is the largest part of it. A man is never anything but what his outside influences have made him. They train him downward or they train him upward—but they _train _him; they are at work upon him all the time.  Y.M. Then if he happen by the accidents of life to be evilly placed there is no help for him, according to your notions—he must train downward.  O.M. No help for him? No help for this chameleon? It is a mistake. It is in his chameleonship that his greatest good fortune lies. He has only to change his habitat—his _associations_. But the impulse to do it must come from the _outside _—he cannot originate it himself, with that purpose in view. Sometimes a very small and accidental thing can furnish him the initiatory impulse and start him on a new road, with a new idea. The chance remark of a sweetheart, “I hear that you are a coward,” may water a seed that shall sprout and bloom and flourish, and ended in producing a surprising fruitage—in the fields of war. The history of man is full of such accidents. The accident of a broken leg brought a profane and ribald soldier under religious influences and furnished him a new ideal. From that accident sprang the Order of the Jesuits, and it has been shaking thrones, changing policies, and doing other tremendous work for two hundred years—and will go on. The chance reading of a book or of a paragraph in a newspaper can start a man on a new track and make him renounce his old associations and seek new ones that are _in sympathy with his new ideal_: and the result, for that man, can be an entire change of his way of life.  Y.M. Are you hinting at a scheme of procedure?  O.M. Not a new one—an old one. Old as mankind.  Y.M. What is it?  O.M. Merely the laying of traps for people. Traps baited with _initiatory impulses toward high ideals. _It is what the tract-distributor does. It is what the missionary does. It is what governments ought to do.  Y.M. Don’t they?  O.M. In one way they do, in another they don’t. They separate the smallpox patients from the healthy people, but in dealing with crime they put the healthy into the pest-house along with the sick. That is to say, they put the beginners in with the confirmed criminals. This would be well if man were naturally inclined to good, but he isn’t, and so _association _makes the beginners worse than they were when they went into captivity. It is putting a very severe punishment upon the comparatively innocent at times. They hang a man—which is a trifling punishment; this breaks the hearts of his family—which is a heavy one. They comfortably jail and feed a wife-beater, and leave his innocent wife and family to starve.  Y.M. Do you believe in the doctrine that man is equipped with an intuitive perception of good and evil?  O.M. Adam hadn’t it.  Y.M. But has man acquired it since?  O.M. No. I think he has no intuitions of any kind. He gets _all _his ideas, all his impressions, from the outside. I keep repeating this, in the hope that I may impress it upon you that you will be interested to observe and examine for yourself and see whether it is true or false.  Y.M. Where did you get your own aggravating notions?  O.M. From the _outside_. I did not invent them. They are gathered from a thousand unknown sources. Mainly _unconsciously _gathered.  Y.M. Don’t you believe that God could make an inherently honest man?  O.M. Yes, I know He could. I also know that He never did make one.  Y.M. A wiser observer than you has recorded the fact that “an honest man’s the noblest work of God.”  O.M. He didn’t record a fact, he recorded a falsity. It is windy, and sounds well, but it is not true. God makes a man with honest and dishonest _possibilities _in him and stops there. The man’s _associations _develop the possibilities—the one set or the other. The result is accordingly an honest man or a dishonest one.  Y.M. And the honest one is not entitled to—  O.M. Praise? No. How often must I tell you that? _He _is not the architect of his honesty.  Y.M. Now then, I will ask you where there is any sense in training people to lead virtuous lives. What is gained by it?  O.M. The man himself gets large advantages out of it, and that is the main thing—to _him_. He is not a peril to his neighbors, he is not a damage to them—and so _they _get an advantage out of his virtues. That is the main thing to _them_. It can make this life comparatively comfortable to the parties concerned; the _neglect _of this training can make this life a constant peril and distress to the parties concerned.  Y.M. You have said that training is everything; that training is the man _himself_, for it makes him what he is.  O.M. I said training and _another _thing. Let that other thing pass, for the moment. What were you going to say?  Y.M. We have an old servant. She has been with us twenty—two years. Her service used to be faultless, but now she has become very forgetful. We are all fond of her; we all recognize that she cannot help the infirmity which age has brought her; the rest of the family do not scold her for her remissnesses, but at times I do—I can’t seem to control myself. Don’t I try? I do try. Now, then, when I was ready to dress, this morning, no clean clothes had been put out. I lost my temper; I lose it easiest and quickest in the early morning. I rang; and immediately began to warn myself not to show temper, and to be careful and speak gently. I safe-guarded myself most carefully. I even chose the very word I would use: “You’ve forgotten the clean clothes, Jane.” When she appeared in the door I opened my mouth to say that phrase—and out of it, moved by an instant surge of passion which I was not expecting and hadn’t time to put under control, came the hot rebuke, “You’ve forgotten them again!” You say a man always does the thing which will best please his Interior Master. Whence came the impulse to make careful preparation to save the girl the humiliation of a rebuke? Did that come from the Master, who is always primarily concerned about _himself_?  O.M. Unquestionably. There is no other source for any impulse. _Secondarily _you made preparation to save the girl, but _primarily _its object was to save yourself, by contenting the Master.  Y.M. How do you mean?  O.M. Has any member of the family ever implored you to watch your temper and not fly out at the girl?  Y.M. Yes. My mother.  O.M. You love her?  Y.M. Oh, more than that!  O.M. You would always do anything in your power to please her?  Y.M. It is a delight to me to do anything to please her!  O.M. Why? _You would do it for pay, solely _—for _profit_. What profit would you expect and certainly receive from the investment?  Y.M. Personally? None. To please _her _is enough.  O.M. It appears, then, that your object, primarily, _wasn’t _to save the girl a humiliation, but to _please your mother. _It also appears that to please your mother gives _you _a strong pleasure. Is not that the profit which you get out of the investment? Isn’t that the _real _profits and _first _profit?  Y.M. Oh, well? Go on.  O.M. In _all _transactions, the Interior Master looks to it that _you get the first profit. _Otherwise there is no transaction.  Y.M. Well, then, if I was so anxious to get that profit and so intent upon it, why did I throw it away by losing my temper?  O.M. In order to get _another _profit which suddenly superseded it in value.  Y.M. Where was it?  O.M. Ambushed behind your born temperament, and waiting for a chance. Your native warm temper suddenly jumped to the front, and _for the moment its influence _was more powerful than your mother’s, and abolished it. In that instance you were eager to flash out a hot rebuke and enjoy it. You did enjoy it, didn’t you?  Y.M. For—for a quarter of a second. Yes—I did.  O.M. Very well, it is as I have said: the thing which will give you the _most _pleasure, the most satisfaction, in any moment or _fraction _of a moment, is the thing you will always do. You must content the Master’s _latest _whim, whatever it may be.  Y.M. But when the tears came into the old servant’s eyes I could have cut my hand off for what I had done.  O.M. Right. You had humiliated _yourself_, you see, you had given yourself _pain_. Nothing is of _first _importance to a man except results which damage _him _or profit him—all the rest is _secondary_. Your Master was displeased with you, although you had obeyed him. He required a prompt _repentance_; you obeyed again; you_ had _to—there is never any escape from his commands. He is a hard master and fickle; he changes his mind in the fraction of a second, but you must be ready to obey, and you will obey, _always_. If he requires repentance, you content him, you will always furnish it. He must be nursed, petted, coddled, and kept contented, let the terms be what they may.  Y.M. Training! Oh, what’s the use of it? Didn’t I, and didn’t my mother try to train me up to where I would no longer fly out at that girl?  O.M. Have you never managed to keep back a scolding?  Y.M. Oh, certainly—many times.  O.M. More times this year than last?  Y.M. Yes, a good many more.  O.M. More times last year than the year before?  Y.M. Yes.  O.M. There is a large improvement, then, in the two years?  Y.M. Yes, undoubtedly.  O.M. Then your question is answered. You see there _is _use in training. Keep on. Keeping faithfully on. You are doing well.  Y.M. Will my reform reach perfection?  O.M. It will. Up to _your _limit.  Y.M. My limit? What do you mean by that?  O.M. You remember that you said that I said training was _everything_. I corrected you, and said “training and _another _thing.” That other thing is _temperament _—that is, the disposition you were born with. _You can’t eradicate your disposition nor any rag of it _—you can only put a pressure on it and keep it down and quiet. You have a warm temper?  Y.M. Yes.  O.M. You will never get rid of it; but by watching it you can keep it down nearly all the time. _Its presence is your limit. _Your reform will never quite reach perfection, for your temper will beat you now and then, but you come near enough. You have made valuable progress and can make more. There _is _use in training. Immense use. Presently you will reach a new stage of development, then your progress will be easier; will proceed on a simpler basis, anyway.  Y.M. Explain.  O.M. You keep back your scoldings now, to please _yourself _by pleasing your _mother_; presently the mere triumphing over your temper will delight your vanity and confer a more delicious pleasure and satisfaction upon you than even the approbation of your _mother _confers upon you now. You will then labor for yourself directly and at _first hand, _not by the roundabout way through your mother. It simplifies the matter, and it also strengthens the impulse.  Y.M. Ah, dear! But I sha’n’t ever reach the point where I will spare the girl for _her _sake _primarily_, not mine?  O.M. Why—yes. In heaven.  Y.M. (_After a reflective pause) _Temperament. Well, I see one must allow for temperament. It is a large factor, sure enough. My mother is thoughtful, and not hot-tempered. When I was dressed I went to her room; she was not there; I called, she answered from the bathroom. I heard the water running. I inquired. She answered, without temper, that Jane had forgotten her bath, and she was preparing it herself. I offered to ring, but she said, “No, don’t do that; it would only distress her to be confronted with her lapse, and would be a rebuke; she doesn’t deserve that—she is not to blame for the tricks her memory serves her.” I say—has my mother an Interior Master?—and where was he?  O.M. He was there. There, and looking out for his own peace and pleasure and contentment. The girl’s distress would have pained _your mother. _Otherwise the girl would have been rung up, distress and all. I know women who would have gotten a No. 1 _pleasure _out of ringing Jane up—and so they would infallibly have pushed the button and obeyed the law of their make and training, which are the servants of their Interior Masters. It is quite likely that a part of your mother’s forbearance came from training. The _good _kind of training—whose best and highest function is to see to it that every time it confers a satisfaction upon its pupil a benefit shall fall at second hand upon others.  Y.M. If you were going to condense into an admonition your plan for the general betterment of the race’s condition, how would you word it?  _Admonition_  O.M. Diligently train your ideals _upward _and _still upward _toward a summit where you will find your chiefest pleasure in conduct which, while contenting you, will be sure to confer benefits upon your neighbor and the community.  Y.M. Is that a new gospel?  O.M. No.  Y.M. It has been taught before?  O.M. For ten thousand years.  Y.M. By whom?  O.M. All the great religions—all the great gospels.  Y.M. Then there is nothing new about it?  O.M. Oh yes, there is. It is candidly stated, this time. That has not been done before.  Y.M. How do you mean?  O.M. Haven’t I put _you first, _and your neighbor and the community afterward?  Y.M. Well, yes, that is a difference, it is true.  O.M. The difference between straight speaking and crooked; the difference between frankness and shuffling.  Y.M. Explain.  O.M. The others offer you a hundred bribes to be good, thus conceding that the Master inside of you must be conciliated and contented first, and that you will do nothing at _first hand _but for his sake; then they turn square around and require you to do good for _other’s _sake _chiefly_; and to do your duty for duty’s _sake_, chiefly; and to do acts of _self_-_sacrifice_. Thus at the outset we all stand upon the same ground—recognition of the supreme and absolute Monarch that resides in man, and we all grovel before him and appeal to him; then those others dodge and shuffle, and face around and unfrankly and inconsistently and illogically change the form of their appeal and direct its persuasions to man’s _second-place _powers and to powers which have _no existence _in him, thus advancing them to _first _place; whereas in my Admonition I stick logically and consistently to the original position: I place the Interior Master’s requirements _first_, and keep them there.  Y.M. If we grant, for the sake of argument, that your scheme and the other schemes aim at and produce the same result—_right living—_has yours an advantage over the others?  O.M. One, yes—a large one. It has no concealments, no deceptions. When a man leads a right and valuable life under it he is not deceived as to the _real _chief motive which impels him to it—in those other cases he is.  Y.M. Is that an advantage? Is it an advantage to live a lofty life for a mean reason? In the other cases he lives the lofty life under the _impression _that he is living for a lofty reason. Is not that an advantage?  O.M. Perhaps so. The same advantage he might get out of thinking himself a duke, and living a duke’s life and parading in ducal fuss and feathers, when he wasn’t a duke at all, and could find it out if he would only examine the herald’s records.  Y.M. But anyway, he is obliged to do a duke’s part; he puts his hand in his pocket and does his benevolences on as big a scale as he can stand, and that benefits the community.  O.M. He could do that without being a duke.  Y.M. But would he?  O.M. Don’t you see where you are arriving?  Y.M. Where?  O.M. At the standpoint of the other schemes: That it is good morals to let an ignorant duke do showy benevolences for his pride’s sake, a pretty low motive, and go on doing them unwarned, lest if he were made acquainted with the actual motive which prompted them he might shut up his purse and cease to be good?  Y.M. But isn’t it best to leave him in ignorance, as long as he _thinks _he is doing good for others’ sake?  O.M. Perhaps so. It is the position of the other schemes. They think humbug is good enough morals when the dividend on it is good deeds and handsome conduct.  Y.M. It is my opinion that under your scheme of a man’s doing a good deed for his _own _sake first-off, instead of first for the _good deed’s _sake, no man would ever do one.  O.M. Have you committed a benevolence lately?  Y.M. Yes. This morning.  O.M. Give the particulars.  Y.M. The cabin of the old negro woman who used to nurse me when I was a child and who saved my life once at the risk of her own, was burned last night, and she came mourning this morning, and pleading for money to build another one.  O.M. You furnished it?  Y.M. Certainly.  O.M. You were glad you had the money?  Y.M. Money? I hadn’t. I sold my horse.  O.M. You were glad you had the horse?  Y.M. Of course I was; for if I hadn’t had the horse I should have been incapable, and my _mother _would have captured the chance to set old Sally up.  O.M. You were cordially glad you were not caught out and incapable?  Y.M. Oh, I just was!  O.M. Now, then—  Y.M. Stop where you are! I know your whole catalog of questions, and I could answer every one of them without your wasting the time to ask them; but I will summarize the whole thing in a single remark: I did the charity knowing it was because the act would give _me _a splendid pleasure, and because old Sally’s moving gratitude and delight would give _me _another one; and because the reflection that she would be happy now and out of her trouble would fill _me _full of happiness. I did the whole thing with my eyes open and recognizing and realizing that I was looking out for _my _share of the profits _first_. Now then, I have confessed. Go on.  O.M. I haven’t anything to offer; you have covered the whole ground. Can you have been any _more _strongly moved to help Sally out of her trouble—could you have done the deed any more eagerly—if you had been under the delusion that you were doing it for _her _sake and profit only?  Y.M. No! Nothing in the world could have made the impulse which moved me more powerful, more masterful, more thoroughly irresistible. I played the limit!  O.M. Very well. You begin to suspect—and I claim to _know _—that when a man is a shade _more strongly moved _to do _one _of two things or of two dozen things than he is to do any one of the _others_, he will infallibly do that _one _thing, be it good or be it evil; and if it be good, not all the beguilements of all the casuistries can increase the strength of the impulse by a single shade or add a shade to the comfort and contentment he will get out of the act.  Y.M. Then you believe that such tendency toward doing good as is in men’s hearts would not be diminished by the removal of the delusion that good deeds are done primarily for the sake of No. 2 instead of for the sake of No. 1?  O.M. That is what I fully believe.  Y.M. Doesn’t it somehow seem to take from the dignity of the deed?  O.M. If there is dignity in falsity, it does. It removes that.  Y.M. What is left for the moralists to do?  O.M. Teach unreservedly what he already teaches with one side of his mouth and takes back with the other: Do right _for your own sake, _and be happy in knowing that your _neighbor _will certainly share in the benefits resulting.  Y.M. Repeat your Admonition.  O.M. _Diligently train your ideals upward and still upward toward a summit where you will find your chiefest pleasure in conduct which, while contenting you, will be sure to confer benefits upon your neighbor and the community._  Y.M. One’s _every _act proceeds from _exterior influences_, you think?  O.M. Yes.  Y.M. If I conclude to rob a person, I am not the _originator _of the idea, but it comes in from the _outside_? I see him handling money—for instance—and _that _moves me to the crime?  O.M. That, by itself? Oh, certainly not. It is merely the _latest _outside influence of a procession of preparatory influences stretching back over a period of years. No _single _outside influence can make a man do a thing which is at war with his training. The most it can do is to start his mind on a new tract and open it to the reception of _new _influences—as in the case of Ignatius Loyola. In time these influences can train him to a point where it will be consonant with his new character to yield to the _final _influence and do that thing. I will put the case in a form which will make my theory clear to you, I think. Here are two ingots of virgin gold. They shall represent a couple of characters which have been refined and perfected in the virtues by years of diligent right training. Suppose you wanted to break down these strong and well-compacted characters—what influence would you bring to bear upon the ingots?  Y.M. Work it out yourself. Proceed.  O.M. Suppose I turn upon one of them a steam-jet during a long succession of hours. Will there be a result?  Y.M. None that I know of.  O.M. Why?  Y.M. A steam-jet cannot break down such a substance.  O.M. Very well. The steam is an _outside influence, _but it is ineffective because the gold _takes no interest in it. _The ingot remains as it was. Suppose we add to the steam some quicksilver in a vaporized condition, and turn the jet upon the ingot, will there be an instantaneous result?  Y.M. No.  O.M. The _quicksilver _is an outside influence which gold (by its peculiar nature—say _temperament, disposition) cannot be indifferent to. _It stirs up the interest of the gold, although we do not perceive it; but a _single _application of the influence works no damage. Let us continue the application in a steady stream, and call each minute a year. By the end of ten or twenty minutes—ten or twenty years—the little ingot is sodden with quicksilver, its virtues are gone, its character is degraded. At last it is ready to yield to a temptation which it would have taken no notice of, ten or twenty years ago. We will apply that temptation in the form of a pressure of my finger. You note the result?  Y.M. Yes; the ingot has crumbled to sand. I understand, now. It is not the _single _outside influence that does the work, but only the _last _one of a long and disintegrating accumulation of them. I see, now, how my _single _impulse to rob the man is not the one that makes me do it, but only the _last _one of a preparatory series. You might illustrate with a parable.  _A Parable_  O.M. I will. There was once a pair of New England boys—twins. They were alike in good dispositions, feckless morals, and personal appearance. They were the models of the Sunday—school. At fifteen George had the opportunity to go as cabin-boy in a whale-ship, and sailed away for the Pacific. Henry remained at home in the village. At eighteen George was a sailor before the mast, and Henry was teacher of the advanced Bible class. At twenty-two George, through fighting-habits and drinking-habits acquired at sea and in the sailor boarding-houses of the European and Oriental ports, was a common rough in Hong-Kong, and out of a job; and Henry was superintendent of the Sunday-school. At twenty-six George was a wanderer, a tramp, and Henry was pastor of the village church. Then George came home, and was Henry’s guest. One evening a man passed by and turned down the lane, and Henry said, with a pathetic smile, “Without intending me a discomfort, that man is always keeping me reminded of my pinching poverty, for he carries heaps of money about him, and goes by here every evening of his life.” That _outside influence _—that remark—was enough for George, but _it _was not the one that made him ambush the man and rob him, it merely represented the eleven years’ accumulation of such influences, and gave birth to the act for which their long gestation had made preparation. It had never entered the head of Henry to rob the man—his ingot had been subjected to clean steam only; but George’s had been subjected to vaporized quicksilver.  V  More About the Machine  Note.—When Mrs. W. asks how can a millionaire give a single dollar to colleges and museums while one human being is destitute of bread, she has answered her question herself. Her feeling for the poor shows that she has a standard of benevolence; there she has conceded the millionaire’s privilege of having a standard; since she evidently requires him to adopt her standard, she is by that act requiring herself to adopt his. The human being always looks down when he is examining another person’s standard; he never find one that he has to examine by looking up.  _The Man-Machine Again_  Young Man. You really think man is a mere machine?  Old Man. I do.  Y.M. And that his mind works automatically and is independent of his control—carries on thought on its own hook?  O.M. Yes. It is diligently at work, unceasingly at work, during every waking moment. Have you never tossed about all night, imploring, beseeching, commanding your mind to stop work and let you go to sleep?—you who perhaps imagine that your mind is your servant and must obey your orders, think what you tell it to think, and stop when you tell it to stop. When it chooses to work, there is no way to keep it still for an instant. The brightest man would not be able to supply it with subjects if he had to hunt them up. If it needed the man’s help it would wait for him to give it work when he wakes in the morning.  Y.M. Maybe it does.  O.M. No, it begins right away, before the man gets wide enough awake to give it a suggestion. He may go to sleep saying, “The moment I wake I will think upon such and such a subject,” but he will fail. His mind will be too quick for him; by the time he has become nearly enough awake to be half conscious, he will find that it is already at work upon another subject. Make the experiment and see.  Y.M. At any rate, he can make it stick to a subject if he wants to.  O.M. Not if it find another that suits it better. As a rule it will listen to neither a dull speaker nor a bright one. It refuses all persuasion. The dull speaker wearies it and sends it far away in idle dreams; the bright speaker throws out stimulating ideas which it goes chasing after and is at once unconscious of him and his talk. You cannot keep your mind from wandering, if it wants to; it is master, not you.  _After an Interval of Days_  O.M. Now, dreams—but we will examine that later. Meantime, did you try commanding your mind to wait for orders from you, and not do any thinking on its own hook?  Y.M. Yes, I commanded it to stand ready to take orders when I should wake in the morning.  O.M. Did it obey?  Y.M. No. It went to thinking of something of its own initiation, without waiting for me. Also—as you suggested—at night I appointed a theme for it to begin on in the morning, and commanded it to begin on that one and no other.  O.M. Did it obey?  Y.M. No.  O.M. How many times did you try the experiment?  Y.M. Ten.  O.M. How many successes did you score?  Y.M. Not one.  O.M. It is as I have said: the mind is independent of the man. He has no control over it; it does as it pleases. It will take up a subject in spite of him; it will stick to it in spite of him; it will throw it aside in spite of him. It is entirely independent of him.  Y.M. Go on. Illustrate.  O.M. Do you know chess?  Y.M. I learned it a week ago.  O.M. Did your mind go on playing the game all night that first night?  Y.M. Don’t mention it!  O.M. It was eagerly, unsatisfiably interested; it rioted in the combinations; you implored it to drop the game and let you get some sleep?  Y.M. Yes. It wouldn’t listen; it played right along. It wore me out and I got up haggard and wretched in the morning.  O.M. At some time or other you have been captivated by a ridiculous rhyme-jingle?  Y.M. Indeed, yes!  “I saw Esau kissing Kate,     And she saw I saw Esau; I saw Esau, he saw Kate,     And she saw—”   And so on. My mind went mad with joy over it. It repeated it all day and all night for a week in spite of all I could do to stop it, and it seemed to me that I must surely go crazy.  O.M. And the new popular song?  Y.M. Oh yes! “In the Swee-eet By and By”; etc. Yes, the new popular song with the taking melody sings through one’s head day and night, asleep and awake, till one is a wreck. There is no getting the mind to let it alone.  O.M. Yes, asleep as well as awake. The mind is quite independent. It is master. You have nothing to do with it. It is so apart from you that it can conduct its affairs, sing its songs, play its chess, weave its complex and ingeniously constructed dreams, while you sleep. It has no use for your help, no use for your guidance, and never uses either, whether you be asleep or awake. You have imagined that you could originate a thought in your mind, and you have sincerely believed you could do it.  Y.M. Yes, I have had that idea.  O.M. Yet you can’t originate a dream-thought for it to work out, and get it accepted?  Y.M. No.  O.M. And you can’t dictate its procedure after it has originated a dream-thought for itself?  Y.M. No. No one can do it. Do you think the waking mind and the dream mind are the same machine?  O.M. There is argument for it. We have wild and fantastic day-thoughts? Things that are dream-like?  Y.M. Yes—like Mr. Wells’s man who invented a drug that made him invisible; and like the Arabian tales of the Thousand Nights.  O.M. And there are dreams that are rational, simple, consistent, and unfantastic?  Y.M. Yes. I have dreams that are like that. Dreams that are just like real life; dreams in which there are several persons with distinctly differentiated characters—inventions of my mind and yet strangers to me: a vulgar person; a refined one; a wise person; a fool; a cruel person; a kind and compassionate one; a quarrelsome person; a peacemaker; old persons and young; beautiful girls and homely ones. They talk in character, each preserves his own characteristics. There are vivid fights, vivid and biting insults, vivid love-passages; there are tragedies and comedies, there are griefs that go to one’s heart, there are sayings and doings that make you laugh: indeed, the whole thing is exactly like real life.  O.M. Your dreaming mind originates the scheme, consistently and artistically develops it, and carries the little drama creditably through—all without help or suggestion from you?  Y.M. Yes.  O.M. It is argument that it could do the like awake without help or suggestion from you—and I think it does. It is argument that it is the same old mind in both cases, and never needs your help. I think the mind is purely a machine, a thoroughly independent machine, an automatic machine. Have you tried the other experiment which I suggested to you?  Y.M. Which one?  O.M. The one which was to determine how much influence you have over your mind—if any.  Y.M. Yes, and got more or less entertainment out of it. I did as you ordered: I placed two texts before my eyes—one a dull one and barren of interest, the other one full of interest, inflamed with it, white-hot with it. I commanded my mind to busy itself solely with the dull one.  O.M. Did it obey?  Y.M. Well, no, it didn’t. It busied itself with the other one.  O.M. Did you try hard to make it obey?  Y.M. Yes, I did my honest best.  O.M. What was the text which it refused to be interested in or think about?  Y.M. It was this question: If A owes B a dollar and a half, and B owes C two and three-quarter, and C owes A thirty—five cents, and D and A together owe E and B three-sixteenths of—of—I don’t remember the rest, now, but anyway it was wholly uninteresting, and I could not force my mind to stick to it even half a minute at a time; it kept flying off to the other text.  O.M. What was the other text?  Y.M. It is no matter about that.  O.M. But what was it?  Y.M. A photograph.  O.M. Your own?  Y.M. No. It was hers.  O.M. You really made an honest good test. Did you make a second trial?  Y.M. Yes. I commanded my mind to interest itself in the morning paper’s report of the pork-market, and at the same time I reminded it of an experience of mine of sixteen years ago. It refused to consider the pork and gave its whole blazing interest to that ancient incident.  O.M. What was the incident?  Y.M. An armed desperado slapped my face in the presence of twenty spectators. It makes me wild and murderous every time I think of it.  O.M. Good tests, both; very good tests. Did you try my other suggestion?  Y.M. The one which was to prove to me that if I would leave my mind to its own devices it would find things to think about without any of my help, and thus convince me that it was a machine, an automatic machine, set in motion by exterior influences, and as independent of me as it could be if it were in some one else’s skull. Is that the one?  O.M. Yes.  Y.M. I tried it. I was shaving. I had slept well, and my mind was very lively, even gay and frisky. It was reveling in a fantastic and joyful episode of my remote boyhood which had suddenly flashed up in my memory—moved to this by the spectacle of a yellow cat picking its way carefully along the top of the garden wall. The color of this cat brought the bygone cat before me, and I saw her walking along the side-step of the pulpit; saw her walk on to a large sheet of sticky fly-paper and get all her feet involved; saw her struggle and fall down, helpless and dissatisfied, more and more urgent, more and more unreconciled, more and more mutely profane; saw the silent congregation quivering like jelly, and the tears running down their faces. I saw it all. The sight of the tears whisked my mind to a far distant and a sadder scene—in Terra del Fuego—and with Darwin’s eyes I saw a naked great savage hurl his little boy against the rocks for a trifling fault; saw the poor mother gather up her dying child and hug it to her breast and weep, uttering no word. Did my mind stop to mourn with that nude black sister of mine? No—it was far away from that scene in an instant, and was busying itself with an ever-recurring and disagreeable dream of mine. In this dream I always find myself, stripped to my shirt, cringing and dodging about in the midst of a great drawing-room throng of finely dressed ladies and gentlemen, and wondering how I got there. And so on and so on, picture after picture, incident after incident, a drifting panorama of ever-changing, ever-dissolving views manufactured by my mind without any help from me—why, it would take me two hours to merely name the multitude of things my mind tallied off and photographed in fifteen minutes, let alone describe them to you.  O.M. A man’s mind, left free, has no use for his help. But there is one way whereby he can get its help when he desires it.  Y.M. What is that way?  O.M. When your mind is racing along from subject to subject and strikes an inspiring one, open your mouth and begin talking upon that matter—or—take your pen and use that. It will interest your mind and concentrate it, and it will pursue the subject with satisfaction. It will take full charge, and furnish the words itself.  Y.M. But don’t I tell it what to say?  O.M. There are certainly occasions when you haven’t time. The words leap out before you know what is coming.  Y.M. For instance?  O.M. Well, take a “flash of wit”—repartee. Flash is the right word. It is out instantly. There is no time to arrange the words. There is no thinking, no reflecting. Where there is a wit-mechanism it is automatic in its action and needs no help. Where the wit-mechanism is lacking, no amount of study and reflection can manufacture the product.  Y.M. You really think a man originates nothing, creates nothing.  _The Thinking-Process_  O.M. I do. Men perceive, and their brain-machines automatically combine the things perceived. That is all.  Y.M. The steam-engine?  O.M. It takes fifty men a hundred years to invent it. One meaning of invent is discover. I use the word in that sense. Little by little they discover and apply the multitude of details that go to make the perfect engine. Watt noticed that confined steam was strong enough to lift the lid of the teapot. He didn’t create the idea, he merely discovered the fact; the cat had noticed it a hundred times. From the teapot he evolved the cylinder—from the displaced lid he evolved the piston-rod. To attach something to the piston-rod to be moved by it, was a simple matter—crank and wheel. And so there was a working engine.  One by one, improvements were discovered by men who used their eyes, not their creating powers—for they hadn’t any—and now, after a hundred years the patient contributions of fifty or a hundred observers stand compacted in the wonderful machine which drives the ocean liner.  Y.M. A Shakespearean play?  O.M. The process is the same. The first actor was a savage. He reproduced in his theatrical war-dances, scalp—dances, and so on, incidents which he had seen in real life. A more advanced civilization produced more incidents, more episodes; the actor and the story-teller borrowed them. And so the drama grew, little by little, stage by stage. It is made up of the facts of life, not creations. It took centuries to develop the Greek drama. It borrowed from preceding ages; it lent to the ages that came after. Men observe and combine, that is all. So does a rat.  Y.M. How?  O.M. He observes a smell, he infers a cheese, he seeks and finds. The astronomer observes this and that; adds his this and that to the this-and-thats of a hundred predecessors, infers an invisible planet, seeks it and finds it. The rat gets into a trap; gets out with trouble; infers that cheese in traps lacks value, and meddles with that trap no more. The astronomer is very proud of his achievement, the rat is proud of his. Yet both are machines; they have done machine work, they have originated nothing, they have no right to be vain; the whole credit belongs to their Maker. They are entitled to no honors, no praises, no monuments when they die, no remembrance. One is a complex and elaborate machine, the other a simple and limited machine, but they are alike in principle, function, and process, and neither of them works otherwise than automatically, and neither of them may righteously claim a _personal _superiority or a personal dignity above the other.  Y.M. In earned personal dignity, then, and in personal merit for what he does, it follows of necessity that he is on the same level as a rat?  O.M. His brother the rat; yes, that is how it seems to me. Neither of them being entitled to any personal merit for what he does, it follows of necessity that neither of them has a right to arrogate to himself (personally created) superiorities over his brother.  Y.M. Are you determined to go on believing in these insanities? Would you go on believing in them in the face of able arguments backed by collated facts and instances?  O.M. I have been a humble, earnest, and sincere Truth-Seeker.  Y.M. Very well?  O.M. The humble, earnest, and sincere Truth-Seeker is always convertible by such means.  Y.M. I am thankful to God to hear you say this, for now I know that your conversion—  O.M. Wait. You misunderstand. I said I have _been _a Truth-Seeker.  Y.M. Well?  O.M. I am not that now. Have your forgotten? I told you that there are none but temporary Truth-Seekers; that a permanent one is a human impossibility; that as soon as the Seeker finds what he is thoroughly convinced is the Truth, he seeks no further, but gives the rest of his days to hunting junk to patch it and caulk
