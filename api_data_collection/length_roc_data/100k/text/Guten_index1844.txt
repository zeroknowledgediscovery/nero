Secretarie him selfe, Syr _William Peter_, Syr _J. Mason_,     D. _Wotton_, Syr _Richard Sackuille_ Treasurer of the Exchecker,     Syr _Walter Mildmaye_ Chauncellor of the Exchecker, M.     _Haddon_ Master of Requestes, M. _John Astely_ Master of the     Iewell house, M. _Bernard Hampton_, M. _Nicasius_, and _J_.     Of which number, the most part were of hir Maiesties most     honourable priuie Counsell, and the reast seruing hir in verie     good place.  I was glad than, and do reioice yet to remember,     that my chance was so happie, to be there that day, in the     companie of so manie wise & good men togither, as hardly     than could haue beene piked out againe, out of all England     beside.          M. Secretarie hath this accustomed maner, though his head     be neuer so full of most weightie affaires of the Realme, yet, at     diner time he doth seeme to lay them alwaies aside: and findeth     euer fitte occasion to taulke pleasantlie of other matters,     but most gladlie of some matter of learning: wherein, he will     curteslie heare the minde of the meanest at his Table.          Not long after our sitting doune, I haue strange newes     brought me, sayth M. Secretarie, this morning, that diuerse     Scholers of Eaton, be runne awaie from the     Schole, for feare of beating. Whereupon, M.   //M. _Secreta-_     Secretarie tooke occasion, to wishe, that some     //_rie._       176        _A Præface to the Reader._      more discretion were in many Scholemasters, in vsing correction,     than commonlie there is. Who many times, punishe rather,     the weakenes of nature, than the fault of the Scholer. Whereby,     many Scholers, that might else proue well, be driuen to hate     learning, before they knowe, what learning meaneth: and so,     are made willing to forsake their booke, and be glad to be put     to any other kinde of liuing.          M. _Peter_, as one somewhat seuere of nature, said plainlie,     M. _Peter._ // that the Rodde onelie, was the sworde, that must     keepe, the Schole in obedience, and the Scholer     M. _Wotton._ // in good order. M. _Wotton_, á man milde of nature,     with soft voice, and fewe wordes, inclined to M. Secretaries     iudgement, and said, in mine opinion, the Schole-     Ludus li- // house should be in deede, as it is called by name,     terarum. // the house of playe and pleasure, and not of feare     _Plato_ de // and bondage: and as I do remember, so saith     Rep. 7. // _Socrates_ in one place of _Plato_. And therefore,     if a Rodde carie the feare of à Sworde, it is no maruell, if those     that be fearefull of nature, chose rather to forsake the Plaie,     than to stand alwaies within the feare of a Sworde in a fonde     mans handling. M. _Mason_, after his maner, was     M. _Mason._ // verie merie with both parties, pleasantlie playing,     both, with the shrewde touches of many courste boyes, and with     the small discretion of many leude Scholemasters. M. _Haddon_     was fullie of M. _Peters_ opinion, and said, that     M. _Haddon._ // the best scholemaster of our time, was the     greatest beater, and named the Person. Though, quoth I, it     was his good fortune, to send from his Schole,     The Author of // vnto the Vniuersitie, one of the best Scholers in     this booke. // deede of all our time, yet wise men do thinke,     that that came so to passe, rather, by the great towardnes of the     Scholer, than by the great beating of the Master: and whether     this be true or no, you your selfe are best witnes. I said     somewhat farder in the matter, how, and whie, yong children,     were soner allured by loue, than driuen by beating, to atteyne     good learning: wherein I was the bolder to say my minde,     bicause M. Secretarie curteslie prouoked me thereunto: or else,     in such à companie, and namelie in his præsence, my wonte is,     to be more willing, to vse mine eares, than to occupie my     tonge.       _A Præface to the Reader._        177      Syr _Walter Mildmaye_, M. _Astley_, and the rest, said verie     litle: onelie Syr _Rich. Sackuill_, said nothing at all. After dinner     I went vp to read with the Queenes Maiestie. We red than     togither in the Greke tongue, as I well remember. // Demost.     that noble Oration of _Demosthenes_ against _æschines_, // peri pa-     for his false dealing in his Ambassage to king // rapresb.     _Philip_ of Macedonie. Syr _Rich. Sackuile_ came vp sone after: and     finding me in hir Maiesties priuie chamber, he // Syr _R._     tooke me by the hand, & carying me to à // _Sackuiles_     windoe, said, M. _Ascham_, I would not for à good  // communi-     deale of monie, haue bene, this daie, absent from // cation with     diner. Where, though I said nothing, yet I gaue // the Author     as good eare, and do consider as well the taulke,  // of this     that passed, as any one did there. M. Secretarie said very // booke.     wisely, and most truely, that many yong wittes be driuen to     hate learninge, before they know what learninge is. I can be     good witnes to this my selfe: For à fond Scholemaster, before     I was fullie fourtene yeare olde, draue me so, with feare of     beating, from all loue of learninge, as nowe, when I know, what     difference it is, to haue learninge, and to haue litle, or none at     all, I feele it my greatest greife, and finde it my greatest hurte,     that euer came to me, that it was my so ill chance, to light     vpon so lewde à Scholemaster. But seing it is but in vain, to     lament thinges paste, and also wisdome to looke to thinges to     cum, surely, God willinge, if God lend me life, I will make     this my mishap, some occasion of good hap, to litle _Robert     Sackuile_ my sonnes sonne. For whose bringinge vp, I would     gladlie, if it so please you, vse speciallie your good aduice. I     heare saie, you haue à sonne, moch of his age: we wil deale thus     togither. Point you out à Scholemaster, who by your order,     shall teache my sonne and yours, and for all the rest, I will     prouide, yea though they three do cost me a couple of hundred     poundes by yeare: and beside, you shall finde me as fast à     Frend to you and yours, as perchance any you haue. Which     promise, the worthie Ientleman surelie kept with me, vntill his     dying daye.          We had than farther taulke togither, of bringing vp of     children: of the nature, of quicke, and hard wittes:  // The cheife     of the right choice of à good witte: of Feare, and  // pointes of     loue in teachinge children. We passed from // this booke.       178        _A Præface to the Reader._      children and came to yonge men, namely, Ientlemen: we     taulked of their to moch libertie, to liue as they lust: of their     letting louse to sone, to ouer moch experience of ill, contrarie to     the good order of many good olde common welthes of the     Persians and Grekes: of witte gathered, and good fortune     gotten, by some, onely by experience, without learning. And     lastlie, he required of me verie earnestlie, to shewe, what I     thought of the common goinge of Englishe men into Italie.     But, sayth he, bicause this place, and this tyme, will not suffer     so long taulke, as these good matters require, therefore I pray     you, at my request, and at your leysure, put in some order of     writing, the cheife pointes of this our taulke, concerning the     right order of teachinge, and honestie of liuing, for the good     bringing vp of children & yong men. And surelie, beside     contentinge me, you shall both please and profit verie many     others. I made some excuse by lacke of habilitie, and weakenes     of bodie: well, sayth he, I am not now to learne, what you can     do.  Our deare frende, good M. _Goodricke_, whose iudgement I     could well beleue, did once for all, satisfye me fullie therein.     Againe, I heard you say, not long agoe, that you may thanke     Syr _John Cheke_, for all the learninge you haue: And I know     verie well my selfe, that you did teach the Quene. And     therefore seing God did so blesse you, to make you the Scholer     of the best Master, and also the Scholemaster of the best     Scholer, that euer were in our tyme, surelie, you should please     God, benefite your countrie, & honest your owne name, if you     would take the paines, to impart to others, what you learned     of soch à Master, and how ye taught such à scholer. And, in     vttering the stuffe ye receiued of the one, in declaring the     order ye tooke with the other, ye shall neuer lacke, neither     matter, nor maner, what to write, nor how to write in this     kinde of Argument.          I beginning some farther excuse, sodeinlie was called to     cum to the Queene. The night following, I slept litle, my     head was so full of this our former taulke, and I so mindefull,     somewhat to satisfie the honest request of so deare à frend,     I thought to præpare some litle treatise for a New yeares gift     that Christmas. But, as it chanceth to busie builders, so, in     building thys my poore Scholehouse (the rather bicause the forme     of it is somewhat new, and differing from others) the worke       _A Præf ace to the Reader._         179      rose dailie higher and wider, than I thought it would at the     beginninge.          And though it appeare now, and be in verie deede, but a     small cotage, poore for the stuffe, and rude for the workemanship,     yet in going forward, I found the site so good, as I was lothe to     giue it ouer, but the making so costlie, outreaching my habilitie,     as many tymes I wished, that some one of those three, my deare     frendes, with full pursses, Syr _Tho. Smithe_, M. // {_Smith._     _Haddon_, or M. _Watson_, had had the doing of it. // M. {_Haddon._     Yet, neuerthelesse, I my selfe, spending gladlie // {_Watson._     that litle, that I gatte at home by good Syr _Iohn_ // Syr_ I._     _Cheke_, and that that I borrowed abroad of my // _Cheke._     frend _Sturmius_, beside somewhat that was left me // _I. Sturmius._     in Reuersion by my olde Masters, _Plato, Aristotle_, // _Plato._     and _Cicero_, I haue at last patched it vp, as I could, // _Aristotle._     and as you see. If the matter be meane, and meanly handled, // _Cicero._     I pray you beare, both with me, and it: for neuer worke went     vp in worse wether, with mo lettes and stoppes, than this poore     Scholehouse of mine. Westminster Hall can beare some     witnesse, beside moch weakenes of bodie, but more trouble of     minde, by some such sores, as greue me to toche them my     selfe, and therefore I purpose not to open them to others.     And, in middes of outward iniuries, and inward cares, to     encrease them withall, good Syr _Rich. Sackuile_     dieth, that worthie Ientleman: That earnest // Syr _R._     fauorer and furtherer of Gods true Religion: // _Sackuill._     That faithfull Seruitor to his Prince and Countrie: A louer of     learning, & all learned men: Wise in all doinges: Curtesse to     all persons: shewing spite to none: doing good to many: and as     I well found, to me so fast à frend, as I neuer lost the like     before. Whan he was gone, my hart was dead. There was     not one, that woare à blacke gowne for him, who caried à     heuier hart for him, than I. Whan he was gone, I cast this     booke àwaie: I could not looke vpon it, but with weping eyes,     in remembring him, who was the onelie setter on, to do it, and     would haue bene, not onelie à glad commender of it, but also     à sure and certaine comfort, to me and mine, for it. Almost     two yeares togither, this booke lay scattered, and neglected,     and had bene quite giuen ouer of me, if the goodnesse of one     had not giuen me some life and spirite againe. God, the      180        _A Præface to the Reader._      mouer of goodnesse, prosper alwaies him & his, as he hath     many times comforted me and mine, and, I trust to God, shall     comfort more and more. Of whom, most iustlie I may saie,     and verie oft, and alwaies gladlie, I am wont to say, that     sweete verse of _Sophocles_, spoken by _Oedipus_ to worthie _Theseus_.      Soph. in // echo [gar] acho dia se, kouk allon broton.     Oed. Col. //      Thys hope hath helped me to end this booke: which, if he     allowe, I shall thinke my labours well imployed, and shall not     moch æsteme the misliking of any others. And I trust, he     shall thinke the better of it, bicause he shall finde the best part     thereof, to cum out of his Schole, whom he, of all men loued     and liked best.          Yet some men, frendly enough of nature, but of small     iudgement in learninge, do thinke, I take to moch paines, and     _Plato_ in // spend to moch time, in settinge forth these     initio // childrens affaires.   But those good men were     Theagis. //  neuer brought vp in _Socrates_ Schole, who saith     ou gar esti //  plainlie, that no man goeth àbout à more godlie     peri otou //  purpose, than he that is mindfull of the good     theioterou // bringing vp, both of hys owne, and other mens     anthropos // children.     an bouleu- //     saito, e //       Therfore, I trust, good and wise men, will     peri pai-  // thinke well of this my doing. And of other, that     deias, kai // thinke otherwise, I will thinke my selfe, they are     ton auton, // but men, to be pardoned for their follie, and     kai ton // pitied for their ignoraunce.     oikeion. //          In writing this booke, I haue had earnest respecte to three     speciall pointes, trothe of Religion, honestie in liuing, right order     in learning. In which three waies, I praie God, my poore     children may diligently waulke: for whose sake, as nature     moued, and reason required, and necessitie also somewhat     compelled, I was the willinger to take these paines.          For, seing at my death, I am not like to leaue them any     great store of liuing, therefore in my life time, I thought good     to bequeath vnto them, in this litle booke, as in my Will and     Testament, the right waie to good learning: which if they     followe, with the feare of God, they shall verie well cum to     sufficiencie of liuinge.          I wishe also, with all my hart, that yong M. _Rob. Sackuille_,       _A Præface to the Reader._        181      may take that fructe of this labor, that his worthie Grauntfather     purposed he should haue done: And if any other do take, either     proffet, or pleasure hereby, they haue cause to thanke M.     _Robert Sackuille_, for whom speciallie this my Scholemaster was     prouided.          And one thing I would haue the Reader consider in     readinge this booke, that bicause, no Scholemaster hath charge     of any childe, before he enter into hys Schole, therefore I     leauing all former care, of their good bringing vp, to wise and     good Parentes, as à matter not belonging to the Scholemaster,     I do appoynt thys my Scholemaster, than, and there to begin,     where his office and charge beginneth. Which charge lasteth     not long, but vntill the Scholer be made hable to go to the     Vniuersitie, to procede in Logike, Rhetoricke, and other kindes     of learning.          Yet if my Scholemaster, for loue he beareth to hys     Scholer, shall teach hym somewhat for hys furtherance,     and better iudgement in learning, that may serue     him seuen yeare after in the Vniuersitie, he     doth hys Scholer no more wrong, nor de-     serueth no worse name therby, than he     doth in London, who sellinge silke     or cloth vnto his frend, doth     giue hym better measure,     than either hys pro-     mise or bargaine     was.                               _Farewell in Christ._       _The first booke for the youth._      AFter the childe hath learned perfitlie the eight partes of     speach, let him then learne the right ioyning togither of     substantiues with adiectiues, the nowne with the verbe, the     relatiue with the antecedent.  And in learninge farther hys     Syntaxis, by mine aduice, he shall not vse the common order     in common scholes, for making of latines: wherby, the childe     _Cic._ de // commonlie learneth, first, an euill choice of wordes,     Cla. or. // (and right choice of wordes, saith _Cæsar_, is the     foundation of eloquence) than, a wrong placing     of wordes: and lastlie, an ill framing of the sentence, with     a peruerse iudgement, both of wordes and sentences.  These     Making of // faultes, taking once roote in yougthe, be neuer, or     Lattines // hardlie, pluckt away in age.  Moreouer, there is     marreth // no one thing, that hath more, either dulled the     Children. // wittes, or taken awaye the will of children from     learning, then the care they haue, to satisfie their masters, in     making of latines.          For, the scholer, is commonlie beat for the making, when     the master were more worthie to be beat for the mending, or     rather, marring of the same: The master many times, being     as ignorant as the childe, what to saie properlie and fitlie to the     matter.          Two scholemasters haue set forth in print, either of them     _Horman._ // a booke, of soch kinde of latines, _Horman_ and     _Whitting-_ // _Whittington_.     _ton._ //          A childe shall learne of the better of them,     that, which an other daie, if he be wise, and cum to iudgement,     he must be faine to vnlearne againe.       _The first booke for the youth._     183           There is a waie, touched in the first booke of _Cicero     De Oratore_, which, wiselie brought into scholes, // 1. _De Or._     truely taught, and constantly vsed, would not     onely take wholly away this butcherlie feare in making of     latines, but would also, with ease and pleasure, and in short     time, as I know by good experience, worke a true choice and     placing of wordes, a right ordering of sentences, an easie     vnderstandyng of the tonge, a readines to speake, a facultie to     write, a true iudgement, both of his owne, and other mens     doinges, what tonge so euer he doth vse.          The waie is this.  After the three Concordances learned,     as I touched before, let the master read vnto hym the Epistles     of _Cicero_, gathered togither and chosen out by _Sturmius_, for     the capacitie of children.          First, let him teach the childe, cherefullie and plainlie, the     cause, and matter of the letter: then, let him     construe it into Englishe, so oft, as the childe may // The order     easilie carie awaie the vnderstanding of it: // of teaching.     Lastlie, parse it ouer perfitlie.  This done thus, let the childe,     by and by, both construe and parse it ouer againe: so, that it     may appeare, that the childe douteth in nothing, that his     master taught him before.  After this, the childe must take     a paper booke, and sitting in some place, where no man shall     prompe him, by him self, let him translate into Englishe his     former lesson.  Then shewing it to his master,     let the master take from him his latin booke, and // Two pa-     pausing an houre, at the least, than let the childe // per bokes.     translate his owne Englishe into latin againe, in an other paper     booke.  When the childe bringeth it, turned into latin, the     master must compare it with _Tullies_ booke, and laie them both     togither: and where the childe doth well, either in chosing, or     true placing of _Tullies_ wordes, let the master // Children     praise him, and saie here ye do well.

But if the childe misse, either in forgetting a worde, or in     chaunging a good with a worse, or misordering the sentence,     I would not haue the master, either froune, or chide with him,     if the childe haue done his diligence, and vsed no trewandship       184     _The first booke teachyng_      therein.  For I know by good experience, that a childe shall     Ientlenes // take more profit of two fautes, ientlie warned of,     in teaching. // then of foure thinges, rightly hitt.  For than, the     master shall haue good occasion to saie vnto him.     _N. Tullie_ would haue vsed such a worde, not this: _Tullie_     would haue placed this word here, not there: would haue vsed     this case, this number, this person, this degree, this gender: he     would haue vsed this moode, this tens, this simple, rather than     this compound: this aduerbe here, not there: he would haue     ended the sentence with this verbe, not with that nowne or     participle, etc.          In these fewe lines, I haue wrapped vp, the most tedious     part of Grammer: and also the ground of almost all the Rewles,     that are so busilie taught by the Master, and so hardlie learned     by the Scholer, in all common Scholes: which after this sort,     the master shall teach without all error, and the scholer shall     learne without great paine: the master being led by so sure     a guide, and the scholer being brought into so plaine and easie     a waie.  And therefore, we do not contemne Rewles, but we     gladlie teach Rewles: and teach them, more plainlie, sensiblie,     and orderlie, than they be commonlie taught in common     Scholes.  For whan the Master shall compare _Tullies_ booke     with his Scholers translation, let the Master, at the first,     lead and teach his Scholer, to ioyne the Rewles of his Grammer     booke, with the examples of his present lesson, vntill the     Scholer, by him selfe, be hable to fetch out of his Grammer,     euerie Rewle, for euerie Example: So, as the Grammer booke     be euer in the Scholers hand, and also vsed of him, as a     Dictionarie, for euerie present vse.  This is a liuely and perfite     waie of teaching of Rewles: where the common waie, vsed in     common Scholes, to read the Grammer alone by it selfe, is     tedious for the Master, hard for the Scholer, colde and vn-     cumfortable for them bothe.          Let your Scholer be neuer afraide, to aske you any dout,     but vse discretlie the best allurements ye can, to encorage him     to the same: lest, his ouermoch fearinge of you, driue him     to seeke some misorderlie shifte: as, to seeke to be helped     by some other booke, or to be prompted by some other     Scholer, and so goe aboute to begile you moch, and him selfe     more.       _the brynging vp of youth._     185           With this waie, of good vnderstanding the mater, plaine     construinge, diligent parsinge, dailie translatinge, cherefull     admonishinge, and heedefull amendinge of faultes: neuer     leauinge behinde iuste praise for well doinge, I would haue the     Scholer brought vp withall, till he had red, & translated ouer y^e     first booke of Epistles chosen out by _Sturmius_, with a good     peece of a Comedie of _Terence_ also.          All this while, by mine aduise, the childe shall vse to speake     no latine: For, as _Cicero_ saith in like mater, with like wordes,     _loquendo, male loqui discunt_.  And, that excellent // Latin     learned man, _G. Budæus_, in his Greeke Com- // speakyng.     mentaries, sore complaineth, that whan he began // _G. Budæus._     to learne the latin tonge, vse of speaking latin at the table, and     elsewhere, vnaduisedlie, did bring him to soch an euill choice of     wordes, to soch a crooked framing of sentences, that no one     thing did hurt or hinder him more, all the daies of his life     afterward, both for redinesse in speaking, and also good iudge-     ment in writinge.          In very deede, if children were brought vp, in soch a house,     or soch a Schole, where the latin tonge were properlie and     perfitlie spoken, as _Tib._ and _Ca. Gracci_ were brought vp, in     their mother _Cornelias_ house, surelie, than the dailie vse of     speaking, were the best and readiest waie, to learne the latin     tong.  But, now, commonlie, in the best Scholes in England,     for wordes, right choice is smallie regarded, true proprietie     whollie neglected, confusion is brought in, barbariousnesse is     bred vp so in yong wittes, as afterward they be, not onelie     marde for speaking, but also corrupted in iudgement: as with     moch adoe, or neuer at all, they be brought to right frame     againe.          Yet all men couet to haue their children speake latin: and     so do I verie earnestlie too.  We bothe, haue one purpose: we     agree in desire, we wish one end: but we differ somewhat in     order and waie, that leadeth rightlie to that end.  Other would     haue them speake at all aduentures: and, so they be speakinge,     to speake, the Master careth not, the Scholer knoweth not,     what.  This is, to seeme, and not to bee: except it be, to be     bolde without shame, rashe without skill, full of words without     witte.  I wish to haue them speake so, as it may well appeare,     that the braine doth gouerne the tonge, and that reason leadeth       186     _The first booke teachyng_      forth the taulke.  _Socrates_ doctrine is true in _Plato_, and well     _Plato._ // marked, and truely vttered by _Horace_ in _Arte_     _Horat._ // _Poetica_, that, where so euer knowledge doth accom-     panie the witte, there best vtterance doth alwaies     awaite vpon the tonge: For, good vnderstanding must first be bred     Much wri- // in the childe, which, being nurished with skill, and     tyng bree- // vse of writing (as I will teach more largelie     deth ready // hereafter) is the onelie waie to bring him to     speakyng. // iudgement and readinesse in speakinge: and that     in farre shorter time (if he followe constantlie the trade of this     litle lesson) than he shall do, by common teachinge of the     common scholes in England.          But, to go forward, as you perceiue, your scholer to goe     better and better on awaie, first, with vnderstanding his lesson     more quicklie, with parsing more readelie, with translating     more spedelie and perfitlie then he was wonte, after, giue him     longer lessons to translate: and withall, begin to teach him,     The second // both in nownes, & verbes, what is _Proprium_, and     degree and // what is _Translatum_, what _Synonymum_, what     order in // _Diuersum_, which be _Contraria_, and which be     teachyng. // most notable _Phrases_ in all his lecture.

I do gladlie agree with all good Scholemasters in these     pointes: to haue children brought to good perfitnes in learning:     to all honestie in maners: to haue all fautes rightlie amended:     to haue euerie vice seuerelie corrected: but for the order and     waie that leadeth rightlie to these pointes, we somewhat differ.

For whan the scholemaster     is angrie with some other matter, then will he sonest faul to     beate his scholer: and though he him selfe should be punished     for his folie, yet must he beate some scholer for his pleasure:     though there be no cause for him to do so, nor yet fault in the     scholer to deserue so.  These ye will say, be fond scholemasters,     and fewe they be, that be found to be soch.  They be fond in     deede, but surelie ouermany soch be found euerie where.  But     Nature // this I will say, that euen the wisest of your great     punished. // beaters, do as oft punishe nature, as they do     correcte faultes.  Yea, many times, the better     nature, is sorer punished: For, if one, by quicknes of witte,     take his lesson readelie, an other, by hardnes of witte, taketh it     not so speedelie: the first is alwaies commended, the other is     commonlie punished: whan a wise scholemaster, should rather     discretelie consider the right disposition of both their natures,     and not so moch wey what either of them is able to do now,     Quicke // as what either of them is likelie to do hereafter.     wittes for // For this I know, not onelie by reading of bookes     learnyng. // in my studie, but also by experience of life,     abrode in the world, that those, which be commonlie the     wisest, the best learned, and best men also, when they be olde,     were neuer commonlie the quickest of witte, when they were     yonge.  The causes why, amongst other, which be many, that     moue me thus to thinke, be these fewe, which I will recken.     Quicke wittes commonlie, be apte to take, vnapte to keepe:     soone hote and desirous of this and that: as colde and sone       _the brynging vp of youth._     189      wery of the same againe: more quicke to enter spedelie, than     hable to pearse farre: euen like ouer sharpe tooles, whose edges     be verie soone turned.  Soch wittes delite them selues in easie     and pleasant studies, and neuer passe farre forward in hie and     hard sciences.  And therefore the quickest wittes commonlie     may proue the best Poetes, but not the wisest Orators: readie     of tonge to speake boldlie, not deepe of iudgement, // Quicke     either for good counsell or wise writing.  Also, // wittes, for     for maners and life, quicke wittes commonlie, be,  // maners &     in desire, newfangle, in purpose, vnconstant, light // lyfe.     to promise any thing, readie to forget euery thing: both benefite     and inurie: and therby neither fast to frend, nor fearefull to foe:     inquisitiue of euery trifle, not secret in greatest affaires: bolde,     with any person: busie, in euery matter: sothing, soch as be     present: nipping any that is absent: of nature also, alwaies,     flattering their betters, enuying their equals, despising their     inferiors: and, by quicknes of witte, verie quicke and readie, to     like none so well as them selues.          Moreouer commonlie, men, very quicke of witte, be also,     verie light of conditions: and thereby, very readie of disposition,     to be caried ouer quicklie, by any light cumpanie, to any riot     and vnthriftines when they be yonge: and therfore seldome,     either honest of life, or riche in liuing, when they be olde.     For, quicke in witte, and light in maners, be either seldome     troubled, or verie sone wery, in carying a verie heuie purse.     Quicke wittes also be, in most part of all their doinges, ouer-     quicke, hastie, rashe, headie, and brainsicke.  These two last     wordes, Headie, and Brainsicke, be fitte and proper wordes,     rising naturallie of the matter, and tearmed aptlie by the     condition of ouer moch quickenes of witte.  In yougthe also     they be, readie scoffers, priuie mockers, and euer ouer light and     mery.  In aige, sone testie, very waspishe, and alwaies ouer     miserable: and yet fewe of them cum to any great aige, by     reason of their misordered life when they were yong: but     a great deale fewer of them cum to shewe any great counten-     ance, or beare any great authoritie abrode in the world, but     either liue obscurelie, men know not how, or dye obscurelie,     men marke not whan.  They be like trees, that shewe forth,     faire blossoms & broad leaues in spring time, but bring out     small and not long lasting fruite in haruest time: and that       190     _The first booke teachyng_      onelie soch, as fall, and rotte, before they be ripe, and so, neuer,     or seldome, cum to any good at all.  For this ye shall finde     most true by experience, that amongest a number of quicke     wittes in youthe, fewe be found, in the end, either verie     fortunate for them selues, or verie profitable to serue the common     wealth, but decay and vanish, men know not which way:     except a very fewe, to whom peraduenture blood and happie     parentage, may perchance purchace a long standing vpon the     stage.  The which felicitie, because it commeth by others     procuring, not by their owne deseruinge, and stand by other     mens feete, and not by their own, what owtward brag so euer     is borne by them, is in deed, of it selfe, and in wise mens eyes,     of no great estimation.          Some wittes, moderate enough by nature, be many tymes     Som sci- // marde by ouer moch studie and vse of some     ences hurt // sciences, namelie, Musicke, Arithmetick, and     mens wits, // Geometrie.  Thies sciences, as they sharpen mens     and mar // wittes ouer moch, so they change mens maners     mens ma- // ouer sore, if they be not moderatlie mingled, &     ners. //     wiselie applied to som good vse of life.

This is not onelie knowen now by common     experience, but vttered long before by wise mens Iudgement     _Galen._ // and sentence.  _Galene_ saith, moch Musick marreth     _Plato._ // mens maners: and _Plato_ hath a notable place of     the same thing in his bookes _de Rep._ well marked     also, and excellentlie translated by _Tullie_ himself.  Of this     matter, I wrote once more at large, XX. yeare a go, in my booke     of shoting: now I thought but to touch it, to proue, that ouer     moch quicknes of witte, either giuen by nature, or sharpened by     studie, doth not commonlie bring forth, eyther greatest learning,     best maners, or happiest life in the end.          Contrariewise, a witte in youth, that is not ouer dulle,     Hard wits // heauie, knottie and lumpishe, but hard, rough, and     in learning. // though somwhat staffishe, as _Tullie_ wisheth _otium,     quietum, non languidum_: and _negotium cum labore,     non cum periculo_, such a witte I say, if it be, at the first well     handled by the mother, and rightlie smothed and wrought as it       _the brynging vp of youth._     191      should, not ouerwhartlie, and against the wood, by the schole-     master, both for learning, and hole course of liuing, proueth     alwaies the best.  In woode and stone, not the softest, but     hardest, be alwaies aptest, for portrature, both fairest for pleasure,     and most durable for proffit.  Hard wittes be hard to receiue,     but sure to keepe: painefull without werinesse, hedefull without     wauering, constant without newfanglenes: bearing heauie     thinges, thoughe not lightlie, yet willinglie: entring hard     thinges, though not easelie, yet depelie, and so cum to that     perfitnes of learning in the ende, that quicke wittes, seeme in     hope, but do not in deede, or else verie seldome, // Hard wits     euer attaine vnto.  Also, for maners and life, hard // in maners     wittes commonlie, ar hardlie caried, either to // and lyfe.     desire euerie new thing, or else to meruell at euery strange     thinge: and therfore they be carefull and diligent in their own     matters, not curious and busey in other mens affaires: and so,     they becum wise them selues, and also ar counted honest by     others.  They be graue, stedfast, silent of tong, secret of hart.     Not hastie in making, but constant in keping any promise.     Not rashe in vttering, but ware in considering euery matter:     and therby, not quicke in speaking, but deepe of iudgement,     whether they write, or giue counsell in all waightie affaires.     And theis be the men, that becum in the end, both most happie     for themselues, and alwaise best estemed abrode in the world.          I haue bene longer in describing, the nature, the good or ill     successe, of the quicke and hard witte, than perchance som will     thinke, this place and matter doth require.  But // The best     my purpose was hereby, plainlie to vtter, what // wittes dri-     iniurie is offered to all learninge, & to the common // uen from     welthe also, first, by the fond father in chosing, // learnyng,     but chieflie by the lewd scholemaster in beating // to other li-     and driuing away the best natures from learning.  A childe // uyng.     that is still, silent, constant, and somewhat hard of witte, is     either neuer chosen by the father to be made a scholer, or else,     when he commeth to the schole, he is smally regarded, little     looked vnto, he lacketh teaching, he lacketh coraging, he lacketh     all thinges, onelie he neuer lacketh beating, nor any word, that     may moue him to hate learninge, nor any deed that may driue     him from learning, to any other kinde of liuing.          And when this sadde natured, and hard witted child, is bette       192     _The first booke teachyng_      from his booke, and becummeth after eyther student of     Hard wits // the common lawe, or page in the Court, or     proue best // seruingman, or bound prentice to a merchant,     in euery // or to som handiecrafte, he proueth in the ende,     kynde of // wiser, happier and many tymes honester too, than     life. // many of theis quick wittes do, by their learninge.          Learning is, both hindred and iniured to, by the ill choice     of them, that send yong scholers to the vniuersities.  Of whom     must nedes cum all our Diuines, Lawyers, and Physicions.          Thies yong scholers be chosen commonlie, as yong apples be     The ill // chosen by children, in a faire garden about _S._     choice of // _Iames_ tyde: a childe will chose a sweeting, because it     wittes for // is presentlie faire and pleasant, and refuse a Runnet,     learnyng. // because it is than grene, hard, and sowre, whan the     one, if it be eaten, doth breed, both wormes and ill humors:     the other if it stand his tyme, be ordered and kepte as it should, is     holsom of it self, and helpeth to the good digestion of other meates:     Sweetinges, will receyue wormes, rotte, and dye on the tree, and     neuer or seldom cum to the gathering for good and lasting store.          For verie greafe of harte I will not applie the similitude:     but hereby, is plainlie seen, how learning is robbed of hir best     wittes, first by the great beating, and after by the ill chosing     of scholers, to go to the vniuersities.  Whereof cummeth     partelie, that lewde and spitefull prouerbe, sounding to the     greate hurte of learning, and shame of learned men, that, the     greatest Clerkes be not the wisest men.          And though I, in all this discourse, seem plainlie to prefer,     hard and roughe wittes, before quicke and light wittes, both for     learnyng and maners, yet am I not ignorant that som quicknes     of witte, is a singuler gifte of God, and so most rare emonges     men, and namelie such a witte, as is quicke without lightnes,     sharpe without brittlenes, desirous of good thinges without     newfanglenes, diligent in painfull thinges without werisomnes,     and constant in good will to do all thinges well, as I know was     in Syr _Iohn Cheke_, and is in som, that yet liue, in whome all     theis faire qualities of witte ar fullie mette togither.          But it is notable and trewe, that _Socrates_ saith in _Plato_ to     _Plato in_ // his frende _Crito_.  That, that number of men is     _Critone_. // fewest, which far excede, either in good or ill, in     wisdom of folie, but the meane betwixt both, be       _the brynging vp of youth._     193      the greatest number: which he proueth trewe in diuerse other     thinges: as in greyhoundes, emonges which fewe // Verie     are found, exceding greate, or exceding litle, // good, or     exceding swift, or exceding slowe: And therfore/ verie ill     I speaking of quick and hard wittes, I ment, the // men, be     common number of quicke and hard wittes, // fewest in     emonges the which, for the most parte, the hard // number.     witte, proueth manie times, the better learned, wiser and     honester man: and therfore, do I the more lament, that soch     wittes commonlie be either kepte from learning, by fond fathers,     or bet from learning by lewde scholemasters.

But concerning the trewe notes of the best wittes for     learning in a childe, I will reporte, not myne own opinion, but     the very iudgement of him, that was counted the best teacher     and wisest man that learning maketh mention of, // _Plato_ in 7.     and that is _Socrates_ in _Plato_, who expresseth // de Rep.     orderlie thies seuen plaine notes to choise a good     witte in a child for learninge.       194     _The first booke teachyng_                           {1  Euphues.                          {2  Mnemon.

And bicause I write English, and to Englishemen, I will     plainlie declare in Englishe both, what thies wordes of _Plato_     meane, and how aptlie they be linked, and how orderlie they     folow one an other.      1.

And how can a cumlie bodie be better employed,     than to serue the fairest exercise of Goddes greatest gifte,     and that is learning.  But commonlie, the fairest bodies,     ar bestowed on the foulest purposes.  I would it were not so:     and with examples herein I will not medle: yet I wishe, that       _the brynging vp of youth._     195      those shold, both mynde it, & medle with it, which haue most     occasion to looke to it, as good and wise fathers shold do, and     greatest authoritie to amend it, as good & wise magistrates     ought to do: And yet I will not let, openlie to lament the     vnfortunate case of learning herein.          For, if a father haue foure sonnes, three faire and well     formed both mynde and bodie, the fourth, // Deformed     wretched, lame, and deformed, his choice shalbe, // creatures     to put the worst to learning, as one good enoughe // commonlie     to becum a scholer.

And thus moch of the first note.      2  Mnemon.           Good of memorie, a speciall parte of the first note euphues,     and a mere benefite of nature: yet it is so // Memorie.     necessarie for learning, as _Plato_ maketh it a     separate and perfite note of it selfe, and that so principall a note,     as without it, all other giftes of nature do small seruice to     learning.  _Afranius_, that olde Latine Poete maketh // _Aul. Gel._     Memorie the mother of learning and wisedome,     saying thus.          _Vsus me genuit, Mater peperit memoria_, and though it be the     mere gifte of nature, yet is memorie well preserued by vse, and     moch encreased by order, as our scholer must // Three sure     learne an other day in the Vniuersitie: but in // signs of a     a childe, a good memorie is well known, by three // good me-     properties: that is, if it be, quicke in receyuing, // morie.     sure in keping, and redie in deliuering forthe againe.      3  Philomathes.           Giuen to loue learning: for though a child haue all the     giftes of nature at wishe, and perfection of memorie at wil, yet     if he haue not a speciall loue to learning, he shall neuer attaine     to moch learning.  And therfore _Isocrates_, one of the noblest       196     _The first booke teachyng_      scholemasters, that is in memorie of learning, who taught     Kinges and Princes, as _Halicarnassæus_ writeth, and out of     whose schole, as _Tullie_ saith, came forth, mo noble Capitanes,     mo wise Councelors, than did out of _Epeius_ horse at _Troie_.     This _Isocrates_, I say, did cause to be written, at the entrie of his     schole, in golden letters, this golden sentence, ean es philomathes,     ese polymathes which excellentlie said in _Greeke_, is thus rudelie     in Englishe, if thou louest learning, thou shalt attayne to moch     learning.      4.  Philoponos.           Is he, that hath a lust to labor, and a will to take paines.     For, if a childe haue all the benefites of nature, with perfection     of memorie, loue, like, & praise learning neuer so moch, yet     if he be not of him selfe painfull, he shall neuer attayne vnto it.     And yet where loue is present, labor is seldom absent, and     namelie in studie of learning, and matters of the mynde: and     therfore did _Isocrates_ rightlie iudge, that if his scholer were     philomathes he cared for no more.  _Aristotle_, variing from     _Isocrates_ in priuate affaires of life, but agreing with _Isocrates_ in     common iudgement of learning, for loue and labor in learning,     is of the same opinion, vttered in these wordes, in his Rhetorike     2 Rhet. ad // _ad Theodecten_.  Libertie kindleth loue: Loue     Theod. // refuseth no labor: and labor obteyneth what so     euer it seeketh.  And yet neuerthelesse, Goodnes     of nature may do little good: Perfection of memorie, may     serue to small vse: All loue may be employed in vayne: Any     labor may be sone graualed, if a man trust alwaies to his own     singuler witte, and will not be glad somtyme to heare, take     aduise, and learne of an other: And therfore doth _Socrates_     very notablie adde the fifte note.      5.  Philekoos.           He, that is glad to heare and learne of an other.  For     otherwise, he shall sticke with great troble, where he might     go easelie forwarde: and also catche hardlie a verie litle by his     owne toyle, whan he might gather quicklie a good deale, by an     nothers mans teaching.  But now there be some, that haue     great loue to learning, good lust to labor, be willing to learne of     others, yet, either of a fonde shamefastnes, or else of a proud       _the brynging vp of youth._     197      folie, they dare not, or will not, go to learne of an nother: And     therfore doth _Socrates_ wiselie adde the sixte note of a good witte     in a childe for learning, and that is.      6.  Zetetikos.           He, that is naturallie bold to aske any question, desirous to     searche out any doute, not ashamed to learne of the meanest,     not affraide to go to the greatest, vntill he be perfitelie taught,     and fullie satisfiede.  The seuenth and last poynte is.      7.  Philepainos.           He, that loueth to be praised for well doing, at his father,     or masters hand.  A childe of this nature, will earnestlie loue     learnyng, gladlie labor for learning, willinglie learne of other,     boldlie aske any doute.  And thus, by _Socrates_ iudgement, a     good father, and a wise scholemaster, shold chose a childe to     make a scholer of, that hath by nature, the foresayd perfite     qualities, and cumlie furniture, both of mynde and bodie: hath     memorie, quicke to receyue, sure to keape, and readie to deliuer:     hath loue to learning: hath lust to labor: hath desire to learne     of others: hath boldnes to aske any question: hath mynde holie     bent, to wynne praise by well doing.          The two firste poyntes be speciall benefites of nature:     which neuerthelesse, be well preserued, and moch encreased by     good order.  But as for the fiue laste, loue, labor, gladnes to     learne of others, boldnes to aske doutes, and will to wynne     praise, be wonne and maintened by the onelie wisedome and     discretion of the scholemaster.  Which fiue poyntes, whether a     scholemaster shall worke soner in a childe, by fearefull beating,     or curtese handling, you that be wise, iudge.          Yet some men, wise in deede, but in this matter, more by     seueritie of nature, than any wisdome at all, do laugh at vs, when     we thus wishe and reason, that yong children should rather be     allured to learning by ientilnes and loue, than compelled to     learning, by beating and feare: They say, our reasons serue     onelie to breede forth talke, and passe a waie tyme, but we     neuer saw good scholemaster do so, nor neuer red of wise man     that thought so.          Yes forsothe: as wise as they be, either in other mens     opinion, or in their owne conceite, I will bring the contrarie       198     _The first booke teachyng_      iudgement of him, who, they them selues shall confesse, was as     wise as they are, or else they may be iustlie thought to haue     small witte at all: and that is _Socrates_, whose iudgement in     _Plato_ in 7. // _Plato_ is plainlie this in these wordes: which,     de Rep. // bicause they be verie notable, I will recite them     in his owne tong, ouden mathema meta douleias     chre manthanein: oi men gar tou somatos ponoi bia ponoumenoi     cheiron ouden to soma apergazontai; psyche de, biaion ouden     emmonon mathema: in Englishe thus, No learning ought to be     learned with bondage: For bodelie labors, wrought by compul-     sion, hurt not the bodie: but any learning learned by compulsion,     tarieth not long in the mynde: And why?  For what soeuer the     mynde doth learne vnwillinglie with feare, the same it doth     quicklie forget without care.  And lest proude wittes, that loue     not to be contraryed, but haue lust to wrangle or trifle away     troth, will say, that _Socrates_ meaneth not this of childrens     teaching, but of som other higher learnyng, heare, what     _Socrates_ in the same place doth more plainlie say: me toinyn     bia, o ariste, tous paidas en tois mathemasin, alla     paizontas trephe, that is to say, and therfore, my deare frend,     bring not vp your children in learning by compulsion and feare,     but by playing and pleasure.  And you, that do read _Plato_, as     The right // ye shold, do well perceiue, that these be no     readyng of // Questions asked by _Socrates_, as doutes, but they     _Plato_. // be Sentences, first affirmed by _Socrates_, as mere     trothes, and after, giuen forth by _Socrates_, as right Rules, most     necessarie to be marked, and fitte to be folowed of all them,     that would haue children taughte, as they should.  And in this     counsell, iudgement, and authoritie of _Socrates_ I will repose     my selfe, vntill I meete with a man of the contrarie mynde,     whom I may iustlie take to be wiser, than I thinke _Socrates_     Yong Ien- // was.  Fonde scholemasters, neither can vnder-     tlemen, be // stand, nor will folow this good counsell of _Socrates_,     wiselier // but wise ryders, in their office, can and will do     taught to // both: which is the onelie cause, that commonly,     ryde, by com- // the yong ientlemen of England, go so vnwillinglie     mon ry- // to schole, and run so fast to the stable: For in     ders, than // verie deede fond scholemasters, by feare, do     to learne, // beate into them, the hatred of learning, and wise     by common // riders, by ientle allurements, do breed vp in     Schole- //     masters. //       _the brynging vp of youth._     199      them, the loue of riding.  They finde feare, & bondage in     scholes, They feele libertie and freedome in stables: which     causeth them, vtterlie to abhore the one, and most gladlie to     haunt the other.  And I do not write this, that in exhorting to     the one, I would dissuade yong ientlemen from the other: yea     I am sorie, with all my harte, that they be giuen no more to     riding, then they be: For, of all outward qualities, // Ryding.     to ride faire, is most cumelie for him selfe, most     necessarie for his contrey, and the greater he is in blood, the     greater is his praise, the more he doth excede all other therein.     It was one of the three excellent praises, amongest the noble     ientlemen the old _Percians_, Alwaise to say troth, to ride faire,     and shote well: and so it was engrauen vpon _Darius_ tumbe, as     _Strabo_ beareth witnesse. // Strabo. 15.           _Darius the king, lieth buried here,             Who in riding and shoting had neuer peare._           But, to our purpose, yong men, by any meanes, leesing the     loue of learning, whan by tyme they cum to their owne rule,     they carie commonlie, from the schole with them, a perpetuall     hatred of their master, and a continuall contempt of learning.     If ten Ientlemen be asked, why they forget so sone in Court,     that which they were learning so long in schole, eight of them,     or let me be blamed, will laie the fault on their ill handling, by     their scholemasters.          _Cuspinian_ doth report, that, that noble Emperor _Maxi-     milian_, would lament verie oft, his misfortune herein.          Yet, some will say, that children of nature, loue pastime,     and mislike learning: bicause, in their kinde, the // Pastime.     one is easie and pleasant, the other hard and     werisom: which is an opinion not so trewe, as // Learnyng.     some men weene: For, the matter lieth not so much in the     disposition of them that be yong, as in the order & maner of     bringing vp, by them that be old, nor yet in the difference of     learnyng and pastime.  For, beate a child, if he daunce not well,     & cherish him, though he learne not well, ye shall haue him,     vnwilling to go to daunce, & glad to go to his booke.  Knocke     him alwaies, when he draweth his shaft ill, and fauor him     againe, though he faut at his booke, ye shall haue hym verie     loth to be in the field, and verie willing to be in the schole.       200     _The first booke teachyng_      Yea, I saie more, and not of my selfe, but by the iudgement of     those, from whom few wisemen will gladlie dissent, that if euer     the nature of man be giuen at any tyme, more than other, to     receiue goodnes, it is in innocencie of yong yeares, before, that     experience of euill, haue taken roote in hym.  For, the pure     cleane witte of a sweete yong babe, is like the newest wax,     most hable to receiue the best and fayrest printing: and like a     new bright siluer dishe neuer occupied, to receiue and kepe     cleane, anie good thyng that is put into it.          And thus, will in children, wiselie wrought withall, maie     Will.  }                   | // easelie be won to be verie well willing to               }in Children.| // learne.  And witte in children, by nature,     Witte.}                   | // namelie memorie, the onelie keie and keper of     all learning, is readiest to receiue, and surest to kepe anie maner     of thing, that is learned in yougth: This, lewde and learned, by     common experience, know to be most trewe.  For we remember     nothyng so well when we be olde, as those things which we     learned when we were yong: And this is not straunge, but     Yong yeares // common in all natures workes.  Euery man sees,     aptest for // (as I sayd before) new wax is best for printyng:     learnyng. // new claie, fittest for working: new shorne woll,     aptest for sone and surest dying: new fresh flesh, for good and     durable salting.  And this similitude is not rude, nor borowed     of the larder house, but out of his scholehouse, of whom, the     wisest of England, neede not be ashamed to learne.  Yong     Graftes grow not onelie sonest, but also fairest, and bring alwayes     forth the best and sweetest frute: yong whelpes learne easelie     to carie: yong Popingeis learne quicklie to speake: And so, to     be short, if in all other thinges, though they lacke reason, sens,     and life, the similitude of youth is fittest to all goodnesse,     surelie nature, in mankinde, is most beneficiall and effectuall in     this behalfe.          Therfore, if to the goodnes of nature, be ioyned the     wisedome of the teacher, in leading yong wittes into a right and     plaine waie of learnyng, surelie, children, kept vp in Gods feare,     and gouerned by his grace, maie most easelie be brought well to     serue God and contrey both by vertue and wisedome.          But if will, and witte, by farder age, be once allured from     innocencie, delited in vaine sightes, filed with foull taulke,     crooked with wilfulnesse, hardned with stubburnesse, and let       _the brynging vp of youth._     201      louse to disobedience, surelie it is hard with ientlenesse, but     vnpossible with seuere crueltie, to call them backe to good     frame againe.  For, where the one, perchance maie bend it,     the other shall surelie breake it: and so in stead of some hope,     leaue an assured desperation, and shamelesse con- // _Xen._ 1. _Cy-_     tempt of all goodnesse, the fardest pointe in all // _ri Pæd._     mischief, as _Xenophon_ doth most trewlie and most     wittelie marke.          Therfore, to loue or to hate, to like or contemne, to plie     this waie or that waie to good or to bad, ye shall haue as ye vse     a child in his youth.          And one example, whether loue or feare doth worke more     in a child, for vertue and learning, I will gladlie report: which     maie be hard with some pleasure, and folowed with more profit.     Before I went into _Germanie_, I came to Brodegate in Leceter-     shire, to take my leaue of that noble Ladie _Iane     Grey_, to whom I was exceding moch beholdinge. // _Lady Iane_     Hir parentes, the Duke and Duches, with all the // _Grey._     houshould, Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, were huntinge in the     Parke: I founde her, in her Chamber, readinge _Phædon Platonis_     in Greeke, and that with as moch delite, as som ientleman wold     read a merie tale in _Bocase_.  After salutation, and dewtie done,     with som other taulke, I asked hir, whie she wold leese soch     pastime in the Parke? smiling she answered me: I wisse, all     their sporte in the Parke is but a shadoe to that pleasure, that I     find in _Plato_: Alas good folke, they neuer felt, what trewe     pleasure ment.  And howe came you Madame, quoth I, to this     deepe knowledge of pleasure, and what did chieflie allure you     vnto it: seinge, not many women, but verie fewe men haue     atteined thereunto.  I will tell you, quoth she, and tell you     a troth, which perchance ye will meruell at.  One of the     greatest benefites, that euer God gaue me, is, that he sent me     so sharpe and seuere Parentes, and so ientle a scholemaster.     For when I am in presence either of father or mother, whether     I speake, kepe silence, sit, stand, or go, eate, drinke, be merie,     or sad, be sowyng, plaiyng, dauncing, or doing anie thing els,     I must do it, as it were, in soch weight, mesure, and number,     euen so perfitelie, as God made the world, or else I am so     sharplie taunted, so cruellie threatened, yea presentlie some     tymes, with pinches, nippes, and bobbes, and other waies, which       202     _The first booke teachyng_      I will not name, for the honor I beare them, so without     measure misordered, that I thinke my selfe in hell, till tyme     cum, that I must go to _M. Elmer_, who teacheth me so ientlie,     so pleasantlie, with soch faire allurementes to learning, that I     thinke all the tyme nothing, whiles I am with him.  And     when I am called from him, I fall on weeping, because, what     soeuer I do els, but learning, is ful of grief, trouble, feare, and     whole misliking vnto me: And thus my booke, hath bene so     moch my pleasure, & bringeth dayly to me more pleasure &     more, that in respect of it, all other pleasures, in very deede, be     but trifles and troubles vnto me.  I remember this talke gladly,     both bicause it is so worthy of memorie, & bicause also, it was     the last talke that euer I had, and the last tyme, that euer I     saw that noble and worthie Ladie.          I could be ouer long, both in shewinge iust causes, and in     recitinge trewe examples, why learning shold be taught, rather     by loue than feare.  He that wold see a perfite discourse of it,     _Sturmius_ // let him read that learned treatese, which my frende     de Inst. // _Ioan. Sturmius_ wrote _de institutione Principis_, to     Princ. // the Duke of _Cleues_.          The godlie counsels of _Salomon_ and _Iesus_ the sonne of     Qui par- // _Sirach_, for sharpe kepinge in, and bridleinge of     cit virgæ, // youth, are ment rather, for fatherlie correction,     odit filium. // then masterlie beating, rather for maners, than for     learninge: for other places, than for scholes.  For God forbid,     but all euill touches, wantonnes, lyinge, pickinge, slouthe, will,     stubburnnesse, and disobedience, shold be with sharpe chastise-     ment, daily cut away.          This discipline was well knowen, and diligentlie vsed,     among the _Græcians_, and old _Romanes_, as doth appeare in     _Aristophanes, Isocrates_, and _Plato_, and also in the Comedies of     _Plautus_: where we see that children were vnder the rule of     three persones: _Præceptore, Pædagogo, Parente_: the scholemaster     1. Schole- // taught him learnyng with all ientlenes: the          master. // Gouernour corrected his maners, with moch     2.

But what shall we saie, whan     now in our dayes, the scholemaster is vsed, both for _Præceptor_       _the brynging vp of youth._     203      in learnyng, and _Pædagogus_ in maners.  Surelie, I wold he     shold not confound their offices, but discretelie vse the dewtie     of both so, that neither ill touches shold be left vnpunished, nor     ientlesse in teaching anie wise omitted.  And he shall well do     both, if wiselie he do appointe diuersitie of tyme, & separate     place, for either purpose: vsing alwaise soch discrete modera-     tion as the scholehouse should be counted a     sanctuarie against feare: and verie well learning, a // The schole     common perdon for ill doing, if the fault, of it // house.     selfe be not ouer heinous.          And thus the children, kept vp in Gods feare, and preserued     by his grace, finding paine in ill doing, and pleasure in well     studiyng, shold easelie be brought to honestie of life, and     perfitenes of learning, the onelie marke, that good and wise     fathers do wishe and labour, that their children, shold most     buselie, and carefullie shot at.          There is an other discommoditie, besides crueltie in schole-     masters in beating away the loue of learning from // Youth of     children, which hindreth learning and vertue, and // England     good bringing vp of youth, and namelie yong // brought vp     ientlemen, verie moch in England.  This fault // with to     is cleane contrary to the first.  I wished before, // much li-     to haue loue of learning bred vp in children: // bertie.     I wishe as moch now, to haue yong men brought vp in good     order of liuing, and in some more seuere discipline, then     commonlie they be.  We haue lacke in England of soch good     order, as the old noble _Persians_ so carefullie vsed: // _Xen._ 7.     whose children, to the age of xxi. yeare, were // _Cyri Ped._     brought vp in learnyng, and exercises of labor,     and that in soch place, where they should, neither see that was     vncumlie, nor heare that was vnhonest.  Yea, a yong ientleman     was neuer free, to go where he would, and do what he liste him     self, but vnder the kepe, and by the counsell, of some graue     gouernour, vntill he was, either maryed, or cald to beare some     office in the common wealth.          And see the great obedience, that was vsed in old tyme to     fathers and gouernours.  No sonne, were he neuer so old of     yeares, neuer so great of birth, though he were a kynges sonne,     might not mary, but by his father and mothers also consent.     _Cyrus_ the great, after he had conquered _Babylon_, and subdewed       204  _The first booke teachyng_      Riche king _Crœsus_ with whole _Asia minor_, cummyng tryumph-     antlie home, his vncle _Cyaxeris_ offered him his daughter to     wife.  _Cyrus_ thanked his vncle, and praised the maide, but for     mariage he answered him with thies wise and sweete wordes, as     _Xen._ 8. _Cy-_ // they be vttered by _Xenophon_, o kuazare, to     _ri. Pæd._ // te genos epaino, kai ten paida, kai dora     boulomai de, ephe, syn te tou patros gnome     kai [te] tes metros tauta soi synainesai, &c., that is to say:     Vncle _Cyaxeris_, I commend the stocke, I like the maide, and     I allow well the dowrie, but (sayth he) by the counsell and     consent of my father and mother, I will determine farther of     thies matters.          Strong _Samson_ also in Scripture saw a maide that liked him,     but he spake not to hir, but went home to his father, and his     mother, and desired both father and mother to make the     mariage for him.  Doth this modestie, doth this obedience,     that was in great kyng _Cyrus_, and stoute _Samson_, remaine in     our yongmen at this daie? no surelie: For we liue not     longer after them by tyme, than we liue farre different from     them by good order.  Our tyme is so farre from that old     discipline and obedience, as now, not onelie yong ientlemen, but     euen verie girles dare without all feare, though not without     open shame, where they list, and how they list, marie them     selues in spite of father, mother, God, good order, and all.     The cause of this euill is, that youth is least looked vnto, when     they stand [in] most neede of good kepe and regard.  It auail-     eth not, to see them well taught in yong yeares, and after whan     they cum to lust and youthfull dayes, to giue them licence to     liue as they lust them selues.  For, if ye suffer the eye of a     yong Ientleman, once to be entangled with vaine sightes, and     the eare to be corrupted with fond or filthie taulke, the mynde     shall quicklie fall seick, and sone vomet and cast vp, all the     holesome doctrine, that he receiued in childhoode, though he     were neuer so well brought vp before.  And being ons inglutted     with vanitie, he will streight way loth all learning, and all good     counsell to the same.  And the parents for all their great cost     Great mens // and charge, reape onelie in the end, the frute     sonnes // of grief and care.     worst //       This euill, is not common to poore men, as God     brought // will haue it, but proper to riche and great mens     vp. //       _the brynging vp of youth._     205      children, as they deserue it.  In deede from seuen, to seuentene,     yong ientlemen commonlie be carefullie enough brought vp: But     from seuentene to seuen and twentie (the most dangerous tyme of     all a mans life, and most slipperie to stay well in) they haue     commonlie the reigne of all licens in their owne // Wise men     hand, and speciallie soch as do liue in the Court. // fond fa-     And that which is most to be merueled at, // thers.     commonlie, the wisest and also best men, be found the fondest     fathers in this behalfe.  And if som good father would seick     some remedie herein, yet the mother (if the house hold of our     Lady) had rather, yea, & will to, haue her sonne cunnyng &     bold, in making him to lyue trimlie when he is yong, than by     learning and trauell, to be able to serue his Prince and his     contrie, both wiselie in peace, and stoutelie in warre, whan he     is old.          The fault is in your selues, ye noble mens sonnes, and     therefore ye deserue the greater blame, that // Meane     commonlie, the meaner mens children, cum to // mens sonnes     be, the wisest councellours, and greatest doers, // come to     in the weightie affaires of this Realme.  And // great au-     why? for God will haue it so, of his prouidence: // thoritie.     bicause ye will haue it no otherwise, by your negligence.

For wisedom, and vertue, there be manie faire examples in     this Court, for yong Ientlemen to folow.  But they be, like     faire markes in the feild, out of a mans reach, to far of, to shote     at well.  The best and worthiest men, in deede, be somtimes     seen, but seldom taulked withall: A yong Ientleman, may     somtime knele to their person, smallie vse their companie, for     their better instruction.          But yong Ientlemen ar faïne commonlie to do in the Court,     as yong Archers do in the feild: that is take soch markes, as be     Ill compa- // nie them, although they be neuer so foule to     nie marreth // shote at.

But error and phantasie, do commonlie occupie, the place     of troth and iudgement.  For, if a yong ientleman, be demeure     and still of nature, they say, he is simple and lacketh witte: if     he be bashefull, and will soone blushe, they call him a babishe     _Xen. in_ 1. // and ill brought vp thyng, when _Xenophon_ doth     _Cyr.

But if ye would know, what grace they meene, go, and     looke, and learn emonges them, and ye shall see that it is:     First, to blush at nothing.  And blushyng in youth, sayth     _Aristotle_ is nothyng els, but feare to do ill: which feare beyng     once lustely fraid away from youth, then foloweth, // Grace of     to dare do any mischief, to contemne stoutly any // Courte.     goodnesse, to be busie in euery matter, to be     skilfull in euery thyng, to acknowledge no ignorance at all.

Meane men haue eies to see, and cause to lament, and     occasion to complaine of thies miseries: but other haue     authoritie to remedie them, and will do so to, whan God shall     think time fitte.  For, all thies misorders, be Goddes iuste     plages, by his sufferance, brought iustelie vpon vs, for our     sinnes, which be infinite in nomber, and horrible in deede, but     namelie, for the greate abhominable sin of vn- // Contempt     kindnesse: but what vnkindnesse? euen such // of Gods     vnkindnesse as was in the Iewes, in contemninge // trewe Re-     Goddes voice, in shrinking from his woorde, in // ligion.     wishing backe againe for _ægypt_, in committing aduoultrie and     hordom, not with the women, but with the doctrine of Babylon,     did bring all the plages, destructions, and Captiuities, that fell     so ofte and horriblie, vpon Israell.          We haue cause also in England to beware of vnkindnesse,     who haue had, in so fewe yeares, the Candel of Goddes     worde, so oft lightned, so oft put out, and yet // _Doctrina_     will venture by our vnthankfulnesse in doctrine // _Mores._     and sinfull life, to leese againe, lighte, Candle,     Candlesticke and all.          God kepe vs in his feare, God grafte in vs the trewe     knowledge of his woorde, with a forward will to folowe it, and     so to bring forth the sweete fruites of it, & then shall he     preserue vs by his Grace, from all maner of terrible dayes.          The remedie of this, doth not stand onelie, // _Publicæ_     in making good common lawes for the hole // _Leges._     Realme, but also, (and perchance cheiflie) // _Domestica_     in obseruing priuate discipline euerie man care- // _disciplina._     fullie in his own house: and namelie, if speciall // _Cognitio_     regard be had to yougth: and that, not so moch, // _boni._       210     _The first booke teachyng_      in teaching them what is good, as in keping them from that,     that is ill.

Here is the place, in yougthe is the time whan som     Some // ignorance is as necessarie, as moch knowledge,     ignorance, // and not in matters of our dewtie towardes God,     as good as // as som wilful wittes willinglie against their owne     knowledge. // knowledge, perniciouslie againste their owne     conscience, haue of late openlie taught.  In deede _S.

I know, _Iulianus_     _stat._ // _Apostata_ did so, but I neuer hard or red, that any     auncyent father of the primitiue chirch, either     thought or wrote so.          But this ignorance in yougthe, which I spake on, or rather     Innocency // this simplicitie, or most trewlie, this innocencie,     in youth. // is that, which the noble _Persians_, as wise _Xenophon_     doth testifie, were so carefull, to breede vp their     yougth in.  But Christian fathers commonlie do not so.  And     I will tell you a tale, as moch to be misliked, as the _Persians_     example is to be folowed.          This last somer, I was in a Ientlemans house: where     A childe ill // a yong childe, somewhat past fower yeare olde,     brought // cold in no wise frame his tongue, to saie, a litle     vp. // shorte grace: and yet he could roundlie rap out,     so manie vgle othes, and those of the newest facion, as som     good man of fourescore yeare olde hath neuer hard named     Ill Pa- // before: and that which was most detestable of     rentes. // all, his father and mother wold laughe at it.  I       _the brynging vp of youth._     211      moche doubte, what comforte, an other daie, this childe shall     bring vnto them.  This Childe vsing moche the companie of     seruinge men, and geuing good eare to their taulke, did easelie     learne, which he shall hardlie forget, all daies of his life here-     after: So likewise, in the Courte, if a yong Ientleman will     ventur him self into the companie of Ruffians, it is ouer greate     a ieopardie, lest, their facions, maners, thoughtes, taulke, and     deedes, will verie sone, be euer like.

And it maie be a great wonder, but a greater shame, to vs     Christian men, to vnderstand, what a heithen writer, _Isocrates_,     doth leaue in memorie of writing, concerning the // _Isocrates._     care, that the noble Citie of _Athens_ had, to bring     vp their yougthe, in honest companie, and vertuous discipline,     whose taulke in Greke, is, to this effect, in Englishe.          "The Citie, was not more carefull, to see their Children     "well taughte, than to see their yong men well // In Orat.     "gouerned: which they brought to passe, not so // Ariopag.     "much by common lawe, as by priuate discipline.     "For, they had more regard, that their yougthe, by good order     "shold not offend, than how, by lawe, they might be punished:     "And if offense were committed, there was, neither waie to     "hide it, neither hope of pardon for it.  Good natures, were     "not so moche openlie praised as they were secretlie marked,     "and watchfullie regarded, lest they should lease the goodnes     "they had.  Therefore in scholes of singing and dauncing, and     "other honest exercises, gouernours were appointed, more     "diligent to ouersee their good maners, than their masters were,     "to teach them anie learning.  It was som shame to a yong     "man, to be seene in the open market: and if for businesse, he     "passed throughe it, he did it, with a meruelous modestie, and     "bashefull facion.  To eate, or drinke in a Tauerne, was not     "onelie a shame, but also punishable, in a yong man.  To     "contrarie, or to stand in termes with an old man, was more     "heinous, than in som place, to rebuke and scolde with his     "owne father: with manie other mo good orders, and faire     disciplines, which I referre to their reading, that haue lust     to looke vpon the description of such a worthie common     welthe.       212     _The first booke teachyng_           And to know, what worthie frute, did spring of soch     Good sede, // worthie seade, I will tell yow the most meruell     worthie // of all, and yet soch a trothe, as no man shall     frute. // denie it, except such as be ignorant in knowledge     of the best stories.          _Athens_, by this discipline and good ordering of yougthe, did     _Athenes._ // breede vp, within the circute of that one Citie,     within the compas of one hondred yeare, within     the memorie of one mans life, so manie notable Capitaines in     warre, for worthinesse, wisdome and learning, as be scarse     Roma. // matchable no not in the state of Rome, in the     compas of those seauen hondred yeares, whan it     florished moste.
