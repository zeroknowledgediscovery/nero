Chapter One: The Arrangement

The sun scorched the dusty horizon as Avery Malone kicked the side of her stalled pickup truck, the toe of her worn boot connecting with rusted metal. "Damn thing," she muttered, sweat clinging to her temple. She pulled her hat lower against the glare of the mid-June Texas sky. Her phone had one bar of signal and a battery that blinked red.

“Figures,” she grumbled, glancing up the road that stretched out like an old ribbon, knotted and crumbling at the edges. “Could’ve at least died closer to town.”

Behind her, in the bed of the truck, boxes of her late grandmother’s china clinked against each other with every gust of wind. She’d been hauling them from Lubbock to the family ranch outside of Alton, a town so small it barely had a stoplight and only made the weather map when something burned.

The whine of tires on gravel caught her ear. She turned, shielding her eyes.

A silver Chevy Silverado pulled to a stop, engine humming like a satisfied beast. Out stepped a man in a navy ball cap and jeans that looked like they’d seen more fence posts than fashion shows.

“You alright there?” he called out, a grin hitching at the corner of his mouth. He had a smooth, lazy drawl that somehow made the heat seem even thicker.

Avery hesitated. “I’ve been better.”

He walked closer, his boots crunching the grit. “Need a tow?”

“I need a miracle.”

That made him laugh—an easy sound, genuine. He offered a hand. “Eli Callahan.”

She shook it, firm grip, calluses against calluses. “Avery Malone.”

He blinked. “Malone as in Harlan Malone?”

“My granddad, yeah. Why?”

“Guess that makes you the girl who ran off to Dallas.”

“Woman,” she corrected. “And yeah, I suppose I am.”

“Well,” Eli said, tipping his hat back, “guess that makes us neighbors. Sorta.”

**

Eli towed her truck to his family’s garage, just past the feed store and across from a diner that hadn’t changed since 1975. Avery sat on the worn leather couch in the waiting room while Eli poked around under her hood.

“So what brings you back to Alton?” he asked, wiping his hands on a rag.

“My grandma passed. I’m handling her estate.”

“Sorry to hear that.”

“She raised me,” Avery said, then added quickly, “I’m not here long. Just enough to sell the house and take care of things.”

He nodded slowly. “You’ll be gone by Fourth of July, then?”

“That’s the plan.”

Eli paused. “You seeing anyone?”

Avery blinked. “Excuse me?”

“Just... I have a weird proposition.”

She laughed, but it sounded more like a scoff. “Wow. That’s subtle.”

“No, no, it’s not like that.” Eli raised his hands. “It’s just—my ma’s been on my case. Wants me to settle down, start a family. She thinks I’m hiding someone. Truth is, I’ve just been busy. But I told her I had someone.”

“You... lied to your mom?”

“Sorta.”

“And now you need a fake girlfriend.”

“Exactly.”

Avery stared. “You want me to pretend to date you?”

“Just through the Fourth. There’s this big town barbecue and dance. She’ll calm down if she sees me with someone. You’re leaving anyway—no strings.”

Avery leaned back. “You’re insane.”

“Probably. But I’ll fix your truck for free.”

That got her attention.

“And I’ll throw in gas money.”

She raised an eyebrow. “And?”

“I’ll help you clean out your grandma’s house.”

**

Avery didn’t say yes that day. But that night, as she stared at the ceiling fan spinning above her grandmother’s guest bed, she couldn’t get the deal out of her head.

It wasn’t like she had a lot going on in Dallas. A marketing job she hated, a shoebox apartment near a bar that never closed, and a string of dates that went nowhere. Maybe it would be easier to let the town think she’d found someone, just for a few weeks. Maybe it would be a way to get closure. Or distraction. Or something.

She texted him the next morning: Fine. But you owe me pie.

**

By the following Saturday, Alton was buzzing about the town’s favorite eligible bachelor being seen with the Malone girl. They sat close at the diner—too close, if you asked Martha Jean, who never liked Avery’s family to begin with.

Eli played the part well. He was charming, attentive. He’d pull her chair out and bring her iced tea without asking. He even held her hand walking down Main Street.

“Doesn’t it feel a little... fake?” Avery whispered one afternoon as they sat on the porch swing of her grandmother’s house, sipping sweet tea.

“It’s supposed to be,” Eli replied. “But you’re not a bad fake girlfriend.”

“And you’re not a terrible fake boyfriend.”

They shared a look. A beat too long.

Then Eli cleared his throat. “So, uh. My ma wants to meet you. For real.”

Avery groaned. “This wasn’t part of the deal.”

“Technically, it was.”

She sighed. “Fine. But if she tries to marry us off, I’m blaming you.”

**

Eli’s mother was a woman of soft curls, sharp eyes, and even sharper instincts. She watched Avery with the precision of a hawk eyeing a field mouse.

“So,” she said, over casserole and cornbread, “how’d you two meet?”

Eli started to speak, but Avery interrupted. “We ran into each other by accident. Literally. My truck broke down. He rescued me.”

“Sounds like a romance novel,” she said with a tight smile.

“More like a comedy of errors,” Avery replied.

“Well, I’m glad he found someone who’ll challenge him. He needs that.”

After dinner, Eli walked her to the porch. “You’re good under pressure.”

“Your mom scares me.”

“She scares everyone.”

They laughed. And then silence fell between them like a soft fog.

“You ever think about staying?” Eli asked quietly.

Avery shook her head. “This place was never really mine.”

“But it could be.”

She didn’t answer. Didn’t know how.

**

The days passed, the town grew more convinced, and Avery found herself slipping into the role too easily. She liked the way Eli looked at her, even when no one was watching. She liked how he remembered how she took her coffee. How he called her "Red" when she wore that old flannel shirt.

It started to feel real.

Too real.

And that scared her more than anything.

Because it wasn’t supposed to.

Because she knew she couldn’t stay.

Because eventually, one of them would have to say goodbye.

And she wasn’t sure her heart was ready for that.

Not again.

Avery should have known better than to open the old cedar chest in her grandmother’s attic. The air was thick with dust, and the fan upstairs spun like it had a grudge against gravity. She knelt beside the chest, coughing as she pried open the latch and found a stack of letters bundled with blue ribbon, their corners soft and yellow with age.

She wasn’t a sentimental type, but something about the cursive handwriting and the faint scent of lavender got to her. Each letter was addressed to her grandmother—Amelia Malone—from someone named J.T. The postmarks ranged from 1958 to 1963, all sent from a place in Oklahoma she didn’t recognize. She read the first letter aloud, half under her breath.

“My dearest Amelia, I saw the way you looked at me after the town picnic. I know it can’t be, not with our families the way they are, but I swear on everything good, if you asked me to leave it all behind, I would...”

Avery exhaled sharply. “Well damn, Grandma.”

She kept reading until her eyes blurred. Her grandmother had once been someone who loved fiercely. Someone who made sacrifices. Maybe even someone who lied to protect herself. And now Avery found herself doing the same. Only she wasn’t sure who she was protecting—Eli, her own heart, or the tidy version of herself she’d built back in Dallas.

Later that afternoon, she brought the box of letters downstairs and placed it on the kitchen table. She stared at it, sipping lukewarm coffee, trying not to think about how easily a life could go from passion to secrets to silence.

She wasn’t ready to pack the letters away yet.

**

The next morning, Avery found herself at the Callahan ranch, standing awkwardly in the doorway of Eli’s barn while he adjusted a halter on a young mare. The smell of hay, sweat, and leather hit her in the chest like a memory she didn’t have. He glanced up when he heard her boots on the packed earth.

“You look like you’re here to fire me,” he said, brushing his hands on his jeans.

“I’m here because I found a bunch of letters in my grandma’s attic. Love letters.”

“That sounds like a soap opera waiting to happen.”

She held out the one on top. “They’re from someone named J.T. Ever hear of him?”

Eli squinted at the paper. “J.T.? Could be J.T. Waverly. He used to run cattle over near Brazos Fork. Died a long while back. He and your granddad had a falling out in the sixties. Nobody really talks about why.”

“Well,” Avery said, “I think I found out why.”

Eli looked at her, serious now. “What are you gonna do with them?”

“Don’t know yet. But it makes me wonder what else I don’t know about this place.”

“People got layers,” he said. “Town like this don’t let you see them all at once.”

Avery studied him. “And how many layers do you have, Eli Callahan?”

He smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Enough to keep you guessing.”

**

That night, they attended the summer movie in the park, where a big white sheet hung between two pine trees and kids ran wild with glo-sticks while their parents laid out quilts and coolers. Eli brought popcorn in a paper sack and sat close enough that his knee brushed hers.

They watched Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and about halfway through, Avery leaned over and whispered, “If we’re faking this relationship, should I pretend to like Westerns?”

“You don’t like Westerns?” he said, scandalized.

“I think they’re all just sweaty men arguing over horses.”

“That’s the most disrespectful thing I’ve ever heard,” he said, grinning.

She leaned against his shoulder anyway.

When the movie ended, they walked under the string lights back to his truck. Eli stopped halfway and turned to face her.

“You’re not faking it right now,” he said softly.

She should have denied it. Should’ve laughed, made a joke. But she didn’t.

“No,” she said. “I guess I’m not.”

He stepped closer, slow and careful. “Can I kiss you?”

She nodded, heart thudding so hard she thought maybe he could hear it.

The kiss was gentle, warm, and utterly unlike anything she expected. His hand cupped her cheek, the other at her waist, and for a moment everything else melted away—the letters, the lies, the plans to leave.

For that minute, she let herself believe.

**

The next day, Avery went into town alone. She stopped by the courthouse to start the paperwork on her grandmother’s estate, then dropped off a few donations at the church. At the coffee shop, she bumped into Janie Wilcox, who was holding her baby on one hip and nursing an iced latte in the other.

“I heard you and Eli are serious now,” Janie said without even saying hello.

“We’re... spending time together,” Avery replied carefully.

“Well,” Janie said, “some folks are saying he’s finally moving on from Leah.”

Avery froze. “Leah?”

“His high school sweetheart. They were gonna get married. She died in a car accident two years ago. Didn’t you know?”

“No,” Avery said. Her voice felt small.

Janie looked genuinely surprised. “Guess he never told you. That boy was a wreck for a long time.”

Avery walked out of the shop with her coffee untouched. The guilt settled in her stomach like a stone. She’d walked into Eli’s life thinking she could pretend, play a part. But now there were ghosts she hadn’t accounted for.

That night, she confronted him.

“You should’ve told me about Leah,” she said on his porch.

He rubbed his jaw. “Didn’t seem like your business.”

“I was pretending to be your girlfriend in front of your mother. That makes it my business.”

He looked away. “You were supposed to leave. What was I supposed to say? ‘Hi, I need you to fake-date me because the last girl I loved died in a fireball on Highway 9’?”

Avery softened. “You don’t owe me your pain, Eli. But you can’t pretend it doesn’t shape who you are.”

“I know,” he said quietly. “I just didn’t want you to see me like that.”

She reached for his hand. “Too late.”

They sat in silence, the kind that wasn’t empty but full of things unsaid. A warm breeze swept the porch, rattling the wind chimes overhead. It was the first time Avery felt like maybe this fake relationship had become something harder to walk away from than she’d ever imagined.

And that scared her more than anything else.

**

Two days before the Fourth of July, Eli’s mother invited them over for dinner again. This time, Avery helped set the table, her hands familiar now with where the good dishes were kept. They ate pulled pork and peach cobbler and drank sweet tea so strong it could strip paint.

After dessert, Eli’s mother handed Avery a box wrapped in soft paper.

“It’s nothing fancy,” she said, “but I thought you might like it.”

Inside was a necklace with a tiny horseshoe charm.

“I wore it when I was your age,” she said, eyes gleaming. “Eli’s father gave it to me when we first started courting.”

Avery nearly dropped it.

“I—thank you,” she said, swallowing hard. “It’s beautiful.”

She wore it that night as they watched the fireworks burst above the old football field, red and gold raining down like stars. Eli stood behind her, arms around her waist, chin on her shoulder.

They looked like a couple in love.

And maybe, just maybe, they were.

Even if neither of them was ready to admit it.

Even if it couldn’t last.

The Fourth of July in Alton was not just a holiday—it was an institution. Main Street had been strung with red, white, and blue bunting for a week, and the storefronts gleamed with fresh paint and American flags clipped to the awnings. Kids ran around with faces painted like tigers and eagles, waving tiny plastic flags like they could change the weather with them. The church ladies had set up a pie table under a crooked canopy, and every square foot of the park had been claimed by someone’s lawn chair or picnic blanket before noon.

Avery walked beside Eli through the crowd, her sundress brushing against his jeans as he pointed out familiar faces. “That’s Sheriff Langston’s boy over by the dunk tank. He’s gonna join the Marines next month. And that lady over there? That’s Beverly Hanks. Don’t let her sweet tea fool you—she once chased a trespasser off her property with a rake.”

She smiled, soaking it in. The sounds of fiddles tuning up, the smell of grilled ribs and funnel cake, the swell of small-town pride that pressed against her chest. For the first time since she’d come back, the weight she’d been carrying felt a little lighter. She wasn’t sure if it was the holiday or Eli’s hand resting warm and steady at her back, but something inside her had shifted.

By late afternoon, the temperature hovered in the nineties and the dance floor had been laid out on the grass, a makeshift square with strings of lights hanging above like low stars. Eli offered her his hand as the band struck up an old George Strait song, and she let herself be pulled onto the floor. They moved slowly at first, her hand resting on his shoulder, their bodies swaying in rhythm with the music.

“You dance better than I expected,” she said.

“That’s just the boots,” he replied with a grin.

She laughed, head tilted back, and he looked at her like he was trying to memorize something he wasn’t sure he’d get to see again.

As the sun dipped low, painting the horizon in watercolor pinks and oranges, a sudden breeze blew across the grass, carrying the smell of rain that hadn’t fallen yet. Eli brushed a lock of hair from her face, his thumb lingering at her cheekbone.

“This feels real,” he said quietly.

Avery hesitated, heart leaping. “It does.”

He leaned in then, kissed her gently, and she kissed him back. There was no audience this time, no need for show. Just the two of them, standing in the middle of a crowded park, pretending nothing else in the world mattered.

After the fireworks, they drove back to her grandmother’s house, the truck windows down, the wind rushing past them like a river. Eli walked her to the porch and lingered by the steps.

“You don’t have to go,” she said before she could stop herself.

He looked at her, uncertain. “You sure?”

She nodded.

Inside, they moved like people who already knew each other’s rhythms. She lit a candle in the kitchen while he poured two glasses of whiskey. They didn’t talk much—didn’t need to. They sat on the living room couch, shoulders pressed together, and listened to the quiet hum of the house settle around them.

Later, as they lay in bed, Avery traced a scar on Eli’s shoulder with her fingertip. “Where’s this from?”

“Barbed wire,” he said. “Trying to cut across a fence when I was seventeen.”

She smiled. “Rebel.”

“Idiot,” he corrected.

They lay there in silence, her head on his chest, his hand resting against her spine. She wanted to say something—ask what they were, what came next—but the words tangled behind her teeth. Instead, she let herself drift off, pretending this could last, that the morning wouldn’t change everything.

But of course, it did.

**

Eli was gone when she woke. A note sat on the kitchen counter.

Had to meet Ray at the shop. Coffee’s still hot. —E

She stared at it longer than necessary, then poured a cup and took it out to the porch. The day was already warming, and the cicadas were screaming from the trees. She pulled the blanket tighter around her shoulders and tried to ignore the ache in her chest.

She didn’t want to leave. She realized that now. The idea of going back to Dallas—to her sterile apartment and her meaningless job—made her stomach turn. But staying meant more than just deciding to linger. It meant opening herself up. To a town she’d fled. To a man still grieving. To a life she’d never imagined for herself.

That afternoon, she drove to the cemetery, a bouquet of wildflowers in the passenger seat. She hadn’t been to her grandmother’s grave since the funeral. The headstone was simple: Amelia Malone, 1936–2025. Fierce and Full of Grace.

She knelt beside it and laid the flowers down.

“Hey, Grandma. Sorry I haven’t been by. I found your letters, by the way. I guess we both had our secrets, huh?”

She glanced up at the sky. The clouds were building, cotton stacking against cotton.

“I met someone. Or maybe I didn’t. Maybe it’s all fake. But it doesn’t feel that way. Not anymore.”

The wind shifted, cool against her neck.

“I wish you were here to tell me what to do. But maybe that’s not how this works. Maybe I’ve gotta figure it out on my own.”

She stood and wiped her hands on her jeans. The wind rustled the leaves above her, and for a moment, it felt like an answer.

**

That evening, she found Eli at the garage, working on an old Ford that looked like it hadn’t run since Reagan was president. He was under the hood, grease smudged across his arms, hair damp with sweat.

“Hey,” she said, leaning in the doorway.

He looked up, surprised. “Hey. Everything okay?”

“I don’t know. Maybe.”

She walked over and handed him the ribbon-tied stack of letters.

“These were in her attic. I think you should read them.”

He took them, confused.

“She loved someone else,” Avery said. “And she chose not to be with him. I think about that a lot. About the things we choose and the things we run from.”

Eli set the letters aside and wiped his hands.

“You thinking about running?”

“I was. I’m not sure I want to anymore.”

He stepped closer. “So what are you thinking now?”

She looked up at him. “I’m thinking maybe this isn’t fake. Maybe it hasn’t been for a while.”

His eyes softened. “It hasn’t. Not for me.”

She reached for his hand. “Then maybe we stop pretending.”

He pulled her close, their foreheads touching. The smell of motor oil and cedar lingered between them.

“Sounds good to me.”

Outside, the first drops of rain began to fall, soft and slow, as if the sky itself was exhaling. Avery didn’t run for cover. She let it wash over her, clean and full of promise.

Maybe it hadn’t been a fake relationship after all.

Maybe it was just the beginning.

Chapter Two: The Unraveling

The rain didn’t stop for three days. Texas storms had a way of arriving like drunken uncles—loud, unpredictable, and lingering far past welcome. It turned the dirt roads to slush, sent the creek beds swelling over, and soaked the hay bales out by Eli’s barn until they molded from the inside. But Avery didn’t mind. The storm kept the world small and quiet, as if the universe were holding its breath. She and Eli moved through the days in a soft rhythm, like dancers who’d learned each other’s steps in silence.

Mornings started with coffee and murmured plans for the day. Afternoons passed in a blur of estate paperwork, house repairs, and short drives to nowhere. Nights were slower, warmer—hours stretched on the back porch beneath a wet sky, his arm around her shoulders, her head on his chest. It was all too good. Too easy. And Avery knew, in that deep, skeptical place where her old life still lurked, that nothing this perfect stayed untouched for long.

She was right.

The call came on a Thursday.

It was near dusk, and Avery was standing in the kitchen peeling peaches. The air smelled like sugar and cinnamon, and her grandmother’s old radio was humming a Patsy Cline tune when her phone lit up with a Dallas area code.

She hesitated. Answered.

“Avery, it’s Mark.”

Her spine straightened. She hadn’t heard his voice in months. Not since she walked out of that glass-and-steel marketing firm without so much as a goodbye.

“I thought I blocked you,” she said.

“You did. I got a new number.”

“What do you want, Mark?”

“I heard about your grandmother. I’m sorry.”

A pause. She didn’t fill it.

“I also heard you’ve been... involved with someone in Alton,” he continued, voice soft like he was offering condolences instead of prodding for gossip. “Are you serious with this guy?”

“Why do you care?”

“I don’t. Not really. But the firm’s offering you your job back. With a raise. Full client list. You come back, it’s yours.”

She nearly dropped the peach.

“I’m not interested.”

“I think you are. You’re not meant for small towns and fixer-upper houses. Come on, Avery. This thing you’re doing—it’s just nostalgia. A phase.”

“No,” she said firmly. “It’s not.”

“You always had a way of running when things got real. Just think about it.”

She hung up. Stared at her phone like it had insulted her. Then, slowly, she went out onto the porch, where Eli was fixing the screen door with a screwdriver and a mouthful of nails.

“You alright?” he asked, catching her expression.

She sat down hard on the steps. “My old boss wants me to come back.”

Eli didn’t look at her right away. Just tightened another screw. “You thinking about it?”

“I don’t know. It’s everything I thought I wanted, before.”

“But not now?”

“I didn’t say that.”

He set the screwdriver down and sat beside her. The storm clouds were finally clearing, leaving streaks of amber light across the horizon.

“You don’t owe me anything, Avery.”

She turned to face him. “That’s not what this is about.”

“Isn’t it? I told myself I wouldn’t get too close. That this was temporary. But I lied to myself. And maybe you did too.”

She reached for his hand, but he pulled back.

“I care about you,” she said. “I just need time.”

“That’s what people say when they’re already halfway out the door.”

She didn’t answer. Couldn’t. Because he wasn’t wrong.

**

The next day, Avery drove to the lake just outside town, where the water shimmered with that odd, silvery tint only seen in heat waves. She parked the truck and walked down to the shoreline, skipping rocks until her arm ached. She thought about Mark. About Dallas. About the person she used to be and the one she was becoming.

She’d always been someone with a plan. A list. A calendar color-coded down to the minute. But this—this messy, unpredictable, sweat-and-heart kind of life—had caught her off guard. She had fallen for Eli in the spaces between planning. In the silences. In the laughter she didn’t mean to let slip.

Her phone buzzed again. This time it was her cousin from Lubbock. The estate sale was set for the following week. People were already asking about the house. Time was running out.

When she returned to town that evening, she found a note on her door.

Had to clear my head. Taking the horses up to Broken Ridge for a few days. Don’t wait.

No signature. But it didn’t need one.

**

The days without Eli dragged. She busied herself packing boxes, sorting through old photos, trying not to notice how quiet the house felt without his boots at the door or his laugh bouncing down the hallway. She missed him in a way that surprised her. Not just the comfort of his presence, but the absence of doubt he’d brought into her life.

One night, she opened a drawer in the hallway hutch and found an envelope addressed to her in her grandmother’s handwriting. Her heart caught in her throat as she peeled it open.

My dearest Avery,
If you’re reading this, I’ve probably already left this world. And if I know you, you’re thinking about leaving too. I hope you don’t. But if you do, I want you to know something.
Love isn’t always grand gestures and perfect timing. Sometimes it’s the quiet things. Showing up. Saying you’re sorry. Staying when it’s easier to go.
I made choices I couldn’t undo. Don’t let fear be your reason to walk away.
You deserve the kind of love that scares you, because that’s the one that means something.
With all my heart,
Amelia

Avery folded the letter slowly, tears burning at the corners of her eyes. Her grandmother had always known more than she let on. Even from beyond the grave, she was still trying to push her in the right direction.

And for the first time, Avery wasn’t so sure that direction was away.

**

Two days later, she drove to Broken Ridge. The road wound through hills dusted in dry brush and prickly pear, the horizon a hazy band of green and gold. She found Eli camped near a rocky bluff, his horse tethered to a tree, a small fire burning low beside a folding chair.

He stood when he saw her.

“I wasn’t sure you’d come,” he said.

She walked to him, slow but steady. “I wasn’t sure either.”

They stared at each other for a moment, the wind kicking up the smell of sage and smoke.

“I got scared,” she said. “Not of you. Of what it meant to stay. To want something real.”

“You think I wasn’t scared?”

She stepped closer. “I don’t want to run anymore.”

He studied her face, like he was trying to find the truth in her eyes. Then he pulled her into his arms and held her tightly, his breath against her neck.

“I don’t want to lose you,” he said.

“Then don’t.”

She kissed him, slow and certain.

Around them, the Texas wilds whispered with wind, and the fire crackled low and steady between them, like a promise rekindled.

Maybe there was still time.

Maybe love, real love, was never about perfection or planning—but about choosing to stay when it would be easier to go.

And for the first time, Avery was ready to stay.

The next morning, the sunrise broke over Broken Ridge in a slow spill of honeyed light, soaking the rocks and dust with a softness that didn’t match the harsh terrain. Avery woke before Eli, lying beneath a rough wool blanket, the earth firm beneath her back and the scent of mesquite smoke lingering in her hair. She listened to the quiet—birds rustling through brush, the gentle whinny of the horses, the rhythmic breath of the man beside her.

She could’ve stayed like that forever.

But forever had its own ideas.

By the time they packed up camp and rode back toward town, Avery had made up her mind. She wasn’t going back to Dallas. Not yet. Maybe not ever. She’d call the firm and decline the offer. She’d keep the house, maybe rent it out short-term while she figured things out. She had savings. Enough to last. Enough to breathe. Enough to rebuild without slipping back into the cold corporate mold that had never really fit.

But even as she imagined her future more clearly than she had in years, something restless lingered inside her. Not doubt, exactly—more like an awareness of how fragile things still were. One wrong step, one old fear, and the whole house of cards could tumble.

Back in town, the buzz from the Fourth had settled into a slow hum of midsummer routines. Teenagers clustered at the Sonic, old men played dominoes under the shade trees behind the hardware store, and the church sign on Main Street read, “JESUS IS MY ROCK AND THAT’S HOW I ROLL.”

Avery pulled up in front of the house, brushing dirt from her jeans as she climbed out of the truck. She looked at the peeling porch rails, the paint-chipped shutters, the sag in the roof above the front window, and felt something shift in her chest. This house had always been a place of memory, not possibility. But that was starting to change.

Inside, she opened the windows and let the dry breeze roll through. She brewed coffee, tossed a load of laundry in the machine, and sat on the floor of her grandmother’s bedroom to sort through the last of the personal items. Eli arrived just after noon with a box of tools and two sandwiches from the gas station deli.

“You look like a woman with a mission,” he said, handing her a drink.

“I am,” she replied. “I’m staying.”

He sat beside her, the sandwich untouched in his lap. “You sure?”

“Yeah,” she said. “It’s not just about you. Or the house. It’s about what this place does to me. I can breathe here.”

He nodded slowly, his eyes warm. “Then we figure it out. Together.”

They spent the rest of the afternoon repairing the back porch, hammering nails and scraping paint. It wasn’t glamorous. Her arms ached, her fingers were splintered, and sweat rolled down her spine in rivers. But Eli was beside her, cracking jokes, stealing kisses when the ladder wobbled, and it all felt real in a way her old life never had.

As dusk settled, they shared dinner on the porch steps—leftover chili and cornbread eaten straight from Tupperware with chipped spoons. Overhead, the sky blushed purple, the first stars peeking through.

Avery leaned against his shoulder. “Did you ever think this would happen? Us?”

Eli tilted his head. “Nope. Thought you were gonna cuss me out and never look back.”

“I almost did.”

“What changed your mind?”

She thought about it. About her grandmother’s letters. About the town gossip. About the feel of Eli’s hand in hers on the dance floor.

“You kissed me like you meant it,” she said.

He chuckled. “Well, I did.”

A pause stretched between them, long but not uncomfortable.

“I’ve got baggage,” she added. “Fears. Flaws. Plans that don’t always stick.”

“Good,” he said, nudging her with his knee. “Means you’re human. And I’m not afraid of any of that.”

She looked at him, her heart full in her chest. “You say that now.”

“I’ll say it tomorrow too.”

And he did. For the rest of the week, Eli kept showing up. With tools, with groceries, with dumb jokes and quiet strength. They painted the living room, fixed the broken fence out back, and sorted through boxes of family history like archaeologists unearthing more than just belongings. Somewhere in that stretch of days, Avery stopped thinking of it as “her grandmother’s house” and started thinking of it as hers.

But of course, peace in Alton never lasted.

It was a Wednesday morning when trouble came knocking—literally.

A dark blue SUV pulled into the gravel drive, too clean and too unfamiliar. A woman stepped out, tall and put-together, her heels clicking across the porch like a punctuation mark.

“Can I help you?” Avery asked, stepping onto the porch with paint-smeared hands and a ragged ponytail.

The woman offered a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “I’m Marlene Callahan. Eli’s sister-in-law.”

Avery blinked. “I didn’t know he had a sister-in-law.”

“Well,” Marlene said, “I’m technically his late brother’s widow. I moved to San Antonio a few years back. But this morning I got a phone call from someone concerned about what’s going on here.”

Avery crossed her arms. “And what exactly is going on here?”

“That’s what I came to find out.”

Inside, they sat across from each other at the kitchen table. Avery served coffee out of habit. Marlene didn’t touch hers.

“You’re living here now?” she asked.

“For now.”

“Are you and Eli serious?”

“I don’t think that’s your business.”

“I think it is. This town’s small, and the Callahan family name carries weight. Eli doesn’t always make the best choices when it comes to women.”

Avery’s jaw clenched. “Excuse me?”

“I’m just saying—be careful. He’s still grieving. And you’ve been gone a long time. People don’t forget that.”

“You don’t know me,” Avery said quietly. “And you definitely don’t know him.”

Marlene stood, her tone cooler now. “Just looking out for my family. You take care now.”

When she left, the house felt colder. Emptier. Avery poured herself another cup of coffee and tried to brush off the encounter. But it stuck like a splinter.

That evening, when Eli came by, she told him what happened. He listened, jaw tight, hands clenching at his sides.

“She has no right,” he said. “She’s barely part of the family anymore.”

“She thinks she’s protecting you.”

“From what? Happiness?”

Avery smiled, but it didn’t quite land. “I just don’t want to be a problem.”

“You’re not. Don’t let her shake you.”

But the doubt was there now, lingering at the edges. The kind of doubt that grows in silence.

The next few days passed with a slight strain—nothing obvious, but present. They laughed less. Touched less. Not because anything had changed, but because everything had. They had started building something, and now they were afraid to breathe wrong and watch it all come crashing down.

Then came the letter.

It arrived on a Saturday morning. No return address. Just her name, printed in neat block letters on the envelope.

Inside was a single sheet of paper. Typed. Anonymous.

Avery,
People around here forget easy, but not everyone does.
Watch your step. Some things can’t be fixed twice.

She read it three times. Her hands shook.

When she showed Eli, he took the letter and read it once before folding it neatly and placing it on the table.

“Someone’s trying to scare you,” he said.

“Maybe it’s Marlene.”

“Maybe. But I don’t think she’d hide behind a note.”

“Then who?”

“I don’t know. But I’ll find out.”

Avery stared out the window, heart pounding. She’d spent so long pretending this town was home again, she’d forgotten how quickly it could turn. How small and sharp its memories were. She had made enemies once, long ago. By being too loud, too stubborn, too ambitious.

She had come back stronger, but not invincible.

And now, just when everything was starting to feel right, the past had returned with claws.

She reached for Eli’s hand. “We’ll deal with it,” she said.

His grip tightened. “Together.”

And they would. Because whatever came next—whispers, warnings, old wounds—they were in it now. Not as a show. Not as a story.

But as something real.

Chapter Three: The Echoes of Dirt Roads

The following week, Avery couldn’t shake the feeling that eyes were on her. Not just the curious glances from the diner regulars or the watchful stares from the church ladies with their sun hats and suspicious smiles—those she expected. But there was something more. An undercurrent in town, subtle but insistent, like a low hum you don’t notice until it stops.

She didn’t tell Eli that someone had scratched the word leave into the side of her truck door two days after the letter came. He was already tense, already on edge, and she didn’t want to pour gas on a fire she couldn’t control. Instead, she buffed it out with a rag and a half-empty bottle of polish, her jaw clenched so hard she gave herself a headache.

What disturbed her most wasn’t the threat—it was the familiarity of it. The way small towns could weaponize their silence. Alton had a long memory and a short tolerance for outsiders, even if she’d once belonged here. Her return hadn’t erased the years she’d been gone or the version of herself they’d built in her absence.

She didn’t know who to suspect. The obvious choices—Marlene, bitter old neighbors, jealous exes of Eli—felt too convenient. Whoever was behind it was quieter, more insidious. Someone who remembered something Avery had long forgotten, or worse, someone who remembered everything.

That week, the heat turned oppressive, and the air stuck to skin like wet gauze. The town’s only grocery store lost power twice, and the community center’s air conditioning gave out just as they opened it up for a bake sale fundraiser. In the middle of it all, Avery tried to pretend nothing was wrong. She painted another bedroom, baked a peach pie for the volunteer fire department, and attended Sunday service with Eli even though the pastor’s sermon sounded suspiciously pointed.

Afterward, they stood outside the church in the sweltering sun, shaking hands with people whose smiles never quite reached their eyes. One woman—a Mrs. Halversen, who used to babysit Avery when she was five—leaned in close with a too-tight grip on her hand.

“Some folks don’t like when old dirt gets stirred up, dear,” she whispered. “Best not go digging.”

Avery didn’t respond. Couldn’t. Her throat had gone dry, and all she could think was, What did I stir?

That evening, she asked Eli if he knew what people meant when they talked about “old dirt.”

He was washing dishes, the sink steaming and suds clinging to his forearms. He didn’t look up right away.

“Alton’s full of it,” he said finally. “Old fights. Old love. Land deals gone wrong. Gossip with roots like mesquite—hard to kill and harder to dig out.”

“Do you think this has to do with my family?”

He turned the tap off and dried his hands slowly. “Could be. Your granddad had enemies. Hell, my dad didn’t like him much.”

“But why now? Why stir it up after all this time?”

Eli sat beside her, the kitchen still smelling of soap and tomato sauce. “Maybe because you’re back. Maybe because we’re together. That scares some people.”

Avery tilted her head. “Scares them how?”

“Because it’s change. Because it’s truth. And because they can’t control it.”

They sat in silence, the ceiling fan ticking overhead, the windows open to a world that no longer felt quite so friendly.

The next day, she drove out to the county records office. Something in her needed to understand, to connect the dots before they bled into something more dangerous. The woman at the front desk wore a floral blouse and bifocals, and didn’t even blink when Avery requested property records for the Malone ranch and surrounding lots going back fifty years.

“People don’t usually want to look that far back,” the woman said as she slid a stack of dusty folders across the counter.

“People usually don’t have a reason to,” Avery replied.

She spent hours there, flipping through deed transfers, probate files, handwritten tax records from the 1980s. At first it was mind-numbing—line after line of acreage and signatures and payment stamps—but eventually a pattern emerged. In the late sixties, Harlan Malone, her grandfather, had bought up three adjacent parcels of land in quick succession. What stuck out wasn’t the acquisition, but the sellers—families who’d left town abruptly, with rumors trailing behind them.

And then there was the Waverly tract.

Avery stopped short when she saw the name. J.T. Waverly. The man from her grandmother’s letters. The one whose name hadn’t been mentioned in town in decades. The land had been sold to Malone under suspicious terms—no formal bank involvement, no witnesses, just a single signed page and a cash transfer scribbled in the margins.

She photocopied the page and tucked it into her purse.

That evening, she confronted Eli with the document.

“This is why people are nervous,” she said. “There was a feud. Something happened between my grandfather and J.T. Waverly, and land changed hands that shouldn’t have.”

Eli scanned the page, his jaw tightening. “My uncle used to say Harlan Malone was the richest poor man in West Texas. Always had cash. No one knew from where.”

“Could he have forced J.T. out?”

Eli didn’t answer right away. “Back then? Anything was possible. The law didn’t look too hard when the names were big and the money was right.”

“And my grandmother?” Avery whispered. “She never spoke of any of it. Just... disappeared into the quiet.”

“She probably thought silence was safer.”

Avery pressed the heels of her hands into her eyes. “So what do I do now? Let it go?”

“I don’t think you can. Not anymore.”

And he was right. Because the next morning, the house was egged.

Not just the porch or the windows—everything. Dozens of them, cracking against the siding, yolk dripping into the seams of the porch boards, shells littering the flowerbeds. It was a message. And not a subtle one.

Eli helped her clean it, silent and tight-lipped, his movements sharp with anger. When they finished, she found another envelope tucked under the windshield of her truck.

Last warning. Stop looking.

She showed it to the sheriff, but he just sighed and scratched at his mustache.

“These things have a way of working themselves out,” he said.

“Or festering,” Avery snapped.

“Don’t make trouble where there’s none left to make.”

She stormed out of the office, angrier than she’d been in weeks.

That night, as she and Eli sat under the porch light, a bottle of whiskey between them, she made a decision.

“I’m not going back to Dallas,” she said. “But I’m not going to play dumb, either. If this town wants to bury something, they better dig deeper.”

Eli met her eyes. “You’re sure?”

“I’ve lived my whole life avoiding the hard questions. I’m done doing that.”

He nodded. “Then we’ll dig together.”

And as the wind shifted and the stars blinked into view above them, Avery felt something settle deep inside her. Not fear. Not even resolve.

But belonging.

Hard-won. Messy. Real.

And it was only just beginning.

They started with the Waverly property.

The parcel had been abandoned for decades, a long-forgotten stretch of mesquite and brittle grass about ten miles south of Alton, wedged between old cattle routes and a dried-out creek bed. The road leading to it was barely a trail anymore, nearly swallowed by nature, but Eli’s truck made it with a groan and a cloud of red dust that rose like smoke behind them.

Avery sat with the deed printout in her lap, fingers clutching the edges as if it might disappear the moment she let go. She didn’t know what she expected—answers, maybe. A hint. A shadow of the past that could be translated into something concrete. But when they pulled up to the old Waverly lot, all they found was silence. A windmill, broken and tilting like a question mark, loomed over the remains of a stone foundation. No house, just its footprint. A pile of charred beams. A well that had been capped with rusted sheet metal.

“Place burned down sometime in the early seventies,” Eli said as he climbed out. “Or that’s what I heard. Nobody ever rebuilt. Locals called it cursed ground.”

“Because of what happened between him and my grandfather?” Avery asked.

Eli nodded. “That, and the way Waverly disappeared. No forwarding address. No funeral. No nothing.”

They walked through the brush, the dry ground cracking under their boots. Avery knelt by the old well, pried up the metal with effort, and shined her phone flashlight into the dark. Only a few feet of visible depth, then blackness. The kind that swallows light whole.

She stood up slowly. “This isn’t just land. This is a graveyard.”

“You think someone buried something here?”

“Or someone.”

Eli stared at the trees. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”

But they both felt it. The weight of something unfinished. Unspoken.

That night, they returned to the Malone house and sat in silence for a long time. The crickets were louder than usual. The wind sharper. The air thick with the storm of unasked questions.

“Eli,” Avery said quietly, “if I start pulling at this thread, I don’t know where it’s gonna lead. I don’t want to drag you into something that could... change the way people see you. Or us.”

He reached for her hand. “Then let them look. We’ve already got their attention.”

She smiled faintly. “You really don’t care?”

“I care about you. The rest can rot.”

And so, together, they kept digging.

Over the next week, Avery visited the county archives nearly every day. She went through old newspaper clippings, town council minutes, microfilm scans that blurred at the edges, and school yearbooks where surnames she’d long forgotten floated to the surface like ghosts. What emerged was a pattern—not just of land disputes, but of power. Her grandfather, Harlan, had bought influence with quiet money. He’d backed three town council members in the sixties, then brokered property deals that always seemed to come with strings. And he’d clashed with J.T. Waverly repeatedly in legal filings, mostly over water rights, but also, chillingly, over “community safety issues,” a vague phrase that turned up more than once.

Avery finally found the obituary for J.T.’s sister, Miriam, who died in 1972. The obituary was short, matter-of-fact, and made no mention of surviving family. But in the margin, someone had scrawled in pencil: “Last of the Waverly line.”

She brought it to Eli that night, and he read it twice before saying anything.

“If Harlan pushed them out,” he said, “he did it with full town approval.”

“Or with threats,” Avery replied. “This place isn’t just complicit. It’s built on what it doesn’t say.”

The next morning, she received another envelope. No note this time. Just a single photograph.

It was her. Standing on the porch of her grandmother’s house. Smiling.

And drawn across the photo, in red ink, a simple message: You’re next.

Her hands trembled as she handed it to Eli.

He stared at it, face hardening. “That’s it. I’m calling in someone.”

“Who?”

“Old friend from my Army days. Lives up near Amarillo. He’s done security work since he got out.”

“Eli, that’s a little extreme.”

“No,” he said. “It’s not. Not when someone’s watching you like this.”

Despite her protest, she was relieved when a man named Curtis showed up the next evening in a battered SUV with Colorado plates and eyes like granite. He had a military stiffness to him, but spoke gently, like someone used to easing people into bad news.

Curtis walked the perimeter of the house, checked for camera spots, and installed motion sensors at every entry point.

“Whoever’s doing this knows the terrain,” he said. “They’re not outsiders.”

“Then it’s someone I grew up with,” Avery said, nausea crawling in her gut.

“Or someone your family wronged. Might not be about you personally.”

She laughed bitterly. “That doesn’t make it feel any better.”

Over the next few days, things remained quiet. No notes. No graffiti. No late-night knocks. But the stillness felt false, a lull before the next storm.

Then, just as Avery was beginning to hope it had ended, the fire happened.

She and Eli had gone into town to grab dinner—two burgers from Darla’s Diner and a milkshake to split. When they returned, they saw the smoke before they saw the flames.

The barn behind the house was burning.

Not a big structure—just an old storage building her grandmother had used for tools and gardening supplies—but it was up in minutes. The fire roared orange and white into the sky, swallowing wood and memory in equal measure.

Eli was the first to react, sprinting to the hose line, yelling instructions. Avery called 911, voice trembling as she gave the address.

The fire department arrived just in time to keep the flames from jumping to the main house, but the barn was gone. Reduced to wet ash and twisted metal.

Curtis found the remains of a gas can behind the chicken wire fence.

“This was deliberate,” he said. “Someone wanted to scare you.”

“They’re doing a damn good job,” Avery muttered.

That night, she couldn’t sleep. She sat on the couch with a blanket around her shoulders, staring at the empty backyard where the barn used to be. Eli joined her just after midnight, his face lined with exhaustion and something darker.

“We could leave,” he said, almost too softly.

She shook her head. “If I leave now, they win.”

“You’re not stubborn. You’re reckless.”

“Maybe. But I’m not alone.”

He looked at her for a long moment. “No. You’re not.”

And even though the night stretched long and uncertain before them, Avery felt something in her gut settle.

They hadn’t come this far to back down.

They hadn’t uncovered this much to bury it again.

Whatever lay beneath Alton’s charm and dust—whatever truth her grandfather, the town, or the Waverlys had left behind—was going to come out.

And she would be the one to drag it into the light. Even if it scorched her in the process.

Chapter Four: The Cost of Secrets

Avery didn’t recognize the version of herself she’d become. She was still waking up in her grandmother’s house each morning, still slipping into jeans smeared with paint and dirt, still drinking too-strong coffee with Eli by the back steps. But now, when she looked in the mirror, her eyes were sharper. Wary. They no longer held the wide, nostalgic wonder she’d arrived with. They held purpose. A spine of steel.

The fire had changed everything. The barn’s charred remains were still being hauled away by volunteers when word got out, spreading like syrup through town. People clucked and speculated, but no one stepped forward. That was the way of Alton—loud in private, silent in public. The kind of silence that stuck in your throat like smoke.

On Monday morning, Sheriff Langston stopped by the house, not with answers but with a weak apology and a reminder.

“I don’t like what’s happening,” he told Avery, eyes fixed on the scorched soil behind her. “But stirring it up doesn’t help, either. People here have long memories and short tempers.”

She crossed her arms. “People here also burned down my family’s barn. Or did you forget that part?”

Langston adjusted his belt. “I’m asking you to be careful, that’s all.”

Avery watched him walk back to his cruiser and realized, in that moment, she was done asking permission. The town’s patience with her had run thin—and hers with it.

That night, she and Eli drove to the edge of town where the oldest houses stood like relics, their porches slumping and yards wild with weeds. They stopped at the Givens house, where Amelia Malone’s childhood friend still lived. Miss Florence Givens, who everyone thought was half-mad and entirely blind to the present, answered the door in a lavender robe and bare feet.

“You’ve got the Malone look,” she said before Avery could speak. “Long bones, fire behind the eyes.”

“Miss Florence,” Avery began, “I’m looking for the truth. About the land. About my grandfather. About J.T. Waverly.”

Florence blinked slowly. “So it’s come to that.”

She invited them in without another word. Her house smelled like lemon balm and old paper. The parlor was full of clocks, none of which matched time. She lowered herself into an armchair and gestured for them to sit.

“I don’t know everything,” she said. “But I remember the night the Waverly house burned.”

Avery leaned forward. “It wasn’t an accident?”

“Lord, no. It was a warning. J.T. had threatened to go public with something—some kind of ledger he kept. Said he’d expose what your grandfather had done.”

“Expose what, exactly?”

Florence hesitated. “Harlan was no fool, but he was cruel when cornered. He wanted control of the aquifer rights out past the ridge. J.T. was the only one standing in his way. And when J.T. refused to sell, Harlan found leverage.”

“What kind of leverage?”

Florence looked at her with a weary sadness. “Your grandmother. Before she married Harlan, she and J.T. were—well, everyone knew. It wasn’t a fling. It was a heartbreak waiting to happen. When she chose your grandfather, J.T. left town. Came back only when he heard Harlan was buying up land illegally.”

“Why didn’t he ever speak up?” Avery asked.

“He tried. But this town didn’t want its myths ruined. Harlan Malone was already a saint in too many minds. J.T. became a ghost.”

Eli spoke for the first time. “The ledgers—do they still exist?”

Florence smiled faintly. “If they do, they’re buried deeper than truth usually goes. But I remember J.T. said he’d never let Harlan win. Said he’d hide the evidence somewhere no Malone would ever dare look.”

They left with more questions than answers.

That night, Avery found herself wandering the property lines of the old Malone ranch with a flashlight and Eli trailing behind her, silent but present. She passed through fences her grandfather built, walked past old pecan trees her grandmother planted, and stood before the well house at the far edge of the field, long sealed and mostly forgotten.

“Eli,” she whispered. “What if the ledgers are here?”

He stepped forward. “Then we find them.”

They pried open the heavy door of the well house. Dust rolled out like breath. Inside, the air was cooler. Stale. The boards creaked under their boots. In the far corner, beneath a tarp and some rotted burlap sacks, Avery found a trapdoor.

She paused. “You think this is it?”

“No doubt in my mind.”

They opened it and found a ladder descending into darkness. Avery climbed down first, her flashlight jittering against the walls. At the bottom was a root cellar—stone-walled, cobwebbed, lined with the musty smell of old apples and wet clay. And in the far corner, a metal box half-buried in dirt.

Her hands shook as she unearthed it.

The lock was rusted, brittle. Eli pried it open with his pocket knife, and inside they found stacks of notebooks—spiral-bound, yellowed, and stuffed with receipts, property surveys, and meticulous notes in tight cursive.

“This is it,” Avery breathed. “This is everything.”

They brought it back to the house and spent the night reading. Page after page detailed land deals, bribes, bank statements—proof that Harlan had blackmailed at least three families, threatened others, and even paid hush money to council members. There were initials, dates, signatures. And there were notes about Amelia—cryptic, heartbreaking things written in the margins: She deserved more. She chose him. I hope she forgives me one day.

By dawn, Avery felt hollowed out. The truth had weight, and she was carrying all of it.

“We have to go public,” she said.

Eli sat across from her, eyes red, hair tousled. “Are you sure?”

“Someone already tried to scare us off. We have to finish this. If I don’t, I’ll never be free of it.”

They drove to the local paper—The Alton Weekly—with copies of the ledgers. The editor, a grizzled man named Hal Turner, read through them without comment. When he finally looked up, his face was pale.

“This changes everything.”

“Good,” Avery said.

The story ran three days later. A front-page spread with the headline: “The Truth Beneath Alton: New Evidence Links Malone Legacy to Land Coercion, Fire, and Silence.”

The town didn’t erupt. Not at first. It simply stopped.

No calls. No visits. Just a heavy stillness, as if everyone was waiting to see who would speak first.

But it didn’t last.

On the fourth day, Florence Givens invited Avery to speak at the town meeting. Eli went with her, silent and watchful. The meeting hall was packed—farmers, business owners, old classmates, the sheriff, Marlene.

Avery stood before them, the ledger clutched in her hand.

“I didn’t come back to destroy a legacy,” she said. “But I also didn’t come to protect a lie. My grandfather did things that hurt people. That shaped this town’s history in ways none of us fully understood until now. You may not want to believe it. But it’s true.”

Marlene stood. “And what do you want from us?”

“Nothing,” Avery said. “I’m not asking for apologies or reparations. I just want to end the silence. To stop pretending everything built on bad ground is still solid. We don’t heal by hiding.”

There was no applause. But there was no shouting either.

Only a long, stunned quiet.

And then Florence, standing from the front row, clapped. Once. Twice. Until it caught.

That night, Avery sat on the porch with Eli again, watching the stars.

“Do you think we changed anything?” she asked.

He squeezed her hand. “I think we started something.”

She leaned into his side, tired but content.

The ghosts weren’t gone. But they had names now. Stories. Light.

And that was enough—for now.

The days that followed the town meeting unfolded in quiet ripples, as if the entire town had been holding its breath and finally exhaled. Avery didn’t know whether it was relief or resentment she saw on their faces when they passed her on Main Street. Some nodded stiffly. Others avoided eye contact altogether. But there was one undeniable shift—people were talking. At the diner. At the post office. At the feed store. What had been sacred silence was now being pulled apart thread by thread.

Eli received a handful of calls, mostly from old family friends and local business owners. Some voiced concern. Others, surprisingly, offered support. One afternoon, he returned from the garage with a tin of homemade biscuits from Miss June Holloway, who’d written a note on the lid: Thank you for not pretending.

That small kindness nearly made Avery cry.

She busied herself with practicalities in the meantime—repairing what was left of the barn’s foundation, finalizing the legal filing that would transfer full ownership of her grandmother’s land to her, and corresponding with a land conservation group that had expressed interest in protecting the old Waverly tract. It felt right. As if something broken was finally being put back into the earth it had been pulled from.

But it wasn’t all resolution and goodwill.

One evening, as the cicadas started their dusk song, a rock smashed through her front window.

The sound was sharp, violent. Glass shattered across the living room floor. Avery ducked instinctively, heart in her throat. Eli came running in from the back porch, Curtis behind him, gun drawn. They swept the yard. Found nothing. The rock had been wrapped in paper, now torn and blood-streaked from the broken shards.

Only one word had been scrawled across it: Liar.

The sheriff came again. This time with less patience and more weariness.

“Some folks are still raw,” he said. “Don’t take it personally.”

“I got a rock through my window,” Avery snapped. “That feels pretty personal.”

Langston rubbed the back of his neck. “It’s better than a matchstick.”

Curtis stepped in then, his voice low and steady. “You’re not doing your job, Sheriff. This is intimidation. Borderline criminal threat. You’ve got a suspect list longer than your hat’s brim, and you haven’t followed up once.”

Langston’s cheeks darkened. “You think I don’t know how deep this town’s rot goes?”

“I think you’re afraid to pull the root,” Curtis said.

For the first time, Langston didn’t argue. He just sighed. “Maybe I am.”

They replaced the window the next day. Eli insisted on doing the work himself, even though he gashed his palm in the process and bled all over the porch steps before Avery made him sit down.

“You can’t fix everything with hammers and silence,” she told him, pressing gauze to the wound.

He winced but smiled faintly. “Worked well enough till you showed up.”

“Sorry to ruin your quiet life.”

“Not sorry enough to stop talking.”

They laughed then, tired and close, the kind of laugh you only share with someone who knows the full weight of your truth.

But the incident left a mark. Avery found herself double-checking the locks each night, closing the curtains, hesitating before stepping out after dark. And Eli, for all his steadiness, became sharper. Less forgiving. He watched every car that drove too slowly past the house, memorized plates, kept a bat under the bed even though Curtis had offered to leave them a firearm.

“I don’t need a gun to protect what’s mine,” Eli had said.

But Avery didn’t want him to carry that burden alone. This was her fight. Her past. Her reckoning.

So she kept working.

The final ledger, the one they’d almost missed because it had slipped behind a broken board in the cellar box, held the most damning information. It included a letter—unsent, handwritten by J.T. Waverly in fading ink—addressed to the Texas State Land Commission. A draft complaint, complete with maps and affidavits, documenting how Harlan Malone had falsified survey lines and used backdoor deals to take water access from surrounding farmers.

J.T. had intended to send it.

He never did.

Avery sat with the letter for hours, weighing its power and its risk. The Commission might still act on something like this, even decades later. But it would open the town up to audits, investigations, potentially lawsuits. People could lose land. Reputation. Family peace.

And for what?

Justice?

“Would you do it?” she asked Eli one night, as they stood in the yard beneath the stars.

He considered the question for a long moment.

“If it were me?” he said. “Maybe. But I think the real question is—what kind of life do you want when this ends? A scorched one? Or something you can build from?”

Avery looked down at her hands. “Can I live with letting it lie?”

“I don’t know,” he said. “But you’re the only one who gets to answer that.”

The answer didn’t come that night. Or the next. It came on a Sunday, when Avery stood in her grandmother’s old bedroom, packing away the last of the linens, and found a second letter from Amelia, hidden in a worn Bible beneath the bed.

Avery,
If you’ve found the ledgers, then you know what your grandfather did. You know the truth I carried for too long. I stayed silent because I believed it protected you. But maybe I was wrong. Maybe silence is just another way of giving fear a place to grow.
If you can do what I couldn’t—if you can bring light to what we buried—then do it. But do it with love. Not vengeance. Let this land heal.
Love, always—
Grandma

She mailed a copy of the letter and the last ledger to the Commission that afternoon. Not because she wanted revenge. But because she wanted air. Space. Clean ground. And she signed her name at the bottom, with no fear and no apology.

It would take weeks before she heard back. Maybe longer.

But she slept well that night, for the first time in months.

And when she woke the next morning to Eli cooking breakfast and sunlight pouring in through the new kitchen window, she knew they had made it through the worst.

Not unscathed.

But whole.

And that was enough—for now.

Chapter Five: Things That Stay

The town of Alton didn’t change overnight.

It never had, and it never would. That wasn’t how towns like this worked. They creaked and shifted like old houses, groaning under the weight of what they carried, loosening one nail at a time. Avery had stopped expecting dramatic closure. What she learned instead, as the summer deepened and the heat began to lose its edge, was that real change showed itself in subtle ways—a longer pause before a judgment, a softer tone in a once-hardened voice, a pie left on a doorstep without a name.

Some people never said anything. They simply started treating her like she belonged.

She kept working on the house. Not because it needed her anymore, but because she needed it. Scrubbing baseboards, sanding window frames, hanging new curtains—it was more than upkeep. It was communion. The act of choosing to stay, to root herself not in memory but in something alive.

Eli was there through all of it, hammer in hand, dirt on his jeans, sometimes whistling, sometimes swearing under his breath when a beam didn’t align or a pipe refused to behave. He still helped at the garage in the mornings and came home by late afternoon, tracking grease across the porch steps like breadcrumbs. They shared routines now—meals, errands, chores. They shared the kind of silence that didn’t feel like absence but comfort. A stillness they didn’t need to fill.

And yet, under the rhythm of their new normal, something quietly unsettled began to rise in Avery. A question she hadn’t dared ask. Not out loud. Not even in her own head.

Was this enough?

Not the town, or the house, or the land. But them.

She knew she loved him. She knew what they’d faced—what they’d fought for. But as the adrenaline of survival faded, a different kind of reckoning appeared. She wasn’t the same woman who’d stepped onto the porch with a box of china and a truck full of doubt. She wasn’t pretending anymore. And that meant she had to ask: what did love look like without the urgency of fire and fear?

One evening, as they sat on the tailgate watching the stars, she turned to him.

“Do you think we’re still faking it?” she asked.

He looked over, surprised. “Faking?”

“This. Us. It started as a performance. A convenience. And then it became real. But I wonder if... we ever talked about what that means.”

He took a long pull from his beer before answering.

“I stopped pretending the night of the dance,” he said. “I didn’t say it then because I figured you weren’t ready. Maybe I wasn’t either.”

“And now?”

“I’m still not good at talking. But I know what it feels like to want someone in your bones. To want them even when the smoke clears.”

She stared at the field ahead. The grass swayed like breath. “I want this. I want you. But I’m scared of wanting too much.”

“You’re allowed to want,” he said quietly. “It doesn’t make you weak. It makes you honest.”

Avery felt her chest tighten. Not with panic, but with the fragile ache of possibility.

“I want more than just staying here fixing fences,” she said. “I want to build something.”

“With me?”

She turned to face him, heart wide open. “Yes. With you.”

They kissed there under the stars, not with urgency but with certainty. Like sealing a promise. Like laying a cornerstone.

**

A week later, she stood on the steps of Alton’s town hall again, only this time it wasn’t to deliver secrets or reckonings. She’d submitted a proposal to the county to turn part of the Waverly land into a historical and environmental conservation site. With Florence Givens’ help and the support of a few key townsfolk—people who remembered too much and had said too little—they were granted a grant. A small one, but enough to start.

They called it the Ridgeway Project. Part memorial, part reparation.

On the opening day, a modest crowd gathered under a new wooden sign carved with the name. Eli stood beside her, his hand in hers. Florence gave a speech. Avery followed.

“I was afraid to come home,” she told them. “I thought this place would never forgive me for leaving. But it wasn’t forgiveness I needed. It was truth. And truth doesn’t ask for permission. It just waits for someone to be brave enough to speak it.”

Afterward, a woman approached her. Janie Wilcox, the same one who had once gossiped about Leah, who had looked at Avery like an intruder at the church picnic. She carried her toddler on one hip and offered a tentative smile.

“My granddad lost land to Harlan too,” she said. “He never talked about it, but... I know he carried it with him. I’m glad you didn’t let it stay buried.”

“Thank you,” Avery said, surprised by the sting in her eyes.

That night, Eli took her dancing.

It wasn’t a festival or a parade. Just a cleared space behind the barn, a speaker playing old country records, and string lights draped between two fence posts. He offered his hand like it was the first time, and she took it like it was the only time.

They danced barefoot in the grass, the music lilting soft and slow, the stars peeking out from behind the clouds.

“I’ve been thinking,” Eli murmured, his chin brushing her temple.

“About what?”

He pulled back just enough to look her in the eye. “About rings. About forever. About how maybe I didn’t just need a fake girlfriend to keep my mama off my back. Maybe I needed a reason to stop standing still.”

Her breath caught.

“I don’t have a ring yet,” he said. “But I’ve got a house. And land. And love.”

She smiled, full and real. “Then you’ve got everything you need.”

He leaned in, forehead to hers. “So do you.”

And there, in the quiet of a Texas summer night, with the scent of cedar and honeysuckle wrapping around them like a benediction, Avery Malone finally knew the answer to the question that had followed her since the moment she stepped back into town.

Yes.

This was home.

Not because it was familiar. Not because it was perfect.

But because she had chosen it.

Because it had chosen her back.

And because love—real, enduring, imperfect love—was never fake to begin with. It had simply been waiting to be found.

The following morning, Avery woke to the scent of fresh bread baking—Eli had somehow become a weekend baker, a fact that amused both of them since his idea of cooking used to begin and end with a cast iron skillet and eggs. She padded into the kitchen barefoot, hair tangled from sleep, the hem of Eli’s T-shirt hanging loose around her thighs. He stood at the counter, humming off-key, flour dusting his forearms.

She wrapped her arms around his waist from behind, pressing her cheek into his back.

“I could get used to this,” she murmured.

“You already have,” he said with a chuckle.

They ate breakfast on the porch, still warm from the sun just rising over the trees. The Ridgeway Project had drawn more attention than they expected, with calls coming in from local schools, a couple of small history podcasts, and even a regional news outlet asking if they’d be open to an interview. Avery was reluctant at first—she’d had enough of being in the spotlight for things that hurt—but Eli convinced her.

“If we don’t tell it right,” he said, “someone else will.”

So she told it. Carefully. Truthfully. She sat in front of a camera in the library meeting room and told the story of land stolen and secrets buried. Of her grandmother’s love. Of her grandfather’s ambition. Of J.T. Waverly’s stubborn dignity. And of how the smallest voices can echo the loudest, if someone is brave enough to listen.

The interviewer asked her if she considered herself a whistleblower.

She paused. “No. I consider myself someone who came home and decided not to stay quiet.”

In the weeks that followed, Avery found a new rhythm. The house, now fully restored, stood not as a relic but a sanctuary. She opened it once a month for community meetings, held volunteer sessions on weekends, and began working with the county on an oral history initiative to collect stories from those who had lived through Alton’s changing tides. Old men cried in her living room. Women she barely remembered told her things in hushed tones about things they never thought they’d say out loud.

It felt like building something lasting, not just from wood or paperwork, but from memory.

Still, the past had a habit of lingering, even in the corners of joy.

One afternoon, she received a call from a number she didn’t recognize. When she answered, a voice from the other side of the country greeted her.

“This is Celia Waverly,” the woman said. “J.T.’s niece. My dad—his brother—moved us to Oregon after the fire. I saw the story online. I had to call.”

Avery sat down slowly. “I didn’t know he had family left.”

“He didn’t talk about Texas,” Celia said. “Not ever. But he left journals. Photos. I thought you might want them. And I thought maybe... we could come visit.”

They arrived two weeks later. Celia was in her forties, her son a teenager who looked uncannily like J.T. in the one surviving photo Avery had seen. They spent a quiet afternoon walking the Ridgeway grounds. Celia stood before the plaque at the entrance, fingers brushing the inscription—In memory of land lost and voices raised.

“He would’ve been proud,” Celia said. “And probably embarrassed. He hated attention.”

Avery laughed softly. “So did my grandma. But she left me the pieces. And now I get to decide what to do with them.”

Celia offered her the box of keepsakes that evening. Inside were dog-eared notebooks, faded photographs, and a sealed envelope with Avery’s name written on it in crisp, elegant handwriting.

She opened it with trembling hands. The letter was brief.

Avery,
If you’re reading this, you’ve already done more than I ever could. Thank you. This land was never meant to be conquered. It was meant to be shared. I hope you live here with peace. I hope you love honestly. I hope you stay longer than I did.
With gratitude,
J.T.

She sat on the porch long after they’d left, the letter folded in her lap, the sky darkening to lavender above the treetops.

Eli joined her eventually, sliding into the rocking chair beside her with two mugs of coffee and that steady, grounding presence she’d come to crave more than caffeine.

“You okay?” he asked.

She nodded. “Yeah. I think I am.”

They rocked in companionable silence, the wind rustling the leaves in that way it always did before dusk—like the land itself sighing in relief. She realized then how far they had come. How far she had come.

From a broken-down truck and a favor asked in jest.

From a fake smile and a borrowed role.

From fear to honesty. From flight to foundation.

The next morning, she found Eli in the barn—not rebuilding this time, but rearranging, clearing space.

“For what?” she asked.

He turned and grinned, brushing sawdust from his jeans. “Avery’s office. Figured if you’re gonna run half the county’s history efforts, you oughta have a place to put your papers.”

She blinked. “You did this for me?”

He stepped closer, voice low and certain. “I’m building a life for us. Not just a roof or a ring or a porch swing. I want you to know that wherever you go in this town, you’ve got a place that’s yours.”

She looked around at the old beams, the fresh paint, the window he’d repaired with his own hands. It wasn’t flashy. It wasn’t modern. But it was steady. Honest. Built with care.

Much like the love that had grown between them.

They stood there in the filtered sunlight, surrounded by wood and dust and memory, and Avery took his hand.

“Then let’s build it together,” she said.

And together they did. One nail, one letter, one morning at a time.

Chapter Six: Home as a Verb

By late August, the Texas heat had settled into its usual stubborn pattern—sunrises that scorched early and nights that clung warm to the skin like the memory of an argument. But Avery didn’t mind the heat anymore. She’d learned to move with it, to rise early before the sun got cruel, to work until the light grew syrup-thick in the sky, and to rest when the crickets took over the soundtrack of the land.

The new office in the barn was nearly finished. The interior had been framed and drywalled, a set of shelves lined with dusty ledgers and fragile photographs. Eli had wired in an overhead fan and found an old metal desk at a local estate sale that cleaned up nicely with some elbow grease and polish. It wasn’t a city office—no sleek lines, no filtered water coolers—but it was hers. And more than that, it was useful. She was doing something that mattered.

Word had spread about Avery’s historical archive project, and families started showing up with boxes—old deeds, black-and-white photos of picnics and protests, receipts for land long since paved over. Some came just to talk. To sit on her porch, sip lemonade, and share what they remembered before time stole it away.

One afternoon, a woman named Lorraine Spencer—pushing eighty, sharp as a blade—sat across from Avery and told her about a neighbor who vanished in 1970.

“His name was Amos Dillard,” she said, voice even, hands folded on a crocheted purse. “Fought the land grab, just like J.T. He didn’t win. He moved to Kansas, folks said, but I don’t believe that. He left his dog. Man don’t leave his dog if he plans on coming back.”

Avery scribbled notes in her worn journal, the one with the cracked leather cover and coffee rings on the spine. She didn’t press Lorraine for more. Just listened. That had become her greatest tool—quiet attention. The kind that invited trust.

Later, she found a mention of Amos in one of the older council transcripts: Disrupted order at meeting. Filed complaint with county. Request denied. That was all. As if his resistance had been a brief breeze, barely worth writing down.

“People like that built this town,” she muttered, running a thumb along the margin. “And it forgot them like they were weeds.”

Eli heard her from the other room. “Town didn’t forget,” he said. “It chose to look away.”

They were in the habit of having these kinds of conversations now—about power, about legacy, about who got remembered and who got erased. And while they didn’t always agree, Avery cherished those talks. They were the bones of the life they were building. Honest. Messy. Laced with grit and grace.

Still, not everything had smoothed out.

Avery received a second letter from the Texas Land Commission. The investigation was ongoing, and while no criminal charges could be filed against a dead man, the evidence she’d submitted had prompted a review of several land use statutes in rural municipalities. It was a ripple. A small one. But real.

She felt a complicated mixture of relief and grief. Her grandfather would never answer for what he’d done. And her grandmother—God, how she must have carried that weight all those years. But Avery had honored them both in her own way. She hadn’t buried the past, but she hadn’t weaponized it either. She’d made it a stepping stone.

The biggest surprise came in the form of an invitation.

A university in Austin had heard about her work—both the Ridgeway Project and the oral archive—and wanted her to speak at a regional history symposium. A modest panel, just one afternoon, but they offered to cover travel and lodging. Avery read the email three times before forwarding it to Eli with a single line:

Should I say yes?

He replied within two minutes.

Only if you let me drive you there.

The symposium was held in a glass-and-limestone building that smelled faintly of eucalyptus and dust. Avery hadn’t been in an academic space in years, and she felt the old familiar tension return—shoulders tight, tongue uncertain. But then she stood up behind the podium and saw a room of strangers waiting to hear something true.

So she told them.

About a town too small for its history. About letters written in the dark. About a woman who came home to pack boxes and found something worth staying for. She told them about silence and land and the power of knowing where you come from, not to stay tethered, but to stop being afraid of roots.

When she finished, the room was quiet. Then a young man in the front row raised his hand.

“What do you call what you’re doing?” he asked.

Avery smiled. “I call it remembering forward.”

Eli met her at the exit with a bottle of cold water and a look that said more than any applause.

“I’m proud of you,” he said.

“Even when I talk too much?”

“Especially then.”

They drove back to Alton in the dark, headlights carving out narrow paths through the hills. They didn’t talk much. They didn’t need to. Their silences were full now, not empty.

When they got home, Avery stood for a moment in front of the porch, just looking. The house was glowing—lamplight in the windows, curtains fluttering with the breeze. Her home. Not just by name. But by soul.

Inside, they settled into bed, limbs tangled, hearts steady.

“Eli,” she said into the dark.

“Yeah?”

“You still think you need a ring to prove something?”

There was a long pause. Then: “Maybe I just want one so people stop asking.”

She laughed, low and warm. “Well, next time they ask, just tell them this: home isn’t a place we move into. It’s a thing we do. And I’m doing it with you.”

He kissed the top of her head.

“That’ll shut them up.”

They fell asleep to the creak of the ceiling fan and the slow rhythm of two people who weren’t pretending anymore. Who hadn’t been, for a long time. Who were still writing their story, not on a stage or in a script, but on each other’s skin and hearts and Sunday mornings.

Because love, as Avery now knew, wasn’t about beginnings or endings.

It was about choosing, over and over again.

To stay.

The final push into fall came slowly, like someone easing a door open after a long time away. September brought cooler mornings and the return of golden light that poured through the kitchen windows with a gentler hand. The heat still clung to the afternoons, but something in the air had changed. Even the cicadas seemed more measured in their chorus. It was as though the land itself was beginning to settle again, relieved of a tension that had long gone unnamed.

Avery spent those early days of autumn immersed in small tasks that had begun to carry larger meaning. She cataloged the latest batch of oral histories in the barn office, digitizing tapes from elderly residents who spoke with shaking voices and eyes full of long-buried stories. She labeled old photos, transcribed letters, and coordinated volunteers who came in shifts now—retirees, high school students, even out-of-town genealogists curious about Alton’s long shadow. It was work that filled her hands and emptied her mind, and she welcomed it.

Eli, too, was busier than ever. The garage had taken on two new mechanics and was expanding its back lot. He worked long hours but always came home in time to make dinner with her—sometimes grilled cheese, sometimes a roast, sometimes just scrambled eggs and laughter in the fading light.

One Thursday evening, as they sat cross-legged on the living room floor surrounded by tax folders and donation forms, Avery turned to him with a thoughtful look.

“You ever think about starting over? Like, really starting fresh?”

He didn’t flinch, just looked at her steadily. “You mean somewhere else?”

“Not necessarily. Just… bigger. Building something more. Maybe the project becomes a real nonprofit. Maybe we write a book.”

Eli nodded, then leaned back against the couch, arms behind his head. “I think about it. Not ‘cause I want to leave anything behind, but because I want to keep moving forward. I never thought I’d want more than this town. Then you came back.”

Avery felt her pulse quicken in the quietest way. Not with nerves. With hope.

“I don’t want to be a firework that fades out,” she said. “I want to keep burning. Even if it’s slow.”

“Then let’s do it,” he said. “Whatever it is. Let’s build it.”

They started drawing up plans over the next few weeks. A real foundation for the archive. A website. A local history festival in the spring to bring people together not around what was lost, but what was worth keeping. They even talked about converting part of the house into a guest suite for visiting researchers or storytellers.

Word reached the state historical board, and by October Avery was invited to submit a grant application for permanent historical designation of the Waverly tract. It was a long shot, and it would take months to review, but even the invitation felt like a win.

That same week, the letter from the Land Commission finally arrived. The final determination confirmed what she already knew: the abuses committed by Harlan Malone had been real, documentable, and part of a systemic failure of oversight. The report wouldn't change the past, but it would remain in the public record—an official account, no longer a whisper or a rumor.

Avery folded the letter carefully and placed it in the top drawer of her desk, next to the photograph of her grandmother, who looked impossibly young in it, standing in a field of wildflowers with a wide smile and a secret in her eyes.

Later that evening, she found herself alone on the porch. Eli was still at the shop, and the sun had dipped behind the hills, painting the sky in hues that belonged on canvas. The quiet was rich, not empty—full of everything they had built and everything they were becoming.

The wind shifted, rustling the cottonwoods.

From the road, headlights approached slowly, and for a moment, she tensed, heart skipping. But it was Curtis, rolling up in his old truck with two paper bags in hand.

“I brought fried catfish,” he said. “Figured y’all hadn’t eaten.”

Avery smiled and held the screen door open. “Come on in. I’ll make tea.”

They sat on the porch with paper plates on their laps and no need for much conversation. After everything, the silences between them were familiar, worn-in like denim.

Curtis nodded toward the field beyond the fence. “Place feels different now.”

“Because it is,” Avery replied. “Not fixed. But not forgotten either.”

He reached into his coat and pulled out an envelope, placing it beside her plate.

“What’s this?” she asked.

“Call it closure,” he said. “Something I found when I went through old files last month.”

Inside was a faded photograph of the Waverly house before the fire—standing tall, proud, with a young woman in the foreground who looked suspiciously like Amelia Malone. On the back, written in ink, were the words: Forgive, but never forget.

Avery stared at it for a long moment before folding it carefully and slipping it into her pocket.

When Eli arrived home later, the catfish gone and the tea cold, he leaned down and kissed the top of her head.

“You keep finding pieces,” he murmured.

“And they keep fitting,” she said.

That night, as they lay in bed, Avery stared at the ceiling fan spinning above her and felt no anxiety for the future. Just curiosity. Anticipation. She had unearthed so much of what had been buried, but now she was planting something new.

Hope, maybe.

Or something even stronger.

Love, not just the romantic kind, but the kind that stays when the story gets hard. That digs in when it would be easier to walk away.

And she knew, as she drifted off to sleep, that no matter how far this life stretched—through seasons, storms, and time itself—she had already arrived.

Not at the end.

But at the heart of it all.

At home.

The first real cold front of the season swept into Alton in early November, arriving with wind that rattled the windows and left a fine dusting of red and brown leaves along every porch step in town. Avery had always associated autumn with decay—a slow dying-off before winter could claim everything—but this year, it felt like transformation. Not loss, but change. A clearing-out. A breathing space.

The house responded, too. It seemed to sigh in the cold, wooden bones creaking in the night as the temperatures dropped. She and Eli lit the fireplace for the first time since she’d returned, curling up under thick quilts in the living room, sipping hot cider, and reading aloud to each other from a book of Texas folklore she’d found tucked in one of her grandmother’s forgotten chests.

They were quieter these days, but not distant. There was a comfort between them now, like the way a well-worn trail feels under your feet. No pretense, no performance. They could sit for an hour without speaking and still feel wrapped in conversation.

But not everything was still. The project continued to grow, now attracting interest from universities beyond Texas. Avery had received a tentative invitation to present at a national humanities conference the following spring. She hadn’t decided yet. It was tempting—too tempting, perhaps—and she didn’t want to lose the simplicity she’d found in Alton by chasing validation from places she’d already left behind.

Eli, of course, encouraged her.

“You can share the truth without leaving the life you’ve built,” he said one evening as they sat at the kitchen table sorting through old letters. “What you’re doing here, what we’re doing—this doesn’t have to be small.”

“But will it stay real?” she asked, half to herself.

He reached across the table, his hand covering hers. “It stays real as long as you do.”

That settled something in her. Not perfectly, but enough to carry her through the next week of meetings and interviews and impromptu visits from out-of-towners who had read about the archive and made the drive just to see it.

One afternoon, a father and daughter arrived from Amarillo. The girl, maybe sixteen, wore thick glasses and carried a notebook bulging with printouts.

“She’s doing a school project,” the father explained. “Wanted to focus on local land disputes and how women preserved history. Your name came up a dozen times.”

Avery was stunned. Not by the recognition—but by the idea that her work had become something replicable. A model. A path for someone else.

She sat with the girl for over an hour, answering questions, showing her the ledgers, the digitization equipment, the filing system she’d cobbled together over months of trial and error.

When they left, the girl handed her a folded note.

Thank you for making the past feel alive. I think I want to do this, too. —Nadia

Avery pinned the note above her desk. It reminded her that stories weren’t just about the past—they were about permission. About legacy. About giving someone else a map forward.

Thanksgiving came quickly after that. Eli’s mother hosted, and for the first time, Avery didn’t feel like a guest or an outsider. She brought a pie, helped set the table, and laughed when Eli’s uncle accidentally sprayed whipped cream across the kitchen counter. There were twenty people crammed into that little farmhouse, knees bumping under the table, voices overlapping in stories both old and new.

At one point, Eli reached beneath the table and gave her hand a squeeze.

“You alright?” he asked, leaning close.

“Better than alright,” she said. “I think this is the first holiday I’ve ever really wanted to be part of.”

After dinner, they walked through the field behind the house, the sky deepening into indigo, the stars beginning to pierce through the dark.

“I used to think I was temporary,” Avery said. “A shadow that would pass through. Even when I stayed, I felt like I was on borrowed time.”

“You’re not,” Eli replied. “You’re the reason time moves forward here now.”

She looked at him, startled by the intensity in his voice.

“I mean it,” he said. “You came back, and everything that was stuck… unstuck.”

She stopped walking. “You know, the funny thing is I didn’t come back looking for you. Or for this. I came back to bury something. But instead, I uncovered everything I needed.”

Eli took her hands in his, rough and warm and sure. “So let’s keep uncovering.”

They kissed there in the cold air, wrapped in each other, the rustle of dead leaves beneath their feet and the stars stretching overhead like watchful sentinels. It wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t cinematic. But it was true.

Later, as they sat by the fire back at their house, Avery curled up against him and finally asked the question she’d been holding.

“Do you want to get married?”

Eli didn’t flinch. He looked down at her, eyes thoughtful.

“Yeah,” he said. “I do. But not because we’re supposed to. Not to prove anything. Just because I want to keep choosing you, out loud, every day.”

She smiled, a tear slipping down her cheek and catching the firelight. “Then let’s do it. Quietly. Just us. No spectacle.”

“You sure?” he asked. “No fake dances this time?”

“No pretending. Just a promise.”

They agreed on New Year’s Eve. Nothing fancy—just the two of them, a county judge, and a sky full of stars. She’d wear her grandmother’s locket. He’d wear his best jeans. And together, they’d mark the start of something not entirely new, but entirely theirs.

Because home wasn’t just a place.

It was a commitment.

And love, Avery had learned, was not an act or an arrangement—it was the daily, stubborn, steady choice to build a life beside someone who saw you clearly and stayed.

And in Alton, under the vast Texas sky and the slow, forgiving clock of small-town time, she had found someone who did just that.

Every single day.

Chapter Seven: In the Quiet of After

Winter in Alton was not harsh, but it was honest. The kind of cold that crept in through the window seams and laid itself across the floorboards like a blanket of memory. The fields browned and curled, and the trees stood stripped bare, their limbs reaching up like questions. The town quieted in December, the buzz of the harvest gone, the hum of the holidays just beginning to surface in string lights and cedar wreaths hung with faded red bows.

Avery had always thought of December as a pause—an inhale before the new year drew its first sharp breath. But this time, the month felt like something fuller, like the settling of dust after movement. She and Eli moved through their days with a kind of gentle momentum, preparing for the end of the year and their quiet wedding at the same time.

They didn’t send out invitations. They didn’t make grand plans. Instead, they chose a spot on the edge of the Ridgeway tract, near a stand of old oaks where the sunlight filtered through the branches even on the gloomiest days. Eli built a small wooden platform just big enough for the two of them and a witness, and Avery sewed a wrap for her shoulders out of one of her grandmother’s old quilts.

Curtis agreed to officiate. It surprised them both—his background was more tactical than theological—but he got certified online and stood proudly behind a makeshift podium on New Year’s Eve as the last sun of the year slipped low on the horizon.

Florence Givens was their witness, wrapped in three layers of wool and standing straight as a fencepost, a single sprig of rosemary in her hand.

The ceremony was short. Curtis spoke plainly about the strength of love forged in fire and quiet, and when it was time for vows, Avery didn’t read from a paper. She just looked up at Eli and let the words come.

“I thought I came home to finish something,” she said, her voice low but sure. “But I didn’t. I came back to begin. And you—well, you made it safe to stay. You made it easy to be myself when nothing else was. I promise to keep choosing you. Every morning. Every hard day. Every quiet one.”

Eli took her hands. “You took a cracked story and filled it with light. You made it matter again. You made me matter again. I promise to protect that light in you. To give you space when you need it, and stand beside you when you don’t.”

They kissed just as the first stars crept into the indigo sky, and somewhere off in the distance, a few illegal fireworks cracked over a neighboring farm. Curtis offered them a flask. Florence dabbed her eyes and muttered something about onions in the wind.

They went home to the house that had watched them grow together, that had absorbed every word, every argument, every moment of tenderness. It wasn’t a palace. It wasn’t even symmetrical. But it was layered now—with truth, with trust, with time.

Inside, Avery placed her locket on the mantle beside the single photograph of her grandparents, their expressions serious, their posture formal. She stood in silence for a while before Eli joined her, wrapping his arms around her waist.

“You think they’d be proud?” he asked.

“I think they’d be surprised,” she said. “But maybe also a little relieved.”

The days after the wedding passed slowly, comfortably. January opened like a door left ajar. Eli resumed work at the garage, and Avery returned to the archive with renewed purpose. She applied for another grant—this time to turn the barn into a year-round education center. She drafted lesson plans. Partnered with a local museum. Organized a spring exhibition that would feature the personal stories gathered over the past year, each one paired with a map and a photo or item from the person’s family.

She titled it Things We Carried Forward.

Volunteers began preparing the space in earnest, sanding floors and repainting trim. Kids from the high school history club hung fairy lights and constructed folding display walls with donated plywood. Local artists offered to create signage, and Florence—still sharp despite the cold—offered to read excerpts from her journal on opening night.

The town, for all its initial suspicion, had become invested. Not everyone showed up. Some still held grudges. But enough of them returned—slowly, like streams thawing—and Avery welcomed them each with the same grace she wished had been extended to her.

In late January, she received a letter from the university where she had spoken in Austin. They were offering her a part-time remote fellowship to continue her research into rural memory systems. It paid modestly but would allow her to publish and develop new tools for the Ridgeway archive without stepping away from Alton.

When she told Eli, he simply smiled and kissed her forehead.

“You’ve got roots,” he said. “Now you’ve got wings, too.”

They celebrated that night with a bottle of wine and a homemade pasta dish that went terribly wrong. The dough stuck. The sauce burned. They ate it anyway, sitting on the kitchen floor and laughing until they cried.

By February, the days were getting longer again. The garden beds were still dormant, but the soil was beginning to soften, and Avery had plans for wildflowers. She ordered seeds by the pound and marked out rows with string and stakes. It wasn’t about beauty, though she did want color.

It was about reclamation. Planting something where fear had once taken root.

That spring, they would open the Ridgeway Education Center. They would host their first community history night. Eli would teach a welding workshop. Avery would hold a storytelling circle beneath the oaks where they’d said their vows.

And they would begin again.

Because that was the heart of everything they had learned: life was a constant return to choice. And choosing love—choosing truth, choosing home—wasn’t a one-time act.

It was a habit.

A vow made not once, but daily.

A thing done over and over, until it grew into something unshakable.

The early days of March arrived with a softness Avery hadn’t expected—gentle rains, cool mornings, the kind of cloud cover that made the world feel smaller, wrapped in quiet. The land responded in its own time. Green crept up the hills in slow waves, buds on the trees unfurled shyly, and the fields behind the house shifted from beige to gold-tinged chartreuse.

The garden beds Eli had helped her build began to take form, framed in salvaged wood and filled with rich soil brought in from a local farm. Together they planted rows of bluebonnets, Indian paintbrush, black-eyed Susans, and golden tickseed—flowers native to Texas, resilient by nature, rooted in dry earth and stubborn seasons. Every handful of seeds Avery scattered felt like a declaration. Something small, sure. But something that said: we’re still here. Still growing.
