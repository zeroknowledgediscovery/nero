Chapter One: The Crack in the Glass

Eleanor Sharpe had always trusted the night. It blanketed her town like an old, familiar quilt—patchy in places, but warm enough. The darkness came with the same rhythm each evening: porch lights flickering on, the whir of air conditioners quieting as temperatures dropped, dogs barking distantly, then silence. And yet, that Tuesday evening, something felt wrong.

It started with the window. The one in the hallway outside her bedroom.

She noticed it around 10:17 p.m., on her way back from brushing her teeth. The hallway was dim, lit only by the soft glow of a nightlight plugged in near the floor. She didn’t stop at first, not until she caught a sliver of movement—or the absence of it. A shadow that shouldn’t have shifted the way it did. She paused. Stepped back.

The window looked normal enough. Double-paned, a little dusty on the inside where she hadn’t cleaned in a few weeks. But there was a crack. Thin, almost invisible, like a silver thread sewn into the glass. She crouched, squinting. It hadn’t been there yesterday.

Eleanor pressed her finger lightly to the glass. Cold. She could feel the tiny ridge where the fracture began, trailing down like a vine. It wasn’t a stress crack. It was precise, deliberate, and curved oddly, like something had etched it with intent.

She stood, heart pacing faster than before. The house was old—1919, Victorian, inherited from her grandmother and full of quirks. She’d grown up in it, left for a few years, then moved back in after the accident. But never once in all those years had the glass cracked on its own.

The phone in her pocket buzzed. A message from Ethan.

    “You left the light on in the garage. Want me to swing by?”

She stared at the message for a moment. Ethan Grant, her former neighbor turned occasional companion. His texts always came like that—casual, like he was walking beside her, still holding on to the comfortable pretense that they were only friends.

    “Don’t bother,” she typed. “Just noticed something weird. I’ll check it out.”

    “Weird?”

She hesitated.

    “Window. Looks like someone touched it.”

    “Inside or outside?”

She didn’t answer right away. Instead, she walked to the front door, turned the deadbolt slowly, and stepped out onto the porch. The night air hit her like a slap—damp and heavy with the scent of wet earth. She circled the side of the house, her phone flashlight held low.

The grass was slick with dew, and her bare feet slipped once on the mossy edge of the pathway. She steadied herself on the side rail, then turned the light upward.

The window was five feet off the ground. And there—just beneath it—were two smudges on the white siding. Dark, crescent-shaped. Fingerprints.

Her breath caught.

    “Outside,” she finally typed.

Then, after a second:

    “Someone was here.”

The next morning, Eleanor sat across from Ethan at Cassidy’s Café, a place that pretended to be rustic but smelled too clean to be authentic. He stirred his coffee with the slow precision of someone avoiding eye contact.

“So... nothing else happened?”

“No,” Eleanor said. “But I didn’t sleep.”

“You check the locks?”

“All of them.”

Ethan looked up finally, his brows knit together. “You call the sheriff?”

“No.”

“Why the hell not?”

Eleanor sipped her tea. It had gone lukewarm. “Because there’s nothing to report. A cracked window and a few smudges? They’d write me off like everyone else.”

He frowned. “You mean—”

“I mean like my sister. Like Dr. Ramos. Like everyone who thought I imagined the voice in the basement.”

That shut him up.

The voice. Two years ago, after her return to the house, Eleanor had heard a low, droning hum beneath the floorboards. Late at night. Faint. Sometimes rising like music, sometimes clicking like bones. She’d recorded it, once. Played it for Ethan. But the sound never came through.

He’d tried to believe her.

He really had.

“I think it’s connected,” she said now, softly. “The crack. The prints. The sound before. I think someone’s watching me.”

“Why would they?”

She didn’t answer. Not directly. Instead, she glanced out the café window toward the hills that curved at the edge of town. St. Veil was a quiet place, tucked between two ridgelines, built around an old ironworks that had gone bust decades earlier. Half the homes were historical, the other half barely standing. Nothing happened here. Not since the Deacons disappeared.

Ethan followed her gaze. “You still thinking about them?”

“Their house is four blocks from mine.”

“They vanished ten years ago.”

“And their windows were cracked, too.”

He paused. Then said, quietly, “That’s a hell of a reach.”

“Maybe. But I’m going to find out.”

That afternoon, Eleanor visited the town archive—a cluttered back room in the municipal building that smelled like glue and mildew. Agnes O'Malley, the part-time librarian-slash-historian, raised an eyebrow as Eleanor entered.

“Back again?”

“I need files from 2015. The Deacon family. Police reports, if you’ve got them.”

Agnes pursed her lips. “You know most of that stuff’s gone.”

“Gone?”

“Sheriff Barnes had a flood in the evidence room. Or so he said. Funny how water damage only hits certain files.”

Eleanor didn’t smile. “Do you have anything left?”

Agnes stood and shuffled into the back. After a few minutes, she returned with a plastic binder, its spine torn.

“This is all I’ve got. Clippings. Notes from their neighbor. Old Mr. Cordell.”

“Thank you,” Eleanor said, already flipping through the pages.

The clippings were yellowed, the ink blurred in places. But one note caught her attention—a scribble in ballpoint pen, dated two days before the Deacons vanished.

    “Saw someone in their backyard again. Tall. Didn’t move right. Just stood there. Looking.”

Another note, undated:

    “Mira said her window cracked again. Always the same one.”

Eleanor’s stomach turned.

She took a photo of the page and closed the binder. On her way out, she stopped by the sheriff’s office. The clerk at the front desk, a girl named Jenny who looked barely twenty, didn’t even glance up.

“Can I speak with Sheriff Barnes?” Eleanor asked.

“He’s out.”

“Where?”

“Field call.”

“Does he still keep the damaged files?”

Jenny finally looked at her. “What files?”

“The ones from 2015. The Deacons.”

Jenny’s lips thinned. “You should go, Miss Sharpe.”

Eleanor left, but the unease followed her. By nightfall, the house felt colder. She locked every window, every door, but couldn’t shake the feeling that she’d missed something.

At 2:14 a.m., she woke to a sound.

A tap.

Then another.

She sat up, listening.

Tap.

Tap.

It came from the hallway.

She rose, heart thudding, and crept toward the door. The tapping stopped. She reached for the handle, pulled it open slowly.

Silence.

Then—

Crack.

She turned.

The window.

The glass had split again, a second line branching from the first like a jagged root.

And in the faint moonlight, pressed against the outside of the window, was a single eye.

Watching her.

Unblinking.

Eleanor stumbled backward, her heel catching on the rug as her shoulder slammed into the doorframe. The eye vanished. Just like that—gone, like a hallucination. She blinked several times, heart hammering in her chest, and staggered toward the window, not even realizing she’d picked up the old fireplace poker from beside her bedroom door. She pressed her face to the glass, squinting into the moonlit yard.

Nothing.

No movement. No footprints on the grass. No lingering shadow or silhouette. Just the garden, still and silver under the waning moon, and the dense row of hedges that lined the far end of the yard.

But she knew what she saw. That eye wasn’t a trick of the light. It had been pale—unusually pale—and too round. Almost lidless. And close, impossibly close, like it had been pressed flat against the glass without leaving any breath or fog.

Her skin prickled. She stood there for what must’ve been ten minutes, straining to hear something—anything—beyond the frantic thudding of her pulse. Nothing came. She finally exhaled and backed away from the window, never once turning her back to it.

Sleep was no longer an option.

The next morning arrived slow and grey, the sun caught behind clouds that threatened rain. Eleanor sat at the kitchen table with an untouched bowl of oatmeal in front of her and the poker still clutched in one hand. Her phone was on the table, the screen showing a half-finished message to Ethan. She’d tried to describe the eye. Deleted it. Tried again. Deleted that, too. There was no way to explain it without sounding completely mad.

The knock at the door startled her so badly she nearly dropped the poker. She stood and crossed the foyer cautiously. Through the peephole: Ethan.

He didn’t wait for an invitation. “You look like hell.”

“Thanks,” she muttered, stepping aside.

He took one look at the poker in her hand and raised an eyebrow. “Planning to joust someone?”

“I saw something last night.”

“You said that before.”

“No, Ethan. I saw someone. Or something. It was staring at me through the hallway window. The crack got worse. It looked... wrong. The eye. It wasn’t human.”

He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. “El, I want to believe you. You know I do. But you’re talking like this is a ghost story.”

“I know what I saw.”

He was quiet for a moment. Then: “Let me look at the crack.”

They walked down the hall together. Ethan crouched near the window, running his finger gently along the lines in the glass. The second crack branched out like a sharp 'Y', jagged and nearly symmetrical. “This is weird,” he murmured. “Too clean for pressure stress. You sure nothing hit it?”

“I’d have heard it.”

“You said the eye was right here?”

She nodded.

He looked outside, scanned the yard. “We should put up cameras. Just to be sure. I’ve got some spares at home. Motion-triggered. One for the back, one for the hall.”

“You think it’ll come back?”

“I think we shouldn’t wait to find out.”

By noon, they had two cameras installed. One perched on the porch roofline, angled toward the window and yard. The other fixed discreetly in the hallway corner, pointing toward the glass. Ethan checked the feeds from his phone, then gave her a short nod. “Good for now. They record to the cloud. If anything moves, we’ll know.”

Eleanor managed a half-smile. “Thanks.”

He hesitated in the doorway before leaving. “You’re not alone, okay? Even if this turns out to be... something else. I’m still around.”

She nodded, but the truth was, she felt more alone than ever. That night, she stayed in the living room with the TV on low volume and every lamp blazing. She watched old documentaries with the sound turned down, the flickering images washing the room in restless color. The window remained dark, but her eyes kept drifting back to it.

She must have dozed off at some point because the sound of her phone buzzing jarred her awake. It was 3:08 a.m.

Motion detected.

She sat up, heart already racing, and opened the camera feed on her phone. The hallway view was black. Nothing visible. Then the exterior feed loaded.

A shape stood at the edge of the frame.

It was tall. Not just tall—wrong. As though someone had taken the dimensions of a human and stretched them in strange ways. The limbs were long, too long, and the torso narrow. It didn’t move. Just stood there, half-hidden behind the edge of the hedge line.

Then, slowly, it turned its head.

No face.

Not blank, but... unfinished. Like a wax figure before the features are carved in. The pale flesh was uneven in tone, like it had never seen sunlight, and its head tilted as if it were listening to something inside the house.

Eleanor froze. She didn’t scream. Didn’t breathe.

The figure moved then, impossibly fast, darting from view in a blur that defied the limitations of the camera. The feed cut to static. A second later, the interior camera pinged.

She flipped to the hallway feed.

The window.

A third crack.

Jagged.

Wider.

There was no one in the hall.

But something had been there.

She backed slowly from the screen and locked herself in the bathroom, curling up in the tub, knees to chest, the poker across her lap. She didn’t sleep. When the morning came, she didn’t notice. The light was no longer comforting.

By Wednesday, Eleanor had stopped pretending it was in her head. She spent the day researching. The Deacons were just one of many families that had disappeared in St. Veil over the past fifty years. Most were written off as missing persons—runaways, domestic disputes gone wrong, transient workers. But a pattern emerged. Before each disappearance, neighbors reported strange noises. Lights flickering. Animals acting oddly. And almost always—cracks. In glass. In mirrors. Windows.

One name kept appearing in the margins of old reports and community bulletins: Margot Wren.

An amateur historian. Deceased. Lived in the hills just outside town. But her letters, dated as far back as the 1980s, spoke of a phenomenon she called the “Threadline.” A seam between places, drawn thin in areas of old trauma. Windows, she wrote, were the weakest points.

Not metaphorically.

Literally.

She believed something was trying to cross.

Not ghosts. Not demons.

Something else.

She called them the Hollow.

Entities without true form, seeking entry by echoing human presence. Imitating familiarity. Learning by watching. Mimicry, she claimed, was only the first stage.

Then they replaced.

Eleanor shut the laptop. Her reflection in the screen looked pale and distant. Not quite right. The air in the room felt heavier. Her ears popped slightly, like pressure had shifted.

That night, the dream came.

She was standing in front of the hallway window, but on the outside, in the garden. Her face pressed to the glass. Inside, someone moved—her own body, in her own clothes, holding the poker. But it wasn’t her. The figure turned to face the window. Smiled. The skin peeled from its cheeks in symmetrical strips, revealing teeth that didn’t end.

She woke screaming.

And this time, she wasn’t alone.

Footsteps creaked on the stairs.

Deliberate.

Slow.

Eleanor slipped from the bed and grabbed her phone, backing into the closet. Her fingers trembled as she typed.

    “Ethan. It’s here.”

Chapter Two: A Sound Like Bone

Ethan didn’t wait for further explanation. He arrived at Eleanor’s door just after four in the morning, a thin fog clinging to the street like smoke from an old fire. He was dressed in jeans, a sweatshirt, and boots with unlaced tops, and his face was pale beneath his scruffy beard. He had a crowbar in one hand and a flashlight in the other, both held low as if not to wake the sleeping houses nearby. The sky had not yet begun to lighten, and St. Veil felt suspended, as if the whole town were holding its breath.

Eleanor met him on the porch. Her expression was somewhere between relief and dread. Her hair was damp from sweat, her robe pulled tight over a tank top. She looked smaller than he remembered, not physically, but as though the edges of her confidence had been eaten away.

“I heard something,” she whispered as she let him in. “I was sure it was coming up the stairs. I hid in the closet. It stopped. But I swear, Ethan—whatever it is, it knows when I’m awake.”

He scanned the interior quickly, every light turned on, the hallway still bathed in a dim gold glow. The third crack in the window was longer now, and spiderwebbed into the lower right pane. The sight of it sent a shiver down his spine.

“I checked the cameras again just before I drove over,” he said, closing the front door behind him. “No alerts. No motion. But... the feed glitched.”

“Glitched how?”

“Like interference. Static. And for a second, I saw—” he stopped, hesitating, “—your hallway, but mirrored. Like the camera had flipped it. And then something moved across it. Fast. But it wasn’t shaped right.”

Eleanor leaned against the wall, suddenly feeling weak. “That’s how it started in the dream. Everything reversed. Like I was outside looking in.”

Ethan’s jaw clenched. He didn’t believe in much—ghosts, spirits, even God—but he believed in Eleanor. She wasn’t prone to fantasy. Whatever was happening here wasn’t ordinary, and it wasn’t going away.

“I think we need to talk to someone,” he said.

Eleanor shook her head. “The sheriff’s useless. The church—don’t even start. And I’m not letting some stranger come into this house and call me crazy.”

“I don’t mean any of them,” he said. “I mean someone who might’ve seen this before. That woman, Wren. Margot Wren.”

“She’s dead.”

“Yeah. But her nephew isn’t.”

Eleanor blinked. “She had family?”

“Isaac Wren. Lives out near Dry Hollow. Teaches folklore at the community college. Bit of a recluse. People say he’s off, but not dumb. I met him once. Did some work at his place a few years back. He collects... weird stuff. Books, old symbols. I didn’t understand half of what I saw, but he knew about things. Things nobody else talked about.”

She hesitated, then nodded slowly. “Take me to him.”

The road to Dry Hollow wound through the woods like a forgotten scar. Tall pines closed in overhead, turning the morning light to green-tinted shadow. Eleanor had brought only her bag, a notebook, and the poker. She didn’t speak much during the drive, just stared out the window, fingers tapping the armrest in an uneven rhythm.

Isaac Wren lived in a sagging farmhouse that looked like it might collapse in the next storm. Its shutters hung at odd angles, and windchimes made from deer bones rattled in the wind. A series of painted symbols—circles within circles, lines that broke apart at sharp angles—adorned the porch beams. They didn’t look decorative. They looked like warnings.

Isaac opened the door before they knocked. He was thin, older than either of them expected, with deep creases around his mouth and sharp, intelligent eyes. His sweater was moth-eaten and hung loose around his frame, and he smelled faintly of old paper and ash.

“Ethan,” he said, voice dry as bark. “You brought someone haunted.”

Eleanor stiffened.

Isaac turned his gaze to her, unblinking. “You’ve seen them.”

She nodded. “Through the window. At first, I thought... maybe I was imagining it. But now, I don’t think it’s just me.”

“It never is,” he said. “Come in.”

His house was full of artifacts—books stacked in towers, jars of yellowing herbs, wax-sealed scrolls. Animal skulls rested on high shelves, and a map of St. Veil, drawn by hand in red ink, hung over the fireplace. Strange black threads had been strung across it, connecting certain locations with pins—her house included.

“You’re on the seam,” he said, pointing to her street.

“The seam?”

Isaac sat, motioning for them to do the same. “A thin place. Where things bleed through. Sometimes it’s a house. Sometimes a mirror. But the window is always the first sign. The glass is weakest. They can’t come through yet—but they can look.”

Ethan leaned forward. “What are they?”

Isaac’s expression turned grim. “They don’t have a name. Not one we can say, anyway. Margot called them the Hollow. Empty shapes, drawn to repetition. They learn you. Study how you move, speak, sleep. And when they understand you well enough... they wear you.”

Eleanor’s voice was low. “Why me? Why now?”

Isaac reached behind him and pulled a leather-bound book from a high shelf. He opened it carefully, revealing sketches—rough charcoal drawings of tall, pale figures, eyes like mirrors, bodies stretched and broken.

“You’ve been marked,” he said. “They pick those who’ve already lost something. Grief hollows a person. Leaves space.”

Ethan shot a glance at her, but she didn’t look away. Her voice was calm. “My sister died two years ago. In that house.”

Isaac nodded. “Then you were always vulnerable.”

Silence fell. Outside, wind stirred the trees. The sky had darkened, thick clouds rolling in like bruises across the horizon.

Eleanor stood. “How do I stop them?”

“You don’t,” Isaac said. “But you can delay them. You have to confuse them. Break your patterns. Rearrange the house. Sleep in the day. Speak in riddles. And most of all—never look them in the eye again. If they know you see them, it accelerates the imitation. They get faster. Smarter.”

Ethan frowned. “We have cameras. They’ve already been seen.”

Isaac turned pale. “Then you have very little time.”

They drove back in silence, the storm beginning to rumble across the sky. Rain started as they pulled into Eleanor’s driveway, fat drops slapping the windshield in uneven rhythms. The windows of the house looked wrong, somehow—darker, heavier, as though the glass itself were warping under some unseen weight.

They entered cautiously. The house smelled different. Not bad—just... off. Like old metal and burned plastic. Eleanor’s chest tightened.

“Something’s changed,” she said.

Ethan checked the camera feeds. The recordings from the night before had corrupted. All that remained were flickering fragments—a brief flash of the hallway, then static, then a face. Not hers. Not anyone’s. Just something staring directly into the lens, its mouth stretched impossibly wide.

He didn’t show it to Eleanor.

That night, they rearranged the furniture. Moved the bed into the kitchen, covered the hallway mirror, turned every rug upside down. Eleanor started speaking aloud in riddles from an old book Isaac gave her. It felt foolish. But also strangely necessary.

At 2:43 a.m., the hallway lights flickered.

Eleanor held her breath.

The glass cracked again.

This time, the line ran straight down the center.

And on the floor, beneath the window, lay a single object.

A tooth. Human.

Still wet.

Ethan crouched beside the tooth without touching it. The thing glistened in the low light, too fresh to have been there long, too deliberate in its placement to be an accident. Eleanor stood a few feet behind him, arms crossed tightly over her chest, her face blank but her shoulders trembling. Neither of them spoke for a long while. The crack in the window groaned softly, like it was still splitting—just slower now, almost thoughtfully.

“It's a warning,” Ethan said finally, glancing up at her. “Or... maybe a message.”

“A message from what?” she asked, her voice hollow. “It doesn’t have a mouth.”

He shook his head. “No. But it wants one.”

Eleanor turned away abruptly and walked toward the kitchen, gripping the edge of the counter like it might stop her from shaking apart. “What happens when the glass gives way completely? Do they just walk in? Crawl in? What if it’s already in here?”

Ethan stood, his face tense with something between anger and helplessness. “We’re not going to let it get that far. Isaac said we could delay it. Disrupt its process. We just have to stay ahead of it, right?”

“I’m not sure I even know what time is anymore,” she murmured. “I haven’t slept properly in three nights. Every time I close my eyes, I’m back outside that window. Looking in. Watching myself.”

She turned, her face pale in the overhead light. “What if it already knows me too well?”

Ethan didn’t have an answer. He picked up the poker she kept leaning against the kitchen table and held it loosely, as if its weight anchored him to something real. “We need to go deeper. Find out more about what this thing is. Maybe there’s something Isaac missed.”

Eleanor hesitated. “I think I have something. My grandmother—she kept a journal. Back when she was dying. There were entries about dreams. Shadows. She lived in this house for sixty years, Ethan. What if it started before me?”

Together they ascended into the attic, a cramped triangular space with dust layered like sediment across everything. Cardboard boxes lined the back wall, and under a tarp was the heavy cedar chest Eleanor remembered from childhood. She hadn’t opened it since before her sister died. Her hands hesitated on the latch before snapping it open.

Inside were old letters, photographs, brittle sheets of yellowed newspaper. Beneath those, wrapped in a strip of linen, was a notebook.

Her grandmother’s handwriting was precise, slanted, and small. The ink had faded in some places but the entries remained legible.

March 3rd, 1977 – Heard it again. That awful humming. Like something speaking underwater. It comes from the hallway, always when I’m alone. Always when the moon is waning.

March 8th – Cracks in the glass. The left window, same one as before. I replaced it last fall. That makes the third pane in under two years.

March 15th – Saw Margaret’s face in the window. But Margaret’s been dead for five years. It looked at me like it wanted something.

Eleanor flipped pages rapidly. The entries grew more desperate.

April 2nd – It wears faces. Not well, but it tries. Last night it wore Henry’s. Stood in the garden and waved. Henry died in 1962. Buried with no teeth.

She stopped cold.

“Buried with no teeth,” she repeated aloud.

Ethan leaned over her shoulder. “The tooth.”

She nodded. “It’s trying to speak. Isaac said they wear people. But maybe they wear memories, too. Old grief. This thing—it’s been here longer than I ever guessed. Maybe it clings to sorrow like a vine.”

They carried the notebook downstairs. The house felt heavier now, like it resented the intrusion. The cracks in the windows weren’t just growing—they were branching. At each seam of glass, the lines had begun to intersect, forming crude spirals. Like something trying to mimic symbols it didn’t understand.

That night, they didn’t sleep at all.

They sat in the kitchen with a lantern between them, poring through every inch of the journal. Outside, the storm returned. Not thunder and lightning this time—just wind. Fierce and relentless, it rattled the windows until the house seemed to groan with exhaustion. And above the wind, from somewhere within the walls, they heard it again.

That hum.

Low. Inhuman. Neither vocal nor mechanical. A pressure, vibrating the air in an almost imperceptible way. Eleanor dropped the journal, her hands clutching her ears instinctively. “It’s in the walls.”

Ethan stood, lantern in hand, and walked to the hallway.

“No,” she hissed. “Don’t go near the window.”

He ignored her. The hallway was quiet. Too quiet. The hum was louder here, like it had gathered beneath the floorboards. And then, just as he reached the crack-riddled pane, he saw it again.

A face in the glass.

But not watching. This time, it was on the inside.

He reeled back. The reflection didn’t move. It stood exactly where he had been a moment before, mirroring his position. But the eyes—those weren’t his eyes. They were wide and too round, and behind them was nothing but grey fog.

“Eleanor,” he said, voice tight. “You need to see this.”

“No,” she whispered from the kitchen. “I can’t. I’m not supposed to. It learns faster when I do.”

“It already knows us.”

She approached slowly. Together, they stood in front of the window. The figure mirrored them both now, a twisted reflection—Eleanor with a mouth too small, Ethan with fingers too long. They stood in identical postures, only slightly distorted. Like a sketch redrawn too many times.

And then, the mirrored Ethan smiled.

Its teeth were all the same size. Every one a molar.

The glass pulsed outward. Not shattered. Not broke. It flexed, like skin.

Ethan raised the poker.

But the figure didn’t lunge. It didn’t break through. Instead, it pressed one pale finger to the inside of the window—its side—and drew slowly, deliberately, a symbol.

The same spiral.

But this one was perfect. Not scratched or crooked. It understood the shape now.

“I think it’s finished learning,” Eleanor said softly.

They spent the rest of the night barricading the hallway. Furniture stacked against the walls. The window covered in black plastic and duct tape. It was a pathetic gesture, but it made them feel better. The sun rose reluctantly, bleeding pale orange across the sky like an infected wound. Eleanor hadn’t felt real morning in days.

By nine a.m., Ethan was asleep on the couch, the poker across his lap. Eleanor stood at the sink, washing a cup with water that felt too cold, her hands moving automatically. Her reflection in the kitchen window looked dull and grey. She frowned and tilted her head.

The reflection didn’t.

She dropped the cup.

It shattered, and Ethan jolted awake. He looked up at her face, still twisted with confusion and fear.

“What is it?”

She pointed with a shaking finger.

“I think it’s inside now.”

Chapter Three: Through the Threshold

It was a strange thing, Eleanor thought, to feel the presence of something unseen take root in your house. Not enter it—no, that was too sudden a word, too clear-cut. This was subtler. A creeping, ambient shift in the atmosphere, like walking into a room and forgetting why you came. It didn’t make itself known with footsteps or broken locks or swinging doors. It simply was. And somehow, it had always been.

The reflection in the kitchen window lingered for less than five seconds after she pointed it out. It blinked—once, deliberately—and then it was gone. Not vanished. Not fled. Just... absorbed, as if it had never existed. Ethan stood beside her now, squinting at the glass, then checking their own faces in its faint sheen. Both looked normal, shaken but normal. No false smiles. No mirrored gestures. No spirals traced in the condensation.

“It’s not just mimicking anymore,” Eleanor said, voice brittle. “It’s choosing when to appear. When not to.”

Ethan looked grim. “Which means it knows when we’re watching. Maybe it always did.”

They packed bags that afternoon—not to flee, but to prepare. Eleanor retrieved the journal again and began cross-referencing the spiral symbols against what Isaac had shown them. Ethan drove into town to buy thick blackout curtains, thermal blankets, and a handheld EMF reader from a novelty shop that catered to amateur ghost hunters. He brought food, batteries, extra memory cards for the cameras.

They weren’t running.

They were settling in.

Back at the house, Eleanor dug deeper into the attic storage. Between old boxes of linens and a crate of VHS tapes, she found another journal. Not her grandmother’s. This one was older, covered in a scaly black leather that stuck slightly to the touch. Inside were hand-drawn illustrations—some in ink, others in what looked disturbingly like dried blood. It was in Latin, mostly. She didn’t read Latin. But between the glyphs and marginalia, there were occasional notes in English, perhaps added later.

They live behind the mirrors, under the floorboards, inside the glass. They wear you from the inside out. They use what you love against you. They only imitate until they understand the soul, and then they become.

She shivered.

Below that:
Break the pattern. Break the face. Disfigure the window. Fragment the reflection.

She read the line three times. Her heart raced, not with fear, but with a dangerous idea.

“What if,” she said when Ethan returned, “what if we can stop it by corrupting the space it uses to watch? If it’s coming through the window, maybe it’s not just an entry—it’s a mirror. A portal of sorts. If we distort that portal, maybe we distort its image of us.”

Ethan looked at the window, now layered in thick plastic and backed by a bookshelf. “You want to break it?”

“Not just break it,” she said. “Change it. Disfigure it. If it sees us wrong, maybe it can’t finish the process.”

He didn’t argue. They were well past reason now. Together, they tore down the makeshift barricade and peeled back the black plastic. The glass shimmered faintly in the morning light. The spiral symbol was still etched faintly in the lower pane. Eleanor fetched a hammer and a small chisel from the basement.

“What if it retaliates?” Ethan asked.

“It already is.”

She started with the edges, chipping away small shards in irregular lines. Then they cracked a corner and spiderwebbed it further. They scraped at the spiral, distorting its form until it was no longer recognizable. The pattern, once eerily symmetrical, now looked chaotic, frayed. As the cracks spread across the pane, the hum returned—but this time not from the walls.

It came from the glass.

The window vibrated with a low resonance, almost like a scream muffled by miles of stone.

Eleanor backed away. “That’s not feedback.”

Ethan grabbed her arm. “It’s pushing back.”

The window shuddered. A long fissure split the center. A gust of freezing air burst from it—not wind, not natural. It was colder than any air she’d felt, like it had never touched sun. Like it came from a place without time.

They stumbled backward as the window shattered.

But not outward.

Inward.

The glass did not fall, did not collapse—it inverted, as though sucked through an invisible membrane. And in its place was not a hole, nor a void, but a surface. Glossy. Perfect. A mirror. And their reflections were no longer their own.

The figures in the mirror did not move in sync. One tilted its head too slowly. The other blinked only one eye. Their skin had an uncanny pallor, faintly bruised and waxen.

Ethan raised the poker.

The mirror rippled.

His reflection opened its mouth.

The sound was unbearable—a wet, rattling series of clicks, followed by a long exhale that vibrated through their spines. It didn’t speak in language. It spoke in memory. Eleanor could feel it brushing against her mind, rifling through images, dreams, regrets. Her sister’s face. The moment of her death. The scream Eleanor never let out. The silence that followed.

“No,” she whispered. “That’s not yours.”

She stepped forward, lifted the chisel, and drew it slowly across her own cheek.

A shallow cut.

The pain was real.

The mirror recoiled.

Her reflection screamed—a grotesque distortion, mouth yawning far too wide, eyes rolling back in their sockets. The mirror pulsed again and cracked. Tiny fissures.

Ethan shouted. “It’s working!”

The room began to twist. Light bent unnaturally, shadows stretching into corners where they shouldn’t reach. The sound returned—a droning hum that shifted into what almost resembled words. A woman’s voice. Then a child’s. Then something that sounded like Eleanor, only... wrong.

“I am here now,” it said.

The mirror imploded.

Shards flew backward, dissolving before they hit the floor. The window was gone. In its place: nothing. Not a hole, but an absence. A perfectly smooth, black rectangle.

They stood in silence.

Neither moved.

Then, slowly, the rectangle faded into the wall like a dying ember.

And just like that, the pressure lifted.

The house exhaled.

The humming stopped.

The lights stabilized.

But neither of them spoke. Not yet. Not until Eleanor reached out and touched the wall where the mirror had been.

It was warm.

Too warm.

“Did we trap it?” she asked.

“I don’t think so,” Ethan replied, his voice barely audible. “I think it retreated.”

“To where?”

He looked at her, then at the surrounding room.

Eleanor turned toward the hallway mirror.

It was fogging.

From the inside.

The fog on the hallway mirror thickened until it obscured the glass entirely, a milky veil that moved slowly, like breath over ice. Eleanor approached it cautiously, heart pounding, unsure whether to cover it again or confront it. Her reflection didn’t appear. There was no outline, no shadow—just the pulsing, opaque mist, alive and shifting. She reached out but stopped short of touching it. After what had just happened with the window, she didn’t trust any surface in the house to behave normally.

Ethan moved up beside her, poker still in hand, his expression tense but resolute. “We need to get rid of it. Every mirror. Every pane of glass. We can’t give it another opening.”

“I don’t think that matters anymore,” she said quietly. “It’s in the house now. I can feel it.”

“We weakened it. We made it retreat.”

“Not defeated. Just slowed.”

He exhaled hard, running a hand through his hair. “Then we stay ahead. Keep Isaac’s rules. No patterns. No sleep where it expects. Nothing familiar. If we make it hard to find us in our own home, maybe it can’t latch back on.”

Eleanor nodded, even as doubt crept in. She turned away from the mirror and went room by room, locating every reflective surface—her phone screen, a silver spoon, the tiny mirror in her makeup drawer. She covered them with cloth, duct tape, old pages from her grandmother’s journal. When she was done, it felt as if the house had gone blind.

But the feeling didn’t last.

That night, the house moaned. Not like wood expanding in the cold or pipes shifting with heat. It was deeper, more mournful. The sound came from the walls again, this time with a rhythm that pulsed like a heartbeat. Eleanor lay on the kitchen floor beneath a blanket, her bag as a pillow and Isaac’s book clutched to her chest. She hadn’t slept, but exhaustion tugged at her like gravity. Her thoughts were fractured, jumping from idea to idea with little cohesion.

What if it didn’t need the mirrors? What if the mirrors were only the first way in, and once it had entered, it could use anything?

She thought of her sister.

Lily had died in that very house, two years ago, in the bathtub. An overdose, they said. But Eleanor had always wondered if it had been more than that. Lily had called her the night before, crying, saying she was scared. Said something was watching her from inside her dreams. Eleanor had dismissed it as the drugs. Now she wasn’t so sure.

She stared at the ceiling, trying not to think of her sister’s pale face. Trying not to remember the way her mouth had hung open. The way the bathroom mirror had shattered when Eleanor found her.

Had it started then?

Had the thing been waiting all this time?

At some point, she drifted off.

She dreamed.

She was back in the garden, barefoot on the damp grass. The windows of the house all glowed from within, like every room was lit by fire. Her reflection moved independently in every pane—sometimes waving, sometimes crying, sometimes clawing at the glass as if begging to be let out. And then, in the attic window, she saw Lily.

Lily was smiling.

Her eyes were wrong.

“I’m still here,” Lily said, voice too clear, too crisp. “I never left.”

Eleanor screamed herself awake.

Ethan was standing over her, eyes wide. “You said her name,” he whispered. “In your sleep. You kept saying it.”

She sat up, gasping. “She’s in the attic. I saw her.”

“Eleanor—”

“No, listen! I saw her. But it wasn’t her. It was wearing her.”

They stared at each other for a long moment, then stood in unison and climbed the stairs to the attic. The air grew colder with each step. At the top, the door creaked open on its own. Eleanor hesitated, then stepped inside.

The attic was dark, but not empty.

The far wall, where they’d found the journal, now held something new: a tall, narrow mirror they had never seen before. Ornate, with a golden frame and beveled edges, it stood upright against the wall like it had always belonged there. But neither of them had ever brought it up.

Eleanor’s voice trembled. “That wasn’t here before.”

Ethan nodded slowly, face pale. “It brought it. Or made it.”

The mirror shimmered. Faintly. Like the surface of water disturbed by breath. In the center was Lily’s face—clear, vivid, beautiful. Her skin flawless. Her eyes human. She smiled gently, like she used to when Eleanor was a child afraid of storms.

“Ellie,” she said, soft and mournful.

Eleanor stepped forward, her breath caught in her throat. “Lily?”

“I was lost,” the voice continued. “But I’ve been watching. You don’t have to be scared anymore. I’m here now.”

Behind her, Ethan said nothing.

Lily reached out, palm pressed to the inside of the glass.

Eleanor moved closer.

And then the smile twisted.

Just slightly. Not grotesque—subtle. Like a mask slipping.

“Let me out.”

Eleanor stopped.

“No.”

Lily’s face flickered.

“Let me out.”

It wasn’t a plea this time. It was a demand. A command.

The mirror vibrated. A thin crack slid across the glass.

Ethan grabbed her arm. “Back away. Now.”

Eleanor hesitated—but the illusion was gone. Her sister’s face melted into waxy nothing, then reshaped into a faceless form. The same pale imitation from the hallway. It screeched—a sound that pierced through bone—and pressed both hands to the inside of the mirror, pushing as if against elastic skin.

The attic windows shattered inward.

Wind roared.

They fled.

The following morning, Isaac Wren arrived at the house unannounced. He looked worse than before—his eyes bloodshot, his hands shaking. He walked straight to the kitchen, sat down, and spoke without preamble.

“I felt it. Last night. The mirror opened.”

Eleanor nodded slowly. “It showed me my sister.”

“It’ll use anything it can pull from your memory. You have to understand—it doesn’t create. It reflects. It echoes. But once it echoes clearly enough, it becomes.”

Ethan paced nearby. “We broke one of the windows. Altered it. It fought back, but it worked. Sort of.”

Isaac shook his head. “The glass is just a skin. You peeled it back, but the body’s still beneath. The only way to sever it is to find the source. The first reflection. The original image. The mirror it came through.”

Eleanor leaned forward. “The attic?”

“Maybe,” Isaac said. “But I think it’s older than that. I think it’s tied to the land itself. To the house. Maybe even deeper.”

“Like under the house?” Ethan asked.

Isaac nodded. “You ever check the crawlspace?”

“No,” Eleanor said. “Never been down there.”

“Then that’s where we go,” he said grimly. “Because if it’s hiding its heart, it’ll bury it deep.”

They spent the rest of the day preparing.

And when the sun dipped below the trees and the shadows stretched long across the floor, they opened the hatch under the pantry and descended into the dark.

The air beneath the house was thicker than it had any right to be—dense with moisture and a rot that didn’t smell quite like decay, but more like something long forgotten. The crawlspace extended deeper than Eleanor remembered from when she was a child, when she used to imagine monsters in the dark corners of the floorboards. Now, crouched under the beams with a flashlight in her hand, she realized she might not have been wrong.

The space had warped.

The ceiling dipped lower the farther they went, but the floor sloped down unnaturally, as if the earth had been hollowed out by invisible hands. The walls of dirt were damp and glistening, lined with roots that pulsed faintly as if drawing in unseen breath. The flashlight beams wobbled along the walls as the three of them—Eleanor, Ethan, and Isaac—made their way forward.

“No one’s ever dug this deep under the foundation,” Ethan whispered, ducking under a beam. “This isn’t part of the original house. It’s... carved.”

“Or grown,” Isaac muttered, brushing one of the pulsing roots. He withdrew his hand quickly, frowning.

Eleanor stopped at a sudden turn in the path. Ahead, the dirt curved into a wide basin—like a crater beneath the house. At its center stood something utterly out of place: a large, oval mirror, framed in blackened wood twisted into thorn-like points. It stood without support, rooted into the dirt, vibrating faintly in the torchlight. Around it, hundreds—maybe thousands—of teeth were scattered in perfect concentric circles, like offerings to a god.

Eleanor couldn’t breathe.

It was the same mirror from her dream. From Lily’s dream. From the attic—but older. More primal.

Isaac stepped forward, kneeling by the edge of the basin. “This is the origin. This is the reflection it started from. A mirror like this doesn’t belong to one home—it belongs to the place. The town. The line of memory stitched across blood and death. Your grandmother. Your sister. The Deacons. This is the mirror they all touched, one way or another.”

“Why is it under my house?” Eleanor asked, voice hoarse.

Isaac didn’t answer right away. He stood slowly, face drawn.

“Because something drew it here. Or something was left behind. Some echo that never faded.”

Ethan stepped toward the mirror. “So we destroy it.”

Isaac raised a hand. “Wait. You can’t just smash a mirror like this. It’s not glass anymore—it’s a door. And it’s open. You shatter it while it’s open, you might bring something through. Or worse—trap someone in.”

Eleanor’s heart began to race. “Then what do we do?”

“There’s a ritual,” Isaac said carefully, pulling a folded, brittle page from his jacket. “It’s not an exorcism. Not really. More like... severing a thread. You sever the reflection’s hold over this world. It needs blood. Salt. Fire. And most importantly—recognition. The thing needs to see itself as false.”

“Then we let it look,” Eleanor said. “We force it to see what it is.”

They began the preparations quickly. Isaac poured a circle of salt around the basin, murmuring old Latin phrases under his breath. Ethan gathered dry brush and old newspapers from the crawlspace’s edge, creating a ring of kindling near the mirror’s base. Eleanor stood silently in front of the mirror, watching the surface pulse and swirl like oil on water.

The reflections hadn’t appeared yet.

But she could feel them close. Waiting.

“Once we start,” Isaac warned, “you can’t look away from the mirror. No matter what it shows. You look away, it knows. And it wins.”

“I understand.”

Ethan held her hand tightly for a moment. Then the ritual began.

Isaac lit the fire.

The flames surged around the basin, brightening the dark with flickering orange. He began chanting the words on the old page, voice rising and falling like a dirge. Eleanor stared into the mirror.

The surface rippled.

Then it opened.

Faces emerged.

Dozens of them. Her mother, her grandmother, Lily—again and again. The Deacons, the children she’d passed in town, people she’d only seen in dreams. All their faces wore that same uncanny imitation. Mouths too stiff, smiles too rehearsed. The reflections stepped forward, reaching out through the glass, pushing against it as if the surface thinned with each breath.

One of them looked just like Eleanor.

It moved differently—elegant, practiced, with a slight delay, like an actor forgetting her cue. The fire flared around them, and Isaac’s voice intensified.

“Speak to it,” he shouted.

Eleanor stepped closer to the glass.

“You’re not me,” she said. “You never were.”

The imitation smiled. “I’m better.”

“No. You’re hollow. Empty. You wear memories like a coat, but you don’t feel them. You copy. You don’t become.”

The mirror cracked slightly.

The imitation frowned. “I remember Lily’s death.”

“You remember how it looked. But you didn’t hear her scream. You didn’t run down those stairs. You didn’t touch her body. You weren’t there when the world stopped turning.”

The reflection’s eyes grew darker.

“You’re nothing,” Eleanor said, stepping into the salt circle. “You’re a shadow. And I’m done carrying you.”

Isaac threw a vial of blood onto the flames.

The mirror screamed.

It wasn’t a sound—more like a pressure, a violent release of sorrow and fury. The surface imploded, folding inward like a collapsing lung. Shards of black glass sucked into themselves until nothing remained but a scorched impression in the dirt.

Then silence.

The air shifted again.

Warmth returned.

The roots stopped pulsing.

And just like that, it was gone.

Isaac slumped to the ground, exhausted. Ethan pulled Eleanor into his arms, shaking as hard as she was. They didn’t speak. There was nothing left to say.

They ascended the stairs an hour later. The house felt lighter. No hum. No crackling. No mirrored breath. Just quiet.

Peaceful.

As they reached the kitchen, Eleanor paused, turned, and looked at the covered hallway mirror.

She uncovered it.

Only her face stared back. Tired. Real.

And behind her, Ethan smiled—no extra teeth. No delay.

She nodded.

It was over.

At least, for now.

Chapter Four: The Shape of Silence

One week passed.

The cracks in the walls had stopped growing. The windows remained intact. The mirrors reflected only what they should. The house, once swollen with unseen weight, had exhaled at last, and Eleanor Sharpe could finally walk through her home without holding her breath.

She no longer slept in the kitchen. Her bed was back in the bedroom, the hallway window was boarded permanently, and the attic was locked with a bolt Isaac had installed himself. The mirror beneath the house was gone—or destroyed—or buried beneath something deeper than earth.

Isaac had vanished shortly after they’d returned aboveground. He said little, only that he needed to return to his maps and old texts. He left them both with one final warning: “It doesn’t die. It only forgets. You must, too. Or it finds a way back.”

Ethan stayed for another four days. They repaired the walls, patched up the damage in the attic, and replaced the window entirely with thick, frosted glass. The house became livable again—functional, familiar. But the familiar now had edges.

And Eleanor couldn’t forget.

Not yet.

She still heard it sometimes. Not the hum—that had stopped. But in the dead of night, when the wind dipped low and the trees outside swayed against the siding, she’d hear a breath. Not hers. Not Ethan’s. Just a hush, like something drawing air not to speak but to mimic the idea of it. It never stayed long. But it never fully left either.

On the eighth day, Ethan left.

He kissed her cheek at the door, lingered as though he wanted to say something more, then walked back to his car and drove off without looking back. She didn’t blame him. She didn’t stop him either. Whatever had happened under the house had changed them both, but it hadn’t made them more whole. It had carved something away.

That night, Eleanor took the journal back out.

Not her grandmother’s—the older one, bound in dried leather. She sat on the porch in the last light of day, reading through the faded Latin, the notations in red ink, and the ragged drawings of faces that had no eyes. She hadn’t noticed before, but one of the sketches looked eerily like the mirror in her crawlspace. Beneath it was a word she didn’t recognize: Siderum.

She copied it into her notebook.

Searched it.

It wasn’t a common term. Not in Latin, not in any modern language. But one obscure footnote in a long-abandoned academic journal suggested a possible translation: “Of the stars.”

That unsettled her more than she wanted to admit.

Had the thing been... alien? Not in the sense of little green men, but alien as in not of this world? Something that had found its way here through grief, through the thin spaces, like a disease slipping in through a paper cut? Isaac had called it the Hollow, but he also said that names didn’t matter. That it never used the same one twice.

She closed the journal and lit a cigarette. She didn’t smoke, not normally, but it gave her hands something to do. The sky was unusually clear, the stars sharp and bright above the sloped roofs of St. Veil. It was the kind of evening people photographed for memory’s sake. But even the beauty of it made her nervous now.

Because if the thing had come from beneath... could it also come from above?

The next morning, she visited the library.

Cassidy’s Café was open early, but she passed it without going in. She didn’t want to run into familiar faces today. Not Agnes, not Jenny from the sheriff’s office, not even the barista with the chipped tooth who always called her “Ms. Sharpe” like they were in a 1950s murder mystery.

The back room of the library smelled like dried glue and rain-damp paper. Eleanor found Agnes O’Malley seated at the old microfiche reader, a cup of peppermint tea steaming beside her.

Agnes looked up, startled. “Eleanor. Lord, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“I’ve seen worse,” she said. “I need your help.”

Agnes blinked. “With?”

“Historical mirrors.”

The older woman squinted. “Come again?”

Eleanor leaned in. “Have there ever been artifacts—mirrors, specifically—found in this region that people considered cursed, or... unholy? Mirrors that went missing? Ones that were documented and then erased?”

Agnes sat back, thoughtful. “You’re not the first person to ask something like that. Some years ago, a man came through—researcher, pale little fella—asked if we had records of anything like that. Said he’d traced a mirror from southern Europe to here. Claimed it went missing around 1918. Said it was tied to ritualistic disappearances. At the time, I thought he was just another crackpot.”

“What happened to him?”

“Stayed in town three weeks. Went digging near the ironworks. Then he disappeared. Left everything behind—papers, equipment, even his boots.”

Eleanor felt the cold creep in again. “Do you have his name?”

Agnes pushed her tea aside and rifled through a drawer of incident reports. After a few minutes, she pulled out a yellowed folder.

“Simon Adlai,” she said, handing it over.

Inside were fragments of his notes. References to star maps. Mentions of “reflected thresholds.” One line, near the bottom of the page, jumped out at her: “They are drawn to emotional density. Areas of prolonged suffering. They feed on memory, wear the mask of regret.”

It was all too familiar.

She thanked Agnes and left, clutching the folder like a life raft. If Simon had followed this thing from Europe, then it was ancient—far older than her house, her family, even the town. And if it had traveled that far, how many other mirrors had it left behind?

That night, she dreamt of windows. Thousands of them. Suspended in black space, each showing a different version of her house. Some burned. Some frozen. Some overgrown with vines. In one, she saw herself—but aged, with gray hair and hollow eyes, staring out from behind a cracked pane of glass.

When she woke, her bathroom mirror was fogged.

She hadn’t showered.

The next day, she drove to the outskirts of town. The Deacon house was still abandoned, its porch sagging and its windows boarded. But one of the back windows had a hole punched through it—fresh. She stepped carefully through it, heart in her throat, and made her way inside.

The living room was empty.

No furniture. No glass.

But in the center of the floor, written in ash, was the spiral.

She knelt beside it.

Faintly, like a whisper through a closed door, she heard the hum again.

Not loud. Not demanding.

Just... waiting.

She didn’t run.

She took a stick and scratched through the spiral, breaking its form, severing the circle.

The hum stopped.

For now.

Outside, the wind shifted.

Somewhere else, a mirror darkened.

She spent the remainder of the afternoon driving through the quiet streets of St. Veil, her fingers drumming the steering wheel with nervous energy as her thoughts unspooled. If the mirror hadn’t been an isolated phenomenon—if it had siblings, echoes of itself scattered across town—then it was more than a haunting. It was an infestation. One that bloomed in silence and shadow, embedding itself in reflection and memory alike.

She found herself parked outside the old Marrow house before she even realized where she was going. It hadn’t been lived in since 1986, when Ruth Marrow reportedly “went missing in her own mirror,” according to one of the town’s oldest pieces of gossip. A ridiculous tale, Eleanor used to think. The sort of thing kids whispered about at sleepovers. But now, in the quiet gravity of everything she’d seen, it carried weight.

The house was boarded and padlocked, but the back door had been forced open long ago. She stepped inside cautiously, her flashlight slicing through thick layers of dust. The house was still filled with furniture, all covered in yellowed sheets, some sagging under the weight of time and mildew. A stale smell clung to everything.

The mirror in the hallway was still intact.

Tall. Bronze-framed. Leaning slightly forward as though straining to listen.

She stood before it, watching her reflection form in the dusty glass. She waited. Counted. Twenty seconds passed. Forty. A minute.

Nothing.

And then—behind her—movement.

She whirled.

Empty hall.

When she turned back, the reflection hadn’t caught up yet.

Her image still faced away, head turned as if it hadn’t noticed her yet. Slowly, like a puppet lifted by unseen strings, the reflection turned its face toward the glass.

It smiled.

Eleanor didn’t.

She stepped back quickly, breath catching in her throat, but kept her gaze fixed. Her hand brushed against a stack of magazines on a nearby table, and she grabbed one. Without thinking, she hurled it at the mirror.

The glass rippled—not broke, but rippled—as if she’d struck the surface of a pond. The reflection laughed without sound, its shoulders jerking in a pantomime of joy. And then it started copying her again.

Only now it moved just a half second faster.

She bolted.

Back through the kitchen, down the broken steps, out into the daylight that no longer felt comforting. She drove home with the windows rolled down and the heater blasting, as though the shifting currents of air could scatter the thing that followed her.

That night, Eleanor didn’t sleep.

She set a camera up in her hallway, another in her bedroom, and a third near the boarded window. Every mirror was covered again—this time with thick canvas stapled to the frame. She scattered salt across thresholds and corners. Burned sage. Played recordings of her own voice reading nonsense syllables backwards, just to fracture the familiarity.

But at 2:19 a.m., her phone buzzed.

Motion detected.

She opened the feed, dread rising.

Bedroom camera.

At first, nothing moved. The angle showed her bed, the edge of the dresser, part of the boarded mirror. She watched for nearly a minute, eyes glued to the screen. Then, from the corner—barely within the frame—something leaned in. Not entered, not walked. Just leaned, as if stepping forward from a place that had no depth.

There was no face.

No defined shape.

But the outline shimmered.

And then the feed cut to black.

She threw off the blankets, grabbed the fireplace poker, and crept through the house. The silence was unbearable—too still, too measured. The kind of silence that suggested observation. Surveillance.

The hallway was empty.

The boards remained in place.

But in the layer of dust by the foot of her door, a single fingerprint had been drawn. Not a whole hand. Just one long, elongated finger.

Pressed. Dragged.

She didn’t scream.

Didn’t cry.

She simply turned, locked the bedroom door, and sat down in the center of the room.

“Alright,” she said aloud. “You want to know me?”

She closed her eyes.

“And I want to know you.”

For the next two hours, Eleanor wrote.

She wrote about her sister. About the night of her death. About the guilt that had carved her in half and left one part hollow. She wrote about the reflections, the fear, the changes in her house. About Isaac, Ethan, and the mirror beneath the crawlspace.

And when she was done, she walked to the fireplace and threw the pages into the flames.

The smoke twisted strangely.

Not upward—but backward.

It folded toward the wall, sank into the plaster, and disappeared. She watched it vanish with a numb understanding.

She had given it something. A piece of truth.

And for now, that satisfied it.

Three days later, she received a letter.

Hand-delivered, no postage.

The envelope was ivory, the name scrawled in old-fashioned ink.

Eleanor Sharpe
St. Veil, The Hollow Line

No return address.

Inside, one sentence:

You severed the thread, but the loom still spins.

Beneath it, a drawing.

A city skyline reflected in water.

Only in the reflection, none of the buildings had windows.

Just mouths.

Gasping.

Silent.

She folded the letter, placed it inside the leather-bound journal, and slid it back beneath the floorboards. Then she stood, stretched her arms, and faced her hallway mirror one last time before covering it again.

She would stay in St. Veil.

Not out of fear.

But because something had to remember.

Something had to hold the thread, even if it frayed.

And because someday, someone else might hear the hum.

Chapter Five: Beneath the Skin of Glass

Spring arrived with a strange inertia. St. Veil, still drowsy from winter, woke slowly—trees budding late, animals staying hidden longer than usual, and the town’s rhythm lagging like an old clock losing time. People noticed, in their own quiet ways. The café's regulars spoke in lower voices. Children stared a little too long at puddles. Some said the birds had begun flying in strange, looping patterns. Others swore they hadn’t heard them at all.

Eleanor noticed everything.

She had returned to her routines. Or tried to. The mirrors in her house remained covered. She had taken to journaling with disciplined regularity, recording every shift in the air, every irregular sound, every time she felt something watching—not out of paranoia, but documentation. She had become a chronicler. Not of her own life, but of something deeper.

She still saw Ethan, sometimes. They met for lunch once a week, usually at the bench behind the library, where the trees grew in a tight half-circle and the wind rarely reached. He had taken a job at the community center and rarely mentioned the house anymore. But his eyes always drifted toward reflective surfaces. Windows, puddles, the brushed steel of utensils. He still carried the poker in his car, hidden beneath a blanket in the backseat.

On a pale Monday in mid-April, Eleanor returned home to find the back door open.

Not wide. Just enough.

There were no signs of forced entry. No missing items. No footprints. Just the door, unlocked and yawning slightly as though someone—or something—had forgotten to close it behind them.

She stood in the threshold for a long time before entering.

The house smelled like itself—books, aged wood, dust. But something was off. A new weight to the silence. A hollow that felt intentional.

Her grandmother’s journal had been moved.

Only an inch or two on the shelf, barely noticeable. But Eleanor knew. Her habit of precise placement had grown obsessive, and she’d begun photographing shelf arrangements weekly. She checked the latest image on her phone.

Definitely moved.

She flipped through it, checking for missing pages, markings, additions.

Nothing.

And yet, near the back cover, a small photograph had been tucked between the final pages.

Black and white. Torn from a larger sheet.

It showed a woman standing in front of a tall mirror. Dressed in mourning clothes, a veil covering her face. Her hands were pressed flat against the glass, and her reflection—barely visible—wore no veil at all. The figure in the mirror stared straight into the camera. Its eyes were completely white.

On the back of the photo, a date had been written in charcoal:

March 3, 1888.

Beneath it, in unfamiliar handwriting:

We made the frame. We did not make what came through.

Eleanor felt the cold return.

Not just fear, but a kind of bone-deep awareness. The thing had not been born in her house, or even in her time. It had simply found her. Because she had seen it. Because she had been seen.

The next few days passed in a trance.

She barely spoke.

She ate only what was necessary.

And each night, as the sun fell behind the black ridgeline, she heard the faintest sound from beneath the floorboards.

A slow, irregular tapping.

No longer frantic. Not a scratching.

A pattern.

A rhythm.

Tap. Tap. Tap-tap. Tap.

Like knocking.

Like a code.

By the fourth night, she knocked back.

Just once.

She didn’t know why.

It responded immediately, mimicking her single knock.

She backed away from the floor and didn’t sleep.

The following morning, she found her front steps covered in salt. Not her doing. Not Ethan’s. Someone else had laid a line of it in a perfect semicircle, as if warding something in—or keeping something from crossing the threshold.

She swept it away instinctively, then paused.

What if they knew something she didn’t?

She checked the porch camera.

No footage.

Just static from 1:07 to 1:22 a.m.

Exactly fifteen minutes.

Later that day, she went to the town records office to dig further into the photograph’s date—March 3, 1888. After an hour combing through brittle ledgers and fading ink, she found it.

On that date, a fire had gutted the original St. Veil township chapel. Witnesses at the time reported that the blaze began in the sacristy, near a mirror imported from Europe only days before—a gift from a donor in Vienna. The official report claimed arson, though no culprit was found. Three parishioners died. Their bodies were discovered kneeling before the mirror, untouched by the flames, eyes wide open and glassy.

One survivor—a young altar boy named Samuel Birch—wrote in his statement:

The people in the mirror moved after the fire started. They didn’t burn. They looked at me like they knew my name.

Samuel Birch was later institutionalized.

Eleanor closed the ledger slowly.

There was a pattern. Not of events—but of proximity.

Every major incident involving the mirror occurred in moments of isolation. Not in crowds. Not in full rooms. But when someone stood alone. Vulnerable. And seen.

She understood now.

The thing didn’t choose people arbitrarily.

It chose those who were watched.

Who were grieving.

Who were still listening.

That night, she left every light in the house off.

No candles.

No screens.

Only darkness.

And she sat in the living room floor, facing the boarded hallway mirror, her breathing calm and shallow.

“Come on,” she whispered. “If you want to talk, then talk.”

No answer.

But the room began to change.

She didn’t hear it—but felt it. A shift in temperature. A distortion, as if the space were being bent slightly, angled inward. A kind of warping silence fell over her, deeper than before.

And from behind the boards, something breathed.

She leaned forward, hand pressed to the floor.

“I see you.”

A slow response.

“I know.”

It wasn’t her voice.

But it wasn’t entirely foreign either.

It was a mixture.

Her cadence, her pitch, mixed with something lower, older. Like her voice reflected through a cavern.

“You’ve been here longer than me.”

“I’ve been waiting for longer than you can count.”

“What do you want?”

“To be known.”

She swallowed hard. “You wear us. But you don’t live.”

The breath behind the wall turned to a sound—almost laughter, but with no humor.

“You call what you do living? Walking shadows of memory? Bound by grief? I am not the echo. I am the lens. You just haven’t seen yourself clearly yet.”

She stood.

“No,” she said. “You don’t belong here. And I’m done being your mirror.”

The boards vibrated.

Once.

Twice.

Then stopped.

The silence returned.

But this time, it felt different. Not peace.

Absence.

The kind that comes when something has stepped away.

Or farther in.

Eleanor didn’t sleep that night.

But she didn’t speak to the mirror again.

She would wait.

Because some doors don’t close by force.

They rot slowly.

And collapse when you stop watching.

But she would keep watching.

The next morning arrived not with sun but with a heavy, leaden sky that pressed down on the town like a blanket soaked in rain. Eleanor stood at her kitchen sink, watching droplets gather on the outside of the boarded windows, their rhythm tapping a code she refused to learn. She hadn’t touched her phone in hours. Hadn’t checked her email, hadn’t returned Ethan’s last message, and hadn’t opened the journal again.

The house was too quiet.

But not empty.

Silence had a texture here now, one she could almost feel clinging to her skin. She moved differently through the rooms, not with fear, but with caution—like someone crossing ice too thin to trust, yet too familiar to avoid. The boards on the hallway mirror were still firm, unmoved. No new cracks had appeared in the glass of the house’s other windows. Yet something had shifted.

She found it that afternoon, behind the utility closet in the laundry room.

She hadn’t opened the small panel behind the dryer in years, but as she leaned in to retrieve a lost coin from the floor, she saw the outline of a door that had once been painted over. Not a crawlspace, not a vent. A deliberate door, only three feet high and set low against the wall, like something built for a child—or something that had never grown.

Her pulse quickened.

She found a screwdriver, wedged it into the seam, and pried.

The panel creaked open with a sound like paper tearing underwater.

Behind it: darkness. Not the kind made by lack of light, but a darkness that seemed to exist on its own terms. A space beyond the crawlspace. A void cut into the bones of the house.

She grabbed her flashlight, clicked it on, and crawled in.

The passage was narrow, barely wide enough for her shoulders. The walls were lined with old wood, and nails jutted out at strange angles as though they'd been driven in and pulled out repeatedly over the decades. She moved slowly, keeping her body low, the beam of her flashlight jittering ahead of her.

The tunnel turned sharply left after a few feet.

And then it opened.

Not into a room—but a cavity.

The space was dome-shaped, like the inside of a hollow sphere, the walls curving smoothly above and around. It had no obvious source of construction. No beams, no nails, no seams. And in the center of the floor sat a single item.

A mirror.

Not full-length.

Not tall.

But oval. The kind once used for brushing hair or lining the inside of a vanity case. Its surface was cracked, but not broken. It pulsed faintly when the light hit it, as though breathing.

She didn’t want to touch it.

She did anyway.

Her fingers brushed the glass.

And she was no longer in the house.

She was in a hallway lined with mirrors on both sides. Some tall. Some narrow. Some shattered. Each one reflected her—but differently. One version of her had no eyes. Another wept continuously. One bared its teeth in a rictus grin while blood poured from its ears. But they were all her. Not doppelgängers. Not illusions.

Echoes.

Memories twisted into reflections.

The floor beneath her feet was glass, and beneath that—more faces. Not hers. Strangers. Screaming, silent, waiting. She walked forward. The mirrors shifted beside her, showing rooms from her life—her childhood bedroom, her sister’s hospital bed, the hallway in the Deacon house, the fire at the chapel.

It was a library of the hollow. A record made of memories, distorted by grief.

Then she heard her name.

Not whispered.

Spoken.

“Eleanor.”

She turned.

Her sister stood at the end of the mirrored hallway.

Alive.

Whole.

Smiling.

“Come with me,” Lily said, holding out her hand. “You don’t have to carry it alone.”

Eleanor didn’t move.

Lily tilted her head, that soft expression still painted on her face, but her eyes were too wide. Her voice too level.

“You said you’d always protect me. You lied.”

Eleanor’s breath hitched.

“I didn’t know how,” she whispered.

“You still don’t.”

Lily’s skin began to flicker like candlelight.

And then her face collapsed inward like wet paper, folding and folding until there was nothing but a black void where her mouth had been. A hand reached out from the hole. A mirror hand.

Eleanor stepped back.

But the floor was gone.

She fell.

She woke in the dome, gasping, heart hammering so violently it hurt. Her hands were bleeding—thin slices across her knuckles, like paper cuts, though there was no paper. The mirror sat dormant in front of her, its pulsing gone.

She didn’t crawl out right away.

She sat in the silence, breathing in the closeness of the space, her mind struggling to understand what she’d seen.

The house wasn’t just infected.

It was a node.

A nerve.

Connected to others like it.

Each mirror—each reflective surface—wasn’t just a passage. It was a lens into the broken paths of memory, where the Hollow watched and chose and waited.

She was part of it now.

Maybe she always had been.

When she finally emerged back into the laundry room, dusk had fallen. The air outside the windows was thick with fog. The hallway light flickered as she passed, and the salt circle she’d poured the night before at her bedroom door had been broken.

One word had been written on the floorboards in what looked like soot:

Closer.

She didn’t run.

She didn’t cry.

She picked up the fireplace poker, sat on the floor, and began writing again. Not in her journal—but on the walls.

Symbols.

Marks of disruption.

Signs Isaac had taught her to scatter—symbols that warped memory, interrupted pattern, severed recognition.

Because if she couldn’t undo it, she could at least disfigure it.

Blur the face it wore.

She worked through the night.

And when the last sigil was drawn, she stood before the boarded mirror and whispered:

“You don’t get all of me.”

For the first time in days, the boards didn’t breathe back.

The mirror, whatever lived behind it, had retreated again.

But it would return.

She knew that now.

Not tomorrow.

Maybe not next week.

But eventually.

It always did.

Because grief, once seen, could never be unseen.

And reflections never forget.

Chapter Six: The Glass That Remembers

The days following the mirror’s second retreat were unnervingly quiet. No more sounds beneath the floorboards, no fingerprints in the dust, no whispers when the lights went out. It was, in every practical sense, over. Or pretending to be.

Eleanor didn’t believe in quiet anymore. Silence, yes—she knew silence intimately now—but not peace. She went through her routines like someone moving underwater, slow and deliberate. The act of making tea, folding laundry, checking the porch camera—all of it felt like a performance for something that might still be watching.

She had left the mirror sealed behind canvas and nails, layered with the symbols she now trusted more than any prayer. Her walls bore markings in chalk and salt, and the mirror beneath the laundry room had been buried in a makeshift tomb of poured concrete. Still, sometimes she woke from sleep with the taste of ash in her mouth and the faint memory of her sister calling her name from behind a wall of glass.

The dreams came more often now. But they were different.

They weren’t frightening. Not the way they had been.

They were instructional.

In one, she stood at the edge of a lake with black water. Across it, mirrors hung from skeletal trees, their surfaces rippling without wind. In each, she saw versions of herself living lives she never had: married to a stranger, raising children, growing old in a house she didn’t recognize. None of those lives were hers, but they all wore her face. And each of them turned to look at her as she approached.

“You’re the one who remembers,” they said in unison. “The one who broke the pattern.”

She didn’t respond. She didn’t know how.

When she woke from that dream, the window beside her bed—sealed shut for months—was ajar.

There were no footprints. No sign of forced entry. Only a thin trail of condensation on the floor. Not water. Not ice.

Breath.

Eleanor sat down at her desk and began writing letters—not to Ethan, not to Isaac, not to anyone she expected to respond. They were messages to people she hadn’t met yet. People who would come after.

She titled the first one: If You Hear the Hum.

In it, she detailed everything.

Not just the events, but the sensations. The subtle signs that marked the Hollow’s presence. The emotional pull toward memory. The strange stillness in reflections. The pressure that built just before the patterns resumed. She wrote about the rules Isaac had taught her, and the ones she’d discovered herself:

    Mirrors are memories.

    Grief draws lines.

    Reflection is not truth.

    Interrupt the rhythm before it speaks your name.

She sealed the letter in a waterproof envelope and tucked it into the floor beneath her bed, beside the concrete slab. She marked it with a symbol of interruption—a jagged, inverted spiral. A broken circle.

Over the next week, she wrote five more letters, each addressed simply:

To the Next.

She didn’t know who they were for. But she had a sense they would be found.

It was the twenty-second of May when Ethan returned, unannounced.

He looked older, leaner. A small scar now traced the side of his neck, like something had tried to mark him and failed. He didn’t mention it. She didn’t ask.

They sat on the porch for an hour before either spoke.

“I had a dream,” he said finally. “Not about you. About me. But you were there.”

She nodded. “What did you see?”

“I was in a city I didn’t recognize. All the buildings had windows—but no one was inside. Not even furniture. Just mirrors. Every apartment. Every shop. Every floor.”

“Did they show anything?”

“Nothing at first. Then they all turned toward me. Like they moved. And my face was in every one. But it wasn’t mine. They all smiled.”

Eleanor exhaled slowly. “They remember you.”

He glanced sideways. “They don’t let go, do they?”

“No,” she said. “But you learn to step out of the frame.”

They sat in silence a little longer, watching the sky shift through the trees. There were fewer birds now. She hadn’t heard a crow in days. The wind had a habit of circling the same corner of the house, whistling in short, measured bursts.

“You ever think about leaving?” he asked.

“All the time.”

“Then why don’t you?”

She looked at the carved symbols along her doorframe, at the sealed mirror she refused to uncover, at the place where her sister’s reflection once tried to speak.

“Because something stayed behind. And as long as it’s here, someone has to know how to look away.”

He nodded. Said nothing more.

That night, they slept back-to-back in the living room, surrounded by open notebooks and unlit candles. The house remained still. The silence deepened.

And from beneath the floor, no sound came.

But Eleanor dreamt.

This dream was unlike the others.

She stood in a black space filled with hanging frames. None of them held glass. Just the outlines. Skeletons of mirrors. As she walked among them, she realized they hummed—not loudly, but softly, in a harmony that seemed to hold the air together. The hum carried names. Not spoken. Felt.

She reached one frame and stepped through it.

On the other side was her own house—but empty.

Time had passed. Decades, maybe. The air was still. The floors warped. A single mirror hung on the back wall, unsealed.

Inside it, her reflection stared.

Not dead. Not hollow.

Just older. Wiser. Watching.

And behind that reflection, another stood.

Faceless.

Waiting.

She woke with the phrase echoing in her skull, without knowing where it had come from:

“The reflection does not fade. It folds.”

She got up, turned on the light, and began drawing again.

Not sigils. Not warnings.

Instructions.

Because she was no longer just defending herself.

She was building something.

A guide.

A map for the mirrorless.

By June, the fog stopped rolling in at night.

Children returned to the park near the creek.

The air warmed, and for the first time in months, Eleanor allowed herself to walk past a window and glance into it without fear. Her reflection blinked when she blinked. Smiled when she smiled.

But still, some nights, she heard glass settle strangely in the walls.

Still, some dreams ended with the feeling of falling backward into her own shadow.

And she knew the truth:

The Hollow didn’t end.

It waited.

And she would wait with it.

Not as prey.

But as a sentinel.

A name it could never quite wear.

The sun hung low and red over St. Veil by midsummer, casting long, unnatural shadows that stretched over the cracked sidewalks like fingers seeking entry. The town moved more slowly in the heat. Conversations drifted into silence more often, and people began to avoid the reflective glass of shop windows—not overtly, not with any clear suspicion, but with quiet instinct, like animals sensing an old predator’s scent on the wind.

Eleanor kept her windows shaded now, not with blackout curtains, but with linen dyed a soft ochre. It allowed the light through without reflecting it. The house breathed easier with this change—less resistance in the air, fewer moments where the stillness thickened just before dusk. She kept her chalk symbols fresh, but had begun refining them, softening the angles, drawing curves instead of spikes. The mirror was still sealed, but her relationship with it had changed.

She had begun to speak to it.

Not nightly. Not even regularly. But when the silence pressed too hard against her ears and her thoughts started to circle downward, she’d kneel before the sealed glass, rest her hand against the wood, and whisper fragments from her memories. She never asked for answers. She didn’t expect them. But she offered something: continuity. A line back into herself.

If it listened, it gave no sign.

Still, she felt it waiting.

One humid evening, Ethan returned with a stack of library books and an old manila folder he’d found in the archive’s donation bin. He laid them out on her kitchen table like sacred offerings, fanning pages across the wood.

“You ever heard of Mirror House?” he asked.

She shook her head.

“It was a house in Kansas, early twentieth century. Torn down after the family inside vanished—entirely. Locals claimed the place had mirrors in every room, even the basement. Some said it was designed that way on purpose, to reflect the soul from every angle.”

He opened the folder. “Photographs. Look.”

Black and white images. Blurry, grainy, but enough to show outlines. In one picture, a child stood at the base of a staircase, eyes wide, hands raised toward a wall of mirrors. The reflections showed her reaching up, smiling.

The actual girl in the photo was crying.

Eleanor leaned in. “They weren’t watching her. They were watching out.”

Ethan nodded. “There’s a pattern. Every town, every story—it always ends the same way: silence, vanishing, forgetting. People don’t just disappear. They’re overwritten.”

She pulled the photo closer. “How do we stop that?”

He didn’t have an answer. Not yet. But his silence felt like the kind that carries weight, not absence. He was thinking of something—some puzzle piece still half-buried in the dark.

Later that night, Eleanor found herself drawn to the spiral again. Not the symbol itself, but the idea of it—the looping, recursive shape that always curved inward. She began drawing a new version. Not a closed spiral, but one that split into branches, then doubled back and forked again, resembling roots more than curves.

The image felt right.

Not protection.

Navigation.

Because this wasn’t a war against a singular entity. The Hollow wasn’t a monster to slay or a wound to cauterize. It was a landscape. A territory. One built on grief, memory, and unspoken truths.

If she couldn’t destroy it, she could map it.

By the end of July, her walls bore a network of lines. Some were symbolic, some literal. She traced her dreams, her visions, the mirrored places she had passed through in sleep, and transcribed them onto the plaster in soft graphite. The living room had become a kind of cartographic cathedral.

Visitors—rare as they were—kept their distance. Agnes from the library stopped by once, peering into the house with wary eyes and a casserole she wouldn’t bring past the doorway. Even Isaac, when he returned for a brief exchange of texts and old manuscripts, refused to step more than a few feet inside.

“You’re becoming a custodian,” he told her, his voice heavy with fatigue. “That’s a sacred task. But it comes at a cost.”

Eleanor met his gaze and asked the question that had been stirring at the base of her spine for weeks.

“Can I ever leave?”

Isaac studied her a long moment. “You can. But the place will remember you. And what it remembers, it tries to keep.”

He left without further warning.

That night, Eleanor drew her own face on the wall.

Not in detail.

Just the suggestion: the outline of her jaw, the curve of her brow, the broken spiral across her chest. She placed it within a ring of other symbols, some her own, some borrowed from the older texts Isaac had shared.

If she ever became part of the house, she wanted to be found.

Not as a victim.

As a signal.

On the first day of August, the mirrors began to whisper again.

Not in words.

Just static.

She heard it in the bathroom, as she passed the covered glass. A hiss, barely there. Not unlike a radio between stations. It faded when she paused but returned each time she turned away.

The same happened with the toaster. The metal frame of the oven. Even her phone, in standby mode, would flicker strangely, the screen glowing for a split second before falling dark again.

They weren’t messages.

They were checks.

Pings. Like sonar. Like a system trying to reestablish connection.

That evening, Ethan returned with another document—this time a handwritten letter, unsigned, left anonymously in the community center’s donation bin.

The letter was brief:

We are not alone in the glass. There are reflections that never belonged to us. They do not fade. They simply wait for the real to forget itself.

Below the text was a drawing. Another mirror. But this time, cracked into four quadrants.

Each one showed a different version of the same room.

One was bright. One dark. One upside down. One filled with ash.

Eleanor ran her finger along the edge of the page.

“Dimensions?” she asked.

Ethan looked exhausted. “Possibilities. Projections. I don’t know. But if they’re real... then maybe the Hollow isn’t a single thing. Maybe it’s a network of doorways between fractured reflections. We don’t fight it. We navigate it.”

She nodded slowly.

That night, she uncovered the hallway mirror.

Stared into it.

Her reflection looked back.

Familiar.

But slightly off.

The hairline parted just a little differently. The collar of the shirt didn’t match. The light hit it wrong.

The reflection blinked.

But she didn’t.

The glass fogged for half a second.

Then cleared.

No sound.

But a feeling.

Like the glass had remembered her.

She pressed her fingers against the mirror’s surface.

It felt warm.

Alive.

Waiting.

She whispered, “Not yet.”

Then she covered it again.

The reflection didn’t follow.

For now.

By mid-August, the town had settled into the strange lull that followed a long season of fear—too tired to ask questions, too numb to confront the fog that had never fully lifted. Most people didn’t speak about the unease anymore. They busied themselves with harvest festivals, maintenance projects, back-to-school routines. St. Veil pretended to move forward.

Eleanor knew better.

She spent her mornings tending the overgrown garden behind her house. It had started as a distraction—something to do with her hands while the silence pressed in—but over time, it became part of the ritual. The act of pulling weeds, of turning soil, of placing roots in the ground, had a certain power to it. Every stem she clipped, every flower she coaxed to bloom, felt like a small defiance against the mirror’s memory.

It was in those early hours, just as the sun began to paint the ridgelines with gold, that she sometimes caught glimpses—tiny things. A shimmer between leaves. A shape passing behind a window. No reflection. Just the suggestion of one. It never lingered. But it always looked back.

One morning, she found a mark etched into the earth behind the tomato vines. Not a footprint, not an animal track—something more deliberate. A symbol. A flattened spiral, drawn not in a complete line but with disconnected arcs, like something trying to remember how to draw it correctly.

Eleanor stared at it for a long time.

Then erased it with her trowel and didn’t mention it to anyone.

Ethan stopped coming by as frequently. Not because he didn’t care—he still checked in, left notes in her mailbox, the occasional care package—but he’d grown quieter, his energy more distant. She suspected something had shifted in him too. The Hollow had brushed him, had imprinted something subtle beneath his skin. He was trying to forget, to rebuild, to reclaim something of himself that had slipped out of frame.

She understood.

For her, forgetting was no longer an option.

She had become the house’s memory.

One evening, just before a thunderstorm rolled in, she descended again into the tunnel behind the laundry room. The concrete seal she had poured over the small mirror was unbroken, but there were cracks in the surface—not from age or pressure, but from within. Thin fissures, webbed like frostbite across the top.

She knelt beside it, resting her hand on the warm concrete. No sound came. But there was a sensation. Not breath. Not hum.

A heartbeat.

Not hers.

She stayed there a while, listening.

And for the first time, she didn’t feel afraid.

Because in that echo, she heard something else:

Loneliness.

The Hollow wasn’t just mimicry, or hunger, or malice. It was absence made aware. A structure of pain, reflection, and time—looping endlessly through every surface that could capture an image and distort it into meaning. It wasn’t looking to kill.

It was looking to be real.

And that made it more dangerous than ever.

By the end of the month, Eleanor began preparing for autumn.

She changed the linens in every room. Re-drew the protection symbols on the doorways and floors, modifying some of them with her new understanding. She marked the base of each window with a narrow line of ash, drawn with her fingers, whispering a new phrase she had composed:

“I see what is not mine. I do not keep it.”

The house accepted the words.

She could feel it.

The wood eased beneath her palms. The temperature held steady. The mirror remained dormant.

Then, on the last night of August, the lights flickered.

Not the usual, uneven buzz of aging wiring. This was different. Rhythmic. Three pulses. A pause. Then two more.

She stood up from the table and turned toward the hallway.

The mirror—still covered—trembled.

No wind. No movement.

Just a sound, barely audible. Like something tapping against the inside of the glass.

She approached carefully, one hand outstretched.

The tapping stopped.

The boards were firm. The canvas unmoved. But she felt a heat rising from the surface again, low and steady. Not threatening. Not inviting.

Just present.

Awake.

Eleanor leaned close, resting her forehead against the wood.

“You’re still here.”

She didn’t expect an answer.

Didn’t receive one.

But a memory slipped into her mind, unbidden: her sister’s voice humming a lullaby they both used to know. Not spoken aloud. Not from the mirror.

From herself.

A memory returned.

She sat down in front of the mirror and listened, tracing the tune on her knee with a finger, eyes closed.

She didn’t hear the mirror breathe.

But she felt it shift.

Somewhere in its depths, a door hadn’t closed.

And maybe never would.

The next morning, Eleanor went into town for the first time in weeks. She bought new notebooks, a few dried herbs, a set of glass vials, and a candle that smelled faintly of cedar and ink. She stopped by the café, exchanged quiet smiles with familiar faces, then walked to the edge of the old Marrow property.

The spiral was there again.

Drawn not in dirt this time, but in rust, on the side of an abandoned wheelbarrow tipped behind the barn.

She didn’t touch it.

Didn’t erase it.

Instead, she added to it—just one line, curved away from the rest, bending outward, breaking the loop.

Then she walked home.

That night, she left a mirror uncovered.

A small one.

Round, silver-rimmed, placed on the table across from her favorite chair.

She didn’t look into it directly.

But she let it sit there.

Open.

Waiting.

Because she was done hiding.

If the Hollow wanted to learn, to remember, to become—

Then it would have to do it through her terms.

Through patience.

Through boundaries.

Through stories she chose to share.

She poured a cup of tea, lit the cedar candle, and began writing in her new notebook.

The title at the top of the first page:

Reflections That Never Broke.

Chapter Seven: The Echoing Frame

Autumn arrived in a hush. Not a burst of color, not the sharp cut of wind through trees—just a gradual dulling, like the world was slipping behind its own reflection. The town’s leaves changed late that year, their burnished edges holding a shade of grey before red could form. Eleanor watched it from her porch, wrapped in a thick shawl, sipping tea that had long since gone cold.

She didn’t mind the cold anymore.

By then, the mirror had been uncovered for weeks. It remained on the kitchen table, untouched except by light and shadow, never spoken to directly. Sometimes it flickered. Sometimes it grew cloudy, as if breathing on its own. And once—just once—it reflected someone else.

Not her.

Not anyone.

Just a shape in motion, blurred and long-limbed, passing slowly through a place that looked nothing like her home.

She had watched that reflection move, silent and slow, until it stepped out of frame.

The glass stilled.

Eleanor never spoke of it.

Some doors, she now understood, didn’t lead in or out—they led across.

She recorded what she saw. Labeled the entry: Nonlocal Echo—Observed Sept 12. She was running out of pages.

In early October, a boy from town went missing.

Twelve years old. Jacob Merrin. Last seen walking home from school just before dusk. No signs of struggle. No witnesses. His phone was found beside the river, screen shattered, camera lens facing upward.

The sheriff organized a search.

Flyers went up. Volunteers scoured the woods and hills. For three days, St. Veil held its breath.

On the fourth, Ethan came to her door.

He didn’t knock. He didn’t speak.

He just held out his phone and showed her the screen.

A photograph from the boy’s phone.

In the image, faintly visible in the reflection of a muddy puddle behind him, was a figure.

Tall.

Pale.

Faceless.

Eleanor took the phone from his hand, studied the image for a long time, and nodded.

“It’s trying again.”

Ethan sat down heavily on the steps. “Why him?”

“Because he saw it,” she said. “And it saw that he saw. It only ever needs that much.”

He looked at her. “What do we do?”

She didn’t answer.

Not yet.

That night, she placed the small silver mirror beneath her bed.

She set her notebook beside her and waited.

Sleep took her quickly.

And in the dream, she walked a corridor of mirrors again.

Only this time, she was not alone.

Beside her, a boy walked barefoot, dragging his fingertips across the frames. His image did not appear in any of them.

“Jacob,” she said.

He turned to her, eyes wide, lip trembling. “I thought it was someone I knew.”

She knelt beside him. “It wasn’t.”

“They showed me my dog,” he said. “Said he missed me.”

The mirrors trembled, but did not break.

“They copy what we grieve,” she said gently. “It’s how they open the door.”

“I want to go home.”

Eleanor looked around.

No exits. No doorways.

Only reflection.

But the dream had a weight, a logic.

She reached into her coat, pulled the broken spiral she had drawn days earlier from her pocket, and held it in front of the nearest frame.

The mirror cracked.

Not shattered—fractured—like a shell splitting open.

Light poured out.

Jacob stepped forward.

She did not follow.

She couldn’t.

The boy turned just before the light swallowed him.

“You’re staying?”

She nodded. “For now.”

Then he was gone.

She woke with a jolt.

The mirror beneath her bed was cold.

But the glass had a hairline crack across its surface.

And outside, someone was knocking gently on her front door.

She answered without hesitation.

It wasn’t Jacob.

It was Isaac.

He looked thinner. Paler. His eyes sunken from too many hours staring into flame and ink. But he smiled when she opened the door.

“You brought someone back.”

“I think so.”

He nodded slowly. “Then it’s shifting again.”

They sat at her table, the small silver mirror between them.

Isaac reached into his satchel and pulled out a thin, handmade book. The paper inside was yellow, filled with scrawled lines and uneven handwriting.

“This is the original ledger,” he said. “The first one. From Vienna. The man who crafted the first mirror—they say he didn’t build it to see himself. He built it to divide himself.”

Eleanor traced the edge of the book. “A severance.”

“Yes. From grief, from memory. He thought if he could leave his worst moments on the other side of the glass, he could walk free.”

“But it didn’t stay separate.”

“No,” Isaac said softly. “It grew.”

They sat in silence for a long time.

Finally, Eleanor said, “We need to find the other mirrors. The ones still connected. I think some are still open.”

Isaac nodded. “And some are waking.”

They began traveling that week.

Not far—not yet.

Just neighboring towns, dusty libraries, overgrown ruins of old houses with glass still clinging to the frames. They found three mirrors that hummed beneath the touch. One of them sang a note too low to hear but felt it nonetheless in their teeth.

Eleanor drew new symbols over each.

Marks not of closure, but of translation.

Not silencing the mirror, but teaching it another language.

Because if the Hollow was still learning how to be, then she could choose what it learned.

She could shape the echo.

Guide it away from hunger.

And toward something else.

Not peace, perhaps.

But understanding.

On the final night of October, a storm rolled through St. Veil. The sky cracked open and rain fell in vertical lines like falling glass. Eleanor stood in her hallway, facing the uncovered mirror.

It did not speak.

But her reflection blinked.

Then stepped back.

Revealing another shape behind it.

Tall.

Thin.

Silent.

It did not mimic.

It simply watched.

And then, slowly, it stepped aside.

Revealing the outline of a door.

Not real.

Not in the glass.

But in memory.

And Eleanor understood.

Not everything that looks like you wants to replace you.

Some just want to be seen.

And not forgotten.

She reached toward the glass.

And whispered:

“I see you still.”

The mirror didn’t answer.

But it remembered.

The storm passed before dawn, but the scent of it lingered—ozone and soil, the metallic smell of sky turned inside out. Eleanor stood barefoot in the kitchen, watching water bead along the windowpanes, waiting for the first breath of light to draw sharp lines back into the world. The house was quiet again, though the quiet no longer felt dangerous. It was the hush of a stage between scenes. Anticipation, not dread.

She spent the morning cataloging. The mirror ledger Isaac had brought contained diagrams that matched the frames they’d encountered, many marked with runes or locations long erased from modern maps. Some had dates going back to the 1600s.

“These are seeds,” she said.

Isaac nodded. “I thought the same.”
