GORDON PYM  INTRODUCTORY NOTE        Upon my return to the United States a few months ago, after the       extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and       elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages,       accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in       Richmond, Va., who felt deep interest in all matters relating to       the regions I had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon       me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the public. I had several       reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of which were of a       nature altogether private, and concern no person but myself;       others not so much so. One consideration which deterred me was       that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time       in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write,       from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have       the _appearance_of that truth it would really possess, barring       only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us       are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence       in exciting the imaginative faculties. Another reason was, that       the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively       marvellous that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be       (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a       half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family,       and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put       faith in my veracity—the probability being that the public at       large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent       and ingenious fiction. A distrust in my own abilities as a writer       was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented me       from complying with the suggestions of my advisers.        Among those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest       interest in my statement, more particularly in regard to that       portion of it which related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe,       lately editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” a monthly       magazine, published by Mr. Thomas W. White, in the city of       Richmond. He strongly advised me, among others, to prepare at       once a full account of what I had seen and undergone, and trust       to the shrewdness and common-sense of the public—insisting, with       great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere       authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if       there were any, would give it all the better chance of being       received as truth.        Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to       do as he suggested. He afterward proposed (finding that I would       not stir in the matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in       his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my       adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the       “Southern Messenger” _under the garb of fiction. _To this,       perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating only that my       real name should be retained. Two numbers of the pretended       fiction appeared, consequently, in the “Messenger” for January       and February (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be       regarded as fiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the       articles in the table of contents of the magazine.        The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at       length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the       adventures in question; for I found that, in spite of the air of       fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of       my statement which appeared in the “Messenger” (without altering       or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all       disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to       Mr. P.’s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the       contrary. I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would       prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence       of their own authenticity, and that I had consequently little to       fear on the score of popular incredulity.        This _exposé_being made, it will be seen at once how much of what       follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be       understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages       which were written by Mr. Poe. Even to those readers who have not       seen the “Messenger,” it will be unnecessary to point out where       his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of       style will be readily perceived.  A. G. PYM.     CHAPTER 1         My name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader       in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal       grandfather was an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in       every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of       the Edgarton New Bank, as it was formerly called. By these and       other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money. He       was more attached to myself, I believe, than to any other person       in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his property       at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of       old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric       manners—he is well known to almost every person who has visited       New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I       left him for Mr. E. Ronald’s academy on the hill. Here I became       intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who       generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh—Mr.       Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many       relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. His son was named Augustus,       and he was nearly two years older than myself. He had been on a       whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and was       always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific       Ocean. I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day,       and sometimes all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would       be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories       of the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had       visited in his travels. At last I could not help being interested       in what he said, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go       to sea. I owned a sailboat called the Ariel, and worth about       seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or cuddy, and was       rigged sloop-fashion—I forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten       persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the habit       of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I       now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am       alive to-day.        I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a       longer and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party       at Mr. Barnard’s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little       intoxicated toward the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I       took part of his bed in preference to going home. He went to       sleep, as I thought, very quietly (it being near one when the       party broke up), and without saying a word on his favorite topic.       It might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in       bed, and I was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly       started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go       to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was so       glorious a breeze from the southwest. I never was so astonished       in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the       wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside       himself. He proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he       knew that I supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more       sober in his life. He was only tired, he added, of lying in bed       on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and       dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat. I can hardly tell       what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth       than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and       thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most       reasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost a gale, and       the weather was very cold—it being late in October. I sprang out       of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was       quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying       in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as       any Augustus Barnard in Nantucket.        We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to       the boat. She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the       lumber-yard of Pankey & Co., and almost thumping her side out       against the rough logs. Augustus got into her and bailed her, for       she was nearly half full of water. This being done, we hoisted       jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea.        The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The       night was very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I       stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew       along at a great rate—neither of us having said a word since       casting loose from the wharf. I now asked my companion what       course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable       we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said       crustily: “_I_ am going to sea—_you_ may go home if you think       proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in       spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated. I       could see him distinctly by the light of the moon—his face was       paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he       could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something       had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I       knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending       entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had       suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the       land—still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for       almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I could stand       it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety       of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he made       answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. “By-and-by,” said he       at length—“time enough—home by-and-by.” I had expected a similar       reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which       filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked       at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and       his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely       able to stand. “For God’s sake, Augustus,” I screamed, now       heartily frightened, “what ails you?—what is the matter?—what       _are_ you going to do?” “Matter!” he stammered, in the greatest       apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and       falling forward into the bottom of the boat—“matter—why, nothing       is the—matter—going home—d—d—don’t you see?” The whole truth now       flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised him up. He was       drunk—beastly drunk—he could no longer either stand, speak, or       see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the       extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the       bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that,       during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and       that his conduct in bed had been the result of a       highly-concentrated state of intoxication—a state which, like       madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward       demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The       coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect—the       mental energy began to yield before its influence—and the       confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous       situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now       thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would       be otherwise for many hours.        It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The       fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly       timid and irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of       managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide       were hurrying us to destruction. A storm was evidently gathering       behind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was       clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of       sight of land before daybreak. These thoughts, with a crowd of       others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a       bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond       the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going       through the water at a terrible rate—full before the wind—no reef       in either jib or mainsail—running her bows completely under the       foam. It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to—Augustus       having let go the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much       agitated to think of taking it myself. By good luck, however, she       kept steady, and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of       mind. Still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we       rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our       counter, and deluged us with water. I was so utterly benumbed,       too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. At       length I summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to       the mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been expected,       it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried       away the mast short off by the board. This latter accident alone       saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I now       boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally       over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate       death. I took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I       found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape.       Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as       there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly       a foot deep just where he fell), I contrived to raise him       partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a       rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of       the cuddy. Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could in       my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God,       and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the       fortitude in my power.        Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and       long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons,       seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat.       Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I       experienced at that moment. My hair stood erect on my head—I felt       the blood congealing in my veins—my heart ceased utterly to beat,       and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my       alarm, I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my       fallen companion.        I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large       whaling-ship (the Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons       were standing over me, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily       occupied in chafing my hands. Upon seeing me open my eyes, his       exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and       tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. The       mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. We had       been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled,       beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set,       and consequently running almost at right angles to our own       course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not       perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming       in contact—their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so       terribly alarmed me. The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately       over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have       passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible       impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from the deck of       the victim—there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling       with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was       swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her       destroyer—but this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be       remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless,       the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for       proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about       the matter. Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore       positively to having seen some person at our helm, and       represented the possibility of yet saving him. A discussion       ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it       was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells;       that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if       there was a man run down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he       might drown and be dammed” or some language to that effect.       Henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly       indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew, at a speech evincing       so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He spoke plainly, seeing       himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a       fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders       if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. He       strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)       on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm       voice, Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went       cleverly about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it       was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that       any individual could be saved—allowing any to have been on board       the boat. Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and myself       were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought       about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune       which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special       interference of Providence.        While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat       and jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke       up as having seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of       the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long       and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment,       starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. He       would say nothing else—repeating his cry impatiently, back water!       back water! The men put back as speedily as possible, but by this       time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway,       although all hands on board were making great exertions to take       in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung       to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another       huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of       water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety       was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be       affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining       bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and       beating violently against it with every movement of the hull.       After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the       ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally       disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board—for the       body proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the       timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the       copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship,       and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The       head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green       baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck,       forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right       ear. I was immediately put to bed—although life seemed to be       totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain,       however, treated me with every attention—to make amends, I       presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in       the previous portion of the adventure.        In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship,       although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not       been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our       boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that       he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring       of the tempest. This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in       their search for more than half an hour, although repeated       signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although       every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them       with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is nearly       impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could       have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built,       however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since       had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some       life-boats used on the coast of Wales.        After searching in vain for about the period of time just       mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. They had       scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark       object that floated rapidly by. They pursued and soon overtook       it. It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel’s cuddy.       Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies.       Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a       rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I       had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt,       for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so       doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving       his life. The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down       her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as       might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water       rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with       other fragments, no doubt) to the surface—Augustus was buoyed up       with it, and thus escaped a terrible death.        It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin       before he could give any account of himself, or be made to       comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our       boat. At length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of       his sensations while in the water. Upon his first attaining any       degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface,       whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a       rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. In an       instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his       head striking violently against a hard substance, he again       relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in       fuller possession of his reason—this was still, however, in the       greatest degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some       accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his       mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some       freedom. Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly       before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his       back. Of course, as long as he could have retained this position,       it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned.       Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this       post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help.       Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been       obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into       the sea, had given himself up for lost. During the whole period       of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the       Ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his       disaster. A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire       possession of his faculties. When he was finally picked up, every       power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was       nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he       became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself—I was       resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and       after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours       and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot       oil—a proceeding suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck,       although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real       consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects.        The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning,       after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off       Nantucket. Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr.       Barnard’s in time for breakfast—which, luckily, was somewhat       late, owing to the party over night. I suppose all at the table       were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded       appearance—of course, it would not have borne a very rigid       scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way       of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in       Nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story       told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at       sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference       either to the Ariel, my companion, or myself. We two have since       very frequently talked the matter over—but never without a       shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly confessed       to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so       excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat       he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt       himself sinking beneath its influence.     CHAPTER 2         In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce       inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data.       It might be supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just       related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for       the sea. On the contrary, I never experienced a more ardent       longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a       navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance.       This short period proved amply long enough to erase from my       memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the       pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of       the late perilous accident. My conversations with Augustus grew       daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. He had a       manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half       of which I now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well       adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament       and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. It is strange,       too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the       life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of       suffering and despair. For the bright side of the painting I had       a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of       death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged       out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an       ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires—for       they amounted to desires—are common, I have since been assured,       to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men—at the       time of which I speak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses       of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil.       Augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind. It is       probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a       partial interchange of character.        About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster,       the firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some       manner with the Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were       engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig Grampus for a       whaling voyage. She was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when       all was done to her that could be done. I hardly know why she was       chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same       owners—but so it was. Mr. Barnard was appointed to command her,       and Augustus was going with him. While the brig was getting       ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the       opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He       found me by no means an unwilling listener—yet the matter could       not be so easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition;       but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the       design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom I expected       much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if I should ever broach       the subject to him again. These difficulties, however, so far       from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame. I       determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my       intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it       might be accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any       of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself       ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had       abandoned the design. I have since frequently examined my conduct       on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of       surprise. The intense hypocrisy I made use of for the furtherance       of my project—an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my       life for so long a period of time—could only have been rendered       tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with       which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished       visions of travel.        In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged       to leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for       the greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to       some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At       night, however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over       our hopes. After nearly a month passed in this manner, without       our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told       me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary. I       had a relation living in New Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house       I was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at       a time. The brig was to sail about the middle of June (June,       1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to       sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from Mr. Ross,       asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert and       Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the inditing of       this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as supposed,       for New Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who       would contrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This       hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently       comfortable for a residence of many days, during which I was not       to make my appearance. When the brig had proceeded so far on her       course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, I       should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts       of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily       at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter       might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.        The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been       matured. The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday       morning I left the house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed.       I went, however, straight to Augustus, who was waiting for me at       the corner of a street. It had been our original plan that I       should keep out of the way until dark, and then slip on board the       brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favor, it was       agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the way to       the wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a       thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my       person might not be easily recognized. Just as we turned the       second corner, after passing Mr. Edmund’s well, who should       appear, standing right in front of me, and looking me full in the       face, but old Mr. Peterson, my grandfather. “Why, bless my soul,       Gordon,” said he, after a long pause, “why, why,—whose dirty       cloak is that you have on?” “Sir!” I replied, assuming, as well       as I could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended       surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable       tones—“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken—my name, in the first       place, bee’nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I’d want you for to       know better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty       one.” For my life I could hardly refrain from screaming with       laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received       this handsome rebuke. He started back two or three steps, turned       first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles,       then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella       uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his career, as if struck       with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled       off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and       muttering between his teeth: “Won’t do—new glasses—thought it was       Gordon—d—d good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”        After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and       arrived at our point of destination in safety. There were only       one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward,       doing something to the forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we       knew very well, was engaged at Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would       remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to       apprehend on his account. Augustus went first up the vessel’s       side, and in a short while I followed him, without being noticed       by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin, and       found no person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable       style—a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were       four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths.       There was also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably       thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin       and staterooms. The ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in       short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature       than I had anticipated. Augustus, however, would allow me but       little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my       concealing myself as soon as possible. He led the way into his       own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and       next to the bulkheads. Upon entering, he closed the door and       bolted it. I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than       the one in which I now found myself. It was about ten feet long,       and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide and       convenient. In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads       there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a       chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books       of voyages and travels. There were many other little comforts in       the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of safe or       refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of       delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.        He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the       carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know       that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had       been neatly cut out and again adjusted. As he pressed, this       portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of       his finger beneath. In this manner he raised the mouth of the       trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I       found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a small taper       by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark       lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me       follow. I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by       means of a nail driven into the under side—the carpet, of course,       resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and       all traces of the aperture being concealed.        The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest       difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of       lumber among which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my       eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less       trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. He brought       me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable       narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes       for packing fine earthenware. It was nearly four feet high, and       full six long, but very narrow. Two large empty oil-casks lay on       the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw       matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. In every       other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up       to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of       ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates,       hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less       than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the       box. I afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the       stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough       concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man       not going out in the brig.        My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could       be removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the       interior, at which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one       of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it       contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be       crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time,       sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting       position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were       some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full       of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna       sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a       dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately       to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings       of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever       experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now pointed out       to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then,       holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark       whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my       hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the       lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold,       immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. By       means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way       out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident       should render such a step necessary. He now took his departure,       leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of       tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often       as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on       the seventeenth of June.        I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in       my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice       for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between       two crates just opposite the opening. During the whole period I       saw nothing of Augustus; but this occasioned me little       uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected to put to sea every       hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of       coming down to me. At length I heard the trap open and shut, and       presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and       if there was any thing I wanted. “Nothing,” I replied; “I am as       comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be       under weigh in less than half an hour,” he answered. “I came to       let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I       shall not have a chance of coming down again for some       time—perhaps for three or four days more. All is going on right       aboveboard. After I go up and close the trap, do you creep along       by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. You will find my       watch there—it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to       keep time by. I suppose you can’t tell how long you have been       buried—only three days—this is the twentieth. I would bring the       watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he       went up.        In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in       motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly       commenced a voyage. Satisfied with this idea, I determined to       make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events       until I should be permitted to exchange the box for the more       roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the       cabin. My first care was to get the watch. Leaving the taper       burning, I groped along in the dark, following the cord through       windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered that, after       toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or two       of a former position. At length I reached the nail, and securing       the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. I now       looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided,       and selected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of       the Columbia. With this I amused myself for some time, when,       growing sleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and       soon fell into a sound slumber.        Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time       elapsed before I could bring to recollection all the various       circumstances of my situation. By degrees, however, I remembered       all. Striking a light, I looked at the watch; but it was run       down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how       long I slept. My limbs were greatly cramped, and I was forced to       relieve them by standing between the crates. Presently feeling an       almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the cold mutton,       some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and found       excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a       state of absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me       great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I       experienced upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have       slept for an inordinately long period of time. The close       atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this,       and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results.       My head ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath       with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude       of gloomy feelings. Still I could not venture to make any       disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound       up the watch, contented myself as well as possible.        Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no       person came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus       of the grossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that       the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was       suffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna       sausages after the loss of my mutton. I became very uneasy, and       could no longer take any interest in my books. I was overpowered,       too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of       indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence,       like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold.       In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in       the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears       as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was       blowing. I could not imagine a reason for the absence of       Augustus. We were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to       allow of my going up. Some accident might have happened to       him—but I could think of none which would account for his       suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his       having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea I       could not dwell with any degree of patience. It was possible that       we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near       vicinity of Nantucket. This notion, however, I was forced to       abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently       gone about; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual       inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along       with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter. Besides, granting       that we were still in the neighborhood of the island, why should       not Augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance?       Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and       cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another twenty-four       hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way to       the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend,       or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a       further supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with       this thought, however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the       contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My       dreams were of the most terrific description. Every species of       calamity and horror befell me. Among other miseries I was       smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most       ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me in their       embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully       shining eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn       and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me.       Immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in       endless succession as far as the eye could reach. Their roots       were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay       intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. And the       strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and waving to       and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for       mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony       and despair. The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone,       amidst the burning sand-plains of Sahara. At my feet lay crouched       a fierce lion of the tropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and       fell upon me. With a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and       laid bare his horrible teeth. In another instant there burst from       his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament, and I       fell impetuously to the earth. Stifling in a paroxysm of terror,       I at last found myself partially awake. My dream, then, was not       all a dream. Now, at least, I was in possession of my senses. The       paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my       bosom—his hot breath was in my ear—and his white and ghastly       fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.        Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the       utterance of a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken.       The beast, whatever it was, retained his position without       attempting any immediate violence, while I lay in an utterly       helpless, and, I fancied, a dying condition beneath him. I felt       that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me—in a word,       that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright. My brain       swam—I grew deadly sick—my vision failed—even the glaring       eyeballs above me grew dim. Making a last strong effort, I at       length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself       to die. The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent       fury of the animal. He precipitated himself at full length upon       my body; but what was my astonishment, when, with a long and low       whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest       eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstration of       affection and joy! I was bewildered, utterly lost in       amazement—but I could not forget the peculiar whine of my       Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well       knew. It was he. I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my       temples—a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and       reanimation. I rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which I had       been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful       follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in       a flood of the most passionate tears.        As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the       greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress.       For a long time I found it nearly impossible to connect any       ideas; but, by very slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned,       and I again called to memory the several incidents of my       condition. For the presence of Tiger I tried in vain to account;       and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures       respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing that       he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort       by his caresses. Most people love their dogs—but for Tiger I had       an affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly,       did any creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he had       been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances       had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value       the animal. I had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of       a malignant little villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with       a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid       the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from       the bludgeon of a street robber.        Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my       ear, that it had again run down; but at this I was not at all       surprised, being convinced, from the peculiar state of my       feelings, that I had slept, as before, for a very long period of       time, how long, it was of course impossible to say. I was burning       up with fever, and my thirst was almost intolerable. I felt about       the box for my little remaining supply of water, for I had no       light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern, and       the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. Upon finding the       jug, however, I discovered it to be empty—Tiger, no doubt, having       been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of       mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the       box. The spoiled meat I could well spare, but my heart sank as I       thought of the water. I was feeble in the extreme—so much so that       I shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest movement or       exertion. To add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and       rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my       box were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up       the only way of ingress or egress. I felt, also, terrible       sufferings from sea-sickness. These considerations determined me       to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate       relief, before I should be incapacitated from doing so       altogether. Having come to this resolve, I again felt about for       the phosphorus-box and tapers. The former I found after some       little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as I had       expected (for I remembered very nearly the spot in which I had       placed them), I gave up the search for the present, and bidding       Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey toward the trap.        In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever       apparent. It was with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along       at all, and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath       me; when, falling prostrate on my face, I would remain for some       minutes in a state bordering on insensibility. Still I struggled       forward by slow degrees, dreading every moment that I should       swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber, in       which event I had nothing but death to expect as the result. At       length, upon making a push forward with all the energy I could       command, I struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner       of an iron-bound crate. The accident only stunned me for a few       moments; but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick       and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely       across my path, so as effectually to block up the passage. With       my utmost exertions I could not move it a single inch from its       position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes       and ship-furniture. It became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as       I was, either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out       a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path       on the other side. The former alternative presented too many       difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. In       my present weak state of both mind and body, I should infallibly       lose my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably amid the       dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. I proceeded,       therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining       strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as I best might, to       clamber over the crate.        Upon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the       undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to       imagine. On each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall       of various heavy lumber, which the least blunder on my part might       be the means of bringing down upon my head; or, if this accident       did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked up against       my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the       obstacle there. The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box,       upon which no foothold could be obtained. In vain I attempted, by       every means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being       thus enabled to draw myself up. Had I succeeded in reaching it,       it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly       inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was better in       every respect that I failed. At length, in a desperate effort to       force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong vibration in the       side next me. I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks,       and found that a very large one was loose. With my pocket-knife,       which, luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great labour,       in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture,       discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the       opposite side—in other words, that the top was wanting, it being       the bottom through which I had forced my way. I now met with no       important difficulty in proceeding along the line until I finally       reached the nail. With a beating heart I stood erect, and with a       gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap. It did not       rise as soon as I had expected, and I pressed it with somewhat       more determination, still dreading lest some other person than       Augustus might be in his state-room. The door, however, to my       astonishment, remained steady, and I became somewhat uneasy, for       I knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to       remove it. I pushed it strongly—it was nevertheless firm: with       all my strength—it still did not give way: with rage, with fury,       with despair—it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and it was       evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the       hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or       that some immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was       useless to think of removing.        My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I       attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus       entombed. I could summon up no connected chain of reflection,       and, sinking on the floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most       gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths of thirst,       famine, suffocation, and premature interment crowded upon me as       the prominent disasters to be encountered. At length there       returned to me some portion of presence of mind. I arose, and       felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture.       Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if they       emitted any light from the state-room; but none was visible. I       then forced the blade of my pen-knife through them, until I met       with some hard obstacle. Scraping against it, I discovered it to       be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I       passed the blade along it, I concluded to be a chain-cable. The       only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box, and       there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to tranquilize my       mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape. I       immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after       innumerable difficulties, in getting back. As I sank, utterly       exhausted, upon the mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length       by my side, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of       consoling me in my troubles, and urging me to bear them with       fortitude.        The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my       attention. After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he       would suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon       reaching out my hand toward him, I then invariably found him       lying on his back, with his paws uplifted. This conduct, so       frequently repeated, appeared strange, and I could in no manner       account for it. As the dog seemed distressed, I concluded that he       had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, I       examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. I then       supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he       devoured with avidity—afterward, however, resuming his       extraordinary manoeuvres. I now imagined that he was suffering,       like myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this       conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that I       had as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly       be a wound upon some portion of his body or head. The latter I       felt carefully over, but found nothing. On passing my hand,       however, along his back, I perceived a slight erection of the       hair extending completely across it. Probing this with my finger,       I discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled       the whole body. Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across a small       slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the       string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it       immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal.     CHAPTER 3         The thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note       from Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having       happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had       devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of       affairs. Trembling with eagerness, I now commenced another search       for my phosphorus matches and tapers. I had a confused       recollection of having put them carefully away just before       falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the       trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had       deposited them. But now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind,       and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious       search for the missing articles; never, surely, was there a more       tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense. At length, while       groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the       opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived a faint       glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. Greatly       surprised, I endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared       to be but a few feet from my position. Scarcely had I moved with       this intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and,       before I could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel       along by the box until I had exactly resumed my original       situation. Now, moving my head with caution to and fro, I found       that, by proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite       direction to that in which I had at first started, I was enabled       to draw near the light, still keeping it in view. Presently I       came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through innumerable       narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some fragments       of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. I       was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell       upon two or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently       mumbled by the dog. I concluded at once that he had devoured the       whole of my supply of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever       able to read the note of Augustus. The small remnants of the wax       were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel, that I       despaired of deriving any service from them, and left them as       they were. The phosphorus, of which there was only a speck or       two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned with it,       after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while       remained.        What to do next I could not tell. The hold was so intensely dark       that I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my       face. The white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not       even that when I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior       portions of the retina toward it—that is to say, by surveying it       slightly askance, I found that it became in some measure       perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the       note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only       likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no       purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. In vain I       revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for       procuring light—such expedients precisely as a man in the       perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for       a similar purpose—each and all of which appear by turns to the       dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of       conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties       flicker, alternately, one above the other. At last an idea       occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to       wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained it before. I       placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and, collecting       the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought from       the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with the       palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. A       clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole       surface; and had there been any writing upon it, I should not       have experienced the least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it.       Not a syllable was there, however—nothing but a dreary and       unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few       seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.        I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some       period prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on       idiocy. There were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect       sanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few. It       must be remembered that I had been, for many days certainly,       inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a       whaling vessel, and for a long portion of that time but scantily       supplied with water. For the last fourteen or fifteen hours I had       none—nor had I slept during that time. Salt provisions of the       most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss       of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the       sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they       were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched       condition of my throat. I was now in a high state of fever, and       in every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact       that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last       adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested       itself that I had examined only one side of the paper. I shall       not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for I believe I was       more angry than any thing else) when the egregious oversight I       had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception. The blunder       itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and       impetuosity rendered it otherwise—in my disappointment at not       finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in       pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where.        From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the       sagacity of Tiger. Having got, after a long search, a small piece       of the note, I put it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make       him understand that he must bring me the rest of it. To my       astonishment, (for I had taught him none of the usual tricks for       which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter at once into my       meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon found       another considerable portion. Bringing me this, he paused awhile,       and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for       my approval of what he had done. I patted him on the head, when       he immediately made off again. It was now some minutes before he       came back—but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip,       which proved to be all the paper missing—it having been torn, it       seems, only into three pieces. Luckily, I had no trouble in       finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left—being       guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still       emitted. My difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution,       and I now took time to reflect upon what I was about to do. It       was very probable, I considered, that some words were written       upon that side of the paper which had not been examined—but which       side was that? Fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in       this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there       were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a       proper manner, as written. There was the greater necessity of       ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the       phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third       attempt, should I fail in the one I was now about to make. I       placed the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes       thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. At last I       thought it barely possible that the written side might have some       unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling       might enable me to detect. I determined to make the experiment       and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first       presented itself. Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned       the paper, adjusting it on the book. I now again carried my       forefinger cautiously along, when I was aware of an exceedingly       slight, but still discernable glow, which followed as it       proceeded. This, I knew, must arise from some very minute       remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I had covered       the paper in my previous attempt. The other, or under side, then,       was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should       finally prove to be. Again I turned the note, and went to work as       I had previously done. Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a       brilliancy ensued as before—but this time several lines of MS. in       a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became distinctly       visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but       momentary. Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there would       have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three       sentences before me—for I saw there were three. In my anxiety,       however, to read all at once, I succeeded only in reading the       seven concluding words, which thus appeared—“blood—your life       depends upon lying close.”        Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note—the       full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted       to convey, that admonition, even although it should have revealed       a story of disaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly       convinced, have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing       and yet indefinable horror with which I was inspired by the       fragmentary warning thus received. And “blood,” too, that word of       all words—so rife at all times with mystery, and suffering, and       terror—how trebly full of import did it now appear—how chilly and       heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words to       qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid       the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my       soul!        Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain       concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could       be—but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution       of the mystery. Just after returning from my last journey to the       trap, and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the       singular conduct of Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making       myself heard at all events by those on board, or, if I could not       succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my way through the       orlop deck. The half certainty which I felt of being able to       accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had       given me courage (which I should not otherwise have had) to       endure the evils of my situation. The few words I had been able       to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and       I now, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. In a       paroxysm of despair I threw myself again upon the mattress,       where, for about the period of a day and night, I lay in a kind       of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and       recollection.        At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon       the horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours       it was barely possible that I might exist without water—for a       longer time I could not do so. During the first portion of my       imprisonment I had made free use of the cordials with which       Augustus had supplied me, but they only served to excite fever,       without in the least degree assuaging thirst. I had now only       about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach       liqueur at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were entirely       consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the       skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had       been eaten by Tiger. To add to my troubles, I found that my       headache was increasing momentarily, and with it the species of       delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first       falling asleep. For some hours past it had been with the greatest       difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so       doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of       the chest. But there was still another and very different source       of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had been       the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the       mattress. It arose from the demeanor of the dog.        I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in       the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he       ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too       greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the       circumstance. Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw       myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy.       Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my       ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting       and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his       eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him,       when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet.       Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again       awakened in a similar manner. This was repeated three or four       times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a       degree of fear, that I became fully aroused. He was now lying       close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a       kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly       convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the       confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at       a loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of       killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own       safety. I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me       with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected       every instant that he would attack me. At last I could endure my       terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from       the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition       should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to       pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate       my design—missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by       the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his       white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of       the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured       them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which       Augustus had left me—then, folding my cloak around me as closely       as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. No       sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl       toward my throat. The whole weight of his body struck me on the       right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left, while the       enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my       knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these       protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt       the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which       enveloped my neck—yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate       all the folds. I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would       place me completely in his power. Despair gave me strength, and I       rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging       with me the blankets from the mattress. These I now threw over       him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the       door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. In this       struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of       ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to       a single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I       felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which       might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar       circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it       to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.        Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my       name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the       direction of the steerage. So unexpected was anything of the       kind, and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the       sound, that I endeavoured in vain to reply. My powers of speech       totally failed, and in an agony of terror lest my friend should       conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach me, I       stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling       convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. Had a       thousand words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken       it. There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber       somewhere forward of my station. The sound presently grew less       distinct, then again less so, and still less. Shall I ever forget       my feelings at this moment? He was going—my friend, my companion,       from whom I had a right to expect so much—he was going—he would       abandon me—he was gone! He would leave me to perish miserably, to       expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeons—and one       word, one little syllable, would save me—yet that single syllable       I could not utter! I felt, I am sure, more than ten thousand       times the agonies of death itself. My brain reeled, and I fell,       deadly sick, against the end of the box.        As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of       my pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor.       Never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my       ears! With the intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the       effect of the noise upon Augustus—for I knew that the person who       called my name could be no one but himself. All was silent for       some moments. At length I again heard the word “Arthur!” repeated       in a low tone, and one full of hesitation. Reviving hope loosened       at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed at the top of my       voice, “Augustus! oh, Augustus!” “Hush! for God’s sake be       silent!” he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; “I will       be with you immediately—as soon as I can make my way through the       hold.” For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and       every moment seemed to me an age. At length I felt his hand upon       my shoulder, and he placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water       to my lips. Those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the       jaws of the tomb, or who have known the insufferable torments of       thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which       encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the       unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest       of all physical luxuries afforded.        When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced       from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured       with the greatest avidity. He had brought with him a light in a       dark lantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less       comfort than the food and drink. But I was impatient to learn the       cause of his protracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what       had happened on board during my incarceration.     CHAPTER 4         The brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he       had left the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be       remembered that I had then been in the hold for three days; and,       during this period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and       so much running to and fro, especially in the cabin and       staterooms, that he had had no chance of visiting me without the       risk of having the secret of the trap discovered. When at length       he did come, I had assured him that I was doing as well as       possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he felt but       little uneasiness on my account—still, however, watching an       opportunity of going down. It was not until the fourth day that       he found one. Several times during this interval he had made up       his mind to let his father know of the adventure, and have me       come up at once; but we were still within reaching distance of       Nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions which had       escaped Captain Barnard, whether he would not immediately put       back if he discovered me to be on board. Besides, upon thinking       the matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that       I was in immediate want, or that I would hesitate, in such case,       to make myself heard at the trap. When, therefore, he considered       everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with       an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. This, as I said before,       did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the       watch, and the seventh since I had first entered the hold. He       then went down without taking with him any water or provisions,       intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get       me to come from the box to the trap,—when he would go up to the       stateroom and thence hand me down a supply. When he descended for       this purpose he found that I was asleep, for it seems that I was       snoring very loudly. From all the calculations I can make on the       subject, this must have been the slumber into which I fell just       after my return from the trap with the watch, and which,       consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days       and nights at the very least. Latterly, I have had reason both       from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be       acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench       arising from old fish-oil when closely confined; and when I think       of the condition of the hold in which I was imprisoned, and the       long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling       vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after       once falling asleep, than that I should have slept       uninterruptedly for the period specified above.        Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing       the trap—but I made him no reply. He then shut the trap, and       spoke to me in a louder, and finally in a very loud tone—still I       continued to snore. He was now at a loss what to do. It would       take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box,       and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by Captain       Barnard, who had occasion for his services every minute, in       arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the       voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and       await another opportunity of visiting me. He was the more easily       induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most       tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone       any inconvenience from my incarceration. He had just made up his       mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an       unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded apparently from the       cabin. He sprang through the trap as quickly as possible, closed       it, and threw open the door of his stateroom. No sooner had he       put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his       face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from       a handspike.        A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp       upon his throat; still he was able to see what was going on       around him. His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along       the steps of the companion-way, with his head down, and a deep       wound in the forehead, from which the blood was flowing in a       continued stream. He spoke not a word, and was apparently dying.       Over him stood the first mate, eyeing him with an expression of       fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from       which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer.       Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were       rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they       soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. Besides       Augustus and Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in       the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig’s       company. The villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with       them after having secured his arms behind his back. They       proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was fastened down—two       of the mutineers standing by it with axes—two also at the main       hatch. The mate called out in a loud voice: “Do you hear there       below? tumble up with you, one by one—now, mark that—and no       grumbling!” It was some minutes before any one appeared:—at last       an Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping       piteously, and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to       spare his life. The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an       axe. The poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the       black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and       tossed him deliberately into the sea. Hearing the blow and the       plunge of the body, the men below could now be induced to venture       on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a proposition was       made to smoke them out. A general rush then ensued, and for a       moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken. The       mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle       effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up.       These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without       arms, submitted after a brief struggle. The mate gave them fair       words—no doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for       they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. The       result proved his sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy.       All in the forecastle presently signified their intention of       submitting, and, ascending one by one, were pinioned and then       thrown on their backs, together with the first six—there being in       all, of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny,       twenty-seven.        A scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. The bound seamen       were dragged to the gangway. Here the cook stood with an axe,       striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side       of the vessel by the other mutineers. In this manner twenty-two       perished, and Augustus had given himself up for lost, expecting       every moment his own turn to come next. But it seemed that the       villains were now either weary, or in some measure disgusted with       their bloody labour; for the four remaining prisoners, together       with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with the rest,       were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole       murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until       sunset. They now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the       survivors, who lay not more than four paces off, and could       distinguish every word said. Upon some of the mutineers the       liquor appeared to have a softening effect, for several voices       were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether, on       condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits. The       black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon, and       who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the mate       himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose       repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway.       Fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be       easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among       whom was a line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters.       This man was the son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of       Upsarokas, who live among the fastnesses of the Black Hills, near       the source of the Missouri. His father was a fur-trader, I       believe, or at least connected in some manner with the Indian       trading-posts on Lewis river. Peters himself was one of the most       ferocious-looking men I ever beheld. He was short in stature, not       more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of       Herculean mould. His hands, especially, were so enormously thick       and broad as hardly to retain a human shape. His arms, as well as       legs, were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to       possess no flexibility whatever. His head was equally deformed,       being of immense size, with an indentation on the crown (like       that on the head of most negroes), and entirely bald. To conceal       this latter deficiency, which did not proceed from old age, he       usually wore a wig formed of any hair-like material which       presented itself—occasionally the skin of a Spanish dog or       American grizzly bear. At the time spoken of, he had on a portion       of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural       ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka       character. The mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips       were thin, and seemed, like some other portions of his frame, to       be devoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling expression never       varied under the influence of any emotion whatever. This ruling       expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth       were exceedingly long and protruding, and never even partially       covered, in any instance, by the lips. To pass this man with a       casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with       laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering       acknowledgment, that if such an expression were indicative of       merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon. Of this       singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring       men of Nantucket. These anecdotes went to prove his prodigious       strength when under excitement, and some of them had given rise       to a doubt of his sanity. But on board the Grampus, it seems, he       was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of       derision than of anything else. I have been thus particular in       speaking of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he       proved the main instrument in preserving the life of Augustus,       and because I shall have frequent occasion to mention him       hereafter in the course of my narrative—a narrative, let me here       say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include       incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human       experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human       credulity, that I proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining       credence for all that I shall tell, yet confidently trusting in       time and progressing science to verify some of the most important       and most improbable of my statements.        After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was       determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of       Augustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping       as his clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest       whaleboats. The mate went down into the cabin to see if Captain       Barnard was still living—for, it will be remembered, he was left       below when the mutineers came up. Presently the two made their       appearance, the captain pale as death, but somewhat recovered       from the effects of his wound. He spoke to the men in a voice       hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him adrift, but to       return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever they       chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. He       might as well have spoken to the winds. Two of the ruffians       seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig’s side into       the boat, which had been lowered while the mate went below. The       four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered       to follow, which they did without attempting any       resistance—Augustus being still left in his painful position,       although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction       of being permitted to bid his father farewell. A handful of       sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither       mast, sail, oar, nor compass. The boat was towed astern for a few       minutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation—it       was then finally cut adrift. By this time night had come on—there       were neither moon nor stars visible—and a short and ugly sea was       running, although there was no great deal of wind. The boat was       instantly out of sight, and little hope could be entertained for       the unfortunate sufferers who were in it. This event happened,       however, in latitude 35 degrees 30’ north, longitude 61 degrees       20’ west, and consequently at no very great distance from the       Bermuda Islands. Augustus therefore endeavored to console himself       with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the       land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels       off the coast.        All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her       original course to the southwest—the mutineers being bent upon       some piratical expedition, in which, from all that could be       understood, a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the Cape       Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No attention was paid to Augustus,       who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the       cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him with some degree of       kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the       cook. His situation was still one of the most precarious, as the       men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon       their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to himself.       His anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most       distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never       reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship. More than once       he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my       being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly through       recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly       through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief. For the       latter purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of       the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat       was cut adrift before any chance occurred. At length, on the       night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the       eastward, and all hands were called up to take in sail. During       the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and       into the stateroom. What was his grief and horror in discovering       that the latter had been rendered a p
