Enter the funeral of KING HENRY THE FIFTH, attended on by the DUKE OF BEDFORD, Regent of France, the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, Protector, the DUKE OF EXETER, the EARL OF WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER    BEDFORD. Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to     night! Comets, importing change of times and states,     Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky     And with them scourge the bad revolting stars     That have consented unto Henry's death!     King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!     England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.   GLOUCESTER. England ne'er had a king until his time.     Virtue he had, deserving to command;     His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams;     His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;     His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,     More dazzled and drove back his enemies     Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.     What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech:     He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.   EXETER. We mourn in black; why mourn we not in blood?     Henry is dead and never shall revive.     Upon a wooden coffin we attend;     And death's dishonourable victory     We with our stately presence glorify,     Like captives bound to a triumphant car.     What! shall we curse the planets of mishap     That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?     Or shall we think the subtle-witted French     Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,     By magic verses have contriv'd his end?   WINCHESTER. He was a king bless'd of the King of kings;     Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day     So dreadful will not be as was his sight.     The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought;     The Church's prayers made him so prosperous.   GLOUCESTER. The Church! Where is it? Had not churchmen     pray'd,     His thread of life had not so soon decay'd.     None do you like but an effeminate prince,     Whom like a school-boy you may overawe.   WINCHESTER. Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art     Protector     And lookest to command the Prince and realm.     Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe     More than God or religious churchmen may.   GLOUCESTER. Name not religion, for thou lov'st the flesh;     And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,     Except it be to pray against thy foes.   BEDFORD. Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace;     Let's to the altar. Heralds, wait on us.     Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms,     Since arms avail not, now that Henry's dead.     Posterity, await for wretched years,     When at their mothers' moist'ned eyes babes shall suck,     Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,     And none but women left to wail the dead.     Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:     Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,     Combat with adverse planets in the heavens.     A far more glorious star thy soul will make     Than Julius Caesar or bright                            Enter a MESSENGER    MESSENGER. My honourable lords, health to you all!     Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,     Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:     Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,     Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.   BEDFORD. What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?     Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns     Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.   GLOUCESTER. Is Paris lost? Is Rouen yielded up?     If Henry were recall'd to life again,     These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.   EXETER. How were they lost? What treachery was us'd?   MESSENGER. No treachery, but want of men and money.     Amongst the soldiers this is muttered     That here you maintain several factions;     And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,     You are disputing of your generals:     One would have ling'ring wars, with little cost;     Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;     A third thinks, without expense at all,     By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.     Awake, awake, English nobility!     Let not sloth dim your honours, new-begot.     Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;     Of England's coat one half is cut away.   EXETER. Were our tears wanting to this funeral,     These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.   BEDFORD. Me they concern; Regent I am of France.     Give me my steeled coat; I'll fight for France.     Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!     Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,     To weep their intermissive miseries.                     Enter a second MESSENGER    SECOND MESSENGER. Lords, view these letters full of bad     mischance.     France is revolted from the English quite,     Except some petty towns of no import.     The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims;     The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;     Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;     The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.   EXETER. The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!     O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?   GLOUCESTER. We will not fly but to our enemies' throats.     Bedford, if thou be slack I'll fight it out.   BEDFORD. Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?     An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,     Wherewith already France is overrun.                     Enter a third MESSENGER    THIRD MESSENGER. My gracious lords, to add to your     laments,     Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,     I must inform you of a dismal fight     Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.   WINCHESTER. What! Wherein Talbot overcame? Is't so?   THIRD MESSENGER. O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was     o'erthrown.     The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.     The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,     Retiring from the siege of Orleans,     Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,     By three and twenty thousand of the French     Was round encompassed and set upon.     No leisure had he to enrank his men;     He wanted pikes to set before his archers;     Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges     They pitched in the ground confusedly     To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.     More than three hours the fight continued;     Where valiant Talbot, above human thought,     Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:     Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;     Here, there, and everywhere, enrag'd he slew     The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms;     All the whole army stood agaz'd on him.     His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,     'A Talbot! a Talbot!' cried out amain,     And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.     Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up     If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward.     He, being in the vaward plac'd behind     With purpose to relieve and follow them-     Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke;     Hence grew the general wreck and massacre.     Enclosed were they with their enemies.     A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,     Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back;     Whom all France, with their chief assembled strength,     Durst not presume to look once in the face.   BEDFORD. Is Talbot slain? Then I will slay myself,     For living idly here in pomp and ease,     Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,     Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.   THIRD MESSENGER. O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,     And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford;     Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.   BEDFORD. His ransom there is none but I shall pay.     I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne;     His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;     Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.     Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;     Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make     To keep our great Saint George's feast withal.     Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,     Whose bloody deeds shall make an Europe quake.   THIRD MESSENGER. So you had need; for Orleans is besieg'd;     The English army is grown weak and faint;     The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply     And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,     Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.   EXETER. Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,     Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,     Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.   BEDFORD. I do remember it, and here take my leave     To go about my preparation.                             Exit   GLOUCESTER. I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can     To view th' artillery and munition;     And then I will proclaim young Henry king.              Exit   EXETER. To Eltham will I, where the young King is,     Being ordain'd his special governor;     And for his safety there I'll best devise.              Exit   WINCHESTER.  [Aside]  Each hath his place and function to     attend:     I am left out; for me nothing remains.     But long I will not be Jack out of office.     The King from Eltham I intend to steal,     And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.             Exeunt                               SCENE 2.                    France. Before Orleans        Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES THE DAUPHIN, ALENCON,            and REIGNIER, marching with drum and soldiers    CHARLES. Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens     So in the earth, to this day is not known.     Late did he shine upon the English side;     Now we are victors, upon us he smiles.     What towns of any moment but we have?     At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;     Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,     Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.   ALENCON. They want their porridge and their fat bull     beeves.     Either they must be dieted like mules     And have their provender tied to their mouths,     Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.   REIGNIER. Let's raise the siege. Why live we idly here?     Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear;     Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury,     And he may well in fretting spend his gall     Nor men nor money hath he to make war.   CHARLES. Sound, sound alarum; we will rush on them.     Now for the honour of the forlorn French!     Him I forgive my death that killeth me,     When he sees me go back one foot or flee.             Exeunt         Here alarum. They are beaten back by the English, with          great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER    CHARLES. Who ever saw the like? What men have I!     Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled     But that they left me midst my enemies.   REIGNIER. Salisbury is a desperate homicide;     He fighteth as one weary of his life.     The other lords, like lions wanting food,     Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.   ALENCON. Froissart, a countryman of ours, records     England all Olivers and Rowlands bred     During the time Edward the Third did reign.     More truly now may this be verified;     For none but Samsons and Goliases     It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!     Lean raw-bon'd rascals! Who would e'er suppose     They had such courage and audacity?   CHARLES. Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd     slaves,     And hunger will enforce them to be more eager.     Of old I know them; rather with their teeth     The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.   REIGNIER. I think by some odd gimmers or device     Their arms are set, like clocks, still to strike on;     Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.     By my consent, we'll even let them alone.   ALENCON. Be it so.                     Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS    BASTARD. Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.   CHARLES. Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.   BASTARD. Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd.     Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?     Be not dismay'd, for succour is at hand.     A holy maid hither with me I bring,     Which, by a vision sent to her from heaven,     Ordained is to raise this tedious siege     And drive the English forth the bounds of France.     The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,     Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:     What's past and what's to come she can descry.     Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,     For they are certain and unfallible.   CHARLES. Go, call her in.                       [Exit BASTARD]     But first, to try her skill,     Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place;     Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern;     By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.                    Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS with                           JOAN LA PUCELLE    REIGNIER. Fair maid, is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?   PUCELLE. Reignier, is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me?     Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;     I know thee well, though never seen before.     Be not amaz'd, there's nothing hid from me.     In private will I talk with thee apart.     Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.   REIGNIER. She takes upon her bravely at first dash.   PUCELLE. Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,     My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.     Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd     To shine on my contemptible estate.     Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs     And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,     God's Mother deigned to appear to me,     And in a vision full of majesty     Will'd me to leave my base vocation     And free my country from calamity     Her aid she promis'd and assur'd success.     In complete glory she reveal'd herself;     And whereas I was black and swart before,     With those clear rays which she infus'd on me     That beauty am I bless'd with which you may see.     Ask me what question thou canst possible,     And I will answer unpremeditated.     My courage try by combat if thou dar'st,     And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.     Resolve on this: thou shalt be fortunate     If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.   CHARLES. Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms.     Only this proof I'll of thy valour make     In single combat thou shalt buckle with me;     And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;     Otherwise I renounce all confidence.   PUCELLE. I am prepar'd; here is my keen-edg'd sword,     Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side,     The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine's churchyard,     Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.   CHARLES. Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.   PUCELLE. And while I live I'll ne'er fly from a man.                  [Here they fight and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes]   CHARLES. Stay, stay thy hands; thou art an Amazon,     And fightest with the sword of Deborah.   PUCELLE. Christ's Mother helps me, else I were too weak.   CHARLES. Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me.     Impatiently I burn with thy desire;     My heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd.     Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,     Let me thy servant and not sovereign be.     'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.   PUCELLE. I must not yield to any rites of love,     For my profession's sacred from above.     When I have chased all thy foes from hence,     Then will I think upon a recompense.   CHARLES. Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.   REIGNIER. My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.   ALENCON. Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;     Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.   REIGNIER. Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?   ALENCON. He may mean more than we poor men do know;     These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.   REIGNIER. My lord, where are you? What devise you on?     Shall we give o'er Orleans, or no?   PUCELLE. Why, no, I say; distrustful recreants!     Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.   CHARLES. What she says I'll confirm; we'll fight it out.   PUCELLE. Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.     This night the siege assuredly I'll raise.     Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,     Since I have entered into these wars.     Glory is like a circle in the water,     Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself     Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.     With Henry's death the English circle ends;     Dispersed are the glories it included.     Now am I like that proud insulting ship     Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.   CHARLES. Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?     Thou with an eagle art inspired then.     Helen, the mother of great Constantine,     Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters were like thee.     Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,     How may I reverently worship thee enough?   ALENCON. Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.   REIGNIER. Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;     Drive them from Orleans, and be immortaliz'd.   CHARLES. Presently we'll try. Come, let's away about it.     No prophet will I trust if she prove false.           Exeunt                               SCENE 3.                  London. Before the Tower gates         Enter the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, with his serving-men                        in blue coats    GLOUCESTER. I am come to survey the Tower this day;     Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.     Where be these warders that they wait not here?     Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.   FIRST WARDER.  [Within]  Who's there that knocks so     imperiously?   FIRST SERVING-MAN. It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.   SECOND WARDER.  [Within]  Whoe'er he be, you may not be     let in.   FIRST SERVING-MAN. Villains, answer you so the Lord     Protector?   FIRST WARDER.  [Within]  The Lord protect him! so we     answer him.     We do no otherwise than we are will'd.   GLOUCESTER. Who willed you, or whose will stands but     mine?     There's none Protector of the realm but I.     Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.     Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?                   [GLOUCESTER'S men rush at the Tower gates, and                          WOODVILLE the Lieutenant speaks within]   WOODVILLE.  [Within]  What noise is this? What traitors     have we here?   GLOUCESTER. Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?     Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.   WOODVILLE.  [Within]  Have patience, noble Duke, I may     not open;     The Cardinal of Winchester forbids.     From him I have express commandment     That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.   GLOUCESTER. Faint-hearted Woodville, prizest him fore me?     Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate     Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook!     Thou art no friend to God or to the King.     Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.   SERVING-MEN. Open the gates unto the Lord Protector,     Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.         Enter to the PROTECTOR at the Tower gates WINCHESTER                    and his men in tawny coats    WINCHESTER. How now, ambitious Humphry! What means     this?   GLOUCESTER. Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be     shut out?   WINCHESTER. I do, thou most usurping proditor,     And not Protector of the King or realm.   GLOUCESTER. Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,     Thou that contrived'st to murder our dead lord;     Thou that giv'st whores indulgences to sin.     I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,     If thou proceed in this thy insolence.   WINCHESTER. Nay, stand thou back; I will not budge a foot.     This be Damascus; be thou cursed Cain,     To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.   GLOUCESTER. I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back.     Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth     I'll use to carry thee out of this place.   WINCHESTER. Do what thou dar'st; I beard thee to thy face.   GLOUCESTER. What! am I dar'd and bearded to my face?     Draw, men, for all this privileged place     Blue-coats to tawny-coats. Priest, beware your beard;     I mean to tug it, and to cuff you soundly;     Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat;     In spite of Pope or dignities of church,     Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.   WINCHESTER. Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the     Pope.   GLOUCESTER. Winchester goose! I cry 'A rope, a rope!'     Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?     Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.     Out, tawny-coats! Out, scarlet hypocrite!           Here GLOUCESTER'S men beat out the CARDINAL'S         men; and enter in the hurly burly the MAYOR OF                   LONDON and his OFFICERS    MAYOR. Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,     Thus contumeliously should break the peace!   GLOUCESTER. Peace, Mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:     Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor King,     Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.   WINCHESTER. Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens;     One that still motions war and never peace,     O'ercharging your free purses with large fines;     That seeks to overthrow religion,     Because he is Protector of the realm,     And would have armour here out of the Tower,     To crown himself King and suppress the Prince.   GLOUCESTER. I will not answer thee with words, but blows.                                       [Here they skirmish again]   MAYOR. Nought rests for me in this tumultuous strife     But to make open proclamation.     Come, officer, as loud as e'er thou canst,     Cry.   OFFICER.  [Cries]  All manner of men assembled here in arms     this day against God's peace and the King's, we charge     and command you, in his Highness' name, to repair to     your several dwelling-places; and not to wear, handle, or     use, any sword, weapon, or dagger, henceforward, upon     pain of death.   GLOUCESTER. Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law;     But we shall meet and break our minds at large.   WINCHESTER. Gloucester, we'll meet to thy cost, be sure;     Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.   MAYOR. I'll call for clubs if you will not away.     This Cardinal's more haughty than the devil.   GLOUCESTER. Mayor, farewell; thou dost but what thou     mayst.   WINCHESTER. Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head,     For I intend to have it ere long.                     Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and WINCHESTER                                              with their servants   MAYOR. See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.     Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!     I myself fight not once in forty year.                Exeunt                                    SCENE 4.                          France. Before Orleans                 Enter, on the walls, the MASTER-GUNNER                        OF ORLEANS and his BOY    MASTER-GUNNER. Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is     besieg'd,     And how the English have the suburbs won.   BOY. Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,     Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.   MASTER-GUNNER. But now thou shalt not. Be thou rul'd     by me.     Chief master-gunner am I of this town;     Something I must do to procure me grace.     The Prince's espials have informed me     How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,     Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars     In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,     And thence discover how with most advantage     They may vex us with shot or with assault.     To intercept this inconvenience,     A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;     And even these three days have I watch'd     If I could see them. Now do thou watch,     For I can stay no longer.     If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;     And thou shalt find me at the Governor's.               Exit   BOY. Father, I warrant you; take you no care;     I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.              Exit            Enter SALISBURY and TALBOT on the turrets, with             SIR WILLIAM GLANSDALE, SIR THOMAS GARGRAVE,                             and others    SALISBURY. Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!     How wert thou handled being prisoner?     Or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd?     Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.   TALBOT. The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner     Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;     For him was I exchang'd and ransomed.     But with a baser man of arms by far     Once, in contempt, they would have barter'd me;     Which I disdaining scorn'd, and craved death     Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.     In fine, redeem'd I was as I desir'd.     But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart     Whom with my bare fists I would execute,     If I now had him brought into my power.   SALISBURY. Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.   TALBOT. With scoffs, and scorns, and contumelious taunts,     In open market-place produc'd they me     To be a public spectacle to all;     Here, said they, is the terror of the French,     The scarecrow that affrights our children so.     Then broke I from the officers that led me,     And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground     To hurl at the beholders of my shame;     My grisly countenance made others fly;     None durst come near for fear of sudden death.     In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;     So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread     That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel     And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;     Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had     That walk'd about me every minute-while;     And if I did but stir out of my bed,     Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.                  Enter the BOY with a linstock    SALISBURY. I grieve to hear what torments you endur'd;     But we will be reveng'd sufficiently.     Now it is supper-time in Orleans:     Here, through this grate, I count each one     And view the Frenchmen how they fortify.     Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.     Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale,     Let me have your express opinions     Where is best place to make our batt'ry next.   GARGRAVE. I think at the North Gate; for there stand lords.   GLANSDALE. And I here, at the bulwark of the bridge.   TALBOT. For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,     Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.                      [Here they shoot and SALISBURY and GARGRAVE                                                       fall down]   SALISBURY. O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!   GARGRAVE. O Lord, have mercy on me, woeful man!   TALBOT. What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?     Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.     How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?     One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!     Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand     That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!     In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;     Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;     Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,     His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.     Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,     One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;     The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.     Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive     If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!     Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.     Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?     Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.     Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,     Thou shalt not die whiles     He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,     As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,     Remember to avenge me on the French.'     Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,     Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.     Wretched shall France be only in my name.                   [Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]     What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?     Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?                            Enter a MESSENGER    MESSENGER. My lord, my lord, the French have gather'd     head     The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,     A holy prophetess new risen up,     Is come with a great power to raise the siege.                   [Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans]   TALBOT. Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan.     It irks his heart he cannot be reveng'd.     Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you.     Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,     Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels     And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.     Convey me Salisbury into his tent,     And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.                                                   Alarum. Exeunt                                  SCENE 5.                            Before Orleans           Here an alarum again, and TALBOT pursueth the       DAUPHIN and driveth him. Then enter JOAN LA PUCELLE        driving Englishmen before her. Then enter TALBOT    TALBOT. Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?     Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them;     A woman clad in armour chaseth them.                            Enter LA PUCELLE      Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee.     Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee;     Blood will I draw on thee--thou art a witch     And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st.   PUCELLE. Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.                                                [Here they fight]   TALBOT. Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?     My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage.     And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder,     But I will chastise this high minded strumpet.                                               [They fight again]   PUCELLE. Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come.     I must go victual Orleans forthwith.              [A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers]     O'ertake me if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.     Go, go, cheer up thy hungry starved men;     Help Salisbury to make his testament.     This day is ours, as many more shall be.                Exit   TALBOT. My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;     I know not where I am nor what I do.     A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,     Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists.     So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench     Are from their hives and houses driven away.     They call'd us, for our fierceness, English dogs;     Now like to whelps we crying run away.                                                 [A short alarum]     Hark, countrymen! Either renew the fight     Or tear the lions out of England's coat;     Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:     Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,     Or horse or oxen from the leopard,     As you fly from your oft subdued slaves.                                  [Alarum. Here another skirmish]     It will not be-retire into your trenches.     You all consented unto Salisbury's death,     For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.     Pucelle is ent'red into Orleans     In spite of us or aught that we could do.     O, would I were to die with Salisbury!     The shame hereof will make me hide my head.                                     Exit TALBOT. Alarum; retreat                                 SCENE 6.                                ORLEANS          Flourish. Enter on the walls, LA PUCELLE, CHARLES,                 REIGNIER, ALENCON, and soldiers    PUCELLE. Advance our waving colours on the walls;     Rescu'd is Orleans from the English.     Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.   CHARLES. Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,     How shall I honour thee for this success?     Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens,     That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.     France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess.     Recover'd is the town of Orleans.     More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.   REIGNIER. Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the     town?     Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires     And feast and banquet in the open streets     To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.   ALENCON. All France will be replete with mirth and joy     When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.   CHARLES. 'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;     For which I will divide my crown with her;     And all the priests and friars in my realm     Shall in procession sing her endless praise.     A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear     Than Rhodope's of Memphis ever was.     In memory of her, when she is dead,     Her ashes, in an urn more precious     Than the rich jewel'd coffer of Darius,     Transported shall be at high festivals     Before the kings and queens of France.     No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,     But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.     Come in, and let us banquet royally     After this golden day of victory. Flourish.           Exeunt     ACT II. SCENE 1.  Before Orleans  Enter a FRENCH SERGEANT and two SENTINELS    SERGEANT. Sirs, take your places and be vigilant.     If any noise or soldier you perceive     Near to the walls, by some apparent sign     Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.   FIRST SENTINEL. Sergeant, you shall.           [Exit SERGEANT]     Thus are poor servitors,     When others sleep upon their quiet beds,     Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain, and cold.               Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and forces,           with scaling-ladders; their drums beating a dead                               march    TALBOT. Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,     By whose approach the regions of Artois,     Wallon, and Picardy, are friends to us,     This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,     Having all day carous'd and banqueted;     Embrace we then this opportunity,     As fitting best to quittance their deceit,     Contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery.   BEDFORD. Coward of France, how much he wrongs his fame,     Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,     To join with witches and the help of hell!   BURGUNDY. Traitors have never other company.     But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?   TALBOT. A maid, they say.   BEDFORD. A maid! and be so martial!   BURGUNDY. Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,     If underneath the standard of the French     She carry armour as she hath begun.   TALBOT. Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:     God is our fortress, in whose conquering name     Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.   BEDFORD. Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.   TALBOT. Not all together; better far, I guess,     That we do make our entrance several ways;     That if it chance the one of us do fail     The other yet may rise against their force.   BEDFORD. Agreed; I'll to yond corner.   BURGUNDY. And I to this.   TALBOT. And here will Talbot mount or make his grave.     Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right     Of English Henry, shall this night appear     How much in duty I am bound to both.              [The English scale the walls and cry 'Saint George!                                                      a Talbot!']     SENTINEL. Arm! arm! The enemy doth make assault.             The French leap o'er the walls in their shirts.            Enter, several ways, BASTARD, ALENCON, REIGNIER,                      half ready and half unready    ALENCON. How now, my lords? What, all unready so?   BASTARD. Unready! Ay, and glad we 'scap'd so well.   REIGNIER. 'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,     Hearing alarums at our chamber doors.   ALENCON. Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms     Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise     More venturous or desperate than this.   BASTARD. I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.   REIGNIER. If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him   ALENCON. Here cometh Charles; I marvel how he sped.                      Enter CHARLES and LA PUCELLE    BASTARD. Tut! holy Joan was his defensive guard.   CHARLES. Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?     Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,     Make us partakers of a little gain     That now our loss might be ten times so much?   PUCELLE. Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend?     At all times will you have my power alike?     Sleeping or waking, must I still prevail     Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?     Improvident soldiers! Had your watch been good     This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.   CHARLES. Duke of Alencon, this was your default     That, being captain of the watch to-night,     Did look no better to that weighty charge.   ALENCON. Had all your quarters been as safely kept     As that whereof I had the government,     We had not been thus shamefully surpris'd.   BASTARD. Mine was secure.   REIGNIER. And so was mine, my lord.   CHARLES. And, for myself, most part of all this night,     Within her quarter and mine own precinct     I was employ'd in passing to and fro     About relieving of the sentinels.     Then how or which way should they first break in?   PUCELLE. Question, my lords, no further of the case,     How or which way; 'tis sure they found some place     But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.     And now there rests no other shift but this     To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispers'd,     And lay new platforms to endamage them.                 Alarum. Enter an ENGLISH SOLDIER, crying             'A Talbot! A Talbot!' They fly, leaving their                            clothes behind    SOLDIER. I'll be so bold to take what they have left.     The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;     For I have loaden me with many spoils,     Using no other weapon but his name.                     Exit                                  SCENE 2.                        ORLEANS. Within the town              Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a CAPTAIN,                            and others    BEDFORD. The day begins to break, and night is fled     Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.     Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit.                                                [Retreat sounded]   TALBOT. Bring forth the body of old Salisbury     And here advance it in the market-place,     The middle centre of this cursed town.     Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;     For every drop of blood was drawn from him     There hath at least five Frenchmen died to-night.     And that hereafter ages may behold     What ruin happened in revenge of him,     Within their chiefest temple I'll erect     A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;     Upon the which, that every one may read,     Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans,     The treacherous manner of his mournful death,     And what a terror he had been to France.     But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,     I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,     His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,     Nor any of his false confederates.   BEDFORD. 'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,     Rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds,     They did amongst the troops of armed men     Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.   BURGUNDY. Myself, as far as I could well discern     For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,     Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull,     When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,     Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves     That could not live asunder day or night.     After that things are set in order here,     We'll follow them with all the power we have.                            Enter a MESSENGER    MESSENGER. All hail, my lords! Which of this princely train     Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts     So much applauded through the realm of France?   TALBOT. Here is the Talbot; who would speak with him?   MESSENGER. The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,     With modesty admiring thy renown,     By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe     To visit her poor castle where she lies,     That she may boast she hath beheld the man     Whose glory fills the world with loud report.   BURGUNDY. Is it even so? Nay, then I see our wars     Will turn into a peaceful comic sport,     When ladies crave to be encount'red with.     You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.   TALBOT. Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men     Could not prevail with all their oratory,     Yet hath a woman's kindness overrul'd;     And therefore tell her I return great thanks     And in submission will attend on her.     Will not your honours bear me company?   BEDFORD. No, truly; 'tis more than manners will;     And I have heard it said unbidden guests     Are often welcomest when they are gone.   TALBOT. Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,     I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.     Come hither, Captain.  [Whispers]   You perceive my mind?   CAPTAIN. I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.           Exeunt                                  SCENE 3.                        AUVERGNE. The Castle                 Enter the COUNTESS and her PORTER    COUNTESS. Porter, remember what I gave in charge;     And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.   PORTER. Madam, I will.   COUNTESS. The plot is laid; if all things fall out right,     I shall as famous be by this exploit.     As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.     Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,     And his achievements of no less account.     Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears     To give their censure of these rare reports.      Enter MESSENGER and TALBOT.    MESSENGER. Madam, according as your ladyship desir'd,     By message crav'd, so is Lord Talbot come.   COUNTESS. And he is welcome. What! is this the man?   MESSENGER. Madam, it is.   COUNTESS. Is this the scourge of France?     Is this Talbot, so much fear'd abroad     That with his name the mothers still their babes?     I see report is fabulous and false.     I thought I should have seen some Hercules,     A second Hector, for his grim aspect     And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.     Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!     It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp     Should strike such terror to his enemies.   TALBOT. Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;     But since your ladyship is not at leisure,     I'll sort some other time to visit you.              [Going]   COUNTESS. What means he now? Go ask him whither he     goes.   MESSENGER. Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves     To know the cause of your abrupt departure.   TALBOT. Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,     I go to certify her Talbot's here.                        Re-enter PORTER With keys    COUNTESS. If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.   TALBOT. Prisoner! To whom?   COUNTESS. To me, blood-thirsty lord     And for that cause I train'd thee to my house.     Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,     For in my gallery thy picture hangs;     But now the substance shall endure the like     And I will chain these legs and arms of thine     That hast by tyranny these many years     Wasted our country, slain our citizens,     And sent our sons and husbands captivate.   TALBOT. Ha, ha, ha!   COUNTESS. Laughest thou, wretch? Thy mirth shall turn to     moan.   TALBOT. I laugh to see your ladyship so fond     To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow     Whereon to practise your severity.   COUNTESS. Why, art not thou the man?   TALBOT. I am indeed.   COUNTESS. Then have I substance too.   TALBOT. No, no, I am but shadow of myself.     You are deceiv'd, my substance is not here;     For what you see is but the smallest part     And least proportion of humanity.     I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,     It is of such a spacious lofty pitch     Your roof were not sufficient to contain 't.   COUNTESS. This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;     He will be here, and yet he is not here.     How can these contrarieties agree?   TALBOT. That will I show you presently.                     Winds his horn; drums strike up;                   a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers      How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded     That Talbot is but shadow of himself?     These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,     With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,     Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,     And in a moment makes them desolate.   COUNTESS. Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse.     I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,     And more than may be gathered by thy shape.     Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,     For I am sorry that with reverence     I did not entertain thee as thou art.   TALBOT. Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconster     The mind of Talbot as you did mistake     The outward composition of his body.     What you have done hath not offended me.     Nor other satisfaction do I crave     But only, with your patience, that we may     Taste of your wine and see what cates you have,     For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.   COUNTESS. With all my heart, and think me honoured     To feast so great a warrior in my house.              Exeunt                                  SCENE 4.                     London. The Temple garden           Enter the EARLS OF SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK;            RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another LAWYER    PLANTAGENET. Great lords and gentlemen, what means this     silence?     Dare no man answer in a case of truth?   SUFFOLK. Within the Temple Hall we were too loud;     The garden here is more convenient.   PLANTAGENET. Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;     Or else was wrangling Somerset in th' error?   SUFFOLK. Faith, I have been a truant in the law     And never yet could frame my will to it;     And therefore frame the law unto my will.   SOMERSET. Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.   WARWICK. Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;     Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;     Between two blades, which bears the better temper;     Between two horses, which doth bear him best;     Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye     I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;     But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,     Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.   PLANTAGENET. Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:     The truth appears so naked on my side     That any purblind eye may find it out.   SOMERSET. And on my side it is so well apparell'd,     So clear, so shining, and so evident,     That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.   PLANTAGENET. Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,     In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts.     Let him that is a true-born gentleman     And stands upon the honour of his birth,     If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,     From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.   SOMERSET. Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,     But dare maintain the party of the truth,     Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.   WARWICK. I love no colours; and, without all colour     Of base insinuating flattery,     I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.   SUFFOLK. I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,     And say withal I think he held the right.   VERNON. Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more     Till you conclude that he upon whose side     The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree     Shall yield the other in the right opinion.   SOMERSET. Good Master Vernon, it is well objected;     If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.   PLANTAGENET. And I.   VERNON. Then, for the truth and plainness of the case,     I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,     Giving my verdict on the white rose side.   SOMERSET. Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,     Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,     And fall on my side so, against your will.   VERNON. If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,     Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt     And keep me on the side where still I am.   SOMERSET. Well, well, come on; who else?   LAWYER.  [To Somerset]  Unless my study and my books be     false,     The argument you held was wrong in you;     In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.   PLANTAGENET. Now, Somerset, where is your argument?   SOMERSET. Here in my scabbard, meditating that     Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.   PLANTAGENET. Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our     roses;     For pale they look with fear, as witnessing     The truth on our side.   SOMERSET. No, Plantagenet,     'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks     Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,     And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.   PLANTAGENET. Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?   SOMERSET. Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?   PLANTAGENET. Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;     Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.   SOMERSET. Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,     That shall maintain what I have said is true,     Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.   PLANTAGENET. Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,     I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.   SUFFOLK. Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.   PLANTAGENET. Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and     thee.   SUFFOLK. I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.   SOMERSET. Away, away, good William de la Pole!     We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.   WARWICK. Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;     His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,     Third son to the third Edward, King of England.     Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?   PLANTAGENET. He bears him on the place's privilege,     Or durst not for his craven heart say thus.   SOMERSET. By Him that made me, I'll maintain my words     On any plot of ground in Christendom.     Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,     For treason executed in our late king's days?     And by his treason stand'st not thou attainted,     Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?     His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;     And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman.   PLANTAGENET. My father was attached, not attainted;     Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;     And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,     Were growing time once ripened to my will.     For your partaker Pole, and you yourself,     I'll note you in my book of memory     To scourge you for this apprehension.     Look to it well, and say you are well warn'd.   SOMERSET. Ay, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;     And know us by these colours for thy foes     For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.   PLANTAGENET. And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,     As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,     Will I for ever, and my faction, wear,     Until it wither with me to my grave,     Or flourish to the height of my degree.   SUFFOLK. Go forward, and be chok'd with thy ambition!     And so farewell until I meet thee next.                 Exit   SOMERSET. Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious     Richard.                                                Exit   PLANTAGENET. How I am brav'd, and must perforce endure     it!   WARWICK. This blot that they object against your house     Shall be wip'd out in the next Parliament,     Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;     And if thou be not then created York,     I will not live to be accounted Warwick.     Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,     Against proud Somerset and William Pole,     Will I upon thy party wear this rose;     And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,     Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden,     Shall send between the Red Rose and the White     A thousand souls to death and deadly night.   PLANTAGENET. Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you     That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.   VERNON. In your behalf still will I wear the same.   LAWYER. And so will I.   PLANTAGENET. Thanks, gentle sir.     Come, let us four to dinner. I dare say     This quarrel will drink blood another day.            Exeunt                                  SCENE 5.                         The Tower of London           Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and GAOLERS    MORTIMER. Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,     Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.     Even like a man new haled from the rack,     So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;     And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,     Nestor-like aged in an age of care,     Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.     These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,     Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;     Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,     And pithless arms, like to a withered vine     That droops his sapless branches to the ground.     Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,     Unable to support this lump of clay,     Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,     As witting I no other comfort have.     But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?   FIRST KEEPER. Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come.     We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;     And answer was return'd that he will come.   MORTIMER. Enough; my soul shall then be satisfied.     Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.     Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,     Before whose glory I was great in arms,     This loathsome sequestration have I had;     And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd,     Depriv'd of honour and inheritance.     But now the arbitrator of despairs,     Just Death, kind umpire of men's miseries,     With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence.     I would his troubles likewise were expir'd,     That so he might recover what was lost.                       Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET    FIRST KEEPER. My lord, your loving nephew now is come.   MORTIMER. Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?   PLANTAGENET. Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly us'd,     Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.   MORTIMER. Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck     And in his bosom spend my latter gasp.     O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,     That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.     And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,     Why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'd?   PLANTAGENET. First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;     And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.     This day, in argument upon a case,     Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;     Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue     And did upbraid me with my father's death;     Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,     Else with the like I had requited him.     Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,     In honour of a true Plantagenet,     And for alliance sake, declare the cause     My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.   MORTIMER. That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me     And hath detain'd me all my flow'ring youth     Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,     Was cursed instrument of his decease.   PLANTAGENET. Discover more at large what cause that was,     For I am ignorant and cannot guess.   MORTIMER. I will, if that my fading breath permit     And death approach not ere my tale be done.     Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,     Depos'd his nephew Richard, Edward's son,     The first-begotten and the lawful heir     Of Edward king, the third of that descent;     During whose reign the Percies of the north,     Finding his usurpation most unjust,     Endeavour'd my advancement to the throne.     The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this     Was, for that-young Richard thus remov'd,     Leaving no heir begotten of his body--     I was the next by birth and parentage;     For by my mother I derived am     From Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son     To King Edward the Third; whereas he     From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,     Being but fourth of that heroic line.     But mark: as in this haughty great attempt     They laboured to plant the rightful heir,     I lost my liberty, and they their lives.     Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,     Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,     Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then deriv'd     From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,     Marrying my sister, that thy mother was,     Again, in pity of my hard distress,     Levied an army, weening to redeem     And have install'd me in the diadem;     But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl,     And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,     In whom the title rested, were suppress'd.   PLANTAGENET. Of Which, my lord, your honour is the last.   MORTIMER. True; and thou seest that I no issue have,     And that my fainting words do warrant death.     Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather;     But yet be wary in thy studious care.   PLANTAGENET. Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.     But yet methinks my father's execution     Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.   MORTIMER. With silence, nephew, be thou politic;     Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster     And like a mountain not to be remov'd.     But now thy uncle is removing hence,     As princes do their courts when they are cloy'd     With long continuance in a settled place.   PLANTAGENET. O uncle, would some part of my young years     Might but redeem the passage of your age!   MORTIMER. Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer     doth     Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.     Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;     Only give order for my funeral.     And so, farewell; and fair be all thy hopes,     And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!          [Dies]   PLANTAGENET. And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!     In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage,     And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.     Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;     And what I do imagine, let that rest.     Keepers, convey him hence; and I myself     Will see his burial better than his life.                 Exeunt GAOLERS, hearing out the body of MORTIMER     Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,     Chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort;     And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,     Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house,     I doubt not but with honour to redress;     And therefore haste I to the Parliament,     Either to be restored to my blood,     Or make my ill th' advantage of my good.                Exit     ACT III. SCENE 1.  London. The Parliament House  Flourish. Enter the KING, EXETER, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK; the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others. GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill; WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it    WINCHESTER. Com'st thou with deep premeditated lines,     With written pamphlets studiously devis'd?     Humphrey of Gloucester, if thou canst accuse     Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,     Do it without invention, suddenly;     I with sudden and extemporal speech     Purpose to answer what thou canst object.   GLOUCESTER. Presumptuous priest, this place commands my     patience,     Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.     Think not, although in writing I preferr'd     The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,     That therefore I have forg'd, or am not able     Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen.     No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,     Thy lewd, pestiferous, and dissentious pranks,     As very infants prattle of thy pride.     Thou art a most pernicious usurer;     Froward by nature, enemy to peace;     Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems     A man of thy profession and degree;     And for thy treachery, what's more manifest     In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,     As well at London Bridge as at the Tower?     Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,     The King, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt     From envious malice of thy swelling heart.   WINCHESTER. Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe     To give me hearing what I shall reply.     If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse,     As he will have me, how am I so poor?     Or how haps it I seek not to advance     Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?     And for dissension, who preferreth peace     More than I do, except I be provok'd?     No, my good lords, it is not that offends;     It is not that that incens'd hath incens'd the Duke:     It is because no one should sway but he;     No one but he should be about the King;     And that engenders thunder in his breast     And makes him roar these accusations forth.     But he shall know I am as good   GLOUCESTER. As good!     Thou bastard of my grandfather!   WINCHESTER. Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,     But one imperious in another's throne?   GLOUCESTER. Am I not Protector, saucy priest?   WINCHESTER. And am not I a prelate of the church?   GLOUCESTER. Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps,     And useth it to patronage his theft.   WINCHESTER. Unreverent Gloucester!   GLOUCESTER. Thou art reverend     Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.   WINCHESTER. Rome shall remedy this.   WARWICK. Roam thither then.   SOMERSET. My lord, it were your duty to forbear.   WARWICK. Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.   SOMERSET. Methinks my lord should be religious,     And know the office that belongs to such.   WARWICK. Methinks his lordship should be humbler;     It fitteth not a prelate so to plead.   SOMERSET. Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.   WARWICK. State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?     Is not his Grace Protector to the King?   PLANTAGENET.  [Aside]  Plantagenet, I see, must hold his     tongue,     Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;     Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'     Else would I have a fling at Winchester.   KING HENRY. Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,     The special watchmen of our English weal,     I would prevail, if prayers might prevail     To join your hearts in love and amity.     O, what a scandal is it to our crown     That two such noble peers as ye should jar!     Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell     Civil dissension is a viperous worm     That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.                   [A noise within: 'Down with the tawny coats!']     What tumult's this?   WARWICK. An uproar, I dare warrant,     Begun through malice of the Bishop's men.                               [A noise again: 'Stones! Stones!']                  Enter the MAYOR OF LONDON, attended    MAYOR. O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,     Pity the city of London, pity us!     The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,     Forbidden late to carry any weapon,     Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones     And, banding themselves in contrary parts,     Do pelt so fast at one another's pate     That many have their giddy brains knock'd out.     Our windows are broke down in every street,     And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.          Enter in skirmish, the retainers of GLOUCESTER and                WINCHESTER, with bloody pates    KING HENRY. We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,     To hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace.     Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.   FIRST SERVING-MAN. Nay, if we be forbidden stones, we'll     fall to it with our teeth.   SECOND SERVING-MAN. Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.                                                 [Skirmish again]   GLOUCESTER. You of my household, leave this peevish broil,     And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.   THIRD SERVING-MAN. My lord, we know your Grace to be a     man     Just and upright, and for your royal birth     Inferior to none but to his Majesty;     And ere that we will suffer such a prince,     So kind a father of the commonweal,     To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,     We and our wives and children all will fight     And have our bodies slaught'red by thy foes.   FIRST SERVING-MAN. Ay, and the very parings of our nails     Shall pitch a field when we are dead.          [Begin again]   GLOUCESTER. Stay, stay, I say!     And if you love me, as you say you do,     Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.   KING HENRY. O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!     Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold     My sighs and tears and will not once relent?     Who should be pitiful, if you be not?     Or who should study to prefer a peace,     If holy churchmen take delight in broils?   WARWICK. Yield, my Lord Protector; yield, Winchester;     Except you mean with obstinate repulse     To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.     You see what mischief, and what murder too,     Hath been enacted through your enmity;     Then be at peace, except ye thirst for blood.   WINCHESTER. He shall submit, or I will never yield.   GLOUCESTER. Compassion on the King commands me stoop,     Or I would see his heart out ere the priest     Should ever get that privilege of me.   WARWICK. Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke     Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,     As by his smoothed brows it doth appear;     Why look you still so stem and tragical?   GLOUCESTER. Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.   KING HENRY. Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach     That malice was a great and grievous sin;     And will not you maintain the thing you teach,     But prove a chief offender in the same?   WARWICK. Sweet King! The Bishop hath a kindly gird.     For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent;     What, shall a child instruct you what to do?   WINCHESTER. Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;     Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.   GLOUCESTER  [Aside]  Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow     heart.     See here, my friends and loving countrymen:     This token serveth for a flag of truce     Betwixt ourselves and all our followers.     So help me God, as I dissemble not!   WINCHESTER  [Aside]  So help me God, as I intend it not!   KING HENRY. O loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,     How joyful am I made by this contract!     Away, my masters! trouble us no more;     But join in friendship, as your lords have done.   FIRST SERVING-MAN. Content: I'll to the surgeon's.   SECOND SERVING-MAN. And so will I.   THIRD SERVING-MAN. And I will see what physic the tavern     affords.                         Exeunt servants, MAYOR, &C.   WARWICK. Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign;     Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet     We do exhibit to your Majesty.   GLOUCESTER. Well urg'd, my Lord of Warwick; for, sweet     prince,     An if your Grace mark every circumstance,     You have great reason to do Richard right;     Especially for those occasions     At Eltham Place I told your Majesty.   KING HENRY. And those occasions, uncle, were of force;     Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is     That Richard be restored to his blood.   WARWICK. Let Richard be restored to his blood;     So shall his father's wrongs be recompens'd.   WINCHESTER. As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.   KING HENRY. If Richard will be true, not that alone     But all the whole inheritance I give     That doth belong unto the house of York,     From whence you spring by lineal descent.   PLANTAGENET. Thy humble servant vows obedience     And humble service till the point of death.   KING HENRY. Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;     And in reguerdon of that duty done     I girt thee with the valiant sword of York.     Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet,     And rise created princely Duke of York.   PLANTAGENET. And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!     And as my duty springs, so perish they     That grudge one thought against your Majesty!   ALL. Welcome, high Prince, the mighty Duke of York!   SOMERSET.  [Aside]  Perish, base Prince, ignoble Duke of     York!   GLOUCESTER. Now will it best avail your Majesty     To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:     The presence of a king engenders love     Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,     As it disanimates his enemies.   KING HENRY. When Gloucester says the word, King Henry     goes;     For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.   GLOUCESTER. Your ships already are in readiness.                          Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER   EXETER. Ay, we may march in England or in France,     Not seeing what is likely to ensue.     This late dissension grown betwixt the peers     Burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love     And will at last break out into a flame;     As fest'red members rot but by degree     Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,     So will this base and envious discord breed.     And now I fear that fatal prophecy.     Which in the time of Henry nam'd the Fifth     Was in the mouth of every sucking babe:     That Henry born at Monmouth should win all,     And Henry born at Windsor should lose all.     Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish     His days may finish ere that hapless time.              Exit                                  SCENE 2.                        France. Before Rouen         Enter LA PUCELLE disguis'd, with four soldiers dressed             like countrymen, with sacks upon their backs    PUCELLE. These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,     Through which our policy must make a breach.     Take heed, be wary how you place your words;     Talk like the vulgar sort of market-men     That come to gather money for their corn.     If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,     And that we find the slothful watch but weak,     I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,     That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.   FIRST SOLDIER. Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,     And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;     Therefore we'll knock.                              [Knocks]   WATCH.  [Within]  Qui est la?   PUCELLE. Paysans, pauvres gens de France     Poor market-folks that come to sell their corn.   WATCH. Enter, go in; the market-bell is rung.   PUCELLE. Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the     ground.                                 [LA PUCELLE, &c., enter the town]          Enter CHARLES, BASTARD, ALENCON, REIGNIER, and forces    CHARLES. Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!     And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.   BASTARD. Here ent'red Pucelle and her practisants;     Now she is there, how will she specify     Here is the best and safest passage in?   ALENCON. By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;     Which once discern'd shows that her meaning is     No way to that, for weakness, which she ent'red.               Enter LA PUCELLE, on the top, thrusting out                          a torch burning    PUCELLE. Behold, this is the happy wedding torch     That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,     But burning fatal to the Talbotites.                    Exit   BASTARD. See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;     The burning torch in yonder turret stands.   CHARLES. Now shine it like a comet of revenge,     A prophet to the fall of all our foes!   ALENCON. Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;     Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,     And then do execution on the watch.  Alarum.           Exeunt                An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion    TALBOT. France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,     If Talbot but survive thy treachery.   PUCELLE, that witch, that damned sorceress,     Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,     That hardly we escap'd the pride of France.             Exit          An alarum; excursions. BEDFORD brought in sick in           a chair. Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without;          within, LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, BASTARD, ALENCON,                  and REIGNIER, on the walls    PUCELLE. Good morrow, gallants! Want ye corn for bread?     I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast     Before he'll buy again at such a rate.     'Twas full of darnel--do you like the taste?   BURGUNDY. Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan.     I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own,     And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.   CHARLES. Your Grace may starve, perhaps, before that time.   BEDFORD. O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!   PUCELLE. What you do, good grey beard? Break a     lance,     And run a tilt at death within a chair?   TALBOT. Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite,     Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours,     Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age     And twit with cowardice a man half dead?     Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,     Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.   PUCELLE. Are ye so hot, sir? Yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace;     If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.                  [The English party whisper together in council]     God speed the parliament! Who shall be the Speaker?   TALBOT. Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?   PUCELLE. Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,     To try if that our own be ours or no.   TALBOT. I speak not to that railing Hecate,     But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest.     Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?   ALENCON. Signior, no.   TALBOT. Signior, hang! Base muleteers of France!     Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls,     And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.   PUCELLE. Away, captains! Let's get us from the walls;     For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.     God b'uy, my lord; we came but to tell you     That we are here.                      Exeunt from the walls    TALBOT. And there will we be too, ere it be long,     Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!     Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,     Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,     Either to get the town again or die;     And I, as sure as English Henry lives     And as his father here was conqueror,     As sure as in this late betrayed town     Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried     So sure I swear to get the town or die.   BURGUNDY. My vows are equal partners with thy vows.   TALBOT. But ere we go, regard this dying prince,     The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,     We will bestow you in some better place,     Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.   BEDFORD. Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me;     Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen,     And will be partner of your weal or woe.   BURGUNDY. Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.   BEDFORD. Not to be gone from hence; for once I read     That stout Pendragon in his litter sick     Came to the field, and vanquished his foes.     Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,     Because I ever found them as myself.   TALBOT. Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!     Then be it so. Heavens keep old Bedford safe!     And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,     But gather we our forces out of hand     And set upon our boasting enemy.           Exeunt against the town all but BEDFORD and attendants             An alarum; excursions. Enter SIR JOHN FASTOLFE,                            and a CAPTAIN    CAPTAIN. Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?   FASTOLFE. Whither away? To save myself by flight:     We are like to have the overthrow again.   CAPTAIN. What! Will you and leave Lord Talbot?   FASTOLFE. Ay,     All the Talbots in the world, to save my life.          Exit    CAPTAIN. Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!                                               Exit into the town           Retreat; excursions. LA PUCELLE, ALENCON,                       and CHARLES fly    BEDFORD. Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,     For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.     What is the trust or strength of foolish man?     They that of late were daring with their scoffs     Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.             [BEDFORD dies and is carried in by two in his chair]            An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest    TALBOT. Lost and recovered in a day again!     This is a double honour, Burgundy.     Yet heavens have glory for this victory!   BURGUNDY. Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy     Enshrines thee in his heart, and there erects     Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.   TALBOT. Thanks, gentle Duke. But where is Pucelle now?     I think her old familiar is asleep.     Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?     What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief     That such a valiant company are fled.     Now will we take some order in the town,     Placing therein some expert officers;     And then depart to Paris to the King,     For there young Henry with his nobles lie.   BURGUNDY. What Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.   TALBOT. But yet, before we go, let's not forget     The noble Duke of Bedford, late deceas'd,     But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen.     A braver soldier never couched lance,     A gentler heart did never sway in court;     But kings and mightiest potentates must die,     For that's the end of human misery.                   Exeunt                                  SCENE 3.                        The plains near Rouen          Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD, ALENCON, LA PUCELLE,                           and forces    PUCELLE. Dismay not, Princes, at this accident,     Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered.     Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,     For things that are not to be remedied.     Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while     And like a peacock sweep along his tail;     We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,     If Dauphin and the rest will be but rul'd.   CHARLES. We have guided by thee hitherto,     And of thy cunning had no diffidence;     One sudden foil shall never breed distrust   BASTARD. Search out thy wit for secret policies,     And we will make thee famous through the world.     ALENCON. We'll set thy statue in some holy place,     And have thee reverenc'd like a blessed saint.     Employ thee, then, sweet virgin, for our good.   PUCELLE. Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:     By fair persuasions, mix'd with sug'red words,     We will entice the Duke of Burgundy     To leave the Talbot and to follow us.   CHARLES. Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,     France were no place for Henry's warriors;     Nor should that nation boast it so with us,     But be extirped from our provinces.   ALENCON. For ever should they be expuls'd from France,     And not have tide of an earldom here.   PUCELLE. Your honours shall perceive how I will work     To bring this matter to the wished end.                                           [Drum sounds afar off]     Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive     Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.            Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over                 at a distance, TALBOT and his forces      There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,     And all the troops of English after him.              French march. Enter the DUKE OF BURGUNDY and                          his forces      Now in the rearward comes the Duke and his.     Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.     Summon a parley; we will talk with him.                                        [Trumpets sound a parley]   CHARLES. A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!   BURGUNDY. Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?   PUCELLE. The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.   BURGUNDY. What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching     hence.   CHARLES. Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.   PUCELLE. Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!     Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.   BURGUNDY. Speak on; but be not over-tedious.   PUCELLE. Look on thy country, look on fertile France,     And see the cities and the towns defac'd     By wasting ruin of the cruel foe;     As looks the mother on her lowly babe     When death doth close his tender dying eyes,     See, see the pining malady of France;     Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,     Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast.     O, turn thy edged sword another way;     Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help!     One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom     Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore.     Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,     And wash away thy country's stained spots.   BURGUNDY. Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,     Or nature makes me suddenly relent.   PUCELLE. Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,     Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.     Who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation     That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?     When Talbot hath set footing once in France,     And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,     Who then but English Henry will be lord,     And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?     Call we to mind-and mark but this for proof:     Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?     And was he not in England prisoner?     But when they heard he was thine enemy     They set him free without his ransom paid,     In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.     See then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen,     And join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.     Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord;     Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.   BURGUNDY. I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers     Have batt'red me like roaring cannon-shot     And made me almost yield upon my knees.     Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen     And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace.     My forces and my power of men are yours;     So, farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.   PUCELLE. Done like a Frenchman-  [Aside]  turn and turn     again.   CHARLES. Welcome, brave Duke! Thy friendship makes us     fresh.   BASTARD. And doth beget new courage in our breasts.   ALENCON. Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,     And doth deserve a coronet of gold.   CHARLES. Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,     And seek how we may prejudice the foe.                Exeunt                               SCENE 4.                       Paris. The palace           Enter the KING, GLOUCESTER, WINCHESTER, YORK,              SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK, EXETER,            VERNON, BASSET, and others. To them, with                      his soldiers, TALBOT    TALBOT. My gracious Prince, and honourable peers,     Hearing of your arrival in this realm,     I have awhile given truce unto my wars     To do my duty to my sovereign;     In sign whereof, this arm that hath reclaim'd     To your obedience fifty fortresses,     Twelve cities, and seven walled towns of strength,     Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,     Lets fall his sword before your Highness' feet,     And with submissive loyalty of heart     Ascribes the glory of his conquest got     First to my God and next unto your Grace.           [Kneels]   KING HENRY. Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,     That hath so long been resident in France?   GLOUCESTER. Yes, if it please your Majesty, my liege.   KING HENRY. Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!     When I was young, as yet I am not old,     I do remember how my father said     A stouter champion never handled sword.     Long since we were resolved of your truth,     Your faithful service, and your toil in war;     Yet never have you tasted our reward,     Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,     Because till now we never saw your face.     Therefore stand up; and for these good deserts     We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;     And in our coronation take your place.               Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but VERNON and BASSET   VERNON. Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,     Disgracing of these colours that I wear     In honour of my noble Lord of York     Dar'st thou maintain the former words thou spak'st?   BASSET. Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage     The envious barking of your saucy tongue     Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.   VERNON. Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.   BASSET. Why, what is he? As good a man as York!   VERNON. Hark ye: not so. In witness, take ye that.                                                    [Strikes him]   BASSET. Villain, thou knowest the law of arms is such     That whoso draws a sword 'tis present death,     Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.     But I'll unto his Majesty and crave     I may have liberty to venge this wrong;     When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.   VERNON. Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;     And, after, meet you sooner than you would.           Exeunt     ACT IV. SCENE 1.  Park. The palace  Enter the KING, GLOUCESTER, WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK, TALBOT, EXETER, the GOVERNOR OF PARIS, and others    GLOUCESTER. Lord Bishop, set the crown upon his head.   WINCHESTER. God save King Henry, of that name the Sixth!   GLOUCESTER. Now, Governor of Paris, take your oath                                                [GOVERNOR kneels]     That you elect no other king but him,     Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,     And none your foes but such as shall pretend     Malicious practices against his state.     This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!                                    Exeunt GOVERNOR and his train                      Enter SIR JOHN FASTOLFE    FASTOLFE. My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,     To haste unto your coronation,     A letter was deliver'd to my hands,     Writ to your Grace from th' Duke of Burgundy.   TALBOT. Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!     I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next     To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg,  [Plucking it off]     Which I have done, because unworthily     Thou wast installed in that high degree.     Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest:     This dastard, at the battle of Patay,     When but in all I was six thousand strong,     And that the French were almost ten to one,     Before we met or that a stroke was given,     Like to a trusty squire did run away;     In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;     Myself and divers gentlemen beside     Were there surpris'd and taken prisoners.     Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss,     Or whether that such cowards ought to wear     This ornament of knighthood--yea or no.   GLOUCESTER. To say the truth, this fact was infamous     And ill beseeming any common man,     Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.   TALBOT. When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,     Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,     Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,     Such as were grown to credit by the wars;     Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress,     But always resolute in most extremes.     He then that is not furnish'd in this sort     Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,     Profaning this most honourable order,     And should, if I were worthy to be judge,     Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain     That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.   KING HENRY. Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy     doom.     Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight;     Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.                                                    Exit FASTOLFE      And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter     Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.   GLOUCESTER.  [Viewing the superscription]  What means his     Grace, that he hath chang'd his style?     No more but plain and bluntly 'To the King!'     Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?     Or doth this churlish superscription     Pretend some alteration in good-will?     What's here?  [Reads]  'I have, upon especial cause,     Mov'd with compassion of my country's wreck,     Together with the pitiful complaints     Of such as your oppression feeds upon,     Forsaken your pernicious faction,     And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'     O monstrous treachery! Can this be so     That in alliance, amity, and oaths,     There should be found such false dissembling guile?   KING HENRY. What! Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?   GLOUCESTER. He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.   KING HENRY. Is that the worst this letter doth contain?   GLOUCESTER. It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.   KING HENRY. Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with     him     And give him chastisement for this abuse.     How say you, my lord, are you not content?   TALBOT. Content, my liege! Yes; but that I am prevented,     I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.   KING HENRY. Then gather strength and march unto him     straight;     Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason.     And what offence it is to flout his friends.   TALBOT. I go, my lord, in heart desiring still     You may behold confusion of your foes.                  Exit                         Enter VERNON and BASSET    VERNON. Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.   BASSET. And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.   YORK. This is my servant: hear him, noble Prince.   SOMERSET. And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.   KING HENRY. Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak.     Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim,     And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?   VERNON. With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.   BASSET. And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.   KING HENRY. What is that wrong whereof you both     complain? First let me know, and then I'll answer you.   BASSET. Crossing the sea from England into France,     This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,     Upbraided me about the rose I wear,     Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves     Did represent my master's blushing cheeks     When stubbornly he did repugn the truth     About a certain question in the law     Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him;     With other vile and ignominious terms     In confutation of which rude reproach     And in defence of my lord's worthiness,     I crave the benefit of law of arms.   VERNON. And that is my petition, noble lord;     For though he seem with forged quaint conceit     To set a gloss upon his bold intent,     Yet know, my lord, I was provok'd by him,     And he first took exceptions at this badge,     Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower     Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.   YORK. Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?   SOMERSET. Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,     Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.   KING HENRY. Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick     men, When for so slight and frivolous a cause     Such factious emulations shall arise!     Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,     Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.   YORK. Let this dissension first be tried by fight,     And then your Highness shall command a peace.   SOMERSET. The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;     Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.   YORK. There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.   VERNON. Nay, let it rest where it began at first.   BASSET. Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.   GLOUCESTER. Confirm it so? Confounded be your strife;     And perish ye, with your audacious prate!     Presumptuous vassals, are you not asham'd     With this immodest clamorous outrage     To trouble and disturb the King and us?     And you, my lords--methinks you do not well     To bear with their perverse objections,     Much less to take occasion from their mouths     To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves.     Let me persuade you take a better course.   EXETER. It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.   KING HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:     Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,     Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.     And you, my lords, remember where we are:     In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;     If they perceive dissension in our looks     And that within ourselves we disagree,     How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd     To wilful disobedience, and rebel!     Beside, what infamy will there arise     When foreign princes shall be certified     That for a toy, a thing of no regard,     King Henry's peers and chief nobility     Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!     O, think upon the conquest of my father,     My tender years; and let us not forgo     That for a trifle that was bought with blood!     Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.     I see no reason, if I wear this rose,                                          [Putting on a red rose]     That any one should therefore be suspicious     I more incline to Somerset than York:     Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.     As well they may upbraid me with my crown,     Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.     But your discretions better can persuade     Than I am able to instruct or teach;     And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,     So let us still continue peace and love.     Cousin of York, we institute your Grace     To be our Regent in these parts of France.     And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite     Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;     And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,     Go cheerfully together and digest     Your angry choler on your enemies.     Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,     After some respite will return to Calais;     From thence to England, where I hope ere long     To be presented by your victories     With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.                          Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK,                                                   EXETER, VERNON   WARWICK. My Lord of York, I promise you, the King     Prettily, methought, did play the orator.   YORK. And so he did; but yet I like it not,     In that he wears the badge of Somerset.   WARWICK. Tush, that was but his fancy; blame him not;     I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.   YORK. An if I wist he did-but let it rest;     Other affairs must now be managed.                                            Exeunt all but EXETER   EXETER. Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;     For had the passions of thy heart burst out,     I fear we should have seen decipher'd there     More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,     Than yet can be imagin'd or suppos'd.     But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees     This jarring discord of nobility,     This shouldering of each other in the court,     This factious bandying of their favourites,     But that it doth presage some ill event.     'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;     But more when envy breeds unkind division:     There comes the ruin, there begins confusion.           Exit                                    SCENE 2.                          France. Before Bordeaux                     Enter TALBOT, with trump and drum    TALBOT. Go to the gates of Bordeaux, trumpeter;     Summon their general unto the wall.               Trumpet sounds a parley. Enter, aloft, the                  GENERAL OF THE FRENCH, and others      English John Talbot, Captains, calls you forth,     Servant in arms to Harry King of England;     And thus he would open your city gates,     Be humble to us, call my sovereign yours     And do him homage as obedient subjects,     And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power;     But if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,     You tempt the fury of my three attendants,     Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;     Who in a moment even with the earth     Shall lay your stately and air braving towers,     If you forsake the offer of their love.   GENERAL OF THE FRENCH. Thou ominous and fearful owl of     death,     Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!     The period of thy tyranny approacheth.     On us thou canst not enter but by death;     For, I protest, we are well fortified,     And strong enough to issue out and fight.     If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,     Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee.     On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd     To wall thee from the liberty of flight,     And no way canst thou turn thee for redress     But death doth front thee with apparent spoil     And pale destruction meets thee in the face.     Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament     To rive their dangerous artillery     Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.     Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,     Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!     This is the latest glory of thy praise     That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;     For ere the glass that now begins to run     Finish the process of his sandy hour,     These eyes that see thee now well coloured     Shall see thee withered, bloody, pale, and dead.                                                  [Drum afar off]     Hark! hark! The Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,     Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;     And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.             Exit   TALBOT. He fables not; I hear the enemy.     Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.     O, negligent and heedless discipline!     How are we park'd and bounded in a pale     A little herd of England's timorous deer,     Maz'd with a yelping kennel of French curs!     If we be English deer, be then in blood;     Not rascal-like to fall down with a pinch,     But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,     Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel     And make the cowards stand aloof at bay.     Sell every man his life as dear as mine,     And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.     God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,     Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!          Exeunt                               SCENE 3.                        Plains in Gascony          Enter YORK, with trumpet and many soldiers. A                    MESSENGER meets him    YORK. Are not the speedy scouts return'd again     That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?
