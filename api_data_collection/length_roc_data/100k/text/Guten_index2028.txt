The light of the table-lamp, softened and enriched by its mosaic shade, gave an appearance of added opulence to the already handsome appointments of the room. The little table-clock ticked merrily from half-past eleven to a quarter to twelve.  Into the cozy, bookish atmosphere of the novelist's study penetrated the muffled chime of Big Ben; it chimed the three-quarters. But, with his mind centered upon his work, Leroux wrote on ceaselessly.  An odd figure of a man was this popular novelist, with patchy and untidy hair which lessened the otherwise striking contour of his brow. A neglected and unpicturesque figure, in a baggy, neutral-colored dressing-gown; a figure more fitted to a garret than to this spacious, luxurious workroom, with the soft light playing upon rank after rank of rare and costly editions, deepening the tones in the Persian carpet, making red morocco more red, purifying the vellum and regilding the gold of the choice bindings, caressing lovingly the busts and statuettes surmounting the book-shelves, and twinkling upon the scantily-covered crown of Henry Leroux. The door bell rang.  Leroux, heedless of external matters, pursued his work. But the door bell rang again and continued to ring.  “Soames! Soames!” Leroux raised his voice irascibly, continuing to write the while. “Where the devil are you! Can't you hear the door bell?”  Soames did not reveal himself; and to the ringing of the bell was added the unmistakable rattling of a letter-box.  “Soames!” Leroux put down his pen and stood up. “Damn it! he's out! I have no memory!”  He retied the girdle of his dressing-gown, which had become unfastened, and opened the study door. Opposite, across the entrance lobby, was the outer door; and in the light from the lobby lamp he perceived two laughing eyes peering in under the upraised flap of the letter-box. The ringing ceased.  “Are you VERY angry with me for interrupting you?” cried a girl's voice.  “My dear Miss Cumberly!” said Leroux without irritation; “on the contrary--er--I am delighted to see you--or rather to hear you. There is nobody at home, you know.”...  “I DO know,” replied the girl firmly, “and I know something else, also. Father assures me that you simply STARVE yourself when Mrs. Leroux is away! So I have brought down an omelette!”  “Omelette!” muttered Leroux, advancing toward the door; “you have--er--brought an omelette! I understand--yes; you have brought an omelette? Er--that is very good of you.”  He hesitated when about to open the outer door, raising his hands to his dishevelled hair and unshaven chin. The flap of the letter-box dropped; and the girl outside could be heard stifling her laughter.  “You must think me--er--very rude,” began Leroux; “I mean--not to open the door. But”...  “I quite understand,” concluded the voice of the unseen one. “You are a most untidy object! And I shall tell Mira DIRECTLY she returns that she has no right to leave you alone like this! Now I am going to hurry back upstairs; so you may appear safely. Don't let the omelette get cold. Good night!”  “No, certainly I shall not!” cried Leroux. “So good of you--I--er--do like omelette.... Good night!”  Calmly he returned to his writing-table, where, in the pursuit of the elusive character whose exploits he was chronicling and who had brought him fame and wealth, he forgot in the same moment Helen Cumberly and the omelette.  The table-clock ticked merrily on; SCRATCH--SCRATCH--SPLUTTER--SCRATCH--went Henry Leroux's pen; for this up-to-date litterateur, essayist by inclination, creator of “Martin Zeda, Criminal Scientist” by popular clamor, was yet old-fashioned enough, and sufficient of an enthusiast, to pen his work, while lesser men dictated.  So, amidst that classic company, smiling or frowning upon him from the oaken shelves, where Petronius Arbiter, exquisite, rubbed shoulders with Balzac, plebeian; where Omar Khayyam leaned confidentially toward Philostratus; where Mark Twain, standing squarely beside Thomas Carlyle, glared across the room at George Meredith, Henry Leroux pursued the amazing career of “Martin Zeda.”  It wanted but five minutes to the hour of midnight, when again the door bell clamored in the silence.  Leroux wrote steadily on. The bell continued to ring, and, furthermore, the ringer could be heard beating upon the outer door.  “Soames!” cried Leroux irritably, “Soames! Why the hell don't you go to the door!”  Leroux stood up, dashing his pen upon the table.  “I shall have to sack that damned man!” he cried; “he takes too many liberties--stopping out until this hour of the night!”  He pulled open the study door, crossed the hallway, and opened the door beyond.  In, out of the darkness--for the stair lights had been extinguished--staggered a woman; a woman whose pale face exhibited, despite the ravages of sorrow or illness, signs of quite unusual beauty. Her eyes were wide opened, and terror-stricken, the pupils contracted almost to vanishing point. She wore a magnificent cloak of civet fur wrapped tightly about her, and, as Leroux opened the door, she tottered past him into the lobby, glancing back over her shoulder.  With his upraised hands plunged pathetically into the mop of his hair, Leroux turned and stared at the intruder. She groped as if a darkness had descended, clutched at the sides of the study doorway, and then, unsteadily, entered--and sank down upon the big chesterfield in utter exhaustion.  Leroux, rubbing his chin, perplexedly, walked in after her. He scarcely had his foot upon the study carpet, ere the woman started up, tremulously, and shot out from the enveloping furs a bare arm and a pointing, quivering finger.  “Close the door!” she cried hoarsely--“close the door!... He has... followed me!”...  The disturbed novelist, as a man in a dream, turned, retraced his steps, and closed the outer door of the flat. Then, rubbing his chin more vigorously than ever and only desisting from this exercise to fumble in his dishevelled hair, he walked back into the study, whose Athenean calm had thus mysteriously been violated.  Two minutes to midnight; the most respectable flat in respectable Westminster; a lonely and very abstracted novelist--and a pale-faced, beautiful woman, enveloped in costly furs, sitting staring with fearful eyes straight before her. This was such a scene as his sense of the proprieties and of the probabilities could never have permitted Henry Leroux to create.  His visitor kept moistening her dry lips and swallowing, emotionally.  Standing at a discreet distance from her:--  “Madam,” began Leroux, nervously.  She waved her hand, enjoining him to silence, and at the same time intimating that she would explain herself directly speech became possible. Whilst she sought to recover her composure, Leroux, gradually forcing himself out of the dreamlike state, studied her with a sort of anxious curiosity.  It now became apparent to him that his visitor was no more than twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, but illness or trouble, or both together, had seared and marred her beauty. Amid the auburn masses of her hair, gleamed streaks, not of gray, but of purest white. The low brow was faintly wrinkled, and the big--unnaturally big--eyes were purple shaded; whilst two heavy lines traced their way from the corner of the nostrils to the corner of the mouth--of the drooping mouth with the bloodless lips.  Her pallor became more strange and interesting the longer he studied it; for, underlying the skin was a yellow tinge which he found inexplicable, but which he linked in his mind with the contracted pupils of her eyes, seeking vainly for a common cause.  He had a hazy impression that his visitor, beneath her furs, was most inadequately clothed; and seeking confirmation of this, his gaze strayed downward to where one little slippered foot peeped out from the civet furs.  Leroux suppressed a gasp. He had caught a glimpse of a bare ankle!  He crossed to his writing-table, and seated himself, glancing sideways at this living mystery. Suddenly she began, in a voice tremulous and scarcely audible:--  “Mr. Leroux, at a great--at a very great personal risk, I have come to-night. What I have to ask of you--to entreat of you, will... will”...  Two bare arms emerged from the fur, and she began clutching at her throat and bosom as though choking--dying.  Leroux leapt up and would have run to her; but forcing a ghastly smile, she waved him away again.  “It is all right,” she muttered, swallowing noisily. But frightful spasms of pain convulsed her, contorting her pale face.  “Some brandy--!” cried Leroux, anxiously.  “If you please,” whispered the visitor.  She dropped her arms and fell back upon the chesterfield, insensible.     II  MIDNIGHT AND MR. KING   Leroux clutched at the corner of the writing-table to steady himself and stood there looking at the deathly face. Under the most favorable circumstances, he was no man of action, although in common with the rest of his kind he prided himself upon the possession of that presence of mind which he lacked. It was a situation which could not have alarmed “Martin Zeda,” but it alarmed, immeasurably, nay, struck inert with horror, Martin Zeda's creator.  Then, in upon Leroux's mental turmoil, a sensible idea intruded itself.  “Dr. Cumberly!” he muttered. “I hope to God he is in!”  Without touching the recumbent form upon the chesterfield, without seeking to learn, without daring to learn, if she lived or had died, Leroux, the tempo of his life changed to a breathless gallop, rushed out of the study, across the entrance hail, and, throwing wide the flat door, leapt up the stair to the flat above--that of his old friend, Dr. Cumberly.  The patter of the slippered feet grew faint upon the stair; then, as Leroux reached the landing above, became inaudible altogether.  In Leroux's study, the table-clock ticked merrily on, seeming to hasten its ticking as the hand crept around closer and closer to midnight. The mosaic shade of the lamp mingled reds and blues and greens upon the white ceiling above and poured golden light upon the pages of manuscript strewn about beneath it. This was a typical work-room of a literary man having the ear of the public--typical in every respect, save for the fur-clad figure outstretched upon the settee.  And now the peeping light indiscreetly penetrated to the hem of a silken garment revealed by some disarrangement of the civet fur. To the eye of an experienced observer, had such an observer been present in Henry Leroux's study, this billow of silk and lace behind the sheltering fur must have proclaimed itself the edge of a night-robe, just as the ankle beneath had proclaimed itself to Henry Leroux's shocked susceptibilities to be innocent of stocking.  Thirty seconds were wanted to complete the cycle of the day, when one of the listless hands thrown across the back of the chesterfield opened and closed spasmodically. The fur at the bosom of the midnight visitor began rapidly to rise and fall.  Then, with a choking cry, the woman struggled upright; her hair, hastily dressed, burst free of its bindings and poured in gleaming cascade down about her shoulders.  Clutching with one hand at her cloak in order to keep it wrapped about her, and holding the other blindly before her, she rose, and with that same odd, groping movement, began to approach the writing-table. The pupils of her eyes were mere pin-points now; she shuddered convulsively, and her skin was dewed with perspiration. Her breath came in agonized gasps.  “God!--I... am dying... and I cannot--tell him!” she breathed.  Feverishly, weakly, she took up a pen, and upon a quarto page, already half filled with Leroux's small, neat, illegible writing, began to scrawl a message, bending down, one hand upon the table, and with her whole body shaking.  Some three or four wavering lines she had written, when intimately, for the flat of Henry Leroux in Palace Mansions lay within sight of the clock-face--Big Ben began to chime midnight.  The writer started back and dropped a great blot of ink upon the paper; then, realizing the cause of the disturbance, forced herself to continue her task.  The chime being completed: ONE! boomed the clock; TWO!... THREE! ... FOUR!...  The light in the entrance-hall went out!  FIVE! boomed Big Ben;--SIX!... SEVEN!...  A hand, of old ivory hue, a long, yellow, clawish hand, with part of a sinewy forearm, crept in from the black lobby through the study doorway and touched the electric switch!  EIGHT!...  The study was plunged in darkness!  Uttering a sob--a cry of agony and horror that came from her very soul--the woman stood upright and turned to face toward the door, clutching the sheet of paper in one rigid hand.  Through the leaded panes of the window above the writing-table swept a silvern beam of moonlight. It poured, searchingly, upon the fur-clad figure swaying by the table; cutting through the darkness of the room like some huge scimitar, to end in a pallid pool about the woman's shadow on the center of the Persian carpet.  Coincident with her sobbing cry--NINE! boomed Big Ben; TEN!...  Two hands--with outstretched, crooked, clutching fingers--leapt from the darkness into the light of the moonbeam.  “God! Oh, God!” came a frenzied, rasping shriek--“MR. KING!”  Straight at the bare throat leapt the yellow hands; a gurgling cry rose--fell--and died away.  Gently, noiselessly, the lady of the civet fur sank upon the carpet by the table; as she fell, a dim black figure bent over her. The tearing of paper told of the note being snatched from her frozen grip; but never for a moment did the face or the form of her assailant encroach upon the moonbeam.  Batlike, this second and terrible visitant avoided the light.  The deed had occupied so brief a time that but one note of the great bell had accompanied it.  TWELVE! rang out the final stroke from the clock-tower. A low, eerie whistle, minor, rising in three irregular notes and falling in weird, unusual cadence to silence again, came from somewhere outside the room.  Then darkness--stillness--with the moon a witness of one more ghastly crime.  Presently, confused and intermingled voices from above proclaimed the return of Leroux with the doctor. They were talking in an excited key, the voice of Leroux, especially, sounding almost hysterical. They created such a disturbance that they attracted the attention of Mr. John Exel, M. P., occupant of the flat below, who at that very moment had returned from the House and was about to insert the key in the lock of his door. He looked up the stairway, but, all being in darkness, was unable to detect anything. Therefore he called out:--  “Is that you, Leroux? Is anything the matter?”  “Matter, Exel!” cried Leroux; “there's a devil of a business! For mercy's sake, come up!”  His curiosity greatly excited, Mr. Exel mounted the stairs, entering the lobby of Leroux's flat immediately behind the owner and Dr. Cumberly--who, like Leroux, was arrayed in a dressing-gown; for he had been in bed when summoned by his friend.  “You are all in the dark, here,” muttered Dr. Cumberly, fumbling for the switch.  “Some one has turned the light out!” whispered Leroux, nervously; “I left it on.”  Dr. Cumberly pressed the switch, turning up the lobby light as Exel entered from the landing. Then Leroux, entering the study first of the three, switched on the light there, also.  One glance he threw about the room, then started back like a man physically stricken.  “Cumberly!” he gasped, “Cumberly”--and he pointed to the furry heap by the writing-table.  “You said she lay on the chesterfield,” muttered Cumberly.  “I left her there.”...  Dr. Cumberly crossed the room and dropped upon his knees. He turned the white face toward the light, gently parted the civet fur, and pressed his ear to the silken covering of the breast. He started slightly and looked into the glazing eyes.  Replacing the fur which he had disarranged, the physician stood up and fixed a keen gaze upon the face of Henry Leroux. The latter swallowed noisily, moistening his parched lips.  “Is she”... he muttered; “is she”...  “God's mercy, Leroux!” whispered Mr. Exel--“what does this mean?”  “The woman is dead,” said Dr. Cumberly.  In common with all medical men, Dr. Cumberly was a physiognomist; he was a great physician and a proportionately great physiognomist. Therefore, when he looked into Henry Leroux's eyes, he saw there, and recognized, horror and consternation. With no further evidence than that furnished by his own powers of perception, he knew that the mystery of this woman's death was as inexplicable to Henry Leroux as it was inexplicable to himself.  He was a masterful man, with the gray eyes of a diplomat, and he knew Leroux as did few men. He laid both hands upon the novelist's shoulders.  “Brace up, old chap!” he said; “you will want all your wits about you.”  “I left her,” began Leroux, hesitatingly--“I left”...  “We know all about where you left her, Leroux,” interrupted Cumberly; “but what we want to get at is this: what occurred between the time you left her, and the time of our return?”  Exel, who had walked across to the table, and with a horror-stricken face was gingerly examining the victim, now exclaimed:--  “Why! Leroux! she is--she is... UNDRESSED!”  Leroux clutched at his dishevelled hair with both hands.  “My dear Exel!” he cried--“my dear, good man! Why do you use that tone? You say 'she is undressed!' as though I were responsible for the poor soul's condition!”  “On the contrary, Leroux!” retorted Exel, standing very upright, and staring through his monocle; “on the contrary, YOU misconstrue ME! I did not intend to imply--to insinuate--”  “My dear Exel!” broke in Dr. Cumberly--“Leroux is perfectly well aware that you intended nothing unkindly. But the poor chap, quite naturally, is distraught at the moment. You MUST understand that, man!”  “I understand; and I am sorry,” said Exel, casting a sidelong glance at the body. “Of course, it is a delicate subject. No doubt Leroux can explain.”...  “Damn your explanation!” shrieked Leroux hysterically. “I CANNOT explain! If I could explain, I”...  “Leroux!” said Cumberly, placing his arm paternally about the shaking man--“you are such a nervous subject. DO make an effort, old fellow. Pull yourself together. Exel does not know the circumstances--”  “I am curious to learn them,” said the M. P. icily.  Leroux was about to launch some angry retort, but Cumberly forced him into the chesterfield, and crossing to a bureau, poured out a stiff peg of brandy from a decanter which stood there. Leroux sank upon the chesterfield, rubbing his fingers up and down his palms with a curious nervous movement and glancing at the dead woman, and at Exel, alternately, in a mechanical, regular fashion, pathetic to behold.  Mr. Exel, tapping his boot with the head of his inverted cane, was staring fixedly at the doctor.  “Here you are, Leroux,” said Cumberly; “drink this up, and let us arrange our facts in decent order before we--”  “Phone for the police?” concluded Exel, his gaze upon the last speaker.  Leroux drank the brandy at a gulp and put down the glass upon a little persian coffee table with a hand which he had somehow contrived to steady.  “You are keen on the official forms, Exel?” he said, with a wry smile. “Please accept my apology for my recent--er--outburst, but picture this thing happening in your place!”  “I cannot,” declared Exel, bluntly.  “You lack imagination,” said Cumberly. “Take a whisky and soda, and help me to search the flat.”  “Search the flat!”  The physician raised a forefinger, forensically.  “Since you, Exel, if not actually in the building, must certainly have been within sight of the street entrance at the moment of the crime, and since Leroux and I descended the stair and met you on the landing, it is reasonable to suppose that the assassin can only be in one place: HERE!”  “HERE!” cried Exel and Leroux, together.  “Did you see anyone leave the lower hall as you entered?”  “No one; emphatically, there was no one there!”  “Then I am right.”  “Good God!” whispered Exel, glancing about him, with a new, and keen apprehensiveness.  “Take your drink,” concluded Cumberly, “and join me in my search.”  “Thanks,” replied Exel, nervously proffering a cigar-case; “but I won't drink.”  “As you wish,” said the doctor, who thus, in his masterful way, acted the host; “and I won't smoke. But do you light up.”  “Later,” muttered Exel; “later. Let us search, first.”  Leroux stood up; Cumberly forced him back.  “Stay where you are, Leroux; it is elementary strategy to operate from a fixed base. This study shall be the base. Ready, Exel?”  Exel nodded, and the search commenced. Leroux sat rigidly upon the settee, his hands resting upon his knees, watching and listening. Save for the merry ticking of the table-clock, and the movements of the searchers from room to room, nothing disturbed the silence. From the table, and that which lay near to it, he kept his gaze obstinately averted.  Five or six minutes passed in this fashion, Leroux expecting each to bring a sudden outcry. He was disappointed. The searchers returned, Exel noticeably holding himself aloof and Cumberly very stern.  Exel, a cigar between his teeth, walked to the writing-table, carefully circling around the dreadful obstacle which lay in his path, to help himself to a match. As he stooped to do so, he perceived that in the closed right hand of the dead woman was a torn scrap of paper.  “Leroux! Cumberly!” he exclaimed; “come here!”  He pointed with the match as Cumberly hurriedly crossed to his side. Leroux, inert, remained where he sat, but watched with haggard eyes. Dr. Cumberly bent down and sought to detach the paper from the grip of the poor cold fingers, without tearing it. Finally he contrived to release the fragment, and, perceiving it to bear some written words, he spread it out beneath the lamp, on the table, and eagerly scanned it, lowering his massive gray head close to the writing.  He inhaled, sibilantly.  “Do you see, Exel?” he jerked--for Exel was bending over his shoulder.  “I do--but I don't understand.”  “What is it?” came hollowly from Leroux.  “It is the bottom part of an unfinished note,” said Cumberly, slowly. “It is written shakily in a woman's hand, and it reads:--'Your wife'”...  Leroux sprang to his feet and crossed the room in three strides.  “Wife!” he muttered. His voice seemed to be choked in his throat; “my wife! It says something about my wife?”  “It says,” resumed the doctor, quietly, “'your wife.' Then there's a piece torn out, and the two words 'Mr. King.' No stop follows, and the line is evidently incomplete.”  “My wife!” mumbled Leroux, staring unseeingly at the fragment of paper. “MY WIFE! MR. KING! Oh! God! I shall go mad!”  “Sit down!” snapped Dr. Cumberly, turning to him; “damn it, Leroux, you are worse than a woman!”  In a manner almost childlike, the novelist obeyed the will of the stronger man, throwing himself into an armchair, and burying his face in his hands.  “My wife!” he kept muttering--“my wife!”...  Exel and the doctor stood staring at one another; when suddenly, from outside the flat, came a metallic clattering, followed by a little suppressed cry. Helen Cumberly, in daintiest deshabille, appeared in the lobby, carrying, in one hand, a chafing-dish, and, in the other, the lid. As she advanced toward the study, from whence she had heard her father's voice:--  “Why, Mr. Leroux!” she cried, “I shall CERTAINLY report you to Mira, now! You have not even touched the omelette!”  “Good God! Cumberly! stop her!” muttered Exel, uneasily. “The door was not latched!”...  But it was too late. Even as the physician turned to intercept his daughter, she crossed the threshold of the study. She stopped short at perceiving Exel; then, with a woman's unerring intuition, divined a tragedy, and, in the instant of divination, sought for, and found, the hub of the tragic wheel.  One swift glance she cast at the fur-clad form, prostrate.  The chafing-dish fell from her hand, and the omelette rolled, a grotesque mass, upon the carpet. She swayed, dizzily, raising one hand to her brow, but had recovered herself even as Leroux sprang forward to support her.  “All right, Leroux!” cried Cumberly; “I will take her upstairs again. Wait for me, Exel.”  Exel nodded, lighted his cigar, and sat down in a chair, remote from the writing-table.  “Mira--my wife!” muttered Leroux, standing, looking after Dr. Cumberly and his daughter as they crossed the lobby. “She will report to--my wife.”...  In the outer doorway, Helen Cumberly looked back over her shoulder, and her glance met that of Leroux. Hers was a healing glance and a strengthening glance; it braced him up as nothing else could have done. He turned to Exel.  “For Heaven's sake, Exel!” he said, evenly, “give me your advice--give me your help; I am going to 'phone for the police.”  Exel looked up with an odd expression.  “I am entirely at your service, Leroux,” he said. “I can quite understand how this ghastly affair has shaken you up.”  “It was so sudden,” said the other, plaintively. “It is incredible that so much emotion can be crowded into so short a period of a man's life.”...  Big Ben chimed the quarter after midnight. Leroux, eyes averted, walked to the writing-table, and took up the telephone.     III  INSPECTOR DUNBAR TAKES CHARGE   Detective-Inspector Dunbar was admitted by Dr. Cumberly. He was a man of notable height, large-boned, and built gauntly and squarely. His clothes fitted him ill, and through them one seemed to perceive the massive scaffolding of his frame. He had gray hair retiring above a high brow, but worn long and untidily at the back; a wire-like straight-cut mustache, also streaked with gray, which served to accentuate the grimness of his mouth and slightly undershot jaw. A massive head, with tawny, leonine eyes; indeed, altogether a leonine face, and a frame indicative of tremendous nervous energy.  In the entrance lobby he stood for a moment.  “My name is Cumberly,” said the doctor, glancing at the card which the Scotland Yard man had proffered. “I occupy the flat above.”  “Glad to know you, Dr. Cumberly,” replied the detective in a light and not unpleasant voice--and the fierce eyes momentarily grew kindly.  “This--” continued Cumberly, drawing Dunbar forward into the study, “is my friend, Leroux--Henry Leroux, whose name you will know?”  “I have not that pleasure,” replied Dunbar.  “Well,” added Cumberly, “he is a famous novelist, and his flat, unfortunately, has been made the scene of a crime. This is Detective-Inspector Dunbar, who has come to solve our difficulties, Leroux.” He turned to where Exel stood upon the hearth-rug--toying with his monocle. “Mr. John Exel, M. P.”  “Glad to know you, gentlemen,” said Dunbar.  Leroux rose from the armchair in which he had been sitting and stared, drearily, at the newcomer. Exel screwed the monocle into his right eye, and likewise surveyed the detective. Cumberly, taking a tumbler from the bureau, said:--  “A scotch-and-soda, Inspector?”  “It is a suggestion,” said Dunbar, “that, coming from a medical man, appeals.”  Whilst the doctor poured out the whisky and squirted the soda into the glass, Inspector Dunbar, standing squarely in the middle of the room, fixed his eyes upon the still form lying in the shadow of the writing-table.  “You will have been called in, doctor,” he said, taking the proffered tumbler, “at the time of the crime?”  “Exactly!” replied Cumberly. “Mr. Leroux ran up to my flat and summoned me to see the woman.”  “What time would that be?”  “Big Ben had just struck the final stroke of twelve when I came out on to the landing.”  “Mr. Leroux would be waiting there for you?”  “He stood in my entrance-lobby whilst I slipped on my dressing-gown, and we came down together.”  “I was entering from the street,” interrupted Exel, “as they were descending from above”...  “You can enter from the street, sir, in a moment,” said Dunbar, holding up his hand. “One witness at a time, if you please.”  Exel shrugged his shoulders and turned slightly, leaning his elbow upon the mantelpiece and flicking off the ash from his cigar.  “I take it you were in bed?” questioned Dunbar, turning again to the doctor.  “I had been in bed about a quarter of an hour when I was aroused by the ringing of the door-bell. This ringing struck me as so urgent that I ran out in my pajamas, and found there Mr. Leroux, in a very disturbed state--”  “What did he say? Give his own words as nearly as you remember them.”  Leroux, who had been standing, sank slowly back into the armchair, with his eyes upon Dr. Cumberly as the latter replied:--  “He said 'Cumberly! Cumberly! For God's sake, come down at once; there is a strange woman in my flat, apparently in a dying condition!'”  “What did you do?”  “I ran into my bedroom and slipped on my dressing-gown, leaving Mr. Leroux in the entrance-hall. Then, with the clock chiming the last stroke of midnight, we came out together and I closed my door behind me. There was no light on the stair; but our conversation--Mr. Leroux was speaking in a very high-pitched voice”...  “What was he saying?”  “He was explaining to me how some woman, unknown to him, had interrupted his work a few minutes before by ringing his door-bell.”...  Inspector Dunbar held up his hand.  “I won't ask you to repeat what he said, doctor; Mr. Leroux, presently, can give me his own words.”  “We had descended to this floor, then,” resumed Cumberly, “when Mr. Exel, entering below, called up to us, asking if anything was the matter. Leroux replied, 'Matter, Exel! There's a devil of a business! For mercy's sake, come up!'”  “Well?”  “Mr. Exel thereupon joined us at the door of this flat.”  “Was it open?”  “Yes. Mr. Leroux had rushed up to me, leaving the door open behind him. The light was out, both in the lobby and in the study, a fact upon which I commented at the time. It was all the more curious as Mr. Leroux had left both lights on!”...  “Did he say so?”  “He did. The circumstances surprised him to a marked degree. We came in and I turned up the light in the lobby. Then Leroux, entering the study, turned up the light there, too. I entered next, followed by Mr. Exel--and we saw the body lying where you see it now.”  “Who saw it first?”  “Mr. Leroux; he drew my attention to it, saying that he had left her lying on the chesterfield and NOT upon the floor.”  “You examined her?”  “I did. She was dead, but still warm. She exhibited signs of recent illness, and of being addicted to some drug habit; probably morphine. This, beyond doubt, contributed to her death, but the direct cause was asphyxiation. She had been strangled!”  “My God!” groaned Leroux, dropping his face into his hands.  “You found marks on her throat?”  “The marks were very slight. No great pressure was required in her weak condition.”  “You did not move the body?”  “Certainly not; a more complete examination must be made, of course. But I extracted a piece of torn paper from her clenched right hand.”  Inspector Dunbar lowered his tufted brows.  “I'm not glad to know you did that,” he said. “It should have been left.”  “It was done on the spur of the moment, but without altering the position of the hand or arm. The paper lies upon the table, yonder.”  Inspector Dunbar took a long drink. Thus far he had made no attempt to examine the victim. Pulling out a bulging note-case from the inside pocket of his blue serge coat, he unscrewed a fountain-pen, carefully tested the nib upon his thumb nail, and made three or four brief entries. Then, stretching out one long arm, he laid the wallet and the pen beside his glass upon the top of a bookcase, without otherwise changing his position, and glancing aside at Exel, said:--  “Now, Mr. Exel, what help can you give us?”  “I have little to add to Dr. Cumberly's account,” answered Exel, offhandedly. “The whole thing seemed to me”...  “What it seemed,” interrupted Dunbar, “does not interest Scotland Yard, Mr. Exel, and won't interest the jury.”  Leroux glanced up for a moment, then set his teeth hard, so that his jaw muscles stood out prominently under the pallid skin.  “What do you want to know, then?” asked Exel.  “I will be wanting to know,” said Dunbar, “where you were coming from, to-night?”  “From the House of Commons.”  “You came direct?”  “I left Sir Brian Malpas at the corner of Victoria Street at four minutes to twelve by Big Ben, and walked straight home, actually entering here, from the street, as the clock was chiming the last stroke of midnight.”  “Then you would have walked up the street from an easterly direction?”  “Certainly.”  “Did you meet any one or anything?”  “A taxi-cab, empty--for the hood was lowered--passed me as I turned the corner. There was no other vehicle in the street, and no person.”  “You don't know from which door the cab came?”  “As I turned the corner,” replied Exel, “I heard the man starting his engine, although when I actually saw the cab, it was in motion; but judging by the sound to which I refer, the cab had been stationary, if not at the door of Palace Mansions, certainly at that of the next block--St. Andrew's Mansions.”  “Did you hear, or see anything else?”  “I saw nothing whatever. But just as I approached the street door, I heard a peculiar whistle, apparently proceeding from the gardens in the center of the square. I attached no importance to it at the time.”  “What kind of whistle?”  “I have forgotten the actual notes, but the effect was very odd in some way.”  “In what way?”  “An impression of this sort is not entirely reliable, Inspector; but it struck me as Oriental.”  “Ah!” said Dunbar, and reached out the long arm for his notebook.  “Can I be of any further assistance?” said Exel, glancing at his watch.  “You had entered the hall-way and were about to enter your own flat when the voices of Dr. Cumberly and Mr. Leroux attracted your attention?”  “I actually had the key in my hand,” replied Exel.  “Did you actually have the key in the lock?”  “Let me think,” mused Exel, and he took out a bunch of keys and dangled them, reflectively, before his eyes. “No! I was fumbling for the right key when I heard the voices above me.”  “But were you facing your door?”  “No,” averred Exel, perceiving the drift of the inspector's inquiries; “I was facing the stairway the whole time, and although it was in darkness, there is a street lamp immediately outside on the pavement, and I can swear, positively, that no one descended; that there was no one in the hall nor on the stair, except Mr. Leroux and Dr. Cumberly.”  “Ah!” said Dunbar again, and made further entries in his book. “I need not trouble you further, sir. Good night!”  Exel, despite his earlier attitude of boredom, now ignored this official dismissal, and, tossing the stump of his cigar into the grate, lighted a cigarette, and with both hands thrust deep in his pockets, stood leaning back against the mantelpiece. The detective turned to Leroux.  “Have a brandy-and-soda?” suggested Dr. Cumberly, his eyes turned upon the pathetic face of the novelist.  But Leroux shook his head, wearily.  “Go ahead, Inspector!” he said. “I am anxious to tell you all I know. God knows I am anxious to tell you.”  A sound was heard of a key being inserted in the lock of a door.  Four pairs of curious eyes were turned toward the entrance lobby, when the door opened, and a sleek man of medium height, clean shaven, but with his hair cut low upon the cheek bones, so as to give the impression of short side-whiskers, entered in a manner at once furtive and servile.  He wore a black overcoat and a bowler hat. Reclosing the door, he turned, perceived the group in the study, and fell back as though someone had struck him a fierce blow.  Abject terror was written upon his features, and, for a moment, the idea of flight appeared to suggest itself urgently to him; but finally, he took a step forward toward the study.  “Who's this?” snapped Dunbar, without removing his leonine eyes from the newcomer.  “It is Soames,” came the weary voice of Leroux.  “Butler?”  “Yes.”  “Where's he been?”  “I don't know. He remained out without my permission.”  “He did, eh?”  Inspector Dunbar thrust forth a long finger at the shrinking form in the doorway.  “Mr. Soames,” he said, “you will be going to your own room and waiting there until I ring for you.”  “Yes, sir,” said Soames, holding his hat in both bands, and speaking huskily. “Yes, sir: certainly, sir.”  He crossed the lobby and disappeared.  “There is no other way out, is there?” inquired the detective, glancing at Dr. Cumberly.  “There is no other way,” was the reply; “but surely you don't suspect”...  “I would suspect the Archbishop of Westminster,” snapped Dunbar, “if he came in like that! Now, sir,”--he turned to Leroux--“you were alone, here, to-night?”  “Quite alone, Inspector. The truth is, I fear, that my servants take liberties in the absence of my wife.”  “In the absence of your wife? Where is your wife?”  “She is in Paris.”  “Is she a Frenchwoman?”  “No! oh, no! But my wife is a painter, you understand, and--er--I met her in Paris--er--... Must you insist upon these--domestic particulars, Inspector?”  “If Mr. Exel is anxious to turn in,” replied the inspector, “after his no doubt exhausting duties at the House, and if Dr. Cumberly--”  “I have no secrets from Cumberly!” interjected Leroux. “The doctor has known me almost from boyhood, but--er--” turning to the politician--“don't you know, Exel--no offense, no offense”...  “My dear Leroux,” responded Exel hastily, “I am the offender! Permit me to wish you all good night.”  He crossed the study, and, at the door, paused and turned.  “Rely upon me, Leroux,” he said, “to help in any way within my power.”  He crossed the lobby, opened the outer door, and departed.  “Now, Mr. Leroux,” resumed Dunbar, “about this matter of your wife's absence.”     IV  A WINDOW IS OPENED   Whilst Henry Leroux collected his thoughts, Dr. Cumberly glanced across at the writing-table where lay the fragment of paper which had been clutched in the dead woman's hand, then turned his head again toward the inspector, staring at him curiously. Since Dunbar had not yet attempted even to glance at the strange message, he wondered what had prompted the present line of inquiry.  “My wife,” began Leroux, “shared a studio in Paris, at the time that I met her, with an American lady a very talented portrait painter--er--a Miss Denise Ryland. You may know her name?--but of course, you don't, no! Well, my wife is, herself, quite clever with her brush; in fact she has exhibited more than once at the Paris Salon. We agreed at--er--the time of our--of our--engagement, that she should be free to visit her old artistic friends in Paris at any time. You understand? There was to be no let or hindrance.... Is this really necessary, Inspector?”  “Pray go on, Mr. Leroux.”  “Well, you understand, it was a give-and-take arrangement; because I am afraid that I, myself, demand certain--sacrifices from my wife--and--er--I did not feel entitled to--interfere”...  “You see, Inspector,” interrupted Dr. Cumberly, “they are a Bohemian pair, and Bohemians, inevitably, bore one another at times! This little arrangement was intended as a safety-valve. Whenever ennui attacked Mrs. Leroux, she was at liberty to depart for a week to her own friends in Paris, leaving Leroux to the bachelor's existence which is really his proper state; to go unshaven and unshorn, to dine upon bread and cheese and onions, to work until all hours of the morning, and generally to enjoy himself!”  “Does she usually stay long?” inquired Dunbar.  “Not more than a week, as a rule,” answered Leroux.  “You must excuse me,” continued the detective, “if I seem to pry into intimate matters; but on these occasions, how does Mrs. Leroux get on for money?”  “I have opened a credit for her,” explained the novelist, wearily, “at the Credit Lyonnais, in Paris.”  Dunbar scribbled busily in his notebook.  “Does she take her maid with her?” he jerked, suddenly.  “She has no maid at the moment,” replied Leroux; “she has been without one for twelve months or more, now.”  “When did you last hear from her?”  “Three days ago.”  “Did you answer the letter?”  “Yes; my answer was amongst the mail which Soames took to the post, to-night.”  “You said, though, if I remember rightly, that he was out without permission?”  Leroux ran his fingers through his hair.  “I meant that he should only have been absent five minutes or so; whilst he remained out for more than an hour.”  Inspector Dunbar nodded, comprehendingly, tapping his teeth with the head of the fountain-pen.  “And the other servants?”  “There are only two: a cook and a maid. I released them for the evening--glad to get rid of them--wanted to work.”  “They are late?”  “They take liberties, damnable liberties, because I am easy-going.”  “I see,” said Dunbar. “So that you were quite alone this evening, when”--he nodded in the direction of the writing-table--“your visitor came?”  “Quite alone.”  “Was her arrival the first interruption?”  “No--er--not exactly. Miss Cumberly...”  “My daughter,” explained Dr. Cumberly, “knowing that Mr. Leroux, at these times, was very neglectful in regard to meals, prepared him an omelette, and brought it down in a chafing-dish.”  “How long did she remain?” asked the inspector of Leroux.  “I--er--did not exactly open the door. We chatted, through--er--through the letter-box, and she left the omelette outside on the landing.”  “What time would that be?”  “It was a quarter to twelve,” declared Cumberly. “I had been supping with some friends, and returned to find Helen, my daughter, engaged in preparing the omelette. I congratulated her upon the happy thought, knowing that Leroux was probably starving himself.”  “I see. The omelette, though, seems to be upset here on the floor?” said the inspector.  Cumberly briefly explained how it came to be there, Leroux punctuating his friend's story with affirmative nods.  “Then the door of the flat was open all the time?” cried Dunbar.  “Yes,” replied Cumberly; “but whilst Exel and I searched the other rooms--and our search was exhaustive--Mr. Leroux remained here in the study, and in full view of the lobby--as you see for yourself.”  “No living thing,” said Leroux, monotonously, “left this flat from the time that the three of us, Exel, Cumberly, and I, entered, up to the time that Miss Cumberly came, and, with the doctor, went out again.”  “H'm!” said the inspector, making notes; “it appears so, certainly. I will ask you then, for your own account, Mr. Leroux, of the arrival of the woman in the civet furs. Pay special attention”--he pointed with his fountain-pen--“to the TIME at which the various incidents occurred.”  Leroux, growing calmer as he proceeded with the strange story, complied with the inspector's request. He had practically completed his account when the door-bell rang.  “It's the servants,” said Dr. Cumberly. “Soames will open the door.”  But Soames did not appear.  The ringing being repeated:--  “I told him to remain in his room,” said Dunbar, “until I rang for him, I remember--”  “I will open the door,” said Cumberly.  “And tell the servants to stay in the kitchen,” snapped Dunbar.  Dr. Cumberly opened the door, admitting the cook and housemaid.  “There has been an unfortunate accident,” he said--“but not to your master; you need not be afraid. But be good enough to remain in the kitchen for the present.”  Peeping in furtively as they passed, the two women crossed the lobby and went to their own quarters.  “Mr. Soames next,” muttered Dunbar, and, glancing at Cumberly as he returned from the lobby:--“Will you ring for him?” he requested.  Dr. Cumberly nodded, and pressed a bell beside the mantelpiece. An interval followed, in which the inspector made notes and Cumberly stood looking at Leroux, who was beating his palms upon his knees, and staring unseeingly before him.  Cumberly rang again; and in response to the second ring, the housemaid appeared at the door.  “I rang for Soames,” said Dr. Cumberly.  “He is not in, sir,” answered the girl.  Inspector Dunbar started as though he had been bitten.  “What!” he cried; “not in?”  “No, sir,” said the girl, with wide-open, frightened eyes.  Dunbar turned to Cumberly.  “You said there was no other way out!”  “There IS no other way, to my knowledge.”  “Where's his room?”  Cumberly led the way to a room at the end of a short corridor, and Inspector Dunbar, entering, and turning up the light, glanced about the little apartment. It was a very neat servants' bedroom; with comfortable, quite simple, furniture; but the chest-of-drawers had been hastily ransacked, and the contents of a trunk--or some of its contents--lay strewn about the floor.  “He has packed his grip!” came Leroux's voice from the doorway. “It's gone!”  The window was wide open. Dunbar sprang forward and leaned out over the ledge, looking to right and left, above and below.  A sort of square courtyard was beneath, and for the convenience of tradesmen, a hand-lift was constructed outside the kitchens of the three flats comprising the house; i. e.:--Mr. Exel's, ground floor, Henry Leroux's second floor, and Dr. Cumberly's, top. It worked in a skeleton shaft which passed close to the left of Soames' window.  For an active man, this was a good enough ladder, and the inspector withdrew his head shrugging his square shoulders, irritably.  “My fault entirely!” he muttered, biting his wiry mustache. “I should have come and seen for myself if there was another way out.”  Leroux, in a new flutter of excitement, now craned from the window.  “It might be possible to climb down the shaft,” he cried, after a brief survey, “but not if one were carrying a heavy grip, such as that which he has taken!”  “H'm!” said Dunbar. “You are a writing gentleman, I understand, and yet it does not occur to you that he could have lowered the bag on a cord, if he wanted to avoid the noise of dropping it!”  “Yes--er--of course!” muttered Leroux. “But really--but really--oh, good God! I am bewildered! What in Heaven's name does it all mean!”  “It means trouble,” replied Dunbar, grimly; “bad trouble.”  They returned to the study, and Inspector Dunbar, for the first time since his arrival, walked across and examined the fragmentary message, raising his eyebrows when he discovered that it was written upon the same paper as Leroux's MSS. He glanced, too, at the pen lying on a page of “Martin Zeda” near the lamp and at the inky splash which told how hastily the pen had been dropped.  Then--his brows drawn together--he stooped to the body of the murdered woman. Partially raising the fur cloak, he suppressed a gasp of astonishment.  “Why! she only wears a silk night-dress, and a pair of suede slippers!”  He glanced back over his shoulder.  “I had noted that,” said Cumberly. “The whole business is utterly extraordinary.”  “Extraordinary is no word for it!” growled the inspector, pursuing his examination.... “Marks of pressure at the throat--yes; and generally unhealthy appearance.”  “Due to the drug habit,” interjected Dr. Cumberly.  “What drug?”  “I should not like to say out of hand; possibly morphine.”  “No jewelry,” continued the detective, musingly; “wedding ring--not a new one. Finger nails well cared for, but recently neglected. Hair dyed to hide gray patches; dye wanted renewing. Shoes, French. Night-robe, silk; good lace; probably French, also. Faint perfume--don't know what it is--apparently proceeding from civet fur. Furs, magnificent; very costly.”...  He slightly moved the table-lamp in order to direct its light upon the white face. The bloodless lips were parted and the detective bent, closely peering at the teeth thus revealed.  “Her teeth were oddly discolored, doctor,” he said, taking out a magnifying glass and examining them closely. “They had been recently scaled, too; so that she was not in the habit of neglecting them.”  Dr. Cumberly nodded.  “The drug habit, again,” he said guardedly; “a proper examination will establish the full facts.”  The inspector added brief notes to those already made, ere he rose from beside the body. Then:--  “You are absolutely certain,” he said, deliberately, facing Leroux, “that you had never set eyes on this woman prior to her coming here, to-night?”  “I can swear it!” said Leroux.  “Good!” replied the detective, and closed his notebook with a snap. “Usual formalities will have to be gone through, but I don't think I need trouble you, gentlemen, any further, to-night.”     V  DOCTORS DIFFER   Dr. Cumberly walked slowly upstairs to his own flat, a picture etched indelibly upon his mind, of Henry Leroux, with a face of despair, sitting below in his dining-room and listening to the ominous sounds proceeding from the study, where the police were now busily engaged. In the lobby he met his daughter Helen, who was waiting for him in a state of nervous suspense.  “Father!” she began, whilst rebuke died upon the doctor's lips--“tell me quickly what has happened.”  Perceiving that an explanation was unavoidable, Dr. Cumberly outlined the story of the night's gruesome happenings, whilst Big Ben began to chime the hour of one.  Helen, eager-eyed, and with her charming face rather pale, hung upon every word of the narrative.  “And now,” concluded her father, “you must go to bed. I insist.”  “But father!” cried the girl--“there is some thing”...  She hesitated, uneasily.  “Well, Helen, go on,” said the doctor.  “I am afraid you will refuse.”  “At least give me the opportunity.”  “Well--in the glimpse, the half-glimpse, which I had of her, I seemed”...  Dr. Cumberly rested his hands upon his daughter's shoulders characteristically, looking into the troubled gray eyes.  “You don't mean,” he began...  “I thought I recognized her!” whispered the girl.  “Good God! can it be possible?”  “I have been trying, ever since, to recall where we had met, but without result. It might mean so much”...  Dr. Cumberly regarded her, fixedly.  “It might mean so much to--Mr. Leroux. But I suppose you will say it is impossible?”  “It IS impossible,” said Dr. Cumberly firmly; “dismiss the idea, Helen.”  “But father,” pleaded the girl, placing her hands over his own, “consider what is at stake”...  “I am anxious that you should not become involved in this morbid business.”  “But you surely know me better than to expect me to faint or become hysterical, or anything silly like that! I was certainly shocked when I came down to-night, because--well, it was all so frightfully unexpected”...  Dr. Cumberly shook his head. Helen put her arms about his neck and raised her eyes to his.  “You have no right to refuse,” she said, softly: “don't you see that?”  Dr. Cumberly frowned. Then:--  “You are right, Helen,” he agreed. “I should know your pluck well enough. But if Inspector Dunbar is gone, the police may refuse to admit us”...  “Then let us hurry!” cried Helen. “I am afraid they will take away”...  Side by side they descended to Henry Leroux's flat, ringing the bell, which, an hour earlier, the lady of the civet furs had rung.  A sergeant in uniform opened the door.  “Is Detective-Inspector Dunbar here?” inquired the physician.  “Yes, sir.”  “Say that Dr. Cumberly wishes to speak to him. And”--as the man was about to depart--“request him not to arouse Mr. Leroux.”  Almost immediately the inspector appeared, a look of surprise upon his face, which increased on perceiving the girl beside her father.  “This is my daughter, Inspector,” explained Cumberly; “she is a contributor to the Planet, and to various magazines, and in this journalistic capacity, meets many people in many walks of life. She thinks she may be of use to you in preparing your case.”  Dunbar bowed rather awkwardly.  “Glad to meet you, Miss Cumberly,” came the inevitable formula. “Entirely at your service.”  “I had an idea, Inspector,” said the girl, laying her hand confidentially upon Dunbar's arm, “that I recognized, when I entered Mr. Leroux's study, tonight”--Dunbar nodded--“that I recognized--the--the victim!”  “Good!” said the inspector, rubbing his palms briskly together. His tawny eyes sparkled. “And you would wish to see her again before we take her away. Very plucky of you, Miss Cumberly! But then, you are a doctor's daughter.”  They entered, and the inspector closed the door behind them.  “Don't arouse poor Leroux,” whispered Cumberly to the detective. “I left him on a couch in the dining-room.”...  “He is still there,” replied Dunbar; “poor chap! It is”...  He met Helen's glance, and broke off shortly.  In the study two uniformed constables, and an officer in plain clothes, were apparently engaged in making an inventory--or such was the impression conveyed. The clock ticked merrily on; its ticking a desecration, where all else was hushed in deference to the grim visitor. The body of the murdered woman had been laid upon the chesterfield, and a little, dark, bearded man was conducting an elaborate examination; when, seeing the trio enter, he hastily threw the coat of civet fur over the body, and stood up, facing the intruders.  “It's all right, doctor,” said the inspector; “and we shan't detain you a moment.” He glanced over his shoulder. “Mr. Hilton, M. R. C. S.” he said, indicating the dark man--“Dr. Cumberly and Miss Cumberly.”  The divisional surgeon bowed to Helen and eagerly grasped the hand of the celebrated physician.  “I am fortunate in being able to ask your opinion,” he began....  Dr. Cumberly nodded shortly, and with upraised hand, cut him short.  “I shall willingly give you any assistance in my power,” he said; “but my daughter has voluntarily committed herself to a rather painful ordeal, and I am anxious to get it over.”  He stooped and raised the fur from the ghastly face.  Helen, her hand resting upon her father's shoulder, ventured one rapid glance and then looked away, shuddering slightly. Dr. Cumberly replaced the coat and gazed anxiously at his daughter. But Helen, with admirable courage, having closed her eyes for a moment, reopened them, and smiled at her father's anxiety. She was pale, but perfectly composed.  “Well, Miss Cumberly?” inquired the inspector, eagerly; whilst all in the room watched this slim girl in her charming deshabille, this dainty figure so utterly out of place in that scene of morbid crime.  She raised her gray eyes to the detective.  “I still believe that I have seen the face, somewhere, before. But I shall have to reflect a while--I meet so many folks, you know, in a casual way--before I can commit myself to any statement.”  In the leonine eyes looking into hers gleamed the light of admiration and approval. The canny Scotsman admired this girl for her beauty, as a matter of course, for her courage, because courage was a quality standing high in his estimation, but, above all, for her admirable discretion.  “Very proper, Miss Cumberly,” he said; “very proper and wise on your part. I don't wish to hurry you in any way, but”--he hesitated, glancing at the man in plain clothes, who had now resumed a careful perusal of a newspaper--“but her name doesn't happen to be Vernon--”  “Vernon!” cried the girl, her eyes lighting up at sound of the name. “Mrs. Vernon! it is! it is! She was pointed out to me at the last Arts Ball--where she appeared in a most monstrous Chinese costume--”  “Chinese?” inquired Dunbar, producing the bulky notebook.  “Yes. Oh! poor, poor soul!”  “You know nothing further about her, Miss Cumberly?”  “Nothing, Inspector. She was merely pointed out to me as one of the strangest figures in the hall. Her husband, I understand, is an art expert--”  “He WAS!” said Dunbar, closing the book sharply. “He died this afternoon; and a paragraph announcing his death appears in the newspaper which we found in the victim's fur coat!”  “But how--”  “It was the only paragraph on the half-page folded outwards which was in any sense PERSONAL. I am greatly indebted to you, Miss Cumberly; every hour wasted on a case like this means a fresh plait in the rope around the neck of the wrong man!”  Helen Cumberly grew slowly quite pallid.  “Good night,” she said; and bowing to the detective and to the surgeon, she prepared to depart.  Mr. Hilton touched Dr. Cumberly's arm, as he, too, was about to retire.  “May I hope,” he whispered, “that you will return and give me the benefit of your opinion in making out my report?”  Dr. Cumberly glanced at his daughter; and seeing her to be perfectly composed:--“For the moment, I have formed no opinion, Mr. Hilton,”  he said, quietly, “not having had an opportunity to conduct a proper examination.”  Hilton bent and whispered, confidentially, in the other's ear:--  “She was drugged!”  The innuendo underlying the words struck Dr. Cumberly forcibly, and he started back with his brows drawn together in a frown.  “Do you mean that she was addicted to the use of drugs?” he asked, sharply; “or that the drugging took place to-night.”  “The drugging DID take place to-night!” whispered the other. “An injection was made in the left shoulder with a hypodermic syringe; the mark is quite fresh.”  Dr. Cumberly glared at his fellow practitioner, angrily.  “Are there no other marks of injection?” he asked.  “On the left forearm, yes. Obviously self-administered. Oh, I don't deny the habit! But my point is this: the injection in the shoulder was NOT self-administered.”  “Come, Helen,” said Cumberly, taking his daughter's arm; for she had drawn near, during the colloquy--“you must get to bed.”  His face was very stern when he turned again to Mr. Hilton.  “I shall return in a few minutes,” he said, and escorted his daughter from the room.     VI  AT SCOTLAND YARD   Matters of vital importance to some people whom already we have met, and to others whom thus far we have not met, were transacted in a lofty and rather bleak looking room at Scotland Yard between the hours of nine and ten A. M.; that is, later in the morning of the fateful day whose advent we have heard acclaimed from the Tower of Westminster.  The room, which was lighted by a large French window opening upon a balcony, commanded an excellent view of the Thames Embankment. The floor was polished to a degree of brightness, almost painful. The distempered walls, save for a severe and solitary etching of a former Commissioner, were nude in all their unloveliness. A heavy deal table (upon which rested a blotting-pad, a pewter ink-pot, several newspapers and two pens) together with three deal chairs, built rather as monuments of durability than as examples of art, constituted the only furniture, if we except an electric lamp with a green glass shade, above the table.  This was the room of Detective-Inspector Dunbar; and Detective-Inspector Dunbar, at the hour of our entrance, will be found seated in the chair, placed behind the table, his elbows resting upon the blotting-pad.  At ten minutes past nine, exactly, the door opened, and a thick-set, florid man, buttoned up in a fawn colored raincoat and wearing a bowler hat of obsolete build, entered. He possessed a black mustache, a breezy, bustling manner, and humorous blue eyes; furthermore, when he took off his hat, he revealed the possession of a head of very bristly, upstanding, black hair. This was Detective-Sergeant Sowerby, and the same who was engaged in examining a newspaper in the study of Henry Leroux when Dr. Cumberly and his daughter had paid their second visit to that scene of an unhappy soul's dismissal.  “Well?” said Dunbar, glancing up at his subordinate, inquiringly.  “I have done all the cab depots,” reported Sergeant Sowerby, “and a good many of the private owners; but so far the man seen by Mr. Exel has not turned up.”  “The word will be passed round now, though,” said Dunbar, “and we shall probably have him here during the day.”  “I hope so,” said the other good-humoredly, seating himself upon one of the two chairs ranged beside the wall. “If he doesn't show up.”...  “Well?” jerked Dunbar--“if he doesn't?”  “It will look very black against Leroux.”  Dunbar drummed upon the blotting-pad with the fingers of his left hand.  “It beats anything of the kind that has ever come my way,” he confessed. “You get pretty cautious at weighing people up, in this business; but I certainly don't think--mind you, I go no further--but I certainly don't think Mr. Henry Leroux would willingly kill a fly; yet there is circumstantial evidence enough to hang him.”  Sergeant Sowerby nodded, gazing speculatively at the floor.  “I wonder,” he said, slowly, “why the girl--Miss Cumberly--hesitated about telling us the woman's name?”  “I am not wondering about that at all,” replied Dunbar, bluntly. “She must meet thousands in the same way. The wonder to me is that she remembered at all. I am open to bet half-a-crown that YOU couldn't remember the name of every woman you happened to have pointed out to you at an Arts Ball?”  “Maybe not,” agreed Sowerby; “she's a smart girl, I'll allow. I see you have last night's papers there?”  “I have,” replied Dunbar; “and I'm wondering”...  “If there's any connection?”  “Well,” continued the inspector, “it looks on the face of it as though the news of her husband's death had something to do with Mrs. Vernon's presence at Leroux's flat. It's not a natural thing for a woman, on the evening of her husband's death, to rush straight away to another man's place”...  “It's strange we couldn't find her clothes”...  “It's not strange at all! You're simply obsessed with the idea that this was a love intrigue! Think, man! the most abandoned woman wouldn't run to keep an appointment with a lover at a time like that! And remember she had the news in her pocket! She came to that flat dressed--or undressed--just as we found her; I'm sure of it. And a point like that sometimes means the difference between hanging and acquittal.”  Sergeant Sowerby digested these words, composing his jovial countenance in an expression of unnatural profundity. Then:--  “THE point to my mind,” he said, “is the one raised by Mr. Hilton. By gum! didn't Dr. Cumberly tell him off!”  “Dr. Cumberly,” replied Dunbar, “is entitled to his opinion, that the injection in the woman's shoulder was at least eight hours old; whilst Mr. Hilton is equally entitled to maintain that it was less than ONE hour old. Neither of them can hope to prove his case.”  “If either of them could?”...  “It might make a difference to the evidence--but I'm not sure.”  “What time is your appointment?”  “Ten o'clock,” replied Dunbar. “I am meeting Mr. Debnam--the late Mr. Vernon's solicitor. There is something in it. Damme! I am sure of it!”  “Something in what?”  “The fact that Mr. Vernon died yesterday evening, and that his wife was murdered at midnight.”  “What have you told the press?”  “As little as possible, but you will see that the early editions will all be screaming for the arrest of Soames.”  “I shouldn't wonder. He would be a useful man to have; but he's probably out of London now.”  “I think not. He's more likely to wait for instructions from his principal.”  “His principal?”  “Certainly. You don't think Soames did the murder, do you?”  “No; but he's obviously an accessory.”  “I'm not so sure even of that.”  “Then why did he bolt?”  “Because he had a guilty conscience.”  “Yes,” agreed Sowerby; “it does turn out that way sometimes. At any rate, Stringer is after him, but he's got next to nothing to go upon. Has any reply been received from Mrs. Leroux in Paris?”  “No,” answered Dunbar, frowning thoughtfully. “Her husband's wire would reach her first thing this morning; I am expecting to hear of a reply at any moment.”  “They're a funny couple, altogether,” said Sowerby. “I can't imagine myself standing for Mrs. Sowerby spending her week-ends in Paris. Asking for trouble, I call it!”  “It does seem a daft arrangement,” agreed Dunbar; “but then, as you say, they're a funny couple.”  “I never saw such a bundle of nerves in all my life!”...  “Leroux?”  Sowerby nodded.  “I suppose,” he said, “it's the artistic temperament! If Mrs. Leroux has got it, too, I don't wonder that they get fed up with one another's company.”  “That's about the secret of it. And now, I shall be glad, Sowerby, if you will be after that taxi-man again. Report at one o'clock. I shall be here.”  With his hand on the door-knob: “By the way,” said Sowerby, “who the blazes is Mr. King?”  Inspector Dunbar looked up.  “Mr. King,” he replied slowly, “is the solution of the mystery.”     VII  THE MAN IN THE LIMOUSINE   The house of the late Horace Vernon was a modern villa of prosperous appearance; but, on this sunny September morning, a palpable atmosphere of gloom seemed to overlie it. This made itself perceptible even to the toughened and unimpressionable nerves of Inspector Dunbar. As he mounted the five steps leading up to the door, glancing meanwhile at the lowered blinds at the windows, he wondered if, failing these evidences and his own private knowledge of the facts, he should have recognized that the hand of tragedy had placed its mark upon this house. But when the door was opened by a white-faced servant, he told himself that he should, for a veritable miasma of death seemed to come out to meet him, to envelop him.  Within, proceeded a subdued activity: somber figures moved upon the staircase; and Inspector Dunbar, having presented his card, presently found himself in a well-appointed library.  At the table, whereon were spread a number of documents, sat a lean, clean-shaven, sallow-faced man, wearing gold-rimmed pince-nez; a man whose demeanor of business-like gloom was most admirably adapted to that place and occasion. This was Mr. Debnam, the solicitor. He gravely waved the detective to an armchair, adjusted his pince-nez, and coughed, introductorily.  “Your communication, Inspector,” he began (he had the kind of voice which seems to be buried in sawdust packing), “was brought to me this morning, and has disturbed me immeasurably, unspeakably.”  “You have been to view the body, sir?”  “One of my clerks, who knew Mrs. Vernon, has just returned to this house to report that he has identified her.”  “I should have preferred you to have gone yourself, sir,” began Dunbar, taking out his notebook.  “My state of health, Inspector,” said the solicitor, “renders it undesirable that I should submit myself to an ordeal so unnecessary--so wholly unnecessary.”  “Very good!” muttered Dunbar, making an entry in his book; “your clerk, then, whom I can see in a moment, identifies the murdered woman as Mrs. Vernon. What was her Christian name?”  “Iris--Iris Mary Vernon.”  Inspector Dunbar made a note of the fact.  “And now,” he said, “you will have read the copy of that portion of my report which I submitted to you this morning--acting upon information supplied by Miss Helen Cumberly?”  “Yes, yes, Inspector, I have read it--but, by the way, I do not know Miss Cumberly.”  “Miss Cumberly,” explained the detective, “is the daughter of Dr. Cumberly, the Harley Street physician. She lives with her father in the flat above that of Mr. Leroux. She saw the body by accident--and recognized it as that of a lady who had been named to her at the last Arts Ball.”  “Ah!” said Debnam, “yes--I see--at the Arts Ball, Inspector. This is a mysterious and a very ghastly case.”  “It is indeed, sir,” agreed Dunbar. “Can you throw any light upon the presence of Mrs. Vernon at Mr. Leroux's flat on the very night of her husband's death?”  “I can--and I cannot,” answered the solicitor, leaning back in the chair and again adjusting his pince-nez, in the manner of a man having important matters--and gloomy, very gloomy, matters--to communicate.  “Good!” said the inspector, and prepared to listen.  “You see,” continued Debnam, “the late Mrs. Vernon was not actually residing with her husband at the date of his death.”  “Indeed!”  “Ostensibly”--the solicitor shook a lean forefinger at his vis-a-vis--“ostensibly, Inspector, she was visiting her sister in Scotland.”  Inspector Dunbar sat up very straight, his brows drawn down over the tawny eyes.  “These visits were of frequent occurrence, and usually of about a week's duration. Mr. Vernon, my late client, a man--I'll not deny it--of inconstant affections (you understand me, Inspector?), did not greatly concern himself with his wife's movements. She belonged to a smart Bohemian set, and--to use a popular figure of speech--burnt the candle at both ends; late dances, night clubs, bridge parties, and other feverish pursuits, possibly taken up as a result of the--shall I say cooling?--of her husband's affections”...  “There was another woman in the case?”  “I fear so, Inspector; in fact, I am sure of it: but to return to Mrs. Vernon. My client provided her with ample funds; and I, myself, have expressed to him astonishment respecting her expenditures in Scotland. I understand that her sister was in comparatively poor circumstances, and I went so far as to point out to Mr. Vernon that one hundred pounds was--shall I say an excessive?--outlay upon a week's sojourn in Auchterander, Perth.”  “A hundred pounds!”  “One hundred pounds!”  “Was it queried by Mr. Vernon?”  “Not at all.”  “Was Mr. Vernon personally acquainted with this sister in Perth?”  “He was not, Inspector. Mrs. Vernon, at the time of her marriage, did not enjoy that social status to which my late client elevated her. For many years she held no open communication with any member of her family, but latterly, as I have explained, she acquired the habit of recuperating--recuperating from the effects of her febrile pleasures--at this obscure place in Scotland. And Mr. Vernon, his interest in her movements having considerably--shall I say abated?--offered no objection: even suffered it gladly, counting the cost but little against”...  “Freedom?” suggested Dunbar, scribbling in his notebook.  “Rather crudely expressed, perhaps,” said the solicitor, peering over the top of his glasses, “but you have the idea. I come now to my client's awakening. Four days ago, he learned the truth; he learned that he was being deceived!”  “Deceived!”  “Mrs. Vernon, thoroughly exhausted with irregular living, announced that she was about to resort once more to the healing breezes of the heather-land”--Mr. Debnam was thoroughly warming to his discourse and thoroughly enjoying his own dusty phrases.  “Interrupting you for a moment,” said the inspector, “at what intervals did these visits take place?”  “At remarkably regular intervals, Inspector: something like six times a year.”  “For how long had Mrs. Vernon made a custom of these visits?”  “Roughly, for two years.”  “Thank you. Will you go on, sir?”  “She requested Mr. Vernon, then, on the last occasion to give her a check for eighty pounds; and this he did, unquestioningly. On Thursday, the second of September, she left for Scotland”...  “Did she take her maid?”  “Her maid always received a holiday on these occasions; Mrs. Vernon wired her respecting the date of her return.”  “Did any one actually see her off?”  “No, not that I am aware of, Inspector.”  “To put the whole thing quite bluntly, Mr. Debnam,” said Dunbar, fixing his tawny eyes upon the solicitor, “Mr. Vernon was thoroughly glad to get rid of her for a week?”  Mr. Debnam shifted uneasily in his chair; the truculent directness of the detective was unpleasing to his tortuous mind. However:--  “I fear you have hit upon the truth,” he confessed, “and I must admit that we have no legal evidence of her leaving for Scotland on this, or on any other occasion. Letters were received from Perth, and letters sent to Auchterander from London were answered. But the truth, the painful truth came to light, unexpectedly, dramatically, on Monday last”...  “Four days ago?”  “Exactly; three days before the death of my client.” Mr. Debnam wagged his finger at the inspector again. “I maintain,” he said, “that this painful discovery, which I am about to mention, precipitated my client's end; although it is a fact that there was--hereditary heart trouble. But I admit that his neglect of his wife (to give it no harsher name) contributed to the catastrophe.”  He paused to give dramatic point to the revelation.  “Walking homeward at a late hour on Monday evening from a flat in Victoria Street--the flat of--shall I employ the term a particular friend?--Mr. Vernon was horrified--horrified beyond measure, to perceive, in a large and well-appointed car--a limousine--his wife!”...  “The inside lights of the car were on, then?”  “No; but the light from a street lamp shone directly into the car. A temporary block in the traffic compelled the driver of the car, whom my client described to me as an Asiatic--to pull up for a moment. There, within a few yards of her husband, Mrs. Vernon reclined in the car--or rather in the arms of a male companion!”  “What!”  “Positively!” Mr. Debnam was sedately enjoying himself. “Positively, my dear Inspector, in the arms of a man of extremely dark complexion. Mr. Vernon was unable to perceive more than this, for the man had his back toward him. But the light shone fully upon the face of Mrs. Vernon, who appeared pale and exhausted. She wore a conspicuous motor-coat of civet fur, and it was this which first attracted Mr. Vernon's attention. The blow was a very severe one to a man in my client's state of health; and although I cannot claim that his own conscience was clear, this open violation of the marriage vows outraged the husband--outraged him. In fact he was so perturbed, that he stood there shaking, quivering, unable to speak or act, and the car drove away before he had recovered sufficient presence of mind to note the number.”  “In which direction did the car proceed?”  “Toward Victoria Station.”  “Any other particulars?”  “Not regarding the car, its driver, or its occupants; but early on the following morning, Mr. Vernon, very much shaken, called upon me and instructed me to despatch an agent to Perth immediately. My agent's report reached me at practically the same time as the news of my client's death”...  “And his report was?”...  “His report, Inspector, telegraphic, of course, was this: that no sister of Mrs. Vernon resided at the address; that the place was a cottage occupied by a certain Mrs. Fry and her husband; that the husband was of no occupation, and had no visible means of support”--he ticked off the points on the long forefinger--“that the Frys lived better than any of their neighbors; and--most important of all--that Mrs. Fry's maiden name, which my agent discovered by recourse to the parish register of marriages--was Ann Fairchild.”  “What of that?”  “Ann Fairchild was a former maid of Mrs. Vernon!”  “In short, it amounts to this, then: Mrs. Vernon, during these various absences, never went to Scotland at all? It was a conspiracy?”  “Exactly--exactly, Inspector! I wired instructing my agent to extort from the woman, Fry, the address to which she forwarded letters received by her for Mrs. Vernon. The lady's death, news of which will now have reached him, will no doubt be a lever, enabling my representative to obtain the desired information.”  “When do you expect to hear from him?”  “At any moment. Failing a full confession by the Frys, you will of course know how to act, Inspector?”  “Damme!” cried Dunbar, “can your man be relied upon to watch them? They mustn't slip away! Shall I instruct Perth to arrest the couple?”  “I wired my agent this morning, Inspector, to communicate with the local police respecting the Frys.”  Inspector Dunbar tapped his small, widely-separated teeth with the end of his fountain-pen.  “I have had one priceless witness slip through my fingers,” he muttered. “I'll hand in my resignation if the Frys go!”  “To whom do you refer?”  Inspector Dunbar rose.  “It is a point with which I need not trouble you, sir,” he said. “It was not included in the extract of report sent to you. This is going to be the biggest case of my professional career, or my name is not Robert Dunbar!”  Closing his notebook, he thrust it into his pocket, and replaced his fountain-pen in the little leather wallet.  “Of course,” said the solicitor, rising in turn, and adjusting the troublesome pince-nez, “there was some intrigue with Leroux? So much is evident.”  “You will be thinking that, eh?”  “My dear Inspector”--Mr. Debnam, the wily, was seeking information--“my dear Inspector, Leroux's own wife was absent in Paris--quite a safe distance; and Mrs. Vernon (now proven to be a woman conducting a love intrigue) is found dead under most compromising circumstances--MOST compromising circumstances--in his flat! His servants, even, are got safely out of the way for the evening”...  “Quite so,” said Dunbar, shortly, “quite so, Mr. Debnam.” He opened the door. “Might I see the late Mrs. Vernon's maid?”  “She is at her home. As I told you, Mrs. Vernon habitually released her for the period of these absences.”  The notebook reappeared.  “The young woman's address?”  “You can get it from the housekeeper. Is there anything else you wish to know?”  “Nothing beyond that, thank you.”  Three minutes later, Inspector Dunbar had written in his book:--Clarice Goodstone, c/o Mrs. Herne, 134a Robert Street, Hampstead Road, N. W.  He departed from the house whereat Death the Gleaner had twice knocked with his Scythe.     VIII  CABMAN TWO   Returning to Scotland Yard, Inspector Dunbar walked straight up to his own room. There he found Sowerby, very red faced and humid, and a taximan who sat stolidly surveying the Embankment from the window.  “Hullo!” cried Dunbar; “he's turned up, then?”  “No, he hasn't,” replied Sowerby with a mild irritation. “But we know where to find him, and he ought to lose his license.”  The taximan turned hurriedly. He wore a muffler so tightly packed between his neck and the collar of his uniform jacket, that it appeared materially to impair his respiration. His face possessed a bluish tinge, suggestive of asphyxia, and his watery eyes protruded remarkably; his breathing was noisily audible.  “No, chuck it, mister!” he exclaimed. “I'm only tellin' you 'cause it ain't my line to play tricks on the police. You'll find my name in the books downstairs more'n any other driver in London! I reckon I've brought enough umbrellas, cameras, walkin' sticks, hopera cloaks, watches and sicklike in 'ere, to set up a blarsted pawnbroker's!”  “That's all right, my lad!” said Dunbar, holding up his hand to silence the voluble speaker. “There's going to be no license-losing. You did not hear that you were wanted before?”  The watery eyes of the cabman protruded painfully; he respired like a horse.  “ME, guv'nor!” he exclaimed. “Gor'blime! I ain't the bloke! I was drivin' back from takin' the Honorable 'Erbert 'Arding 'ome--same as I does almost every night, when the 'ouse is a-sittin'--when I see old Tom Brian drawin' away from the door o' Palace Man--”  Again Dunbar held up his hand.  “No doubt you mean well,” he said; “but damme! begin at the beginning! Who are you, and what have you come to tell us?”  “'Oo are I?--'Ere's 'oo I ham!” wheezed the cabman, proffering a greasy license. “Richard 'Amper, number 3 Breams Mews, Dulwich Village”...  “That's all right,” said Dunbar, thrusting back the proffered document; “and last night you had taken Mr. Harding the member of Parliament, to his residence in?”--  “In Peers' Chambers, Westminister--that's it, guv'nor! Comin' back, I 'ave to pass along the north side o' the Square, an' just a'ead o' me, I see old Tom Brian a-pullin' round the Johnny 'Orner,--'im comin' from Palace Mansions.”  “Mr. Exel only mentioned seeing ONE cab,” muttered Dunbar, glancing keenly aside at Sowerby.  “Wotcher say, guv'nor?” asked the cabman.  “I say--did you see a gentleman approaching from the corner?” asked Dunbar.  “Yus,” declared the man; “I see 'im, but 'e 'adn't got as far as the Johnny 'Orner. As I passed outside old Tom Brian, wot's changin' 'is gear, I see a bloke blowin' along on the pavement--a bloke in a high 'at, an' wearin' a heye-glass.”  “At this time, then,” pursued Dunbar, “you had actually passed the other cab, and the gentleman on the pavement had not come up with it?”  “'E couldn't see it, guv'nor! I'm tellin' you 'e 'adn't got to the Johnny 'Orner!”  “I see,” muttered Sowerby. “It's possible that Mr. Exel took no notice of the first cab--especially as it did not come out of the Square.”  “Wotcher say, guv'nor?” queried the cabman again, turning his bleared eyes upon Sergeant Sowerby.  “He said,” interrupted Dunbar, “was Brian's cab empty?”  “'Course it was,” rapped Mr. Hamper, “'e 'd just dropped 'is fare at Palace Mansions.”...  “How do you know?” snapped Dunbar, suddenly, fixing his fierce eyes upon the face of the speaker.  The cabman glared in beery truculence.  “I got me blarsted senses, ain't I?” he inquired. “There's only two lots o' flats on that side o' the Square--Palace Mansions, an' St. Andrew's Mansions.”  “Well?”  “St. Andrew's Mansions,” continued Hamper, “is all away!”  “All away?”  “All away! I know, 'cause I used to have a reg'lar fare there. 'E's in Egyp'; flat shut up. Top floor's to let. Bottom floor's two old unmarried maiden ladies what always travels by 'bus. So does all their blarsted friends an' relations. Where can old Tom Brian 'ave been comin' from, if it wasn't Palace Mansions?”  “H'm!” said Dunbar, “you are a loss to the detective service, my lad! And how do you account for the fact that Brian has not got to hear of the inquiry?”  Hamper bent to Dunbar and whispered, beerily, in his ear: “P'r'aps 'e don't want to 'ear, guv'nor!”  “Oh! Why not?”  “Well, 'e knows there's something up there!”  “Therefore it's his plain duty to assist the police.”  “Same as what I does?” cried Hamper, raising his eyebrows. “Course it is! but 'ow d'you know 'e ain't been got at?”  “Our friend, here, evidently has one up against Mr. Tom Brian!” muttered Dunbar aside to Sowerby.  “Wotcher say, guv'nor?” inquired the cabman, looking from one to the other.  “I say, no doubt you can save us the trouble of looking out Brian's license, and give us his private address?” replied Dunbar.  “Course I can. 'E lives hat num'er 36 Forth Street, Brixton, and 'e's out o' the big Brixton depot.”  “Oh!” said Dunbar, dryly. “Does he owe you anything?”  “Wotcher say, guv'nor?”  “I say, it's very good of you to take all this trouble and whatever it has cost you in time, we shall be pleased to put right.”  Mr. Hamper spat in his right palm, and rubbed his hands together, appreciatively.  “Make it five bob!” he said.  “Wait downstairs,” directed Dunbar, pressing a bell-push beside the door. “I'll get it put through for you.”  “Right 'o!” rumbled the cabman, and went lurching from the room as a constable in uniform appeared at the door. “Good mornin', guv'nor. Good mornin'!”  The cabman having departed, leaving in his wake a fragrant odor of fourpenny ale:--  “Here you are, Sowerby!” cried Dunbar. “We are moving at last! This is the address of the late Mrs. Vernon's maid. See her; feel your ground, carefully, of course; get to know what clothes Mrs. Vernon took with her on her periodical visits to Scotland.”  “What clothes?”  “That's the idea; it is important. I don't think the girl was in her mistress's confidence, but I leave it to you to find out. If circumstances point to my surmise being inaccurate--you know how to act.”  “Just let me glance over your notes, bearing on the matter,” said Sowerby, “and I'll be off.”  Dunbar handed him the bulging notebook, and Sergeant Sowerby lowered his inadequate eyebrows, thoughtfully, whilst he scanned the evidence of Mr. Debnam. Then, returning the book to his superior, and adjusting the peculiar bowler firmly upon his head, he set out.  Dunbar glanced through some papers--apparently reports--which lay upon the table, penciled comments upon two of them, and then, consulting his notebook once more in order to refresh his memory, started off for Forth Street, Brixton.  Forth Street, Brixton, is a depressing thoroughfare. It contains small, cheap flats, and a number of frowsy looking houses which give one the impression of having run to seed. A hostelry of sad aspect occupies a commanding position midway along the street, but inspires the traveler not with cheer, but with lugubrious reflections upon the horrors of inebriety. The odors, unpleasantly mingled, of fried bacon and paraffin oil, are wafted to the wayfarer from the porches of these family residences.  Number 36 proved to be such a villa, and Inspector Dunbar contemplated it from a distance, thoughtfully. As he stood by the door of the public house, gazing across the street, a tired looking woman, lean and anxious-eyed, a poor, dried up bean-pod of a woman, appeared from the door of number 36, carrying a basket. She walked along in the direction of the neighboring highroad, and Dunbar casually followed her.  For some ten minutes he studied her activities, noting that she went from shop to shop until her basket was laden with provisions of all sorts. When she entered a wine-and-spirit merchant's, the detective entered close behind her, for the place was also a post-office. Whilst he purchased a penny stamp and fumbled in his pocket for an imaginary letter, he observed, with interest, that the woman had purchased, and was loading into the hospitable basket, a bottle of whisky, a bottle of rum, and a bottle of gin.  He left the shop ahead of her, sure, now, of his ground, always provided that the woman proved to be Mrs. Brian. Dunbar walked along Forth Street slowly enough to enable the woman to overtake him. At the door of number 36, he glanced up at the number, questioningly, and turned in the gate as she was about to enter.  He raised his hat.  “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mrs. Brian?”  Momentarily, a hard look came into the tired eyes, but Dunbar's gentleness of manner and voice, together with the kindly expression upon his face, turned the scales favorably.  “I am Mrs. Brian,” she said; “yes. Did you want to see me?”  “On a matter of some importance. May I come in?”  She nodded and led the way into the house; the door was not closed.  In a living-room whereon was written a pathetic history--a history of decline from easy circumstance and respectability to poverty and utter disregard of appearances--she confronted him, setting down her basket on a table from which the remains of a fish breakfast were not yet removed.  “Is your husband in?” inquired Dunbar with a subtle change of manner.  “He's lying down.”  The hard look was creeping again into the woman's eyes.  “Will you please awake him, and tell him that I have called in regard to his license?”  He thrust a card into her hand:--   DETECTIVE-INSPECTOR DUNBAR,  C. I. D.  NEW SCOTLAND YARD. S. W.     IX  THE MAN IN BLACK   Mrs. Brian started back, with a wild look, a trapped look, in her eyes.  “What's he done?” she inquired. “What's he done? Tom's not done anything!”  “Be good enough to waken him,” persisted the inspector. “I wish to speak to him.”  Mrs. Brian walked slowly from the room and could be heard entering one further along the passage. An angry snarling, suggesting that of a wild animal disturbed in its lair, proclaimed the arousing of Taximan Thomas Brian. A thick voice inquired, brutally, why the sanguinary hell he (Mr. Brian) had had his bloodstained slumbers disturbed in this gory manner and who was the vermilion blighter responsible.  Then Mrs. Brian's voice mingled with that of her husband, and both became subdued. Finally, a slim man, who wore a short beard, or had omitted to shave for some days, appeared at the door of the living-room. His face was another history upon the same subject as that which might be studied from the walls, the floor, and the appointments of the room. Inspector Dunbar perceived that the shadow of the neighboring hostelry overlay this home.  “What's up?” inquired the new arrival.  The tone of his voice, thickened by excess, was yet eloquent of the gentleman. The barriers passed, your pariah gentleman can be the completest blackguard of them all. He spoke coarsely, and the infectious Cockney accent showed itself in his vowels; but Dunbar, a trained observer, summed up his man in a moment and acted accordingly.  “Come in and shut the door!” he directed. “No”--as Mrs. Brian sought to enter behind her husband--“I wish to speak with you, privately.”  “Hop it!” instructed Brian, jerking his thumb over his shoulder--and Mrs. Brian obediently disappeared, closing the door.  “Now,” said Dunbar, looking the man up and down, “have you been into the depot, to-day?”  “No.”  “But you have heard that there's an inquiry?”  “I've heard nothing. I've been in bed.”  “We won't argue about that. I'll simply put a question to you: Where did you pick up the fare that you dropped at Palace Mansions at twelve o'clock last night?”  “Palace Mansions!” muttered Brian, shifting uneasily beneath the unflinching stare of the tawny eyes. “What d'you mean? What Palace Mansions?”  “Don't quibble!” warned Dunbar, thrusting out a finger at him. “This is not a matter of a loss of license; it's a life job!”  “Life job!” whispered the man, and his weak face suddenly relaxed, so that, oddly, the old refinement shone out through the new, vulgar veneer.  “Answer my questions straight and square and I'll take your word that you have not seen the inquiry!” said Dunbar.  “Dick Hamper's done this for me!” muttered Brian. “He's a dirty, low swine! Somebody'll do for him one night!”  “Leave Hamper out of the question,” snapped Dunbar. “You put down a fare at Palace Mansions at twelve o'clock last night?”  For one tremendous moment, Brian hesitated, but the good that was in him, or the evil--a consciousness of wrongdoing, or of retribution pending--respect for the law, or fear of its might--decided his course.  “I did.”  “It was a man?”  Again Brian, with furtive glance, sought to test his opponent; but his opponent was too strong for him. With Dunbar's eyes upon his face, he chose not to lie.  “It was a woman.”  “How was she dressed?”  “In a fur motor-coat--civet fur.”  The man of culture spoke in those two words, “civet fur”; and Dunbar nodded quickly, his eyes ablaze at the importance of the evidence.  “Was she alone?”  “She was.”  “What fare did she pay you?”  “The meter only registered eightpence, but she gave me half-a-crown.”  “Did she appear to be ill?”  “Very ill. She wore no hat, and I supposed her to be in evening dress. She almost fell as she got out of the cab, but managed to get into the hall of Palace Mansions quickly enough, looking behind her all the time.”  Inspector Dunbar shot out the hypnotic finger again.  “She told you to wait!” he asserted, positively. Brian looked to right and left, up and down, thrusting his hands into his coat pockets, and taking them out again to stroke his collarless neck. Then:--  “She did--yes,” he admitted.  “But you were bribed to drive away? Don't deny it! Don't dare to trifle with me, or by God! you'll spend the night in Brixton Jail!”  “It was made worth my while,” muttered Brian, his voice beginning to break, “to hop it.”  “Who paid you to do it?”  “A man who had followed all the way in a big car.”  “That's it! Describe him!”  “I can't! No, no! you can threaten as much as you like, but I can't describe him. I never saw his face. He stood behind me on the near side of the cab, and just reached forward and pushed a flyer under my nose.”  Inspector Dunbar searched the speaker's face closely--and concluded that he was respecting the verity.  “How was he dressed?”  “In black, and that's all I can tell you about him.”  “You took the money?”  “I took the money, yes”...  “What did he say to you?”  “Simply: 'Drive off.'”  “Did you take him to be an Englishman from his speech?”  “No; he was not an Englishman. He had a foreign accent.”  “French? German?”  “No,” said Brian, looking up and meeting the glance of the fierce eyes. “Asiatic!”  Inspector Dunbar, closely as he held himself in hand, started slightly.  “Are you sure?”  “Certainly. Before I--when I was younger--I traveled in the East, and I know the voice and intonation of the cultured Oriental.”  “Can you place him any closer than that?”  “No, I can't venture to do so.” Brian's manner was becoming, momentarily, more nearly that of a gentleman. “I might be leading you astray if I ventured a guess, but if you asked me to do so, I should say he was a Chinaman.”  “A CHINAMAN?” Dunbar's voice rose excitedly.  “I think so.”  “What occurred next?”  “I turned my cab and drove off out of the Square.”  “Did you see where the man went?”  “I didn't. I saw nothing of him beyond his hand.”  “And his hand?”  “He wore a glove.”  “And now,” said Dunbar, speaking very slowly, “where did you pick up your fare?”  “In Gillingham Street, near Victoria Station.”  “From a house?”  “Yes, from Nurse Proctor's.”  “Nurse Proctor's! Who is Nurse Proctor?”  Brian shrugged his shoulders in a nonchalant manner, which obviously belonged to an earlier phase of existence.  “She keeps a nursing home,” he said--“for ladies.”  “Do you mean a maternity home?”  “Not exactly; at least I don't think so. Most of her clients are society ladies, who stay there periodically.”  “What are you driving at?” demanded Dunbar. “I have asked you if it is a maternity home.”  “And I have replied that it isn't. I am only giving you facts; you don't want my surmises.”  “Who hailed you?”  “The woman did--the woman in the fur coat. I was just passing the door very slowly when it was flung open with a bang, and she rushed out as though hell were after her. Before I had time to pull up, she threw herself into my cab and screamed: 'Palace Mansions! Westminster!' I reached back and shut the door, and drove right away.”  “When did you see that you were followed?”  “We were held up just outside the music hall, and looking back, I saw that my fare was dreadfully excited. It didn't take me long to find out that the cause of her excitement was a big limousine, three or four back in the block of traffic. The driver was some kind of an Oriental, too, although I couldn't make him out very clearly.”  “Good!” snapped Dunbar; “that's important! But you saw nothing more of this car?”...  “I saw it follow me into the Square.”  “Then where did it wait?”  “I don't know; I didn't see it again.”  Inspector Dunbar nodded rapidly.  “Have you ever driven women to or from this Nurse Proctor's before?”  “On two other occasions, I have driven ladies who came from there. I knew they came from there, because it got about amongst us that the tall woman in nurse's uniform who accompanied them was Nurse Proctor.”  “You mean that you didn't take these women actually from the door of the house in Gillingham Street, but from somewhere adjacent?”  “Yes; they never take a cab from the door. They always walk to the corner of the street with a nurse, and a porter belonging to the house brings their luggage along.”  “The idea is secrecy?”  “No doubt. But as I have said, the word was passed round.”  “Did you know either of these other women?”  “No; but they were obviously members of good society.”  “And you drove them?”  “One to St. Pancras, and one to Waterloo,” said Brian, dropping back somewhat into his coarser style, and permitting a slow grin to overspread his countenance.  “To catch trains, no doubt?”  “Not a bit of it! To MEET trains!”  “You mean?”  “I mean that their own private cars were waiting for them at the ARRIVAL platform as I drove 'em up to the DEPARTURE platform, and that they simply marched through the station and pretended to have arrived by train!”  Inspector Dunbar took out his notebook and fountain-pen, and began to tap his teeth with the latter, nodding his head at the same time.  “You are sure of the accuracy of your last statement?” he said, raising his eyes to the other.  “I followed one of them,” was the reply, “and saw her footman gravely take charge of the luggage which I had just brought from Victoria; and a pal of mine followed the other--the Waterloo one, that was.”  Inspector Dunbar scribbled busily. Then:--  “You have done well to make a clean breast of it,” he said. “Take a straight tip from me. Keep off the drink!”     X  THE GREAT UNDERSTANDING   It was in the afternoon of this same day--a day so momentous in the lives of more than one of London's millions--that two travelers might have been seen to descend from a first-class compartment of the Dover boat-train at Charing Cross.  They had been the sole occupants of the compartment, and, despite the wide dissimilarity of character to be read upon their countenances, seemed to have struck up an acquaintance based upon mutual amiability and worldly common sense. The traveler first to descend and gallantly to offer his hand to his companion in order to assist her to the platform, was the one whom a casual observer would first have noted.  He was a man built largely, but on good lines; a man past his youth, and somewhat too fleshy; but for all his bulk, there was nothing unwieldy, and nothing ungraceful in his bearing or carriage. He wore a French traveling-coat, conceived in a style violently Parisian, and composed of a wonderful check calculated to have blinded any cutter in Savile Row. From beneath its gorgeous folds protruded the extremities of severely creased cashmere trousers, turned up over white spats which nestled coyly about a pair of glossy black boots. The traveler's hat was of velour, silver gray and boasting a partridge feather thrust in its silken band. One glimpse of the outfit must have brought the entire staff of the Tailor and Cutter to an untimely grave.  But if ever man was born who could carry such a make-up, this traveler was he. The face was cut on massive lines, on fleshy lines, clean-shaven, and inclined to pallor. The hirsute blue tinge about the jaw and lips helped to accentuate the virile strength of the long, flexible mouth, which could be humorous, which could be sorrowful, which could be grim. In the dark eyes of the man lay a wealth of experience, acquired in a lifelong pilgrimage among many peoples, and to many lands. His dark brows were heavily marked, and his close-cut hair was splashed with gray.  Let us glance at the lady who accepted his white-gloved hand, and who sprang alertly onto the platform beside him.  She was a woman bordering on the forties, with a face of masculine vigor, redeemed and effeminized, by splendid hazel eyes, the kindliest imaginable. Obviously, the lady was one who had never married, who de
