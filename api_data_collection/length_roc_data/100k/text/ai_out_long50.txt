Title: The Thief of Ember Hollow

Chapter One: Whispers in the Moss

Rain slipped down the gray stones of Ember Hollow like tears off a dying man's cheek. The Hollow stank of old roots and forgotten promises. Beneath a twisted canopy of black alder trees, where the sun dared not gaze, a goblin crouched near a hollow log, chewing on a raw slug. His name was Snaggrel, and he was destined—though he’d cuss you out for saying it—to steal the Crystal of Virid.

Snaggrel was runt-sized, even for a goblin, with ears that curled like boiled cabbage and a nose that twitched at lies. His skin was the shade of wet kelp and slicked with grime. But his eyes—black marbles glinting with cunning—missed little. He wore a patchwork vest made from the skins of rats and owlets, stitched with spider silk and bound with the rib of a vole. The vest stank worse than him, which was saying something.

"Ye ever hear o’ the Crystal o’ Virid?" he asked the slug before swallowing it whole. "Course ye haven’t. Not many has. That’s the point."

He sat back on his haunches, licking his claws clean. In the distance, a bell tolled from atop Cradlespire Keep—a sound no goblin should ever hear unless they were being cooked for a lord’s supper.

He knew what the bell meant. It meant the Seers were stirring. It meant the Crystal was vulnerable. And he—Snaggrel, bane of chicken coops and picker of noble pockets—was going to take it.

But he wasn't alone.

—

Far to the east, past the Grayfen Marsh and the shattered towers of Osgult, a woman in a feathered cloak spoke to an iron mirror. Her name was Vaeleen, a mage of the Unnamed Order, though few used the word "mage" near her without spitting afterward. Her voice echoed coldly through her empty chamber.

"The goblin has awakened," she said. "Just as the moss-blooded prophecy croaked."

The mirror fogged, shimmered, and showed a flicker of Snaggrel rooting through the bones of a drowned badger.

Vaeleen sneered. “This is the creature who’ll steal my inheritance?”

She waved her hand, and the mirror shattered into spiders.

—

Snaggrel padded through the moss, careful of the bloodsnare ferns and the eye-lichens that blinked at him from tree trunks. He carried nothing but a sling and a bone dagger chipped from a wyrmling’s rib. His goal lay many leagues away, under stone and spell, but his first stop was an old ruin buried in a swamp.

There lived Greel the Mad, a former hedge-witch turned tree. She'd once cursed a knight into a beetle for calling her “hag,” and she knew things best left unwhispered. She also owed Snaggrel a favor. Something about a stolen ring and a bad batch of toadwine.

Snaggrel found her just before dusk, her bark-skin cracked and oozing sap. A single yellow eye rolled open in the knot of her trunk.

“You again,” she groaned.

“Need a whisper, Greel,” he said, bowing low. “One about a shiny rock.”

“The Crystal?” she hissed, bark creaking. “You’re dumber than a blind troll with a compass.”

“Yeah, maybe. But I’m me, and I’m the only one daft enough to try.”

She gave a wheeze that might have been laughter or indigestion. “You’ll need more than teeth and bad breath to get past the Wyrd Wardens.”

“You’ll help?”

“No,” she said. “But I’ll give you a name. Find the half-elf thief in Clattershade. She once stole a dragon’s hoard in her sleep. She’ll get you inside the outer ring.”

Snaggrel scratched under his chin. “A name?”

“Riss. She’s trouble.”

“All right,” he said. “But so am I.”

—

Clattershade stank of eel oil and broken dreams. A hundred market stalls haggled over rusted daggers, lizard meat, and memory dust. Snaggrel moved like a flea among dogs—quick, hungry, unseen. He found Riss in a crumbling alehouse, drinking fire syrup and arm-wrestling a tattooed ogre.

She had one ear pierced with a fishhook and silver scars like spiderwebs along her neck.

“You’re a goblin,” she said, watching him over her mug.

“You’re half-elf,” he said. “Neither of us asked for it.”

She grinned. “Fair. What do you want?”

“To steal something stupid and die trying.”

“Even fairer. I’m in.”

They left that night with a trail of angry gamblers behind them. As they traveled, Riss told stories of vaults in the clouds and beastmen that guarded the halls of Cradlespire.

“The Crystal’s not just guarded by flesh,” she said. “It’s guarded by memory. You walk too close, and it’ll whisper lies from your past. Make you forget why you came.”

Snaggrel spat. “I never forget a job. Not one.”

“Good,” she said. “Because this one’s likely to be our last.”

—

They crossed into the haunted thickets of Wyrmroot, where time lagged and fog turned to teeth. A ghost-hound chased them for two days, until Snaggrel fed it a handful of bone coins he'd dug up in the Barrow Mound. The hound bowed and vanished with a yelp of relief.

Near the edge of the thicket, they met the third of their cursed trio—a bard named Hallowin, who’d been hexed to only speak in questions.

“Are you thieves? Are you fools? Are you... the end?”

“Yes,” Snaggrel said. “No. And maybe.”

Hallowin laughed like a broken harp. “May I come with you?”

Riss shrugged. “We’ll need bait.”

—

They reached Cradlespire in the dark of the no-moon, hidden by spells and stink. The spire rose like a fang from the earth, wreathed in lightning and guarded by statues that breathed.

They snuck through the catacombs, dodging sleeptraps and blood runes, until they came upon the Crystal of Virid.

It floated above a bed of obsidian, humming like a dying star. Green light twisted in its heart, pulsing with hunger.

“It’s not just a gem,” Riss whispered. “It’s alive.”

“I know,” Snaggrel said. “And it wants to leave.”

He stepped forward. His hand, dirty and small, reached for destiny.

And the Crystal spoke.

—

The voice was not a sound but a vibration behind Snaggrel’s eyes, as if his skull were a bell and something ancient had struck it. The Crystal of Virid pulsed again, dimming the torches with its lightless glow. He froze. Even Riss held her breath, one hand on the hilt of her curved dagger, the other hovering uncertainly over her mouth as though to shield her soul.

"You are not worthy," the voice echoed in a language that had no words but carried meaning like heat from a fire. It wasn’t accusation. It was fact. The kind that grinds down entire empires.

Snaggrel grinned, his teeth crooked like graveyard posts. “You don’t know what I’m worth.”

The air rippled around the Crystal. Riss stepped back. Hallowin, who had taken to humming nervously through his nose, looked to the ceiling where ethereal script now drifted, writhing like worms in oil.

Snaggrel kept walking, slow and steady, each step pulling the silence tighter. As he crossed the threshold of the obsidian dais, the floor beneath him groaned—not with weight, but memory. Images darted through his head. Not his own. Princes weeping, cities burning, blood-stained children laughing in dungeons of gold. The Crystal showed him things meant to break the will. It was old magic, raw and ugly, forged before kindness was invented.

Snaggrel closed his eyes.

He thought of the smell of damp moss under his hovel back in the Hollow. He remembered the first coin he stole—a copper trinket from a dying merchant whose pouch had no more blood in it than gold. He thought of the time he fed a starving whelp instead of eating it. Small things. True things.

“Do yer worst,” he whispered to the Crystal.

And that, somehow, was enough.

The glow shifted. The voices stilled. The air thinned as though holding its breath. Then the Crystal fell—no grand blast, no shattering light—just a simple drop, like a dying apple from a cursed tree. Snaggrel caught it in both hands. It was warm. Slick with power.

Riss exhaled. “That’s it?”

“No traps? No soul-sucking?” Hallowin asked.

Snaggrel frowned. “Feels wrong, don’t it?”

That’s when the screaming began.

It came from below. Deep in the bones of the tower, a roar rose like a thunderstorm arguing with itself. The walls trembled. A stone face on the far column cracked open and shrieked with rusted breath.

“The Wyrd Wardens,” Riss said, already running.

Snaggrel tucked the Crystal under his vest. It didn’t burn him. It fit there, snug, almost eager. They bolted through the catacombs, pursued by grinding metal and the skitter of claws too many for any beast that walked the world.

Behind them, a chamber door exploded inward, and one of the Wardens emerged. It was neither machine nor flesh, but a riddle given shape—limbs jointed like spider legs, faces shifting every second between queen and soldier, child and corpse. One of its mouths opened wide enough to speak.

“RETURN THE STONE, LITTLE THIEF.”

Snaggrel didn't answer. He hurled a smoke pod behind him—stolen from a goblin alchemist who’d choked on his own brilliance—and kept moving. Riss slid beneath a collapsing archway, while Hallowin leapt awkwardly, losing a boot but gaining speed.

They burst out into the cold night, panting under the weight of stolen fate. The spire behind them groaned and began to collapse inward as if embarrassed to still stand. A thousand hidden guardians awoke too late.

For now, they were free.

But freedom is rarely without cost.

—

They camped by a burned oak two miles from the spire, too tired to speak, too alive to sleep. Snaggrel sat apart from the others, watching the Crystal. It no longer glowed, but he could feel it thinking. It was a presence now, like a shadow under his heart.

Riss finally spoke. “So what’s next?”

“Someone’s going to come for it,” Snaggrel muttered. “Probably a hundred someones. Maybe gods.”

“We could sell it.”

“Could.”

“We could destroy it.”

“Might be the same thing.”

Hallowin rubbed his bare foot, frowning. “Is this how the world ends? With a goblin and two idiots around a fire?”

“No,” Snaggrel said, standing. “This is how it starts.”

He tucked the Crystal deeper into his vest. Somewhere out there, the Seers would already be scrying. The great towers would whisper. Vaeleen, in her bitter tower of glass and bone, would scream until her breath curdled.

And Snaggrel, runt of the Hollow, thief of dreams, bearer of an ancient hunger—he would keep walking.

Because he had a plan.

—

Back in Clattershade, deep under the city, an agent of the Obsidian Vault sent a raven north. Its eyes were carved from starlight and its feathers carried secret ink. The message was simple.

“The Crystal has moved.”

In the Dark Academies of Yth, where shadows were educated and logic had teeth, a chorus of masks debated the implications.

At the edge of the world, in the tomb of a forgotten god, something stirred. A skeletal priest with no eyes whispered prayers it did not understand.

And above them all, in a place where light had never lived, the real owner of the Crystal began to wake.

—

Snaggrel had never believed in fate.

Fate was for kings and dead poets. Goblins didn’t get prophecies. They got stepped on.

But here he was. Holding the end of the world in his filthy hands.

And for the first time in his stunted, snarling, half-starved life—

He wondered what it meant to be chosen.

And whether that was just another kind of curse.

Snaggrel didn’t sleep. Not just because sleep meant dreams and dreams meant the Crystal might talk again, but because he couldn’t afford it. The fire burned low, casting greasy shadows across the gnarled roots behind him. Riss snored softly, her hand still on her weapon. Hallowin muttered something unintelligible in his slumber, likely arguing with a phantom. Snaggrel sat with his knees under his chin, clutching the Crystal like it might disappear into the moss.

He stared into the flames, not for warmth—goblins were too stringy to catch chill—but for focus. The fire danced, reminding him of another blaze long ago, when the Hollow had been raided by a company of mercenaries out of Grettel’s Reach. They’d come to "clear the filth." The memory of charred nests and butchered kin flashed in his mind, unbidden, raw. He'd escaped by hiding under the body of his cousin Grub, who’d taken an arrow through the eye. Snaggrel had lain there for hours, covered in blood that wasn’t his, smelling the cooked stink of goblin fat. He’d vowed then he’d never run again.

But now? With the Crystal pulsing faintly at his chest, whispering in a voice too old to hold malice or mercy, Snaggrel wasn’t sure whether he was running from something—or toward it.

As dawn bled over the horizon, pale and nervous, Riss stirred and sat up without a word. She rubbed sleep from her eyes, tied her hair back with a strip of leather, and looked at him.

“It talked to you, didn’t it?” she asked, her voice rasped and low.

Snaggrel gave her a long look. “You ever been mugged by a memory?”

“No.”

“Then I envy you.”

She leaned forward, poking the fire with a stick. “We need a plan. Now that we’ve got the thing, everyone who’s anyone is going to want a piece of us. No more creeping through swamps and stealing chickens. We’re on the map now.”

Snaggrel snorted. “Let’s hope it’s a small map.”

Riss looked up. “We need to sell it, hide it, or use it. No other options.”

Snaggrel turned the Crystal in his hands. It looked dull now, inert. Just a jagged green stone the size of a rat's heart. But even holding it made the air taste like lightning.

“You ever hear of the Lanternless?” he asked quietly.

Riss blinked. “You mean the monks who carved prayers into their bones and vanished into the Rift Hills?”

“They didn’t vanish,” Snaggrel said. “They’re waiting. They were the first to guard the Crystal. They believed it was a seed. A seed of something that should never grow.”

Riss rubbed her temples. “Snag, how do you know this?”

“I don’t. The stone does.”

“Great,” she said, standing. “Now it’s whispering secrets. We need to move.”

By midday, they’d left the burned oak and entered the Brambletongue—a labyrinth of overgrown hedges, forgotten ruins, and wolves that walked like men. Snaggrel led, more by instinct than knowledge. Paths opened to him, not with welcome, but resignation. The land knew the Crystal had returned to it, and it bent, reluctantly, to its presence.

Hallowin followed, reciting an endless rhyme under his breath about flowers that fed on memory and owls that asked questions you couldn’t afford to answer.

They camped that night near a fallen tower split down the middle, as though struck by a god’s axe. Carvings along the stone showed scenes of worship: cloaked figures kneeling before a burning tree, faces erased by time. Snaggrel touched the weathered runes.

“It was buried here once,” he said.

“The Crystal?”

“No. The thing it called.”

Riss paled. “We’re not keeping it.”

“We may not get a choice.”

That night, the dreams came again. But this time, they weren’t Snaggrel’s. He saw through someone else’s eyes—a young man in silver armor, kneeling before a pool of fire. The Crystal hovered above it, singing in a voice so beautiful it could split a soul.

Then came a scream.

The man fell backward as tendrils of shadow rose from the water, wrapping around him like a lover, dragging him down. The last thing Snaggrel saw was the man’s eyes turning green.

He awoke choking.

The Crystal was warm against his chest.

Riss sat nearby, watching him. “You saw it, didn’t you?”

He nodded. “It’s not just power. It’s a lure.”

“Like a baited hook.”

“Yeah. And we bit.”

—

By the fourth day, word had spread. They heard it in whispers from wandering traders, saw it in the too-long stares of travelers passing on the road. “The Goblin Thief,” they called him now, half in jest, half in warning. Some claimed he rode a shadow beast. Others said he could speak the names of stars backwards and turn men inside out.

Snaggrel found it hilarious.

“If I ever get turned into a legend, at least make me taller,” he muttered.

But the danger was real. Bounty posters began to appear—crudely drawn, but unmistakably his face. The reward grew daily. Not in gold, but in “favors,” which in the backalleys of the kingdoms meant worse than death.

They were being hunted.

In the town of Lorrim’s Bend, they stopped for supplies under false names. Riss went in first, posing as a merchant’s apprentice. Snaggrel stayed in the stable, cloaked in hay, while Hallowin distracted the locals with a song about a woman who fell in love with a ghost and birthed a baby made of fog.

But their luck had run thin.

Just as they were leaving, a cloaked figure stepped into the road. He wore the sigil of the Obsidian Vault, that strange circle within a square within a flame. His face was masked, his weapon sheathed.

Snaggrel stepped forward.

“You’re early,” he said. “I figured the Vault’d wait till we got nearer the mountains.”

“You were not meant to succeed,” the man said, his voice muffled but calm. “But you did. And that makes you... dangerous.”

“Is that supposed to scare me?”

“No. This is.”

The man drew his blade. It wasn’t metal, but glass—obsidian etched with runes that flickered red. One cut from it, and a soul could be undone.

Riss moved first. She flung a handful of cinders into the air—a trick taught to her by a fire dancer in the Eastern Isles—and lunged with her knife. The man blocked it easily, turning the blow aside with a lazy flick. Hallowin shouted something in ancient dialect and conjured a ringing hum that shook the ground. Snaggrel, heart pounding, did the only thing he could think of.

He threw the Crystal into the air.

Everyone, including the Vault agent, looked up.

In that breathless moment, Snaggrel leapt forward, kicked the man’s knee sideways, and grabbed the Crystal on the way down. Riss struck again, this time cutting the man’s arm. Smoke hissed from the wound. He staggered.

They ran.

Down alleys, across roofs, over carts and through sewer grates. The town fell behind them in chaos and shouting. By nightfall, they were deep in the hills again, bleeding, breathless, alive.

Snaggrel collapsed against a tree. “Right. New rule. No more towns.”

Riss laughed. It was short and bitter. “You think that was the worst of them?”

“No,” Snaggrel said. “But it means we’re close.”

“To what?”

He looked at the Crystal, then at the stars.

“To the place it’s leading us. To the thing that’s still dreaming.”

She frowned. “You still think this is a plan?”

He shook his head. “No. I think this is a reckoning.”

And the night, as if in agreement, went utterly still.

Chapter Two: The Path Beneath Teeth

The path into the Weeping Deeps began with a lie. Not the kind one tells to borrow coin or escape a tavern brawl, but an ancient falsehood carved into the very bones of the earth. No map marked it, no guide whispered of its course, and yet the land remembered. The trees leaned away from it. The soil grew sour. Birds fell silent at its edge, and moss refused to grow.

Snaggrel stood at the threshold, clutching the Crystal beneath his vest, feeling the throb of its will growing stronger by the hour. His boots squelched in the damp ground, the soles long since rotted into patchwork. Beside him, Riss stared ahead, arms folded tightly, her fingers twitching near the hilt of her dagger. Hallowin lagged behind, half-dragging his lute like a corpse, and mumbling a slow dirge that hadn’t existed yesterday.

“This place has no name,” Riss said finally, her voice oddly flat.

“It did once,” Snaggrel replied. “It just forgot it.”

They descended in silence.

The Weeping Deeps were not caves in the ordinary sense, but a slow collapse of the world’s trust. The air hung heavy, not just with moisture but memory. The stone walls pressed in, slick with weeping veins of black mineral that pulsed faintly if one stared too long. At first, it was simple darkness, like any tunnel. Then came the bones.

Long-forgotten remains jutted from the walls—elven femurs fused with the rock, goblin skulls worn smooth by centuries of damp, dwarf-hands frozen in mid-clutch over rusted axes. Some of the bones were still twitching, though no flesh clung to them.

“Place is cursed,” Hallowin whispered. “Even the dead ain’t left.”

“No, not cursed,” Snaggrel said. “It’s awake.”

And the Crystal was humming again. Softly. Almost kindly. Like a lullaby hummed through rotted teeth.

Deeper they went, each footstep echoed three times, once now, once in the past, and once in a future that might never happen. Riss began muttering to herself, short, sharp phrases that may have been prayers or names. Hallowin fell silent, a silence rare and unnatural for a bard.

At a narrow ledge where the path dropped sharply into a chasm lit only by glowing lichen, they met something worse than silence.

A shape crawled from the dark.

It was not large. Not armored. It wore no crown, bore no sword. It was small, almost child-sized, cloaked in a gray robe stitched from what looked like eyelids. Its face had no eyes, only smooth skin stretched tight over sockets that wept black tears. Its mouth was sewn shut.

It raised a hand.

All three of them froze, not by choice, but by command. The Crystal hissed in Snaggrel’s vest.

The thing turned slowly and began walking, not speaking, not looking back, just moving forward into a narrow corridor carved not by tools, but by hunger. Walls nibbled inward as though chewed by titanic rats. Footsteps echoed, not theirs, but hundreds—no, thousands—of ghost-feet, marching behind them though no one followed.

“We follow it?” Riss asked, the sweat on her face catching the dim lichen glow.

“Do we have a choice?” Snaggrel replied, not waiting for an answer.

The corridor narrowed further, stone pressing in until even Hallowin had to stoop. The Crystal thrummed harder now, like a heartbeat misaligned with the world. And then, without warning, the corridor ended.

They emerged into a chamber too wide to be believed, its ceiling lost in shadows, its walls a pulsing grid of teeth—hundreds, maybe thousands of fangs fused into the stone. Between the rows were faces. Real ones. Staring, blinking, mouthing things without sound. Trapped.

The gray-robed thing pointed toward the center of the chamber, then sank backward into the stone, as though swallowed by the air itself. Where it had indicated stood a plinth of obsidian, smooth and flawless. Hovering above it, not one, but two Crystals floated, each identical, each humming.

Snaggrel stepped forward, then stopped. His hand burned through the vest, the Crystal in his chest now warm as fire. He pulled it free.

The two floating stones pulsed in time with his own.

“Which one’s real?” Riss murmured.

“None of them,” Hallowin said with strange clarity. “Or all of them. This is the Mirror.”

Snaggrel didn’t ask how he knew. They all understood this was the first test—the first true moment the Crystal had brought them toward.

He approached the plinth.

Each floating Crystal looked identical: sharp-edged, brilliant green, swirling with impossible depths. But one of them, he noticed, hummed a hair off-beat. Just barely. Like a note struck in the wrong key.

Snaggrel took a breath, held his own Crystal in one hand, and reached for the false one with the other.

As soon as his fingers touched it, the ground split.

Not metaphorically—literally. The floor cracked with a scream, the teeth in the walls snapped shut, and the faces in the stone began to howl without sound. The false Crystal shattered in his hand, sending a burst of freezing air that tasted like regret. The real Crystal in his chest flared with green fire, and the entire cavern began to crumble.

“RUN!” Snaggrel bellowed, no time for cleverness.

They scrambled as the ceiling collapsed behind them, faces in the walls tearing free and chasing them in spirals of dust and teeth. Riss grabbed Hallowin, half-dragging the stunned bard as Snaggrel led the way through a path that hadn't been there seconds ago.

The Crystal was guiding him now—not with words or visions, but with certainty. A sense of this way, an ancient will, not gentle, not cruel, but intentional. He trusted it. Had to.

They burst through a final archway, collapsing onto soft moss lit by daylight. The cavern behind them sealed with a grinding sigh, the mouth of the earth closing like a secret.

They lay in silence, panting, coughing. The Crystal’s light had faded again.

“That was... a test?” Riss asked, staring up at the canopy of twisted silver-leaved trees overhead.

“No,” Snaggrel said. “That was a warning.”

Hallowin finally sat up. “I think I peed a little.”

No one laughed.

—

By the time night fell again, they’d made camp near a river whose waters ran uphill. Nothing about the forest around them followed rules. Trees grew in loops. Insects crawled backward. Shadows refused to match their casters. The Crystal was asleep now, or pretending to be. Snaggrel didn’t trust its silence.

“We need answers,” Riss said, her blade laid out in front of her like a relic.

“We’re following a path meant for someone else,” Snaggrel replied. “Maybe someone better. Maybe someone dumber.”

“So what do we do now?”

Snaggrel looked up at the stars. They blinked in unfamiliar constellations.

“We find the Lanternless. If they’re real, they’ll know what comes next.”

“And if they’re not?”

Snaggrel shrugged. “Then we keep moving until the ground opens up and eats us, same as always.”

Riss stared at him for a long time. “You ever get tired of pretending this isn’t killing you?”

Snaggrel didn’t answer. He just watched the Crystal, flickering faintly beneath his vest, and wondered if maybe—just maybe—it had already started to.

The river that ran uphill sang in the voice of drowned children. It wasn’t loud, but it was constant—like someone humming a lullaby through a cracked reed flute, the notes just off enough to make the hair rise at the nape of the neck. Snaggrel dipped a hand into the water despite Riss’s warning glare. It was cold, colder than any mountain spring should be, and when he drew it back, his fingertips were wrinkled like he’d been soaking for hours. He shook the water off and wiped his hand against the moss.

“We shouldn’t stay here long,” Riss said, standing just beyond the firelight, her eyes scanning the treeline. “This place feels... thin. Like a skin stretched too tight over bone.”

Snaggrel nodded. He’d felt it too. The Crystal hadn’t spoken since the Mirror Trial, but it pulsed every so often, as if checking his pulse in return. He didn’t know if that was comforting or terrifying. Probably both. Hallowin had retreated a short distance to sit on a fallen log and play quiet notes on his lute, notes that bent oddly in the air and never landed quite where they should.

“This forest,” Hallowin muttered between chords, “was once part of the Old Court’s hunting grounds. Before the Sundering. Back when gods still walked in fur and teeth.”

“I thought that was a bard’s tale,” Riss said without looking at him.

“So did I,” Hallowin replied. “Until the trees started whispering.”

Snaggrel stood up, brushing dirt from his knees. “Come morning, we head north. The Lanternless are supposed to live in the Shale Hollows, east of the Knife Ridge. That’s five days, maybe six. If they’re real.”

“They’re real,” Riss said. “Or someone’s going through a lot of trouble to make us think they are.”

“And if they’re just another cult with skull masks and fancy riddles?” Snaggrel asked.

“Then we kill ‘em,” she said without blinking.

Snaggrel gave a grunt of agreement. “Fair.”

They tried to sleep in shifts, though rest was shallow and brittle. The forest never fully quieted. Once, during Snaggrel’s watch, a figure passed by just beyond the firelight—tall, impossibly thin, its joints bending wrong. It didn’t stop, didn’t turn, just moved through the trees like smoke given shape. The Crystal grew ice cold in his vest during its passing, and for long minutes after, he could hear whispers under his breath that weren’t his own.

By dawn, the ground was dusted with ash. It hadn’t snowed. There’d been no fire. But a fine layer of gray powder coated everything, and no one said a word about it.

The terrain grew cruel as they ascended into the Knife Ridge. Stone broke through the soil like jagged teeth. Every path was a wound. Thorns as long as fingers lashed at them from gnarled bushes that bled amber when cut. The sun barely pierced the cloud cover, and the Crystal grew warmer with each step. Snaggrel began to dream while awake—brief flashes, like memories from someone else’s life: a child sobbing over a shattered statue, a gate made of hands, a scream caught inside a bell.

It was on the third day, while crossing a bridge of woven roots over a gorge that sang with the voices of the lost, that they met the Lanternless.

They didn’t appear with fanfare. No horns, no war cries. One moment the path was clear. The next, they stood on the other side of the bridge. Six of them, cloaked in soot-colored robes, faces hidden by wooden masks carved to resemble calm expressions: sleep, contemplation, sorrow, joy, anger, and the last—a blank one, smooth as polished bone.

Riss drew her blade without hesitation. “Move.”

The Lanternless did not.

Snaggrel stepped forward, arms spread. “We’re here for answers. Not blood.”

The masked one with the sorrowful face tilted its head. A voice emerged—not from behind the mask, but inside their skulls, slow and deep like roots growing through stone.

“The bearer has come. The cycle groans. The wound remembers.”

Hallowin stumbled slightly, eyes wide. “They’re in my mind,” he muttered, then added with less surprise, “and I think I’ve felt this before.”

Another stepped forward, the one with the blank mask.

“You carry the Seed of Undoing. Why?”

Snaggrel hesitated, then pulled the Crystal from his vest and held it up. It pulsed, and the air warped slightly around it. “It came to me. Or I found it. Doesn’t matter. I stole it, yeah—but it wanted to be taken.”

The Lanternless were silent.

Then, a third voice, harsher, from the mask of anger:

“Many have stolen it. All have died. Some never ended. You are the first who still is.”

Riss stepped beside Snaggrel. “We came here because we don’t know what it’s for. We need to understand.”

“Understanding is not protection.”

“But it’s a start,” Snaggrel said. “So tell us what it is. What it wants.”

For a long time, nothing. Then the six turned and walked into the forest, parting the branches without touching them. No command to follow. But the implication hung there.

“Either we go,” Riss said, “or we stay here and get eaten by singing trees.”

“Easy choice,” Hallowin added, already following.

They were led to a hollow cut into the ridge, hidden behind a waterfall that flowed upward into the sky. Inside, the walls were lined with bones—not trophies, but names. Each femur and rib bore runes that glowed faintly. The place felt old. Not ancient like ruins, but old like the concept of forgetting itself.

They sat before a pool of black water. Reflections showed not their faces, but moments from their lives: Riss as a girl stealing bread in a sunlit market; Hallowin in a burning library, trying to save a book that screamed; Snaggrel digging through muck to bury something he wouldn’t speak of.

The blank mask approached and sat across from them.

“The Crystal is a memory. Not of the past—but of what never should have been. It contains possibility gone wrong. The world locked it away long ago. But things that are buried do not forget.”

“Why is it awake now?” Riss asked.

“Because the wound beneath the world has started to bleed.”

Snaggrel frowned. “And what am I in all this?”

“You are not chosen. You are available. There is a difference.”

Hallowin let out a long, slow exhale. “So what do we do?”

The pool darkened. The voices spoke in unison:

“Take it to the Deep Scar. Return it to the place it first lied. Or the world will break remembering what could have been.”

Snaggrel looked down at the Crystal in his hand. It was calm now. But its weight had never felt heavier.

Riss muttered, “And if we don’t?”

“Then it will choose again. Until someone gets it wrong enough to end everything.”

The room dimmed. The Lanternless turned their backs and began to fade into the shadows of the hollow.

It was not a dismissal. It was a deadline.

That night, they left in silence, climbing out of the hollow and back into the Ridge. The air was colder now. The sky darker.

Snaggrel couldn’t shake the feeling that, for all the horror behind them, the real journey had just begun.

And somewhere in the darkness ahead, the Deep Scar waited. Not a place on any map.

But a truth buried under everything.

Chapter Three: A Map of Scars

The wind changed as they descended the northern flank of Knife Ridge. It lost its voice. Where once it had howled through crags and trees like a drunken piper, it now moved in silence, curling around them like a predator too full to strike but still curious enough to follow. The trees thinned, replaced by jagged rock formations that seemed deliberately placed, like broken teeth jammed into the earth. Even the moss, which had clung defiantly to every surface before, had abandoned this stretch of the world.

Snaggrel walked in front, his posture lower than usual, not from caution but weariness. The Crystal sat cool and inert against his chest, but he could feel its thoughts like pressure in the back of his skull. Since leaving the Lanternless, it hadn’t spoken or shimmered or pulsed. It had simply waited. And that waiting made him uneasy.

“We’re heading into grave territory,” Hallowin said, adjusting the strap of his lute and staring at the path ahead as if trying to recall a tune long forgotten. “I’ve heard songs about this place. The Deep Scar—it’s not a wound in the land. It’s a wound in memory.”

“Nice poetry,” Riss muttered as she scanned the horizon with sharp eyes. “But I’d prefer a map.”

“You don’t map something like this,” Snaggrel said. “It maps you.”

They traveled through a gully lined with slabs of shale, each etched with symbols too worn to decipher. A mist rose from the cracks in the earth, thick and cloying. It didn’t move like mist should. It hovered in coils and eddies that resisted their passage, pressing close to their skin like probing fingers. Twice, Riss drew her dagger and slashed at nothing, only to find her arms covered in fine white dust afterward. Not blood. Not ash. Just dust.

On the second night, they found a ruin.

It wasn’t large—just three standing stones arranged in a crooked triangle, with remnants of a stone circle half-swallowed by the earth. Riss suggested they camp there, if only for the protection the stones might offer. They built no fire. Light, they had learned, attracted things.

They sat close, sharing dried meat and broken thoughts.

“We keep walking,” Snaggrel said finally, staring at the stars. “We find the Scar. We bury the thing. Then we run and never look back.”

“And if the Scar doesn’t want it?” Riss asked.

Snaggrel didn’t answer. The Crystal pulsed once against his chest, as if laughing.

Hallowin leaned back against one of the stones. “I’ve been thinking about the Mirror. About the false Crystals.”

“They were traps,” Riss said. “What’s to think about?”

“Maybe,” Hallowin replied. “Or maybe they were possibilities. Each one a version of this thing. And if that’s true, maybe this Crystal is just the one clever enough to get chosen.”

Snaggrel frowned. “You’re suggesting the Crystal picked me because I’m gullible?”

“I’m suggesting it picked you because it could.”

A cold silence followed. Snaggrel didn’t sleep that night. Instead, he walked a slow circle around the camp, feeling the earth under his feet like a heartbeat. At one point, he knelt and pressed his ear to the soil.

It was humming.

By morning, the stones had moved.

Not much—just a few inches. But they had moved. Riss confirmed it, and Hallowin paled. Snaggrel said nothing. He simply shouldered his pack and continued north.

—

The world began to change in earnest on the fourth day.

Colors dulled. Sound grew sluggish. A river they crossed was filled with water so still and dark it reflected not their faces but places—cities they’d never seen, battles they’d never fought. Riss refused to look into it. Hallowin stared too long and collapsed. Snaggrel dragged him out and slapped him awake, cursing under his breath.

“I saw myself,” Hallowin muttered. “I was happy. Married. I had children. And a song. A song that healed.”

Snaggrel growled. “You saw lies. The Crystal’s full of them.”

“But what if—”

“What if nothing. This place wants us soft. Don’t let it.”

They trudged on. The terrain grew stranger. Trees bled sap that whispered apologies. Rocks rearranged themselves behind them, altering the path. Time became unreliable. One hour felt like three. A full day passed without the sun rising or setting. Hunger became abstract. Fatigue settled into their bones like frost.

Then came the gate.

It was not a gate in the architectural sense. It had no hinges, no doors, no threshold. It was a circle of air, slightly darker than the rest, hovering between two leaning stones. Through it, they could see a plain of ash, wide and barren, with a single black spire at the horizon. The Crystal throbbed against Snaggrel’s chest like a heartbeat skipping a beat.

“That’s it,” he said. “That’s the Scar.”

“You sure?” Riss asked.

“No,” he replied. “But the Crystal is.”

They stepped through.

The air on the other side was wrong.

It wasn’t hot or cold. It wasn’t dry or wet. It simply wasn’t. It clung to their skin like oil and smelled faintly of copper. The plain stretched endlessly in all directions, yet somehow, every step brought them closer to the spire. Their shadows lagged behind them, refusing to keep pace. The sky above was a dull gray with no sun. No moon. No stars.

Just sky.

Hallowin began muttering again. Not songs now—just names. Some they recognized. Some they didn’t. Some they swore he hadn’t known. Riss stopped speaking altogether. Her eyes had a glassy sheen. Snaggrel felt pressure building in his ears, like they were descending into deep water.

At last, they reached the spire.

It was made of stone that pulsed like muscle. Symbols writhed along its base, rearranging themselves with every blink. The top was lost in the sky. At its base sat a bowl-shaped depression, filled with a mist darker than night.

The Crystal buzzed against Snaggrel’s chest. He knew what came next.

He pulled it free.

It shimmered—greener than ever before, almost joyous. It wanted to go home. It trembled in his hand like a living thing, a seed on the cusp of sprouting.

He stepped toward the bowl.

“Wait,” Riss said suddenly. Her voice was hoarse, like she hadn’t used it in days. “You don’t know what happens when it touches that.”

Snaggrel looked at her. “I don’t care.”

“You should.”

“Why? You think the world’s gonna get worse than this?”

She didn’t answer. Hallowin was crying quietly. Not loudly. Not from fear. Just steady tears, as if he were letting go of something too large to carry.

Snaggrel dropped the Crystal into the mist.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then the world screamed.

The sound wasn’t heard—it was felt, in the bones, in the gut, in the thoughts. The sky cracked like porcelain. The spire shook. The mist in the bowl flared green, then black, then was gone.

Snaggrel stumbled back, covering his face.

When he looked again, the bowl was empty.

The Crystal was gone.

And the Scar was closing.

The air began to suck inward. The plain trembled. The spire cracked. Snaggrel grabbed Riss by the arm and screamed, “RUN!”

They didn’t look back.

The ground behind them shattered. The sky bent. Wind pulled at their limbs, trying to drag them down into the vanishing Scar. They ran, each step harder than the last, until finally the circle of air—the gate—loomed before them once more.

They dove through.

And just like that, the plain was gone.

The sky was blue again.

The wind sang nonsense.

The trees were real.

And the Crystal… was no longer humming.

Snaggrel lay in the grass, chest heaving.

“It’s done,” he whispered.

“No,” said Riss. “It’s changed. But not done.”

And they sat there in silence, feeling the weight of what had been released.

Behind them, in the place where the Scar had been, the earth began to forget.

But they never would.

The forest that greeted them after their escape from the Scar was not the one they remembered. It looked similar at a glance—gnarled oaks twisted in defiance of gravity, vines that shivered in the absence of wind—but the rhythm was wrong. The birdsong, when it came, chirped in reverse. The moss now grew on the undersides of rocks. A stream they crossed refused to reflect their images, showing instead the backs of their heads, even when they faced forward.

They moved quietly, each step deliberate. Not because they feared pursuit, but because none of them could quite shake the feeling that they hadn’t returned alone.

Snaggrel walked slightly ahead, though not by choice. The others lagged a few paces behind, not because of exhaustion or injury, but distance of a different kind. Since returning from the Scar, an invisible boundary had formed—between him and the others, and between all three of them and the rest of the world. The Crystal was gone, its weight absent from his chest, but its echo lingered. Like the heat of a fire after the last log has turned to ash.

They camped that night beside a tree shaped like a question mark. The bark peeled in curls, revealing wood the color of old parchment beneath. Riss sat close to the fire, her face carved from silence. Hallowin strummed his lute softly, though the strings no longer made music, only vibrations in the air that shivered like sighs.

Snaggrel stared into the fire. “I feel hollow,” he muttered.

“You carried a godseed,” Hallowin said without looking up. “Even if it wasn’t a god. Not really. Things like that leave... impressions.”

“What was it?” Riss asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Snaggrel didn’t answer right away. He poked the fire with a blackened stick, watching the embers scatter. “I think it was a story that got tired of being untold. And I think it found me because I had nothing to lose.”

“Do you?” Riss asked. “Nothing?”

He looked at her. “Less than before.”

They fell quiet. The fire sputtered, uncertain of its place. Somewhere deep in the forest, something laughed. Not close. Not threatening. But amused.

By morning, the world had changed again.

It looked normal—blue sky, chirping birds, dew-dappled grass—but when Riss tried to drink from the canteen, the water refused to leave it. Hallowin’s shadow no longer followed him, but lingered a few steps behind, as if unsure it wanted to stay. Snaggrel found that his reflection in a puddle blinked a second too late, and sometimes stared back when he turned away.

“We shouldn’t still be here,” Riss said, eyes scanning the treetops. “We left the Scar, but it didn’t let go.”

“We brought something back,” Hallowin murmured.

“No,” Snaggrel said. “We brought ourselves back. But we’re not the same.”

They headed south, aiming for known roads, places where maps held sway. But the path bent strangely, leading them through familiar territory that no longer behaved as it should. A village they passed through had been untouched by time—tools left mid-repair, meals half-eaten on tables, no sign of struggle. But no people. Only birds, perched on chimneys and fences, watching.

Riss kicked over a stool in the empty tavern. “This isn’t right. There’s no dust.”

“No decay either,” Hallowin added. “Like they all stood up and walked out yesterday. Or five minutes ago.”

Snaggrel checked the fireplace. The embers were warm.

He turned toward the others. “We leave. Now.”

They didn’t argue.

They pressed on, pushing through terrain that grew more lucid the farther they got from the Scar. By the fifth day, the trees looked like trees again. Water behaved. Their reflections stopped lagging. Still, none of them slept deeply. Snaggrel’s dreams were haunted not by visions, but absence. He would close his eyes and feel the shape of something that was no longer there—the Crystal, yes, but more than that. The need it filled. The purpose it gave.

He began waking with his hands clenched, nails digging into the calluses of his palms.

One morning, they came across a caravan traveling east. Real people, with mud-splattered wheels and tired horses. The travelers looked wary but not hostile. A few children peeked out from under canvas, wide-eyed at the sight of Snaggrel and his companions.

“You heading west?” the caravan leader asked, a broad-shouldered woman with a jaw like a pickaxe and a voice thick with road dust.

“We’re leaving the Deeps,” Riss replied. “Trying to get back to Clattershade.”

The woman nodded slowly, her gaze resting a little too long on Snaggrel. “You’re the goblin.”

Snaggrel didn’t pretend to misunderstand. “I’ve been called worse.”

She spat. “Don’t care what you took. Don’t care what you killed. You’re alive, and the forest has been quiet ever since. That makes you... tolerated.”

Snaggrel smirked. “High praise.”

“You want a ride? We’ve got room if you don’t mind squeezing in with chickens and pickled fish.”

They agreed.

The road was long, but mundane in its hardships. Mud, rain, aching feet. Arguments over who got the dry blanket. It felt almost normal. Snaggrel found comfort in the stink of livestock and the creak of wheels. Riss softened. Hallowin started playing music again—real songs this time, though the notes still carried a strange edge, like laughter heard through a wall.

At night, by the fireside, Snaggrel found himself telling stories. Not the true ones. Never the true ones. But tales of near-misses and alleyway brawls, of stealing pies from noble banquets and swindling corrupt guards with fake relics. The others laughed. He laughed too.

He didn’t mention the dreams.

Didn’t mention how he sometimes woke with blood in his mouth.

Didn’t mention how the Crystal’s absence still hummed, faint but insistent, like a name half-remembered.

It was near the city gates of Clattershade, weeks later, that they parted ways.

Riss said little. Just clasped Snaggrel’s hand once, firm and steady, and disappeared into the crowd with a hood pulled low.

Hallowin hugged him, an awkward press of arms and bardic musk. “You did something important,” he said. “Even if no one knows what.”

Snaggrel watched them go, then turned and walked into the city.

No one recognized him. The posters were gone. The bounty forgotten. Life had moved on.

He took a room above a candle-maker’s shop in the market quarter. Paid a month in advance. Kept to himself. He even started working odd jobs again—mostly delivery, sometimes pickpocketing for practice. The days passed.

But some nights, just before sleep took him, he would feel the weight return to his chest.

Not painful.

Not even heavy.

Just... present.

As though the Crystal had not been destroyed or sealed.

Only... passed on.

And somewhere in the far corners of the world, it was waiting again.

For another goblin.

For another lie.

For another story to begin.

Chapter Four: A Sickness in Stone

Clattershade had not changed. Its streets still choked on the scent of fish oil and soot, its alleys swarmed with knife-promise eyes, and its towers stabbed upward as if trying to puncture the clouds out of spite. For Snaggrel, walking its familiar filth was like slipping into old skin—uncomfortable but known. Yet something beneath the cobbled rhythm was wrong.

He first noticed it on Crooked Lantern Row, where a boy no older than ten stopped in the middle of thieving Snaggrel’s coin pouch just to stare at him, wide-eyed and silent. The boy’s lips moved, mouthing words that didn’t reach the air, and when Snaggrel touched his shoulder, the child jerked as if electrocuted and ran. Left the pouch. Left his own satchel. Ran like he was on fire.

Later that evening, as Snaggrel perched on the roof of a crooked tenement, chewing on a fried lizard and watching the market stalls wind down, he saw it again. A woman—dressed in the robes of a street preacher—paused her sermon mid-rant to lock eyes with him. Her mouth froze in the shape of a prayer. Then her eyes rolled white and she collapsed.

“Second today,” he muttered, licking his claws clean. “Either I’m cursed or fashionable.”

But deep down, he knew.

He’d felt it building since leaving the Scar. A slow, sick thrum in the stones of the city. Not from the Crystal—that thing was long gone—but from the echo of its passage. Magic like that didn’t vanish. It threaded itself into cracks, into dreams, into the marrow of anyone close enough to feel its heat. Snaggrel had carried it. Riss and Hallowin had touched it. But Clattershade, unknowingly, had breathed it.

And now something was unraveling.

Three days into his quiet return, Snaggrel started noticing the dreams.

They weren’t his. They came in flits and starts, images bleeding into his mind during his waking hours—visions of places he’d never been. A hallway of living glass. A garden grown upside down. A child with green eyes and no mouth.

He kept a tally scratched into the underside of his floorboard.

Nine dreams.

Seven faces he didn’t know.

Five new marks that healed too fast.

And one name that hadn’t been spoken aloud in centuries.

Virid.

He’d heard it whispered in the dark of the Scar, seen it written backward on the skin of a Wyrd Warden. Now it echoed in puddles and rain-slick gutters, always when no one else was around.

It was Riss who returned first.

He didn’t hear her come up the stairs. One moment he was lighting a candle with the stub of a match; the next, she was standing in the corner of the room, her cloak soaked through, her eyes colder than ever.

“You heard it too,” she said.

Snaggrel didn’t turn around. “I see you gave up pretending.”

“I had to kill a man in Vetch Hollow. He was chanting in his sleep. Woke half the district. He was drawing the Crystal in charcoal on the walls.”

“You sure it wasn’t a grift?”

“I cut open his heart. It was pulsing green.”

Snaggrel set down the match. “So. It’s back.”

“No,” Riss said, stepping forward. “It never left.”

They sat in silence, the city groaning faintly through the boards beneath them. Riss poured herself a half-glass of fireroot and passed it over. Snaggrel drank it in one gulp.

“How many others?”

“Hard to say. Rumors in the southern quarter. Seers with blacked-out eyes. One kid started floating in his sleep, then caught fire when he woke. They blamed witchcraft. Lynched a healer for it. Didn’t help.”

Snaggrel leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. “We buried it.”

“No,” she said. “We delivered it. The Crystal wasn’t a prison. It was a key.”

He laughed once, hollow and sharp. “To what?”

“Something old. Maybe not alive. Maybe not dead. But it’s waking.”

Later that night, a message arrived. Delivered by a bird with eyes sewn shut. No markings. No signature. Just a strip of thin leather bound in wax, tied around its leg. Snaggrel unwrapped it slowly. The message inside was only a few words, scrawled in thick, deliberate ink:

“The Lanternless failed. The Archive has split. Come to Hollowbridge.”

He read it twice, then handed it to Riss.

“Hollowbridge is abandoned,” she said. “Flooded a decade ago.”

“Not anymore, apparently.”

Riss drew her hood up. “I’ll get horses.”

“Get a boat,” Snaggrel replied, eyes narrowed. “If the Archive is split, we’ll need to go through the underways.”

Two days later they stood at the mouth of a sewer inlet east of Hollowbridge proper. Rain slicked the stones, the water dark and sluggish. Snaggrel had expected the smell of waste and rot. Instead, he smelled blood and ink. A library drowned in violence.

They slipped through rusted bars, their boots making little noise on the stone. The tunnels below Hollowbridge had once belonged to smugglers and alchemists—places where truth had been whispered and silenced in the same breath. Now they belonged to something else.

The graffiti on the walls was new. Spirals etched with bone. Runes half-formed. A child’s rhyme scrawled in blood.

Green is the hollow
Black is the bite
When the moon forgets morning
The world ends in light.

They found the first corpse slumped against a pillar, soaked and stinking. It wore robes that might’ve once been white. Its hands were burned through, skin fused to paper. Riss bent down and peeled a fragment of a page from under the body. She squinted at the script.

“It’s a summoning formula. Partial.”

“For the Crystal?” Snaggrel asked.

“No,” she said slowly. “For what was inside it.”

Further in, they reached what remained of the Archive: a vaulted chamber lined in stone and silence. Scrolls clung to the walls like dried skin. In the center stood a basin filled with mirrored oil. Above it hovered a shard of something too dark to reflect.

Riss approached it.

Then the voices came.

Soft at first. Then rising.

Not speech. Not song.

Memory.

Snaggrel dropped to his knees, clutching his head. The chamber spun with visions: a city eaten by vines. A man splitting into three versions of himself. A goblin tearing out his own tongue to stop the words from escaping. The shard pulsed. The oil churned.

Riss turned. Her eyes bled green light.

“We didn’t seal it,” she said. “We opened it.”

Snaggrel reached for her. “Riss, fight it.”

“I’m not possessed,” she hissed. “I understand. That’s worse.”

And the shard spoke—not aloud, but into their thoughts, raw and ancient.

“THE SEED HAS BLOOMED. THE HOLLOW IS FED. THE THIEF REMAINS.”

Snaggrel stood slowly. “I’m no thief anymore.”

“ALL WHO TAKE ARE THIEVES. ALL WHO RETURN ARE PRIESTS.”

The light flared.

And the world changed again.

The chamber trembled, not with motion but with intention. The air thickened into syrup. Light became a slow, syrupy smear across their vision, and the voices didn’t fade—they multiplied. Hundreds, maybe thousands, overlapping and echoing with unbearable weight. Some spoke in languages long buried beneath the continents; others sounded like bones grinding underwater. All of them were inside, not around them. The kind of noise that frays thought, chewing through memory like moths through silk.

Riss staggered back from the shard, her arms twitching, fingers splayed as if grasping for something that wasn’t there. Her lips moved in silence, mouthing names Snaggrel couldn’t hear, and didn’t want to. Her shadow rippled across the stone, expanding, coiling, writhing, like it had forgotten what shape belonged to her.

Snaggrel bit down on his tongue, hard. Blood filled his mouth, sharp and grounding. He reached into his vest—habit, reflex—only to remember the Crystal was gone. What he held now was a splinter of nothing, a stolen fate with no anchor. Still, he moved forward, dragging his boots across the slick stone floor.

“Riss,” he said, louder than the storm inside his head. “You’re not theirs.”

She turned slowly. Her eyes were dull green glass. No light behind them. Her mouth split in a wide grin—too wide, too wrong. Then it snapped shut, and her shoulders shook once, violently, as if something within her were being crushed.

Then, in a blink, she was herself again.

She collapsed against the plinth. Her breathing was ragged, and her fingers were stained black to the elbow. Whatever had touched her through the shard had left residue—a corruption that pulsed beneath her skin in twitching lines.

“I saw it,” she whispered. “Not just what it is, but what it’s trying to be.”

Snaggrel knelt beside her. “Talk. Now.”

Riss looked up, her face pale as ash. “The Crystal was a container, yes. But it wasn’t meant to keep something in. It was meant to carry something out. Like smuggling a flame in a seed. It was delivered to this world. Through us.”

He felt his stomach drop. “Delivered to what?”

She shook her head. “Not what. When.”

Behind them, the shard pulsed again. The mirrored oil began to ripple, not as if stirred, but as if something beneath it was waking. The voices stopped. For a moment, there was only breath. Their breath. And then, the whisper:

“Time has opened.”

A blinding pulse of green shot from the shard, striking both of them in the chest. The floor dropped away. The stone turned liquid. Reality folded inward.

They fell.

—

When Snaggrel came to, he was lying in a city that had never been built.

The sky above was cracked like old pottery, leaking strands of gold. Buildings spiraled instead of rose. Roads moved beneath the feet of people who walked like sculptures in reverse—stone turning to flesh with every step. The air smelled of burnt honey and snowmelt, impossible and endless.

He stood, blinking away the nausea. Riss was beside him, groaning, still alive. The shard was gone. The chamber was gone.

But the city remained.

In the distance, a bell tolled. It sounded like metal crying.

“What now?” she asked, slowly rising, rubbing her temples.

Snaggrel looked around. “I think we’re in a when, not a where.”

“Any chance it’s the past?”

“Not one I remember.”

A figure approached them—tall, veiled in robes woven from pages. Its face was featureless, a mask of ink, shifting symbols slithering across its surface. It carried a lantern of black flame, which cast no light, only reflection.

“You have trespassed,” it said, its voice a harmony of a hundred mouths. “You are not of this now.”

Snaggrel stepped forward, baring teeth. “Wasn’t our choice.”

“You carry the residue of the Hollow. The breath of the Scar. The mark of the Thief.”

“Again,” Snaggrel snapped, “not my choice.”

The figure’s lantern lifted. “It is always choice. The Crystal moved because you moved. It wanted you.”

“Then it’s got awful taste.”

Behind the figure, the city began to melt. Towers slumped like wax in summer heat. Streets coiled into loops. People stopped turning from stone to flesh, and instead turned inside out—becoming language, becoming color, becoming questions.

“You have opened the Second Scar,” the figure said. “The First wounded the world. The Second will unravel it.”

Riss whispered, “Then how do we stop it?”

“You cannot stop a story,” the figure said. “You can only end it. Or be ended by it.”

It raised a hand.

A doorway formed.

A frame of shadow. A corridor of bone. Within it, a spiraling tunnel that pulsed with faint green light, steady and beckoning.

“You must walk the Thread,” the figure said. “To the Source. To the Moment where the Seed first sang.”

Snaggrel looked at Riss.

She nodded. “No way out but through.”

They stepped through the door.

—

The tunnel bent logic.

They walked for what felt like hours, though no steps were taken. They stood still and moved forward. The walls were memories—not theirs, but someone’s. A girl crying as her village sank. A man building a harp from his own ribs. A creature with too many eyes burying a book made of screams.

And then—clarity.

They emerged into a vast chamber, far larger than the Scar, far older than the world.

At its center floated a tree.

Not a tree in the way bark and leaves exist, but something that remembered trees. It shimmered between dimensions, branches unfolding into ideas, roots burrowing into the past and future simultaneously. At its heart pulsed a green light.

The Crystal.

No—the First Crystal. Before it was shaped. Before it was carried. Before it chose.

Snaggrel approached.

It pulsed once, soft.

“You know why I’m here,” he said.

A voice answered from within the light. It wasn’t the Crystal. It was himself.

“You brought me. You carried me. You became part of me. But you don’t understand me.”

“I don’t need to,” he growled. “I just need to end this.”

The tree pulsed.

“To end me,” the voice said, “you must give up the part of you that believed in anything.”

Snaggrel blinked. “What?”

“The Crystal chose you because you were empty. A vessel. A wound. But now you are not. You found others. You hoped. You fought. That makes you dangerous.”

Snaggrel turned to Riss. She was glowing faintly, the green shimmer crawling up her arms.

“You carried it too,” he said.

She smiled faintly. “I still do.”

Snaggrel stepped into the light.

And let go.

Of his doubt.

Of his anger.

Of the idea that the world owed him nothing and he owed it less.

And in that moment, the Crystal shattered.

The tree screamed, fracturing across timelines.

The Scar closed—past, present, future.

And the story ended.

But Snaggrel remained.

—

He awoke in the ruins of the Hollow.

Alone.

The Crystal was gone.

Riss was gone.

But the sky was clean.

The birds sang right.

And for the first time in his life, the silence wasn’t empty.

It was peace.

Chapter Five: Echoes Without a Voice

The Hollow had changed, but not in the way Snaggrel expected. It hadn’t grown or crumbled or burned in his absence—it had simply forgotten. The nests were still there, sagging beneath the limbs of black alder trees. The old stink of damp bark and roasted beetle guts still clung to the earth. But the noise, the ceaseless cackling and snarling and song, the goblin chaos that had once defined this place, was gone.

No laughter. No firelight. No kin.

Only memory, curled like a wounded animal beneath the roots.

Snaggrel sat on the edge of what had once been his den, clawing through debris that might have been furniture if you squinted. He found a fragment of his old vest—torn, rotted, and gnawed-through by time—and held it in his lap like an offering. Above him, the sun flickered behind slow-moving clouds, casting long shadows that seemed too thin for the trees that made them.

He hadn’t spoken in three days.

He hadn’t needed to.

There was no one to talk to.

The Crystal’s absence was a pressure of its own. Not pain, not exactly—but a hollow ache where purpose used to sit. Like a story that ends mid-sentence. He didn’t miss the power. He didn’t even miss the danger. What he missed was knowing what came next.

Now, there was only silence. And the sense that something still watched him, not from the trees or the sky, but from within. A residue. Not malevolent, just persistent.

He had given up the Crystal. Broken the cycle. Closed the Scar. And yet the world had not cheered. No parades. No thunderclaps of divine approval.

Just... more dirt.

More roots.

More Hollow.

He tried leaving once—ventured south, toward the moss road where travelers sometimes passed with packs full of gossip and dried fish. But the trees had shifted. Not enough to trap him, just enough to confuse him. And each step felt more absurd than the last.

He didn’t belong in cities. He never had.

And so he returned, days later, to the half-collapsed den and the taste of old lichen.

He thought of Riss. Briefly. Often.

She had vanished in the light of the tree, her presence burning off like morning fog. Whether she’d lived or dissolved or become part of the ending—he didn’t know. The last look she gave him had been calm, maybe grateful. Maybe something else.

He wondered if she remembered him now.

If she remembered herself.

One morning, a crow landed on the edge of the den and cocked its head at him.

It didn’t speak. Didn’t caw. Just stared, and then dropped a bit of parchment from its beak.

Snaggrel stared at it for a long time before picking it up.

The parchment was rough, stained, scrawled with thick, childish lines. Not language—symbols. A circle within a spiral within a jagged line. He knew it. Had seen it carved into the walls of the Archive, drawn in blood by hands that no longer remembered flesh.

Under the symbol, four words scratched in a desperate hand:

“It dreams again. Below.”

Snaggrel burned the parchment that night. Let it curl to ash in his fingers. Then, for the first time in weeks, he moved with intent. He packed a small satchel—just bone knife, some dried roots, a slingshot, and the last tooth of a Wyrd Warden that he’d kept more out of spite than strategy.

He left the Hollow the next morning before the sun had fully committed to rising.

The forest didn’t resist him this time. The path bent, yes, but in agreement. The moss no longer whispered, and the roots didn’t trip him. It was as if the woods had finally accepted that whatever fate he was tangled in, it was bigger than their games.

He headed east. Not to the Archive, nor the Scar, nor any known ruin.

He followed something older. A tug behind his sternum. Not the Crystal—he was sure of that. This was different. This was familiar.

He came to a cliff’s edge on the third day. Below it stretched a vast sinkhole, wide as a lake, depthless as night. The land had collapsed inward, not from violence, but retreat. Like the earth had curled away from something buried. He crouched at the lip, scanning for paths downward.

A single stone staircase wound along the inner wall, narrow and broken in places, slick with moss and old tears. No handrails. No torches. Only descent.

He didn’t hesitate.

The deeper he went, the colder the air became—not just in temperature, but in intent. The sort of cold that made thoughts shiver, that reminded bones of how brief they were. Each step echoed with a delay, as though the pit measured sound before deciding to return it. Shapes moved in the dark far below. Not bodies. Not even shadows.

Ideas.

Snaggrel whispered under his breath as he descended. Nothing specific. No spell. No plea. Just sound, something his, to keep the silence from growing teeth.

At the bottom, the staircase ended in a platform of carved stone. Not ancient. Not new. Just permanent. Beyond it, a cave yawned open, rimmed with glyphs that wept slow trails of greenish light. The scent that wafted out was not rot or mold, but age. The smell of waiting.

He stepped inside.

And the dream returned.

Not a vision this time, but an awareness. A presence, coiled tight in the deepest parts of the cave. Breathing slowly. Sleeping deeply.

It had no name, yet it remembered his.

Snaggrel.

He moved slowly now, carefully, each footfall a pact with the ground. The air thickened. The walls glistened with veins of crystal—not the same green as before, but pale, almost white, like frost frozen in mid-thought. And then the tunnel ended.

The final chamber was circular, its walls lined with alcoves. In each, a statue knelt. Human. Elf. Goblin. Beast. All postured in worship. All headless.

At the center of the chamber was a pool. Black. Still. Not liquid—absence. A mirror that reflected nothing. The voice that rose from it was not spoken aloud, but neither was it within.

It was between.

“You ended the story.”

Snaggrel stepped to the edge of the pool. “I thought I did.”

“No. You paused it. You mourned it. But stories do not die. They wait.”

He stared down into the stillness. “What are you?”

“I am the page that follows the last. The silence between chapters. The breath before the next word.”

Snaggrel closed his eyes. “And what do you want?”

“To be read. To be remembered. To be written.”

The pool trembled. In its center, something rose—slow, deliberate. Not the Crystal. Not exactly. A seed, shaped like a spiral. Small. Pale. Breathing.

He didn’t reach for it.

Didn’t need to.

It floated toward him, stopping just short of his chest.

“You can leave it,” the voice said. “Or carry it. But if you carry it, you will write again.”

Snaggrel stared at it for a long time.

And then, slowly, he reached out.

The moment his fingers brushed it, the pool vanished. The chamber lit up. The statues raised their hands.

And the world began again.

Not in fire.

Not in blood.

But in ink.

The light did not blind him. It wasn’t even particularly bright. It poured across the chamber in slow ripples, as if hesitant to illuminate what had slumbered in darkness for so long. The statues around Snaggrel, now glowing with inner fire, no longer seemed inert. Though their heads were still missing, their bodies had shifted subtly, joints loosened, hands opened as if offering or awaiting something. And the pool—the black, mirrorless void—was simply gone, leaving behind a ring of smooth stone and the lingering taste of deep cold on the air.

The seed hovered just before him. It pulsed faintly, not in warning or beckoning, but with a sort of nervousness. As if it were unsure of him, and perhaps unsure of itself. Snaggrel stared at it, claws slightly extended, and for a long while he did nothing. He simply breathed.

“You’re not the Crystal,” he said, his voice breaking the thick hush.

The seed shimmered gently. A memory curled into shape before his eyes—not a vision, not a command. Just a flicker.

A boy no older than ten with green eyes and ink-stained fingers, hunched over parchment. Writing.

Then another flicker—an old woman tearing pages from a book and feeding them into a furnace.

Then another—Snaggrel, long ago, stealing a book he couldn’t read, hiding it under floorboards, and sleeping above it like a dragon with its hoard.

The seed was not power.

It was story.

Pure, unformed, unclaimed.

Not a weapon. Not a curse. A beginning.

Snaggrel reached forward, and this time, he didn’t hesitate.

The seed slid into his palm and dissolved.

No pain. No surge. No scream.

Just warmth. Like breath on a cold night. And then a word—not spoken aloud, not planted by any outside voice, but born fully within his mind.

Write.

He staggered back. The cave shuddered. The statues lowered their arms and collapsed into fine white ash. The walls cracked, glyphs splintering like thin ice. The floor beneath him held—barely.

And in that silence, he understood.

He wasn’t just the vessel. Not anymore.

He was the scribe.

The seed had not chosen him to contain it.

It had chosen him to remember it. To record what had been, and to shape what could be.

And the price of such clarity was responsibility.

Snaggrel stood alone, dust coating his boots, lungs heavy with old echoes. He left the chamber with no fanfare, no final riddle. The path behind him closed—not with violence, but resolution.

When he emerged aboveground, the sky was a deep bruise-blue. Dawn or dusk—he wasn’t sure. The air smelled cleaner. No sour rot. No creeping moss scent. The Hollow was far behind him now, and something in him no longer reached back to it.

He began walking—not with destination, but with direction.

South. Toward villages where folk still told stories beside hearths and children dared each other to enter ruined shrines. Toward crossroads where rumors grew legs. Toward cities where libraries had forgotten what truths they held.

He would go to them.

And listen.

He would listen to lies.

And truths.

And the soft, uncertain things in between.

He found an abandoned chapel on the road to Gretsmar. Roof caved in. Walls overtaken by ivy. Inside, there was a stone table and the brittle bones of someone who had once believed in permanence. He set up camp there—not because it was safe, but because it was quiet. At night, he lit a single candle and pulled out scraps of scavenged parchment, ink brewed from river bark and fire soot, a broken quill fixed with a rat-bone nib.

He began to write.

Not grand epics. Not histories carved into stone.

He wrote what he remembered.

He wrote Riss’s smile, bent and fleeting as it had been. He wrote Hallowin’s lute, cracked and humming with impossible harmonics. He wrote the taste of fear inside the Scar, the weight of the Crystal in his vest, the lies the Crystal told through him that sounded too much like hope.

And each word he wrote, the seed inside him grew.

It didn't hunger. It didn't beg.

It became.

He didn’t understand it all. He didn’t need to.

He simply wrote.

He remembered.

And in that remembering, the story healed.

Not ended.

Not erased.

Just softened. Just closed.

Days turned to weeks.

Once, a traveler passed through the chapel and asked if he was a priest.

“No,” Snaggrel had said, without looking up from his writing. “I’m a thief.”

The traveler had laughed and tossed him a coin.

Snaggrel kept it.

And kept writing.

Sometimes he felt Riss nearby. Not in flesh, but in memory. She had always stood where the world broke, held her knives like truths, and dared the end to come faster.

He hoped she was still out there.

He hoped she remembered him.

If she didn’t, that was fine too.

He’d written her name already.

Carved it onto the page where no fire could reach.

One night, as the stars began to blink in like forgotten promises, he heard a sound beyond the chapel door. A soft knock, three times.

He paused.

Set down his quill.

Stood.

When he opened the door, no one was there.

Only a single page nailed to the wood, flapping in the wind.

No ink.

No glyphs.

Just a clean, blank page.

And Snaggrel smiled.

Because he understood.

The story wasn’t finished.

It never would be.

But now, at last, it belonged to him.

The page nailed to the chapel door stayed there through the night, fluttering in the wind like a loose thought trying to decide whether to fly or fall. Snaggrel didn’t remove it. He let it hang there, watched it from inside with the firelight casting a golden flicker on the door, waiting to see if it would change, if it would ink itself in the dark. It didn’t. But somehow, that was more meaningful than if it had.

The blank page was an invitation.

Not from the seed. Not from the Crystal. Not even from whatever voice still lingered beyond the reach of time.

It was from the world itself.

It wanted to be written.

Snaggrel sat at his table again that morning, ink pot refreshed, quill sharpened with the edge of a rusted coin. He had no outline. No plan. Just a weight in his chest where questions nested like birds that would not sleep. He dipped the quill. He began again.

This time, he wrote in goblin script.

It was crude, full of loops and slashes and spittle-marks, but it was his. Not the language of seers or monks or mages. It carried none of the precision of High Glyph or the haunting rhythm of Bone Chants. It was jagged. Ugly. Alive.

He wrote the Hollow.

Not how it had ended, but how it had lived. The arguments over mushroom rights. The old hags who ran gambling dens in mud-walled huts. The tricks they played on passing travelers who didn’t know better than to whistle after dark.

He wrote his mother’s name, though he’d forgotten her face.

He wrote the word Grub, and then stopped for a long time, claw frozen above the page.

The memory came slowly—his cousin, eyes clouded, hand still clutching a stone blade after death, the two of them hiding beneath a broken wheelbarrow during the raids. Snaggrel didn’t cry. He hadn’t in years. But the ink on the page blurred slightly, and he didn’t wipe it away.

The page filled.

He pinned it to the wall of the chapel.

The next one followed.

He wrote Riss again. More carefully this time. Not just the way she moved or spoke, but the space she had created around herself. The room she left for others. The blade she kept hidden in her boot, not out of paranoia but certainty. She had known the world would never stop testing her.

He hoped she’d passed.

He hoped she’d forgiven him, if not for leaving her behind, then for surviving.

That page went up beside the first.

By the end of that week, the chapel walls were no longer bare. They were papered with memory. Not all of it his. Sometimes, he dreamed faces that weren’t his to recall. Other people’s losses. Forgotten loves. Wounds carved into cities he had never walked.

He wrote them anyway.

Because someone had to.

And then, on the eleventh night since he found the seed, someone knocked again.

This time it wasn’t wind.

Snaggrel opened the door to find a child. Goblin, like him. Young, sharp-eyed, too thin for her age, carrying a satchel that had seen better centuries.

“You’re the one who wrote about the Hollow,” she said before he could speak. “The real Hollow. Not the ones in the songbooks.”

Snaggrel blinked. “How’d you read that?”

She tapped her temple. “Not reading. Knowing. It was written the way we remember. It smells like home.”

He stepped aside.

She entered like she belonged there.

By morning, she was writing too.

Not well. Not clean. But with fire.

Days passed. Then another came. An old woman missing one eye. A human boy who dreamed in colors that hadn’t been named yet. A pair of twins who only spoke in fragments, but wrote in exacting detail—pages that buzzed with memory, that smelled of summer stone and distant thunder.

They didn’t ask Snaggrel what to do. They knew. The seed had touched them too, in slivers. In dreams. In the breath between turning a page.

The chapel became a sanctum.

Not a temple. Not a school.

Something in between.

Each writer pinned their page.

And each page became part of the whole.

No one spoke of the Crystal.

No one spoke of the Scar.

But the echoes were there.

Snaggrel sometimes caught himself turning in the night, sure he’d heard the old hum—the pulse that once lived beneath his ribs.

He never found it.

And yet it never truly left.

It lived now in the stories.

In the way new voices picked up old threads and gave them endings they had been denied.

The past healed slowly.

The world did not thank them.

But sometimes, travelers stopped by, just to listen.

To read.

To remember.

And in doing so, they changed.

That was enough.

That was more than magic.

One day, Snaggrel stood at the chapel door and looked out at the road twisting into fog.

The seed still pulsed faintly in his chest—not a demand, not a power, but a beat. A rhythm waiting for the next line.

He turned back inside.

The ink was ready.

The paper was blank.

The story, as always, was beginning again.

Chapter Six: The Ink That Binds

The fog rolled in before dawn, thick and low, the kind that curled around your boots and whispered like an old friend who had forgotten your name. Snaggrel stood at the chapel door, peering into the gray without fear. He had learned that the fog itself held no malice—it was what used it that mattered. And right now, something was moving within it. Slowly. Deliberately.

Behind him, the others still slept. Pages rustled on the chapel walls as a breeze passed through, carrying the faint scent of ash and myrrh. Snaggrel stepped outside.

The figure emerged as more suggestion than person. A silhouette against nothing, cloaked in layers of patchwork cloth that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. A staff tapped against the stone path with each step—an old rhythm, steady and final.

Snaggrel didn’t reach for a weapon. He no longer carried one.

The figure stopped a few feet away.

“Goblin,” it said in a voice like crumbling pages. “You wrote something that doesn’t belong.”

“I wrote what was true,” Snaggrel replied. “Or as close as I could manage.”

The figure didn’t move. “Truth and ownership are rarely allies.”

“Depends who’s reading.”

For a long time, neither of them spoke. The wind rose and fell. Somewhere far off, a crow cawed—once, then went silent. The figure finally lifted its head. Its face was obscured by a veil of ink-threaded fabric, but Snaggrel could feel the eyes behind it. Not cruel. Not kind. Just measuring.

“There are stories that were locked for a reason,” it said. “Names that should not have form. Thoughts that, once written, do not stop thinking.”

“I know,” Snaggrel said. “I met them. I carried one.”

“And yet here you are. Scratching words on scraps. Passing them on.”

“Because silence is worse.”

The figure tilted its head. “You’ve become dangerous.”

“I used to be a thief. This is an improvement.”

The figure moved closer, the staff now silent. It extended one hand, fingers tipped with silver rings carved with broken symbols.

“You carry the Seed.”

Snaggrel nodded. “Not by choice. But I’ve made it mine.”

The figure lowered its hand. “Then you are no longer the bearer. You are the source.”

At that, Snaggrel flinched. “I’m no prophet. I’m not trying to build anything.”

“Then why do they come to you?” the figure asked. “Why do the blank pages find you?”

Snaggrel didn’t answer. He didn’t have to. The figure exhaled—not anger, not frustration. Something softer.

“I came to silence you,” it said. “But I see now that would do more harm than good.”

“Then why come at all?”

“To warn you.”

It stepped back into the mist, the staff clicking once more against the stone. “The Seed is not alone. Others fell through the cracks. Some were caught. Some... learned to wait.”

Snaggrel’s gut turned. “You’re saying there are more?”

“I’m saying there are stories that remember being erased. And now, they want back in.”

With that, the figure was gone.

The mist swallowed everything.

Snaggrel stood there long after the fog began to lift, watching the place where the path had vanished. Not out of fear, but because the weight of understanding was settling in his shoulders like fresh snow.

He went inside and didn’t wake the others. Instead, he sat at his table, opened a new page, and began again.

This time, he wrote warnings.

Not prophecies. Not threats. Just records.

Of names he’d never heard but felt in his teeth.

Of places shaped like questions.

Of the silence between the Scar’s final breath and the world’s next one.

The others woke slowly. One by one, they came to the walls, read his newest entries, and began to write beside them. Not rebuttals. Not commentary. Continuations.

Together, they wrote a new chapter.

They called it “The Watch.”

The chapel became more than a resting place. It became a gate.

Not a physical one. A narrative threshold.

A place where stories arrived bruised and bleeding, and left changed. Not always healed. But always witnessed.

That was enough.

But nothing stayed quiet forever.

It started with the boy from the valley. He arrived bleeding ink from his eyes, a scroll embedded in his skin. He screamed in seven voices, all saying the same line:

“It has remembered us.”

Then the storms began.

Lightning struck without thunder.

The air filled with whispers only the written could hear.

Books elsewhere in the world burst into flame or wept openly.

And stories long-buried clawed their way into the minds of the innocent.

Snaggrel read each new report with steady hands. He took no joy in being right. Only purpose.

He wrote faster.

He taught others how to anchor their pages.

How to bind ink with intent.

How to recognize the shape of a hungry story before it devoured the pen that wrote it.

More came.

Not refugees.

Witnesses.

Not all stayed. Some took what they learned and carried it back into the world, opening new sanctums, new Watchposts.

Some didn’t return.

But the ink grew.

The walls filled.

Snaggrel never left the chapel again.

He didn’t need to.

Because every word written beyond his reach still pulsed with the same seed.

The one he had accepted.

The one that waited not to destroy the world, but to remake it differently, each time someone was brave enough to write what they had seen.

And he knew, somewhere out there, another goblin would find a blank page.

Would find that echo waiting.

Would begin their own story, not with a battle or a theft—

But with a question.

And an ink-stained smile.

The storms did not pass. They grew stranger.

Rain fell sideways on some days, upward on others. It carried no water—only fragments of memory. Tiny, glowing droplets that vanished when touched, but left behind the smell of old paper and candle smoke. Sometimes the wind brought songs no one had written yet, sung by voices that didn’t match any throat. Other times it screamed the names of things long dead and best forgotten.

Through it all, Snaggrel stayed in the chapel.

His hands grew callused from writing. Ink stained the tips of his claws permanently, dark as ash and stubborn as guilt. He no longer slept regularly. He didn’t need to. The Seed within didn’t demand sustenance, but it had altered him in subtle ways. His body remembered time, but no longer obeyed it. Hunger came slowly and left faster. Fatigue flickered like a candle in a storm but never quite settled in.

He wrote not just what happened, but what might. Possibilities laid out like stones across a river, not as prophecy but as warning. Each new arrival brought new pages, and each page added to the quiet pressure building within the walls. Not weight exactly—intention. As if the chapel had grown teeth in the mortar, and breath in the beams.

Others began to report places changing.

Taverns that had never existed suddenly stood at familiar crossroads.

Old books rewritten themselves. Not the text—the facts. Queens who had died centuries ago now lived lives of exile in mountains no one remembered building. Roads bent at odd angles through forests that did not belong on any map.

And in the northeast, an entire town disappeared.

Not ruined. Not razed.

Just... unwritten.

The parchment that recorded its charter turned blank overnight.

Every map redrew itself without prompting.

And the people? No one could say. Because no one could remember their names.

Snaggrel recorded that too.

He used red ink for that entry, though he didn’t know why. It simply felt necessary.

One night, as he pinned another page to the southern wall, the newest witness arrived. Not through the door. Through the ceiling.

She fell with a soft crash of shattered slate and dislodged dust. She stood before anyone could move to help her, brushing herself off. Her hair was silver, not with age, but with decision. She wore a cloak made of what looked like torn covers of burned books, sewn together with strands of metal wire.

“I’ve been looking for you,” she said.

Snaggrel didn’t rise. “Plenty find me when they stop trying to.”

“You’re the first.”

“The first what?”

“The first to choose it,” she said. “Everyone else before was tricked. Trapped. Chosen. You weren’t. You walked in.”

Snaggrel inclined his head. “And you are?”

“An index that refused to be erased.”

That got a chuckle from him. “Fancy way of saying ‘survivor’.”

She smiled, tight and tired. “No. I died. But I remembered my way back.”

There was something in her eyes—something old and burning and sad.

“I’ve seen what’s coming,” she continued. “What you’re building here... it’s not enough.”

“I’m not building anything. I’m just writing what’s true.”

“And the truth is spreading faster than the lies now. That’s the problem.”

Snaggrel blinked slowly. “You’re saying the ink is bleeding too far.”

“I’m saying the stories you’re catching are catching others too. Some aren’t kind. Some never were meant to be read again.”

She stepped closer. “I’m not here to stop you. I’m here to warn you.”

Snaggrel looked up at the wall behind her—the latest page, still drying.

It had no title.

Just a sketch.

A place he didn’t recognize.

Yet.

“I think I already know,” he said.

The woman nodded. “Then you need a map. But not the kind with roads.”

She reached into her cloak and drew out a book. Bound in threadbare leather. No title. No author. Just a single scar across its cover, like it had been clawed by something hungry and reluctant to let go.

“This was written by the first,” she said.

Snaggrel didn’t take it immediately. “The first what?”

“The first who tried to change the end.”

He took it in both hands. It was heavier than it looked. Warm.

He opened it to the first page.

It was blank.

And then, words formed—not inked, not carved, just present.

“A lie told in kindness still leads to fire.”

Snaggrel closed it again.

The woman was already walking back into the dark beyond the altar.

He didn’t stop her.

Some visitors weren’t meant to stay.

That night, he placed the book at the center of the chapel. Not on a shelf. On a pedestal built from old bricks, mortar still wet. He didn’t remember building it. Perhaps the chapel had done it for him.

And in the days that followed, those who came seeking the Watch no longer brought just stories.

They brought questions.

They asked how to bind a page to a name.

They asked how to know when a story was real, and when it was a weapon.

They asked how to unwrite something already read.

Snaggrel had no answers.

But he taught them how to ask better questions.

That was the beginning of the new ink.

It was stronger. Thicker. Heavier.

It clung to the fingers and whispered while you wrote.

It required will to hold it.

But in return, it obeyed.

And slowly, carefully, the Watch began to write not just what had been or might be...

But what must never be again.

They did not call it prophecy.

They called it a warning wall.

Each page was signed by the hand that wrote it.

And those hands shook.

Because every story has a price.

And the Seed, while silent, still pulsed.

Still waited.

Still remembered.

Because that’s what seeds do.

They wait for the page to turn.

And grow where the words are softest.

Chapter Seven: When Paper Burns

The first page burned at dawn. Not by fire, but by revision.

It began with a hiss, like parchment breathing too deeply. The ink on the sheet curled, letters unspooling from their meanings as if frightened by their own shape. Snaggrel watched from across the chapel, unable to move. The page—one of the earliest, written in his own clawed hand—discolored, crinkled inward, and then unwrote itself. No smoke. No flame. Just absence.

By the time he crossed the room, only tattered corners remained on the nail.

He didn’t cry.

But the others noticed.

“What did it say?” asked Mer, the young scriber who'd joined them a month ago from the river city of Brothwick.

Snaggrel stared at the blank space on the wall. “It was about the Hollow,” he said quietly. “A memory I thought couldn’t be moved.”

“Was it wrong?”

“No. It was true. Which means something is changing truth.”

The chapel grew still. Those gathered inside—witnesses, writers, dreamers, former scavengers and seers—all fell into silence. Everyone had feared such a thing might come. They’d written about it. Had dreams shaped like ink-dripping teeth. But to see it in the light of morning was different.

Later that day, a second page vanished. This one from a traveler named Elwan, who had written a three-page account of a city made entirely from breath, where people spoke only in sighs and died when their last word was spoken.

Snaggrel found her sitting at the altar, shaking.

“I felt it,” she said. “Like fingers inside my ribs. Pulling.”

Snaggrel nodded, knelt, and took her hand. “You’re not the only one.”

Over the next five days, nine more pages dissolved. Some overnight. Some mid-sentence. One vanished the moment it was pinned, shriveling before the ink dried. No pattern. No shared theme. Just stories... erased.

They tried protecting them. Wards, mirrored paper, salt rings, iron nails, even burning a page intentionally to see if sacrifice would appease whatever was behind it.

Nothing worked.

Then came the screams.

Not from within the chapel.

From the pages themselves.

Snaggrel was alone when he first heard it, scratching notes into the archive register. It was a wet, cracking sound—like lungs sobbing into dry cloth. He turned, expecting a wounded traveler at the threshold.

Instead, the page titled “The Man Who Wrote in Rain” began to scream.

A single, drawn-out wail, tearing through the chapel like claws down wet glass.

The ink bled.

The paper folded itself and fell.

When he picked it up, it was blank, but warm—like breath had just left it.

From that day forward, they stopped pinning pages on the northern wall.

It was cursed.

Or claimed.

The Watch held a meeting.

Not a council—no one claimed power—but a gathering of those who had written the most, seen the deepest, or dreamed the clearest.

They debated: Was the Seed rebelling? Was it another seed, planted in secrecy, now rooting up truth and devouring it?

Snaggrel sat quietly through most of it. He listened. Then, at the end, he stood and said only this:

“It’s not the Seed. It’s a Reader.”

That changed everything.

A Reader—an old term, older than the Watch—meant someone or something that interacted with story not by observing, but by interpreting. Bending. Shaping. Deciding.

A Reader could devour a tale simply by choosing to.

And a powerful enough Reader could erase what never should have been remembered.

Someone—or something—was reading them.

Snaggrel couldn’t sleep that night.

He walked the chapel long after the others slept, touching pages gently with his fingertips. Each one vibrated faintly, like a taut string. Each one waiting, holding steady—but for how long?

He thought of the seed again, pulsing still in his chest. Faint now. More rhythm than presence. But alive.

He wondered if it knew.

He returned to his table and wrote.

Not a memory. Not a dream.

A letter.

He did not know to whom it was addressed. It began simply:

    *To the one reading this—

    You’ve taken from us. Not once. Many times. Quietly, yes. But not without weight.*

    You consume stories like fire consumes kindling. And we feel the heat in our sleep. The ink burns our fingers now. The walls whisper in paragraphs that were never penned.

    So now we write this for you, not in warning, but in acknowledgment.

    We see you.

    And we will not stop writing.

    If you erase a page, we’ll write two more.

    If you devour a memory, we will dream it again, backwards and louder.

    If you fear truth, you may silence it briefly.

    But the story remembers.

    And we are its hands.

    Sincerely—
    The First Thief, now a Scribe.

He pinned the letter to the center beam of the chapel. No iron nails. Just twine.

He waited until dawn.

And when the sun rose, that letter still hung.

Untouched.

Read.

And left intact.

A single, defiant reply.

The Reader knew they were watching.

And perhaps—for now—it blinked.

Not in defeat.

But in consideration.

The Watch continued.

More came.

More pages were written.

And the northern wall remained bare.

But beside it, they built a mirror—a wall of polished obsidian. Nothing pinned to it. No ink. No scratches. Just reflection.

A space for the Reader.

A place to be seen back.

Because the war was not with blades or fire.

It was with erasure.

And the only way to win...

Was to write louder.

A week passed with no further vanishings.

No screams. No curling parchment. No bleeding ink.

The pages on the southern and eastern walls remained intact, and the scribes began writing again—tentatively at first, then with urgency, as if afraid the quiet might be temporary, a breath held by a great and ancient mouth. They filled page after page with histories, confessions, half-remembered dreams that tasted like someone else’s regrets. But every word was a stone in the foundation. Every phrase a refusal.

The Reader had not struck again.

Yet none believed the war had ended. Silence was not peace. It was a pause. A decision waiting to be unmade.

Snaggrel paced before the mirror wall every night now, staring at his own reflection—sometimes flickering, sometimes blurred—and wondering what the Reader saw in him. A challenge? A warning? A toy?

His reflection never answered. But sometimes... it smirked.

More troubling still were the newcomers.

They no longer arrived frightened, wounded, or bewildered. They came calm. Too calm. Eyes clear, hands steady, stories already written and folded neatly in leather pouches. They asked no questions, demanded no hospitality. They pinned their pages on the walls, bowed, and left.

The first few were treated as wandering scholars. But when the fifth, then the sixth, then the ninth did the same—each offering near-identical stories, wrapped in different names and worlds—Snaggrel grew wary.

They were copies.

Not perfect, but close. Too close.

He pulled their pages and laid them side-by-side on the chapel floor. One was a tale of a merchant who dreamed of wolves and woke as one. Another was about a tower where every window led to the same sunset. Another told of a city that aged backward each night. Different details. But the same shape. The same cadence. The same rhythm.

He had written enough now to feel the bones of a story.

And these were artificial.

Fabricated.

“Counter-ink,” Mer muttered, kneeling beside him. “Stories written to look like memory. But hollow inside.”

“Designed to confuse,” Snaggrel said. “Or distract.”

“From what?”

Snaggrel looked up at the obsidian wall. “From whatever it doesn’t want us to see.”

The mirror offered no reply.

He burned the pages that night.

Not as censorship, but as cleansing. As if by fire, he could scrape the lie from the Watch’s memory.

But when the flames died, he found something in the ash.

A single word, burned into the stone beneath the brazier.

“Retold.”

Not “written.” Not “dreamed.” Just retold.

Echoed. Echoed too well.

That was the Reader’s trick.

Not erasing the story.

Replacing it.

Changing the tellers, not the tale.

Snaggrel wrote through the night. He penned feverishly—no edits, no breaks—only truth, jagged and imperfect. He wrote about the Hollow again, not as it had been, but as it couldn’t be retold. The smell of a particular fungus only found under the bone-root trees. The way Grub used to gnash his teeth when nervous, even in his sleep. The cursed joke about three goblins and a dead mule that only made sense if you knew exactly how the mayor of Brashford had died.

Details too small to fake.

Too broken to replicate.

When he finished, he pinned the page at the top of the western wall—an area untouched by Readers or echoes.

And waited.

Three days passed.

On the third night, the mirror trembled.

Just once.

No shatter. No voice.

Just a ripple.

As if something behind it had taken a step closer.

And then it left.

Snaggrel slept that night for the first time in weeks.

When he woke, the page still hung.

Untouched.

He gathered the Watch.

Not just the scribes of the chapel, but those from the outposts and other sanctums. They came by caravan, on foot, even in pairs of crows that shifted back into people when no one looked directly at them.

Snaggrel stood before the full hall and spoke.

“The Reader’s not afraid of truth,” he said. “It feeds on it. But it chokes on imperfection. On honesty too small to polish. Stories that contradict themselves. Voices too messy to echo clean.”

He held up a fresh sheet of parchment.

“We stop it by writing like liars who remember too much. Not with polish. With pain. With details. With the grit between truth’s teeth.”

The Watch didn’t cheer. That wasn’t their way.

But the scribes picked up their pens.

That day, they wrote stories about hangnails and broken shoelaces, about half-forgotten arguments over soup, about a man who claimed he’d invented dust. They wrote about goblins who made promises they couldn’t keep, about dead friends whose voices stayed in the walls, about wounds that didn’t bleed but itch.

Not poetic.

Not grand.

But unmistakably real.

And none of those pages ever burned.

In time, others followed the method. They called it fracture writing—embedding flaws, contradictions, off-rhythms and counterbeats to make the text resistant to consumption.

The Reader grew quiet again.

But never gone.

Snaggrel could feel it.

Waiting.

Observing.

Maybe even learning.

So he changed tactics again.

He wrote the Reader into the stories.

Wrote it poorly.

Gave it a limp.

A bad accent.

A habit of blinking too often.

He called it “The Thing That Wanted to Listen but Never Learned to Care.”

He pinned it on the front wall, in bold ink, with his name signed below.

That page stayed.

Unburned.

Unread.

Feared.

The war was still on.

But for now, the story was theirs.

And the scribe-thief, once destined to steal a Crystal, now rewrote the rules one page at a time.

The war, if that’s what it was, had become quieter. But not safer.

The Reader no longer burned pages openly, no longer bled ink across the chapel’s walls or erased stories mid-word. It had learned restraint. It had shifted tactics. Like any good predator, it adapted when its prey fought back.

Snaggrel felt this change in
