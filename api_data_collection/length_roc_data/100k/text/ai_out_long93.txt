Chapter One: The Swing

It started with the swing.

The sun beat down over the cracked blacktop of Meadowrun Elementary, gleaming off the silver chain links and the faded red seat that dangled, just slightly crooked, from the iron A-frame. The swing creaked with the wind, as if aware of its own status. The last swing. The only one not already occupied.

Jude got there first—or at least, he claimed he did.

“No way, I touched it first,” he said, his hand gripping one of the chains as if his life depended on it. He was wiry, all elbows and sharp knees, with a mop of black hair that looked like it hadn’t seen a comb in a week.

Toby, taller but softer, with freckles sprayed across his nose like confetti, stood his ground. “You saw me coming. I was running. It’s not fair if you just cut in like that.”

“Doesn’t matter,” Jude said. “You let go, I win.”

Toby narrowed his eyes. “You didn’t even want it until you saw I was going for it.”

Jude shrugged, shifting his weight and dragging the swing just enough to make it squeal. “Now I do. Too bad.”

A wind kicked up, bringing with it the scent of cut grass and sun-warmed mulch. From the other side of the playground, the jungle gym kids shouted something incomprehensible, their laughter sharp and distant like birds overhead.

“You’re such a jerk,” Toby muttered.

“And you’re too slow,” Jude replied, not unkindly.

Behind them, a teacher's whistle blew once—shrill and authoritative. Neither boy moved.

“You can’t just claim it every day,” Toby said. “That’s not how this works.”

“Oh yeah?” Jude turned, locking eyes with him. “Then let’s make it a game. Winner gets the swing for the rest of recess. Deal?”

“What kind of game?”

A pause. Jude’s grin was slow and calculated. “Race around the monkey bars, jump over the sandbox, touch the basketball pole, then back here. Fastest one wins.”

Toby considered. “You always win races.”

“Not always. You beat me last week.”

“Only ‘cause you tripped.”

“Still counts.” Jude held out his hand.

After a beat, Toby shook it.

They ran. And for a while, it was just the thrill of competition, legs pumping, hearts thudding, shoes pounding dirt and concrete. But it didn’t end with the race. That moment, in the heat of a June afternoon, ignited something that neither of them could see yet. Something that would stretch far beyond the swing set.

It would take them through summer, into secrets and shadows, into woods they weren’t supposed to enter, and down paths that adults never talked about.

But for now, it was just the swing.

Chapter Two: Rules and Rumors

Toby’s backyard was bigger than Jude’s, with a half-rotted treehouse they never used and a fence that leaned like it was tired of standing. That summer, they spent most afternoons there, lying on the grass, sipping melted cherry popsicles from plastic tubes, talking about the stuff no one else ever seemed to notice.

“Did you hear about the Vanishings?” Jude asked one day, midsummer.

Toby blinked. “What?”

“The Vanishings,” Jude said again, more slowly, as if that explained it. “My brother says three kids disappeared last year. Like, totally gone. No trace.”

“That’s just one of his stories.”

“No, seriously. One of them lived on Clover Lane. Two streets over.”

Toby hesitated. “If that’s true, why didn’t we hear about it before?”

Jude’s eyes lit up. “Because the adults keep it secret. They don’t want us to be scared. But I think—” he lowered his voice dramatically, “—I think it has something to do with the woods.”

The woods sat beyond the soccer field, a stretch of thick pines and moss-covered stones. Kids told stories about them all the time—about eyes in the dark, old ghosts, a creature called “Whistler” that no one had actually seen. It was the kind of place you dared someone else to go into but never went yourself.

“You’re just trying to freak me out,” Toby said.

Jude shrugged. “Maybe. But what if I’m right?”

That question sat between them for days.

And when Jude dared Toby to go with him—to sneak out late and go past the soccer field, into the edge of the trees—it was less about belief and more about curiosity. A dare. A test.

They met at midnight, flashlights in hand, pockets full of Oreos and walkie-talkies they barely knew how to use.

“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Toby whispered.

“Too late to back out now,” Jude grinned.

The woods were louder than expected. Not with animals—there were no birds, no frogs, not even the buzz of mosquitos. Just wind and leaves and the soft crack of twigs underfoot.

They didn’t get far the first night. Maybe twenty minutes in before Toby swore he saw something—someone—watching them from behind a fallen log. They ran all the way back to the edge of the field, breathless and pale.

But they didn’t stop going back.

Each night, they went a little deeper.

Chapter Three: The Door in the Hill

Three weeks later, they found the door.

It wasn’t like a normal door. It had no frame, no house or cabin around it. It was just… there. Embedded into the side of a mossy hill, a square of dark iron with a handle so rusted it looked like it would fall off at a touch.

“Holy crap,” Jude said, brushing dirt away. “This is like—like Narnia or something.”

Toby stared at it. “Should we open it?”

“I mean, obviously.”

But when they tried, the door didn’t budge. Locked. Or sealed.

For two nights, they returned with different tools—a crowbar, a wrench, even one of Jude’s mom’s metal knitting needles. Nothing worked. Then, on the third night, Toby touched it again and felt a vibration, low and humming, like the door had suddenly recognized him.

It clicked.

Jude looked at him. “You did that.”

“I didn’t—” Toby began, but then the door began to open.

Inside was darkness. Real darkness. The kind that didn’t just lack light but seemed to swallow it. Their flashlights flickered. The batteries weren’t dead, but the beams dimmed the moment they crossed the threshold.

Toby hesitated. “Maybe we shouldn’t.”

Jude had already stepped inside.

The air was cold. Too cold. The moment Toby followed, his breath fogged out in front of him.

The tunnel sloped down—dirt walls braced with rotting beams, ancient symbols scratched into the wood. The further they went, the more the walls shimmered, like something behind them was watching.

Then the whispering started.

It didn’t make sense—not at first. Just snatches of sound. A phrase here. A word. Names. Some they knew. Some they didn’t.

“Toby… Jude… come further…”

Chapter Four: The Broken Circle

What lay at the bottom of the tunnel was worse than either of them had imagined.

It was a chamber, round, with symbols drawn in salt or ash—lines intersecting, circles nested inside each other, broken by foot scuffs and years of disuse. In the center was something covered by a tarp.

Jude approached it.

“Don’t,” Toby said. “We should go.”

But Jude didn’t stop.

He pulled back the tarp and revealed a mirror. No frame. No backing. Just a sheet of glass—polished, but rippling slightly like water under glass.

In it, their reflections didn’t match.

Toby’s heart leapt. “That’s not us.”

Jude took a step back. In the mirror, his reflection smiled, though he did not.

“Okay, yeah, we’re leaving,” he said.

But behind them, the tunnel had changed. Where once there was a sloping dirt path, now stood a flat wall of stone.

No way back.

Jude won the race. Barely. By the time he slapped his hand against the steel pole at the edge of the basketball court and skidded to a stop beside the swing, he was panting, red-faced, his shirt stuck to his back. Toby came in seconds later, a step behind, and dropped to the dirt, breathing hard.

“That was cheating,” Toby managed between gasps.

“I won fair,” Jude said, not unkindly. “Don’t be a sore loser.”

Toby looked up at him, brushing gravel from his palms. “You cut the sandbox corner.”

“I jumped it. That was part of the rules.”

“You jumped into it,” Toby muttered, “then ran through the middle.”

Jude shrugged, already pulling himself into the swing. The chains groaned as his weight settled in. He kicked once, then again, gaining height with each pump of his legs. Toby watched him, still seated on the ground, and for a long moment neither spoke.

The bell rang in the distance, too far off to be urgent yet. The teachers gave them five-minute warnings before they corralled everyone back inside, and even then, they usually gave the stragglers some leeway. It was June. Everyone was checked out.

“You ever wonder why there’s only three swings?” Toby asked, finally standing and brushing dust from his shorts. “There’s like thirty kids here.”

Jude tilted his head, slowing the swing with his feet. “Budget cuts. Or some kid cracked their head open and their mom sued.”

“That’s grim.”

Jude grinned. “It’s what my brother says.”

“Your brother says a lot of stuff,” Toby replied, stepping beside the swing and giving it a push. Jude let it carry him.

“He’s not wrong. He told me last year about Mr. Sutton getting fired for sleeping in the janitor’s closet. No one believed him, but then Mr. Sutton was just gone one day.”

“Maybe he retired.”

“Retired with a bottle of scotch and a traffic cone pillow,” Jude said, and they both laughed.

That was the thing with Jude. Even when he lied—or exaggerated or made things up in that half-believing way of his—there was always some strange glint in his eye that made you want to believe him anyway. Not because it made sense, but because it made the world feel bigger.

Their laughter faded as the playground emptied out, one teacher at a time calling students into lines. Jude hopped off the swing, landing with a skid, and began walking with his hands in his pockets. Toby followed, not quite ready to let go of the summer smell in the air, the lingering warmth on the back of his neck.

“Next time,” Toby said, “I get the swing.”

Jude didn’t look back. “Only if you win.”

Toby grinned, already planning a route with fewer shortcuts.

That afternoon, the clouds rolled in fast—thick and silver, flashing with distant thunder. By the time they got out of school, the sky had darkened to the color of bruised plums, and the air smelled heavy, like metal and wet leaves. Toby’s mom picked them up in her station wagon and dropped Jude at his street corner before heading home.

“You coming over later?” Toby called out the window.

Jude nodded, shouldering his backpack. “After dinner!”

Back at Toby’s house, the air conditioner droned quietly in the living room. He dropped his bag, peeled off his shoes, and headed to the fridge for something cold. The house was still, his mom upstairs on a conference call, the radio playing soft jazz from the kitchen.

He poured himself a glass of lemonade and stood by the back window, watching the clouds gather over the line of trees behind their fence. They weren’t regular clouds. Not storm clouds. These moved too fast, like something was pushing them from behind. And for a moment—just a second—he thought he saw something flicker along the tree line.

Not lightning.

Something darker. Moving.

A blink, and it was gone.

He rubbed his eyes, then shook his head. Probably a trick of the light. He turned from the window, grabbed a packet of cookies, and went upstairs.

That night, Jude arrived late, soaked from the sudden downpour that hit just after sunset. His hair was plastered to his forehead, shirt clinging to his skinny frame. He grinned like it didn’t bother him.

“Dude, you look like you swam here.”

“Pretty much did. Can I borrow a shirt?”

Toby tossed him an old soccer tee, and they settled in his room, playing video games until the storm knocked the power out halfway through a match. They sat in the sudden silence, the room lit only by flashes of lightning from outside. The thunder followed seconds later.

“Your house ever lose power before?” Jude asked.

“Sometimes. Comes back on pretty quick.”

“This storm’s weird,” Jude said. “Like, too fast. Like it’s not even moving across, just… hovering.”

“Don’t say hovering like that,” Toby said. “You’re going to freak me out.”

Jude smirked, but his voice lowered. “Seriously. Something’s wrong with it. You ever hear of heat storms?”

“Yeah. But this isn’t that. This is…” Toby trailed off as another bolt of lightning cracked overhead, bright enough to silhouette the room.

Jude stood, walked to the window. His shoulders tensed.

“What?” Toby asked, coming up beside him.

“Look.”

Beyond the backyard, just past the broken treehouse and the overgrown rose bushes, the woods loomed. And in the brief flash of light, both of them saw it—something tall, too tall, moving behind the trees. It didn’t walk. It didn’t run. It seemed to glide.

Then the darkness returned.

Toby backed away from the window. “What was that?”

“I don’t know,” Jude said, but his face was pale. “It looked like it was watching.”

“Maybe it was a tree.”

“Trees don’t watch.”

The room was too quiet. Even the storm outside seemed to pause.

Then the wind picked up again, and a long, high whistle echoed through the walls—not like wind through cracks. It had a pitch. A rhythm. A sound like someone calling. Calling a name.

“Did you hear that?” Toby whispered.

Jude nodded.

Neither of them said what they were thinking.

Not out loud.

The next morning, the sun was out again. The air smelled of wet soil and worms, and the sky was cloudless, bright with the kind of washed-out blue that comes after a storm has scrubbed everything clean.

At school, no one else seemed to have seen anything. No one mentioned the whistle, or the movement in the trees. Even the teachers looked fresher, less tired, like nothing unusual had happened.

“You think it was a dream?” Toby asked as they sat on the swings during recess again.

Jude shook his head. “We both saw it.”

“So now what?”

“We find out what it was.”

“That sounds like a terrible idea.”

Jude leaned back in the swing, letting it rock gently. “Terrible ideas make the best stories.”

Toby looked past the edge of the playground, where the grass dipped and the forest began, stretching into places maps didn’t bother to show. He swallowed hard.

“Then I guess we’re writing one.”

Jude smiled.

And the wind, soft this time, curled around them like a whisper from the trees.

Chapter Two: The Rules of the Forest

The forest had always been there. For as long as anyone could remember, it sat behind the schoolyard and beyond the rows of low-slung houses with peeling paint and crooked mailboxes. It was the kind of place every kid in Meadowrun grew up hearing warnings about. Don’t go past the fence. Don’t follow the deer trail. Don’t climb over the rocks with the orange lichen. There were always rules. Spoken, unspoken, and half-whispered during sleepovers when flashlights were the only thing keeping the dark at bay.

Toby had never broken those rules. Not really. He’d stood on the edge once or twice, dared by other boys in his class to take a few steps in, maybe to grab a stick or a dropped ball. But he’d never gone beyond the first trees. Never followed the little path that twisted out of sight. Never let himself wonder too hard what lay past the place where the light started to shift and the air smelled more like copper than pine.

But Jude had. Or at least, he said he had. Half the time, Toby didn’t believe him.

“It’s not bad in there,” Jude insisted the next day after school, balancing on the cracked curb outside Toby’s house. “It’s quiet. And weird. But not scary. You just have to know what you’re doing.”

“How would you know what you’re doing?”

Jude shrugged and flipped a pebble with the toe of his shoe. “There are rules. I found them.”

Toby narrowed his eyes. “Found them where?”

“In a book,” Jude said. “In the library.”

Toby waited.

Jude finally relented. “Okay, not in a real book. More like… scribbled in one of the old encyclopedias. Someone wrote them in the margins.”

“That sounds fake.”

Jude pulled a crumpled sheet from his pocket. The writing was faint, smudged by time and humidity, the kind of messy penmanship that could have belonged to a kid or a lunatic. The list was numbered, but only some lines were still legible.

    Never enter alone

    Don’t speak your full name aloud

    If you hear the bells, walk backward until the sound fades

    Avoid looking at reflections after dusk

    Leave an offering if you take anything

    Don't eat anything that wasn’t yours to begin with

    Always leave before the second sunset

Toby read the list twice. “This is a joke.”

“Maybe,” Jude said, stuffing it back in his pocket. “But someone wrote it for a reason. And I think it explains the Vanishings.”

Toby sighed. “You’re still on about that?”

“I saw something last night, man. You did too.”

“We saw something weird. That doesn’t mean we should go marching into the woods like—like we’re in some movie.”

“You want to spend the rest of summer sitting on your butt playing video games?”

“Yes,” Toby said instantly.

But that night, when the cicadas screamed louder than usual and the wind rattled the gutters like bones in a jar, he found himself pacing by his window, wondering if Jude was already out there. Wondering if he’d go without him. Wondering what that would mean.

He texted Jude at 11:43 PM. You up?

The reply came two minutes later. Meet me at the old fence. Bring a flashlight and something shiny.

The fence was older than it looked. Rust had eaten through parts of the chain-link, and ivy crawled over the poles like a net of snakes. Toby crouched beside a bent section near the far soccer goal, breathing fast, flashlight gripped tight.

Jude emerged from the trees a moment later, flashlight beam bouncing wildly.

“Did you bring something shiny?” he asked.

Toby fished into his pocket and produced a quarter and a plastic keychain shaped like a dragon.

Jude nodded. “Good enough.”

He held up a bobby pin wrapped in tin foil. “I made this. Hope it counts.”

“What are we even doing?” Toby asked. “Seriously.”

Jude looked at him, and for a rare moment, all the bravado was gone. “I need to know.”

“Know what?”

“Why that thing was watching us. Why there’s rules. Why people vanish.”

Toby stared at him, heart pounding. Then he nodded once.

They stepped through the break in the fence.

The trees swallowed sound almost instantly. One moment they could hear the distant whir of cars and porch lights humming behind them, and the next it was just wind, leaves, and the soft crunch of their sneakers on damp ground.

Jude led the way, weaving through roots and ducking under low-hanging branches. The flashlight beams barely reached beyond ten feet, swallowed whole by the foliage. Every now and then, they passed a stone, flat and wide, covered in moss and strange markings. Once, Toby saw something nailed to a tree—a small wooden token, carved with a symbol like an open eye.

“Did you see that?” he whispered.

“Yeah,” Jude said, voice tight. “Don’t touch it.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t know. Just don’t.”

They pressed on.

It was hard to tell how far they’d gone. The forest didn’t seem to follow normal rules. The path twisted in on itself, and Toby swore they passed the same stone twice, though from different directions. His flashlight flickered once, then again, though the batteries were new.

“I don’t like this,” he whispered.

Jude didn’t answer. He was staring ahead, toward a break in the trees where something shimmered.

It looked like water at first. Then like glass. A narrow pool, stretching like a ribbon between two slopes. The surface was perfectly still, and something about it tugged at Toby’s stomach.

“We shouldn’t be here,” he said.

“We’re already here,” Jude replied, stepping forward.

Toby grabbed his arm. “Wait. What if this is what the rules meant?”

Jude looked down at the pool. “Reflections after dusk.”

“Don’t look,” Toby said.

But it was too late.

Jude froze.

Toby followed his gaze and saw their reflections—only not quite. The boys in the water weren’t moving the same way. Jude’s reflection was still grinning, eyes darker than they should’ve been. And Toby’s was mouthing something. A word he couldn’t hear. A word he didn’t want to hear.

He yanked Jude back.

The moment they broke eye contact, the spell shattered. The air snapped, the trees shifted, and a cold breeze blew through them like a whisper of breath on the back of the neck.

They didn’t run. They didn’t speak. They walked back, fast and silent, hearts thudding like war drums, until they reached the edge of the trees.

The fence was where they left it.

But the stars overhead were wrong.

Toby didn’t sleep that night. He lay in bed, eyes on the ceiling, ears straining for any sound. His flashlight sat under his pillow, turned off but close. His backpack, with the rule list now folded into one of the smaller pockets, sat zipped tight by the door. The reflection haunted him. The way it had moved, the way it had smiled—there was something inside that forest. Something older than them. Older than the town.

He didn’t know the rules. Not all of them. Not yet. But he was starting to believe they were real.

The next morning, everything looked normal. The streets were dry. The birds chirped. Toby’s mom hummed while packing his lunch. But when he met Jude outside, the boy’s face was pale, eyes rimmed in shadow like he hadn’t slept either.

“We weren’t gone long, were we?” Jude asked.

“I don’t think so.”

“Then why was the moon higher when we came back?”

Toby didn’t have an answer.

Neither of them said anything more until school started.

And even then, they avoided the windows.

They didn’t want to see if anything was watching.

The days that followed were ordinary in the way dreams sometimes are—real enough to believe in, yet off in ways that couldn't be named. Toby noticed small things first. The hallway clocks at school ticked slower. The air around the playground felt colder in the morning, even though the forecast showed sun and rising temperatures. Mrs. Delaney, the art teacher, was absent three days in a row, and when she returned, she seemed confused, calling students by the wrong names, mixing up colors, staring too long out the windows.

Jude acted like everything was the same. He still played kickball with a crooked grin, still leaned too far back in his chair during math, still passed Toby notes that were more doodle than message. But something in his eyes was different. Brighter, but not in a good way. More intense. Like he was listening for something no one else could hear.

Toby asked him one afternoon, behind the gym while they waited for pickup.

“What’s going on with you?”

Jude shrugged. “Nothing.”

“You’ve been weird since the woods.”

Jude didn’t deny it. He picked at the frayed hem of his sleeve, then looked up at Toby. “You heard the whispering, right? That night?”

Toby nodded, slowly.

“I keep hearing it,” Jude said, voice low. “At night. Sometimes in the morning. Sometimes even in class.”

Toby’s stomach knotted. “Like... voices?”

“Like they’re trying to say something important. But they’re too far away.”

“Maybe it’s just... the wind. Or you imagined it.”

Jude didn’t smile. “I didn’t imagine anything. You saw what I saw. That reflection. It wasn’t us.”

“I know,” Toby said quietly.

They didn’t say anything else for a while. Buses groaned in the distance, the afternoon sun long and golden across the pavement.

Then Jude said, “We need to go back.”

Toby turned sharply. “What? No. No, we don’t. That’s the opposite of what we should do.”

“There’s something there,” Jude continued. “Something we’re supposed to find. Or stop. Or understand. I think that’s why the rules exist. Not to keep us out. To show us how to go further without getting—” He hesitated. “Without getting taken.”

Toby shook his head. “That’s crazy. We got lucky last time. We don’t even know what could’ve happened if we stayed longer.”

“We have to learn more.”

“No,” Toby said, louder than he intended. “We don’t. You want to play with ghosts and shadows and rules written in someone’s old notebook, fine. But I’m done.”

Jude looked hurt. For the first time since they'd met, his bravado cracked, and beneath it was someone who looked less like the fearless explorer and more like a kid trying to make sense of something too big to hold.

“Okay,” he said, softly. “I get it.”

Toby turned away. “Good.”

But Toby didn’t sleep that night, either. The whispering came back—faint, brushing his ears like moth wings. Only now it sounded closer. Like it was moving. Like it was searching. He pressed his hands to his ears, buried his head beneath his pillow, but the words pushed through like water through cloth.

Find the names.

That’s what it said. Over and over.

Find the names.

The next morning, Toby found himself wandering the nonfiction aisle of the school library, trailing his fingers along the spines without knowing what he was looking for. The space felt colder than the rest of the school, the air heavier with dust. He rounded a corner and stopped in front of the encyclopedias.

They were ancient, their red bindings cracked and faded. One volume leaned awkwardly, a page sticking out from between its covers. Toby pulled it free. Volume N.

Inside, scribbled in dark blue ink, was the same handwriting as the rules Jude had shown him. The page wasn’t about forests or mythology. It was about names—specifically, naming conventions in old European cultures, and the power names held in certain traditions. Beside a paragraph about Norse rituals, someone had written:

If it knows your full name, it can take your skin.

Toby slammed the book shut.

He didn’t tell Jude.

He meant to. He almost texted him twice that afternoon. But he didn’t want to give Jude ammunition. He didn’t want to be dragged deeper. Still, the words sat in his mind like stones in his pockets, heavy and impossible to ignore.

That night, the voice came again.

This time, it didn’t whisper.

It called.

Not in his ear. Not in the wind. But from the backyard.

He stood at the window, heart pounding, his hands cold. The treehouse swayed gently in a wind that didn’t touch the grass below. Beyond the swing set, past the fence, the woods were waiting. Still and thick with shadow.

Then something stepped into view.

Not a person. Not exactly. It had legs and arms and a face, but it wasn’t shaped right. Too tall, joints too loose, head slightly tilted like it didn’t understand how to wear its features. And it smiled. Just once. A twitch of the mouth like something trying to imitate a grin it had seen only in dreams.

Toby dropped to the floor.

He crawled backward, not daring to scream. Not daring to look again. He huddled against his closet door, flashlight in hand, until morning bled through the blinds and the birds began to sing.

“I changed my mind,” he told Jude at recess.

Jude blinked. “About what?”

“We need to go back.”

Jude didn’t ask why. He only nodded.

They met again that night, earlier this time. They brought supplies—two flashlights each, a compass from Jude’s dad’s old tackle box, a water bottle, and salt in a sandwich bag. They each wore backpacks and didn’t joke. Not once.

Before they stepped through the fence, Jude stopped and looked at him. “You sure?”

“No,” Toby said. “But I don’t think it matters anymore.”

The forest accepted them.

The air was colder than last time. The path shifted quickly, winding tight like a noose, and the light thinned faster than it should have. By the time they reached the pool again, the sky above was gone entirely, hidden beneath a canopy so thick it seemed more like ceiling than trees.

The water was still.

They didn’t look into it.

They turned left, past a ring of mushrooms Toby swore hadn’t been there before. Their stalks were dark, almost purple, and gave off a faint shimmer when the flashlights passed over them.

The ground sloped up.

At the top of the hill was a clearing.

And in the center of the clearing stood a stone structure.

It wasn’t big—maybe six feet across, circular, like a well or a broken fountain. Vines curled over the lip of the stone. Symbols were carved into the rim, each one faded, but familiar. Toby recognized a few from the rules page.

Jude stepped forward and placed the foil-wrapped bobby pin on the edge. Toby added his coin.

Nothing happened.

Then the air shifted. The wind pulled inward, toward the stone ring, like it was sucking the forest’s breath. The leaves rustled backward. And from the center of the stone, a low hum began.

They backed away.

The hum rose, shaping itself into syllables. A language neither of them knew, but understood. A command. A summons.

From the trees, figures began to emerge.

Not human. Not animals. Shapes in between. One with legs that bent backward. One that walked on hands. One that dragged something behind it like a second body. They moved slowly, reverently, like drawn by a church bell.

Jude grabbed Toby’s arm.

“We need to go.”

Toby’s mouth was dry. “It’s too late.”

The clearing had closed behind them. The path gone. The air too heavy to breathe.

The stone glowed now. Not bright, but deep—an inner light like coal still burning under ash.

Then a voice—not a whisper, but the same one from the backyard, from the water, from the book—spoke, louder now, shaped by wind and dark.

“Speak your name.”

Neither boy moved.

“Speak. Or be named.”

Jude opened his mouth.

Toby shoved him. “No!”

The light flared.

And something stepped from inside the stone.

Chapter Three: The Name-Eater

The thing that rose from the stone circle was not a creature, not in the way that word usually meant. It was presence. A shape built from shadow and light, moving wrong in all the ways something could move wrong—too fluid, too silent, and somehow too aware. It had no face, not really, but there were impressions where eyes should be. Impressions that glowed faintly, like candlelight pressed through thin cloth. It didn’t walk. It didn’t float. It just was, first inside the stone circle, and then outside of it, without stepping.

Toby felt it before he saw it. A pressure in his chest, like being underwater too long. His ears popped, his vision blurred at the edges, and something cold crept down his spine like melted ice. Beside him, Jude stood frozen, lips parted, his breath fogging in the air.

The voice spoke again, and this time it didn’t just vibrate the clearing—it pierced through them.

“Speak your name.”

The figures in the trees—those impossible, bent, dragging things—had gone still. Watching. Waiting. Like an audience awaiting a performer’s next move.

Toby’s mind raced. The rules. Don’t speak your full name aloud. He hadn’t. Not yet. But Jude—Jude had always been too bold, too curious, too reckless.

“Don’t,” Toby whispered, his voice dry. “Don’t say anything.”

“I—I have to,” Jude whispered back. “It’s asking. If we don’t—”

“It’s a trick. That’s what it does.”

But the pressure was building. The thing drew closer, and the air itself grew heavy with expectation. Toby’s head rang with a dozen fractured thoughts. The list in the encyclopedia. The shimmer in the water. The reflection smiling when they hadn’t.

He turned to Jude and grabbed his arm. “If we speak our names, we lose something. It takes something. Maybe everything.”

“Then what do we do?”

Toby swallowed. His mouth felt packed with cotton. “We run.”

Jude hesitated just a second too long, and the thing moved—or perhaps the space between them shrank. Toby felt heat and cold all at once, and something like a hand grazed the side of his face, though when he turned, there was nothing there.

He yanked Jude, and together they ran.

It felt like moving through molasses. The forest resisted them. Trees bent the wrong way, roots shifted to catch their feet. The wind screamed in reverse. Behind them, the voice rose again, this time not demanding—but angry.

“YOU ARE NAMED.”

Toby stumbled but didn’t fall. Jude’s fingers clutched his sleeve, tight and desperate. The clearing faded behind them, but not the feeling. Not the watching. Every step was like pushing against a tide of invisible arms, grasping, clawing, pleading.

And then, suddenly, they were out.

The forest spat them onto the grass behind the soccer field, the night sky above them ordinary again, pierced with familiar stars. They both fell to their knees, gasping, Jude coughing so hard it made his ribs rattle. For a while, they didn’t speak.

Toby sat up first. “Are you okay?”

Jude nodded, but too fast. His eyes were wide. His hands shook. He looked smaller somehow, hunched into himself, like he had been emptied out.

“You didn’t say your name,” Toby said. “Right?”

“I—I almost did,” Jude whispered. “It felt like—like it was pulling it out of me. Like it already knew.”

Toby didn’t reply. He stared at the woods, darker than they had ever looked before.

“We’re not supposed to go back,” Jude added. “Ever again.”

Toby nodded.

But he didn’t believe that was the end.

For three days, they avoided each other. It wasn’t planned. It just happened. Jude didn’t show up in the mornings to walk to school. He wasn’t in his usual spot at lunch. Toby didn’t try to find him. He couldn’t. Something about that night had created a space between them, a fracture neither of them knew how to cross. And yet, the forest lingered—on the edge of dreams, in the stillness between classes, in the way their classmates’ faces blurred if Toby stared too long.

He saw things, now.

Small things.

Like the janitor’s shadow moving when the man was still.

Like the lunch lady’s eyes reflecting light the wrong way.

Like the reflection in the hallway mirror not blinking at the same time he did.

By the fourth day, Toby found a mark on his shoulder, shaped like a spiral. Faint. Red. Like a bruise that never fully surfaced. It didn’t hurt. But it pulsed sometimes, as if it remembered something he didn’t.

That same day, a substitute came to class. Mr. Cleary, the regular teacher, had taken a sudden leave of absence.

“He got sick,” someone whispered.

“No,” another said, “he forgot who he was.”

Toby didn’t want to ask how they knew that.

The summer break started early.

The school claimed flooding had damaged the basement, and mold had gotten into the walls. Parents received notices and emails. The local paper printed a half-page article full of bureaucratic explanations. But Jude and Toby knew better.

The forest was pushing back.

“You said it knew your name,” Toby said when he finally saw Jude again.

They met behind the old library downtown, in the shade of the brick wall where kids once played four-square. Jude looked thinner, his eyes ringed in gray, his hands jammed deep into his hoodie pockets despite the heat.

“It didn’t take it,” Jude said. “But I think it marked me.”

“I think it marked both of us.”

Toby showed him the spiral on his shoulder.

Jude flinched. “Same spot,” he said, lifting his sleeve to reveal an identical mark.

“What does it mean?”

“I think we were chosen,” Jude replied, voice hollow. “Or maybe we trespassed. Broke a boundary.”

Toby frowned. “Then why hasn’t it come for us?”

“I don’t know,” Jude said. “Maybe it’s waiting.”

They tried to act normal. Played video games. Rode their bikes to the gas station for candy. Talked about movies and books and nothing important. But the forest was always there. Waiting. And it wasn’t done.

One afternoon, mid-July, a boy named Calvin Brenner disappeared. He lived three streets over. Quiet, bookish, twelve years old. Last seen walking his dog near the forest’s edge. The dog came back alone.

No one mentioned the Vanishings this time. No one called it that. But Toby knew. Jude knew. The same quiet panic returned to their town like an old song stuck on repeat. Parents kept kids inside. Lights stayed on longer at night. Doors were double-locked.

That night, the spiral on Toby’s shoulder burned.

He woke gasping, a copper taste in his mouth, the whisper back in full force.

Find the names.

Return what was taken.

He didn’t know what it meant.

Not yet.

But he knew it was time to stop hiding.

The next morning, he went to Jude’s house. He didn’t bother with the doorbell. He climbed the tree beside the porch and knocked on the second-floor window until Jude opened it, bleary-eyed.

“We’re going back,” Toby said.

Jude blinked. “I thought we said—”

“It doesn’t matter what we said. It’s not over. It’s never been over.”

Jude stared at him for a long time. Then he nodded.

“I’ll pack the salt.”

They left just after sundown, when the sky was still streaked with orange and the streetlights hadn’t quite flickered on. Their parents thought they were at each other’s houses, a trick they had used before, one that worked so well neither family ever called to check. Toby had his backpack, stuffed with a flashlight, salt, matches, the old rule list, and the library photocopy about names. Jude brought the compass again, along with a notebook, a pencil, and a pocketknife that had belonged to his grandfather.

This time, they didn’t joke. They didn’t even speak as they walked the path that led behind the soccer field. The fence loomed ahead, broken links curled like jagged teeth. For a moment, Toby hesitated. The spiral on his shoulder itched. The last thing they’d seen in the forest still flickered behind his eyes—the impossible figure that had stepped from the stone ring, the way it had spoken without moving lips, the way it had asked to be named.

“Last chance to turn around,” Jude said. His voice was calm, but not casual. There was no bravado in it. Just quiet finality.

Toby looked at the fence. Then the forest beyond it. He took a breath, held it, and stepped through.

The air inside was immediately colder. Not the kind of cold that made your teeth chatter, but something that sank into your skin and made your blood feel slower. The path seemed different this time—narrower, more twisted, as though the forest itself had changed shape. Trees leaned in toward the center like eavesdropping giants, their leaves too still, their branches swaying without wind.

“I brought chalk,” Jude said after they’d walked for ten minutes. “I’m going to mark the trees this time.”

“Smart,” Toby said. “Use symbols, not letters. Just in case.”

Jude gave a small nod. He drew the first symbol—two intersecting triangles—on a low branch as they passed. They walked in silence, stopping every so often to mark another.

The further they went, the more warped things became. The dirt was softer, almost spongy, and their shoes left no prints. The trees had knotholes shaped like eyes, and some of them dripped sap the color of ink. A fox watched them from behind a tree. Its eyes were human-shaped. It did not blink.

“I think it’s changing us,” Toby said quietly. “Not just watching. Changing.”

“How?”

“I don’t know. But this place—it bends things. Maybe even people.”

They came to the pool again, though it looked different this time. Wider. The surface still shimmered like glass, but it reflected a sky they couldn’t see, one filled with two moons and a red streak like a bleeding comet. They skirted it carefully. Neither looked in.

Then the trail dipped, and they found the clearing again.

The stone ring was there, just as they’d left it. But the offerings were gone. The coin, the foil bobby pin, the dragon keychain. Nothing remained. Only the ring itself, and the spirals carved deep into the stone. The air was heavier here, like the place was holding its breath.

“We’re not alone,” Jude said.

Toby nodded. He could feel it too. A presence—close, but not visible. It sat behind the trees like a predator, watching with something deeper than eyes.

“Do you hear it?” Jude asked.

Toby strained his ears.

Then he heard it.

Not a whisper this time. Not a call.

Names.

Soft and slow, like a chant, each one layered atop the other. Not shouted, not spoken—unfurled. Names they recognized. Names of classmates. Teachers. Children who had disappeared.

Calvin Brenner. Elena Marrow. Vincent Alcott.

And then—

“Jude Carter. Tobias Ellison.”

The boys froze.

“It knows us,” Toby whispered. “It remembered.”

“It marked us,” Jude corrected.

Suddenly, the forest trembled. Not like an earthquake, not violently. It shifted. The trees leaned further. The ring glowed faintly, pulsing in time with some heartbeat far underground.

Toby stepped forward. “We need to ask it something.”

“Ask what?”

“Why it’s doing this.”

Jude grabbed his arm. “That’s insane. You don’t ask things like this anything. You leave. We came back to stop it, not talk to it.”

“How can we stop it if we don’t even understand it?”

Jude stared at him. “You sound like them. Like the ones who went missing and came back wrong.”

“I’m not wrong,” Toby said. “Not yet.”

He stepped into the circle.

The stone vibrated under his shoes. The symbols glowed slightly, and the air thickened around him like syrup. Toby spoke—not loudly, but clearly.

“Why do you take names?”

The answer came like a ripple in space, folding the forest inward.

Names are doors. You gave me a key.

Jude took a step back. “Toby, get out of there.”

Toby didn’t move. “What happens when you take a name?”

Then they are mine.

He swallowed. “Can we take them back?”

There was a pause.

Not without cost.

“What cost?”

Your names. One for one.

“No,” Jude said from the edge of the ring. “That’s not happening. We’re not trading our lives for theirs.”

Toby turned, his voice tight. “Maybe we have to.”

“Don’t be stupid.”

“Jude, Calvin didn’t come back. Elena didn’t. Vincent didn’t. If we can bring one of them back, isn’t it worth it?”

Jude was pale. “Not like this.”

The voice returned, louder now, filling the space behind their thoughts.

Give one name, and another is returned. You have one hour.

Then the clearing dimmed, the glow fading, and the pressure in the air released.

Toby stepped out of the circle, shaking. Jude grabbed his shoulder, hard.

“You can’t do this,” he said. “We can’t do this. You don’t bargain with things like that.”

“What if it’s the only way?”

“And what if it’s lying?”

Toby didn’t answer. Because deep down, he didn’t think it was.

They left the forest with the world feeling thinner behind them, like walking on stretched skin. Back in Toby’s room, they sat in silence. The hour was ticking. The voice still echoed in Toby’s head.

Give one name.

“It didn’t say we had to give ours,” he said after a long silence.

Jude looked at him sharply. “What?”

“It didn’t say the name had to be ours. Just a name.”

“That’s even worse. You’d give someone else up? Just to get one back?”

“I’m just saying it’s what it said.”

Jude stood, pacing. “We’re not doing this. Not like that. You want to save someone? Fine. But you’re not sacrificing someone else. That’s how it spreads.”

They stared at each other, the weight of the question growing between them.

Finally, Toby said, “Then maybe the only name we can give… is one of ours.”

Silence.

Then Jude sat back down, hard. “We flip a coin.”

“What?”

“Flip a coin,” Jude said, voice flat. “We each call a side. Whoever loses gives their name.”

“That’s—insane.”

“Isn’t that what this whole thing is?”

Toby opened his hand. In it sat a single coin, worn and bent at one edge—the same quarter they had once placed on the ring. He looked at it, then at Jude.

“You sure?”

“No.”

They flipped.

It spun through the air, catching light, then fell.

Jude lost.

Chapter Four: What Cannot Be Unnamed

Jude stared at the coin for a long time, unmoving. It had landed near the edge of Toby’s bed, caught in a crease of the blanket. Heads. Toby had called tails. They both knew what it meant, but neither said the words aloud.

The room was quiet, filled only with the hum of the ceiling fan and the chirping of crickets outside the window. The air felt wrong, thick with something sour and electric. Toby waited for Jude to speak, to laugh it off or call a redo, to say it didn’t count, but Jude didn’t. His face was pale, but steady, his fingers balled into fists on his knees.

“We don’t have to do it,” Toby said finally, breaking the silence. “We can walk away. Let the hour pass.”

Jude’s voice was a whisper, strained and hoarse. “And let Calvin stay gone? You really think it’ll stop? That it’ll just let us leave if we quit now?”

“No,” Toby admitted. “I don’t.”

Jude leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “So we give it my name.”

Toby’s throat tightened. “You’re not going to disappear. It didn’t say that. Just—just that you give your name. Maybe it forgets you. Maybe you forget yourself. But we’ll figure something out. We’ll fix it.”

Jude didn’t look at him. “You think people can live without a name?”

“I think people do it all the time. People run away. Start over. Take new names.”

“It’s not the same,” Jude murmured. “This thing doesn’t forget you like a lost ID. It eats it. Like it eats light. Like it eats rules.”

The spiral on Toby’s shoulder itched. He scratched it absently, his mind spinning. The rules hadn’t said what happened if you gave your name—only that you shouldn’t speak it. But this was different, wasn’t it? This was an offering. A trade.

“We could try a fake one,” he suggested.

“No,” Jude said immediately. “It would know. You can’t trick something like that.”

“Then I’ll do it.”

Jude looked at him now, sharply. “No. We flipped. It was fair.”

“Who cares about fair?”

“I do.”

Toby looked down at his palms, at the faint chalk residue left over from the marks Jude had drawn earlier. “It’s not forever,” he said, not believing it himself. “You’ll still be you. You’ll remember who you are.”

Jude’s laugh was hollow. “Will I?”

They didn’t have any rituals. No spellbooks. No sacred circle. Just the list of rules, the glowing ring of stone, and something ancient waiting in the dark. It wasn’t enough. But it was all they had.

They went back just before the hour ended. The forest felt different, almost eager. It welcomed them this time, the trees parting like curtains, the path smooth and oddly bright under a sky that had turned an unnatural greenish hue. Nothing tried to stop them. No shapes in the shadows. No glimmers in the water. The pool was gone altogether, the ground dry where it once shimmered.

The clearing was just as they had left it, though the stone ring pulsed now, faintly, like a heartbeat.

Toby led. Jude followed.

No words.

When they reached the center, the air thickened, and the voice returned—not loud, but insistent. Not a whisper, not a scream. Just there, like a pressure behind the eyes.

Time is ended. One name must be given.

Jude took a step forward. His hands trembled, but he didn’t hesitate. His voice shook, but he kept it steady.

“I give my name,” he said, “in return for the boy called Calvin Brenner.”

The forest exhaled. Every leaf trembled. The ring glowed brighter, then dimmed. A wind blew in from nowhere, swirling leaves and dust in a spiral that lifted into the sky and vanished with a sound like snapping branches. Then stillness.

And silence.

Toby waited.

The ground didn’t open. The sky didn’t crack. Jude didn’t vanish. For a long moment, nothing happened. Then the spiral on Toby’s shoulder flared with heat. He gasped and clutched at it. It glowed faintly, a soft white-blue, before fading back into a dull pink.

Jude fell to his knees, breathing hard.

“Are you okay?” Toby knelt beside him.

“I don’t know,” Jude whispered. “I feel… lighter.”

“You remember your name?”

“Yes.” He paused. “But it doesn’t feel like mine anymore. It’s like remembering a story someone told me about myself.”

Toby nodded slowly.

Then a noise broke the silence.

A soft whimper.

They turned.

From behind a tree stepped a boy. Thin, dirt-smeared, with torn jeans and wide, terrified eyes. He looked no older than twelve. His hair was matted, his arms scraped, but he was whole. He stared at them both, blinking.

“Who are you?” he asked.

Toby’s voice caught. “Calvin?”

The boy flinched at the name.

“I—I think so,” he said. “I was… somewhere. Dark. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. There were voices. I don’t remember how I got there.”

Jude stood unsteadily. “We brought you back.”

Calvin looked around, then down at the stone circle. “Where is this?”

Toby stepped forward, reaching out a hand. “It’s okay. We’ll take you home.”

He didn’t say more. There was no way to explain it. Calvin didn’t ask.

Back in the neighborhood, the streetlights were just beginning to flicker on. They left Calvin at the police station—he couldn’t remember where he lived, couldn’t recall his parents’ names, only pieces, like a jigsaw puzzle with holes. But they recognized him. His photo was still up. Officers gasped. Someone cried.

No one asked how the boys had found him. They didn’t explain.

That night, Jude sat on Toby’s porch, silent.

Toby brought out two sodas. Neither drank them.

“Do you feel different?” Toby asked.

Jude didn’t answer for a long time. Then he said, “Yeah. Like part of me’s unwritten.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be. I chose it. He’s back. That matters.”

“What happens now?”

Jude looked out at the street, the trees beyond the fence swaying gently in the summer breeze. “We keep the rules. We warn people. And we never go back.”

Toby nodded, but even then, he wasn’t sure they’d truly left.

Not really.

The next day, Calvin was all over the local news.

“Miracle Return,” the headlines said. “Boy Found After Nearly Three Weeks Missing.” The articles were light on details. Police refused to explain where he had been or how he had come back. They said he was found near the southern edge of the woods, dazed but unharmed. One article mentioned “exhaustion” and “disorientation,” the kind of words adults used when they didn’t know what else to say.

Toby and Jude watched the press conference from Toby’s living room, the TV casting pale light over the rug. Calvin’s parents sat in folding chairs behind the chief of police, their faces hollow and tight. The father held a wrinkled photograph in both hands, knuckles white. The mother wore sunglasses even though they were indoors. Calvin wasn’t there. The chief said he was being kept under observation.

“They’re lying,” Jude said.

Toby didn’t answer. He knew Jude was right.

Jude hadn’t spoken much since the night they gave his name to the forest. He had gone quiet, internal, like someone had turned down the volume on his soul. His movements were slower, his thoughts further apart. He still laughed sometimes, but the sound felt half-formed, like it had forgotten what it was supposed to mean.

“Have you noticed anything?” Toby asked that afternoon as they sat under the willow tree at the end of his yard.

“Like what?”

“Anything strange. Off. Since... since that night.”

Jude considered it. “I don’t remember my middle name.”

Toby turned. “Seriously?”

Jude nodded. “I know I had one. I know my parents picked it because it meant something. But when I try to think about it, it just... slips.”

Toby frowned. “Maybe it’s just memory loss.”

“Or maybe it’s the start.”

“The start of what?”

Jude plucked a blade of grass and twisted it between his fingers. “Of becoming someone else.”

Toby shook his head. “You’re still you.”

“I don’t feel like me.”

Silence settled again.

That night, Toby found a page on his desk that he didn’t remember writing. It wasn’t in his usual notebook, just a sheet torn from one. The handwriting was his, mostly. But slanted differently. Tighter.

It read:

Names can be taken. But they can also be hidden. Carved in bark. Buried in salt. Sewn into clothing. Speak them backwards. Bury them deep. What is lost is not always gone.

He showed it to Jude the next day.

“You wrote this?” Jude asked.

“I guess. I don’t remember.”

Jude read the words again. “Then maybe you didn’t write it for yourself.”

Toby felt a cold knot in his stomach. “What if we’re still in it?”

“In what?”

“The forest.”

Jude looked up sharply. “Don’t say that.”

“I mean it. What if it’s not done with us?”

Jude folded the page and tucked it into his hoodie pocket. “Then we start learning how to fight back.”

They began collecting.

Salt, of course. That was in every rule list they’d seen. But also iron nails, bits of quartz, twine braided into loops. Toby read about old European myths and traditions, the protective power of rowan wood, the way certain symbols carved into thresholds could keep spirits out. Jude began mapping the neighborhood, marking where strange things had happened—where Calvin had vanished, where their reflections had misbehaved, where the fox with human eyes had stared too long.

They kept it quiet. Their classmates had already begun treating them differently, even if they didn’t know why. Kids who used to play soccer with them now crossed the yard without waving. Teachers hesitated before calling on Jude, as if his name tasted unfamiliar in their mouths. Toby overheard someone whispering about how “weird” he’d gotten.

“People can tell,” he told Jude during lunch one day.

Jude just shrugged. “Let them.”

Toby looked down at his tray. The pizza looked gray.

Then, in the second week of July, another child vanished.

Her name was Nadine Vostik. Seven years old. Blonde braids. She’d been playing in her front yard with sidewalk chalk. Her mom went inside for a moment. When she came back out, the chalk was still there, but Nadine was gone. No footprints. No signs of struggle.

Just... gone.

The spiral on Toby’s shoulder flared that night. He woke gasping, drenched in sweat, Jude’s name on his lips.

He called him immediately.

Jude picked up on the first ring.

“Did you feel it?” Toby asked.

“Yes,” Jude said. “It’s happening again.”

They met at dawn, backpacks ready.

Jude didn’t speak much, but he was faster than he’d been in days. More certain. Toby wondered if this was the same boy he’d known before all this, or if the forest had already changed him beyond recognition. But Jude still walked beside him. He still looked over his shoulder every few minutes to make sure Toby was there. That had to mean something.

The forest opened for them once more.

It always did.

This time, the path led them not to the clearing, but to something new.

A garden.

Or what had once been one.

Stone markers sat in crooked rows, overgrown with weeds and moss. Wooden signs had rotted away, and vines choked the few flowers that remained. In the center stood a statue—half-buried, eroded by time. It was faceless. Arms outstretched. Not in welcome, but in warning.

Toby stepped carefully between the stones. “This wasn’t here before.”

“No,” Jude said. “But I think it’s always been here.”

He knelt by one of the markers. There was something carved into the stone, faint but still legible.

Nadine Vostik.

Toby swallowed. “It marked her already.”

Jude looked around. “They’re all names.”

He was right. The stones bore hundreds of names—some they recognized, some that belonged to the vanished children of Meadowrun, and others that meant nothing. But all of them had a date. Most recent first. The older ones stretched back decades.

“This is a graveyard,” Toby said.

“No,” Jude said. “It’s a ledger.”

He pointed to a stone that had been cracked in half.

Calvin Brenner.

The name had been etched in, then crudely struck through. The surface bore claw marks, deep and rough, as though something had tried to erase it by force.

“He was taken,” Jude said. “Then returned. But his name’s still here.”

Toby turned. “Then that means the name isn’t enough.”

“No,” Jude said. “Not unless we unmark them.”

“How?”

Jude stood. “We don’t give names anymore.”

“Then what?”

“We take them back.”

Toby looked up at the statue again. “That sounds like a war.”

Jude didn’t flinch. “Maybe it is.”

They walked back through the garden in silence, past the stones, past the statue. The forest didn’t resist them this time. But it didn’t welcome them either. It watched. Always watched.

They didn’t speak until they saw the fence.

Toby turned to Jude. “You really want to keep doing this?”

Jude looked up at the sky. “I don’t know who I am anymore. But I know I don’t want anyone else to become one of those names.”

“Then we find a way.”

Jude nodded. “We unwrite the ledger.”

And they stepped back into the daylight, not as boys running from something, but as messengers returning with a purpose.

That evening, Toby sat at his desk with every light in the room turned on. The windows were shut and locked, the blinds drawn, the flashlight within reach. A stack of library books stood precariously by his elbow—folk stories, cryptic local histories, fragments of town records so old their ink bled into the margins. Somewhere, in this sea of paper and half-truths, he hoped there was a pattern, or at least a thread he could follow.

Jude had gone home to write in the notebook he kept hidden under a floorboard. He said he remembered a dream, or something that had felt like one—a spiral staircase under the forest, a hand reaching up from beneath a stone floor, and a voice whispering not a threat, but a warning: Names are not just keys. They are chains.

The idea had unsettled them both, more than they admitted aloud.

Toby flipped through the oldest volume again, the spine cracked, the corners eaten by mildew. On page 203, scrawled in a different handwriting than the typeset text, someone had written:

There is no power in names unless we give it. Refuse the name, refuse the bond.

He copied it down, circled it, underlined it three times. That was what they needed. A way to refuse the binding. To turn the lock without offering a key.

The problem was, they still didn’t know how.

At school the next day, a silence had taken root in the halls. Not the ordinary, slouching boredom of a classroom full of kids halfway into summer—but a strange, heavy stillness. Whispers clung to the lockers like dust. Teachers kept glancing out the windows. Students flinched when announcements crackled on the loudspeaker.

Nadine Vostik had not been found.

Toby watched Jude closely. He sat through classes, took notes, gave short answers when called on—but there was something different about the way he moved. Slower. Sharper. Like every second was being measured and catalogued. At one point, Toby thought he saw Jude mumbling something to himself during science. A phrase, repeated under his breath, as if testing its shape. Later, in the cafeteria, Jude didn’t eat. He just stared at his tray and tapped a rhythm on the table: three beats, then two, then three again.

“Do you remember what your parents used to call you?” Toby asked him quietly.

Jude looked up. “What?”

“Not your name. Just... stuff. Nicknames. Anything that wasn’t ‘Jude.’”

Jude thought. “My mom used to call me Bean. Short for string bean. Because I was skinny.”

“Did she still say it?”

“Sometimes.”

“Does she now?”

Jude’s jaw clenched. “She hasn’t used it in weeks.”

Toby nodded. “It’s fading.”

“That’s what names are. Gravity. And we’re floating off.”

For the first time in days, Jude smiled—but it wasn’t a happy smile. It was sharp and sad, and a little too calm.

“Then we tether ourselves,” Toby said. “We find ways to hold on.”

They made charms that night. Nothing fancy. Jude used twine and copper wire, knotting it with broken bits of quartz and glass. Toby dug through his basement until he found an old photo album. He cut out two wallet-sized photos of them—one from third grade, one from the last birthday party they’d both attended. They tucked the pictures into their shoes, their pockets, the lining of their backpacks.

“This isn’t real magic,” Jude said, holding one of the charms up to the light.

“No,” Toby agreed. “But it’s resistance.”

They agreed to return to the garden the next night.

This time, they brought chalk and a trowel.

The forest was different again. Not darker—brighter. But it was the kind of brightness that hurt the eyes, like walking through a fluorescent dream. The trees seemed lit from within, their bark pulsing faintly with gold veins. There were no sounds. Not even wind.

When they reached the garden, the statue was gone.

In its place stood a mirror.

It wasn’t hung or framed or even supported. It just stood upright in the middle of the clearing, tall as a doorway, too perfect to be real. Its surface didn’t reflect them. Instead, it showed the garden as it had been—flowering, clean, tended. The names on the stones were glowing, each with a soft white halo, except for Calvin’s. His marker was cracked and dull.

“This is new,” Jude said.

Toby approached the mirror slowly. “It’s a memory. A trick.”

“Or an invitation.”

“Either way, we didn’t come for that.”

They set to work.

Jude drew a circle of salt around one of the older stones. Toby knelt beside a marker bearing the name Elena Marrow. The girl had vanished nearly two years ago. No body. No suspects. No answers. He took the trowel and began to dig gently, searching not for bones, but for threads—something symbolic, something the forest had buried as a placeholder.

He found it eight inches down. A tooth. Clean, sharp, unnaturally white.

“What the hell?” he whispered.

Jude looked over. “What is it?”

“Evidence.”

Jude glanced at the mirror again. “Then maybe it’s time to bury our own.”

They dug two new holes near the edge of the garden, where the names were faded and the ground was soft. Into one, Jude dropped a strand of his own hair, one of the photos, and the copper-wire charm. Into the other, Toby placed the foil wrapper from the keychain he’d once offered to the ring, along with a pebble from his front yard and a scrap of notebook paper with a false name written on it: Elias Brae.

“I thought you didn’t want to trick it,” Jude said.

“I’m not. I’m giving it a name. Just not mine.”

“You think that’ll work?”

Toby’s eyes flicked toward the glowing mirror. “We’ll find out.”

They covered the holes, then carved a symbol into the stones above each one—an unbroken circle intersected with a jagged X. A denial of permanence. A refusal to be marked.

Nothing happened at first.

Then the forest groaned.

The mirror cracked.

A sound like thunder rolled through the trees, not above them, but inside the soil. A long, slow vibration, as if the woods were shifting against their will.

Then the names began to dim.

Not all. But a few.

Elena Marrow.

Peter Loch.

Nadine Vostik.

Toby stared. “She’s not gone yet.”

“Then we can still save her,” Jude said.

But the glow around their buried stones—Jude’s and Toby’s—began to pulse, slow and red.

“What’s that mean?” Jude asked.

Toby shook his head. “I think it’s a countdown.”

The wind returned. Only it wasn’t wind. It was breath.

Hot, rank, and ancient.

From behind the trees, the forest moved—not the trees themselves, but something in them. A folding of space, a twisting of shape. A presence, pressing in, watching, furious.

The boys turned to run, but the mirror split wide down the middle like a wound, and from its depths, the figure stepped out once more.

The thing that asked for names.

No longer distant.

No longer curious.

Now hungry.

Chapter Five: The Hollow That Remembers

The thing stepped through the cracked mirror without sound, but the forest shuddered like a great weight had been dropped on its roots. Toby could feel it in the soles of his feet, that tremble—not noise, not vibration, but a shift in intention. It was no longer hiding. No longer testing.

It was coming.

The mirror finished its slow collapse behind it, splintering into a thousand jagged pieces, each fragment flickering with impossible images—faces frozen in screams, silhouettes of children reaching skyward, eyes like silver coins staring back. Then the shards fell into the earth like raindrops, vanishing without a trace.

Jude grabbed Toby’s arm. “We have to go. Now.”

They turned, but the forest would not let them leave. The path they had come through twisted on itself, now a spiral with no center. Trees leaned in close, trunks too tall and too thin, branches clawing toward them. The world closed like a jaw.

The creature—if it was that—did not walk. It floated just inches above the ground, a roiling shape of folds and shadows, humanoid in outline, but too tall, its joints wrong, its face covered by a smooth veil of flesh that bent inward where a mouth should be. There were no eyes. No nostrils. No seams.

It radiated remembrance.

Not memory.

Remembrance.

As though it knew them. Had always known them. Not as boys or bodies, but as echoes.

And it spoke.

Not in sound, not this time. In understanding—a presence behind their thoughts, brushing aside the layers of self.

You broke the garden. You offered not truth, but deception. You buried salt where the seed should lie.

Jude stepped forward, his voice hoarse but steady. “We didn’t break it. You did. You made it a tomb. You made it a trap.”

The thing tilted its head. A shiver ran through its form, as if the idea of confrontation was... curious.

You brought back what was mine. Then refused my claim. That is a bargain broken.

“We gave you what you asked for,” Toby said. “You said a name for a name. You didn’t say anything about forever.”

The presence pulsed.

Forever is the natural consequence of taking. You unmade the exchange. You undermined the rules.

“We made our own,” Jude said.

Then, without waiting, he pulled the knife from his pocket—the old folding blade that had belonged to his grandfather—and slashed the air in front of him.

Not wildly. Deliberately. A wide X across the earth.

A symbol of refusal.

The creature recoiled, not in pain, but with a shudder that made the branches of nearby trees sag under sudden weight. Its voice twisted into a different shape.

You think this is defiance. You think this is choice. But names are not only yours. They are known. You are known.

Toby stepped forward, heart hammering. “Then un-know us.”

The wind returned. A low howl, high above the canopy, bending the trees but never touching the ground. It wasn’t wind at all, they realized—it was names. Thousands of names, called in the same breath, indistinguishable from one another. A flood of identity, of ownership.

And then—cutting through it—

Then you must leave what makes you you. And walk into the Hollow.

Toby faltered.

Jude’s fingers twitched.

“The Hollow?” Toby asked, dread crawling up his throat.

The place between. The place before the names. All taken must pass through. Few return.

Jude turned to Toby. “If we go in, we might not come out.”

“But if we don’t,” Toby said, “we bring it back with us.”

The red glow at their feet grew brighter. The earth beneath the salt lines trembled. The charm Jude had buried burst into flames without smoke. A signal. A warning.

Or a countdown.

Toby looked back at the creature. “We go in. But together.”

The forest moaned.

Then the ground opened.

Not like a crack, but a slow blooming—a hole not into earth, but into absence. A well with no bottom. The Hollow.

And they jumped.

Falling was not like falling.

It was unmaking.

Toby felt his memories slide from him like loose papers, fluttering upward as he dropped. Faces faded. Names blurred. The feeling of his own voice slipped from his throat. But Jude was still beside him—he could feel the heat of his body, the tug of his presence like a magnet keeping them aligned.

Then: not-light.

They landed in a space that was not space. A field of mirrors that didn’t reflect. A sky made of teeth. A thousand windows into a thousand different forests, each one blinking open and shut like eyes on stone.

“Jude,” Toby tried to say, but the name didn’t make it past his lips. His voice bent backward. The air was too thick with else.

Jude turned. His face was younger here. Older, too. Fluid. He saw Toby and pointed. His mouth moved, but the sound came seconds later.

“This is where the names sleep.”

Toby nodded.

They moved forward, or what felt like forward, into a grove made entirely of doors. Some small. Some enormous. Some shaped like mouths. All closed.

On one door, carved deep and scratched, was the name Nadine Vostik.

Jude reached for the handle.

“Wait,” Toby managed, this time shaping the sound like clay. “Not yet.”

He stepped to a smaller door just beside it. His own name was on it—but backwards. Ybot Nosille.

He scraped his fingers over the letters until they smeared into dust.

The door vanished.

Then, he reached up and wrote a new name: Tether. His own name, but hidden. Encoded. A truth buried in myth.

He turned back to Jude.

Jude understood. He nodded.

They turned the handle on Nadine’s door.

It opened with a sigh.

Inside was a shape, curled small and still. A girl with braided hair, pale and sleeping. Her hands were empty, but her mouth was half-open, as if caught mid-song. She did not breathe.

“Name her,” Toby said.

Jude knelt. “Nadine Vostik. Come back.”

Her eyes opened.

The Hollow spat them out like fruit from a seed.

They landed hard in the clearing. The red light had gone out. The creature was gone. The garden silent.

Nadine coughed.

She was real. Solid. Awake.

Toby wept.

Jude’s hand trembled, and for a moment he didn’t remember his name.

Then Toby whispered it, three times, like casting a spell.

“Jude. Jude. Jude.”

And the forest released them.

Not forever.

But for now.

They didn’t speak as they carried Nadine from the forest.

The girl didn’t ask questions. She walked between them barefoot, eyes wide and vacant, clinging to Jude’s hand like she was trying to anchor herself to something that wouldn’t vanish if she blinked. Her braids had unraveled, and her clothes hung off her like paper that had been soaked and dried too many times. But she was alive. She was here. And for now, that was enough.

The forest gave no resistance.

No whispering leaves. No strange lights. The trees stood still, their roots retracted, their branches parted like the parted lips of something waiting to speak and deciding—for now—not to.

Only when they reached the edge, where the grass met the chain-link fence and the first porch light glowed in the distance, did Jude turn to look back.

The garden was gone.

Where the ring of stone had stood, there was only a ring of flattened earth, already covered in fallen leaves. The Hollow had closed behind them.

Jude exhaled and stepped through the fence.

Toby followed.

Once back in the neighborhood, the silence broke. Sounds returned in waves—distant TVs behind curtains, cicadas in the trees, the creak of swings on empty porches. Normal sounds. The kind that signaled safety, or the illusion of it.

They didn’t go to the police this time.

They walked Nadine to her house and left her on the porch. She stood there for a moment, blinking at the door as if uncertain what it was. Then she turned to them.

“Are you coming too?”

Toby knelt down, looked her in the eyes. “We can’t. But you’re going to be okay. Knock on the door.”

She hesitated, then raised her hand and knocked.

Lights came on. A shout echoed inside. Then a woman flung the door open, hair wild, face raw with panic and hope and disbelief. Her mouth moved but no words came. Then she dropped to her knees and pulled Nadine into her arms.

The girl looked over the woman’s shoulder, back at the boys.

Jude gave her a single nod.

And they left before anyone else could see them.

The following week passed like a dream half-remembered.

The town shifted in strange ways. The paper ran another headline: Second Missing Child Returned. The police gave no statement. A psychologist from the city came down to “evaluate” Nadine. Her family stayed indoors. Curtains drawn. Lights always on.

At school, no one said anything out loud, but something had changed. The hallways were quieter. The teachers more distracted. Students avoided the windows. A few kids started carrying salt packets in their backpacks. And when asked why, they just said, “Because.”

Jude was more withdrawn than ever.

He no longer joked in class. He stopped drawing in the margins of his math worksheets. He ate lunch in silence. But the spiral mark on his shoulder faded slowly from red to pale pink. Toby checked his every morning, just to be sure.

“I think the Hollow left a part of itself in us,” Jude said one afternoon. They were sitting in Toby’s garage, the air thick with sawdust and motor oil. “Like it wants us to remember.”

Toby rubbed his temples. “We don’t need help with that.”

Jude shook his head. “I don’t mean memory. I mean purpose. I think it wants to be unmade. Piece by piece.”

“Then why fight us?”

“Because that’s how it protects itself. It was made of names. Bound by belief. Buried in rules so old no one remembered how they worked. It didn’t want to die. It wanted to grow.”

“Until it swallowed everything.”

Jude nodded. “But now it’s bleeding.”

Toby looked at him. “We did that?”

“We started it.”

Toby didn’t feel like a hero. Not even close. More like a boy who’d thrown a rock into a still pond and discovered the pond was bottomless and full of teeth.

At night, the voice returned.

Not every night. But some.

Sometimes in dreams. Sometimes from under the floorboards. Always the same sentence:

There is one name left to give.

It haunted him.

Not because he feared what it meant.

But because part of him knew it was true.

They had rescued Calvin. Then Nadine. They had struck names from the garden and buried their own in secret. They had defied the rules and made new ones. But the ledger—the garden—had still been filled with names. So many more. Some hundreds of years old. Others so fresh they still felt warm.

They hadn’t even made a dent.

The Hollow had allowed them to take two.

But there would be a price.

And it hadn’t been paid yet.

That Sunday, Jude didn’t come to the park.

He always met Toby at the swings around two o’clock. It had become their quiet ritual—sitting there with melting popsicles, saying nothing, letting the wind carry their thoughts.

But Jude never showed.

Toby biked to his house.

Jude’s mom answered the door, looking more tired than usual. Her eyes were rimmed in red, and she held a crumpled tissue in one hand.

“He’s... resting,” she said. “He’s not been sleeping well. Nightmares, he says.”

“Can I see him?”

She hesitated, then nodded.

Toby climbed the stairs, already knowing what he’d find.

Jude sat on the floor of his room, back against the wall, knees pulled to his chest. His notebook lay open beside him, the pages filled with tight, strange symbols. Not words. Not runes. Just... marks, each drawn again and again until the pencil broke.

Toby sat down across from him.

“I dreamed of the mirror again,” Jude said.

“Did it show you the garden?”

“No,” Jude whispered. “It showed me us. Standing inside it. Watching. Not speaking. Just... watching.”

Toby swallowed. “You think we’re still in it?”

“No. But I think a piece of it came out with us.”

He looked up, and for a second, Toby didn’t recognize his best friend.

Then Jude blinked, and the boy returned.

“I think I have to go back,” he said.

“No,” Toby said, too quickly. “We don’t. We broke the mirror. We closed the Hollow.”

“It’s not closed. It’s waiting.”

Toby leaned forward. “You said it bled. You said it was weakening. We can find another way. We’ll learn more. Take more names back. But you’re not going back in.”

Jude looked at him for a long time.

“I don’t know if I have a choice.”

“You do,” Toby said. “Because I’m going with you. And we’ll finish this. Together.”

The Hollow may have been a place of forgetting.

But they remembered each other.

And that was their only weapon.

Chapter Six: The Names Between

They waited until the sky turned violet, the hour where shadows seemed longer than they should be and the world quieted like it was holding its breath. By now, the trees at the edge of the soccer field didn’t scare Toby anymore—but they didn’t comfort him either. The forest wasn’t a place you got used to. It was a place you learned to respect, like fire or grief. Always just one step from swallowing you whole.

Jude met him under the floodlight by the goalpost, backpack slung across one shoulder, the other shoulder bandaged. The spiral had returned. Brighter now. Not red, not raw—glowing, like something underneath his skin was waking up.

Toby said nothing. Just nodded.

They didn’t talk as they slipped through the fence, past the patch of tall grass where they had once buried salt and photos, into the paths that had become too familiar. The forest had reshaped itself again. No paths. No rings of mushrooms. Just an endless corridor of trees, each taller than the last, bending ever so slightly toward the center.

“Do you think it knows we’re coming?” Jude asked.

Toby shrugged. “It’s always known.”

He thought about the voice that had haunted him the last week, the whisper that followed no wind. There is one name left to give. What it hadn’t said—but what he felt in his bones—was that the name might already have been given. Or maybe not given, but taken the moment they entered the Hollow.

They stepped over a log that hadn’t been there before, its bark split with symbols like teeth. Past that, the light changed. Less moonlight, more... memory. The air shimmered with moments: a birthday party from third grade, the faint sound of his mother singing in the kitchen, the sting of gravel in his knee after a bad fall. The forest wasn’t just watching them—it was wearing them.

“Look,” Jude said, stopping.

Ahead stood the door.

Not a mirror. Not a pool. Just a wooden door, unhinged, suspended between two trees. It didn’t float or glow. It just was, like a forgotten relic of an old house that had been swallowed whole by the woods. Carved into the frame were the same intersecting circles and spirals they had seen in the Hollow. Above the handle: a single name.

Jude Carter.

Jude stepped back.

“I didn’t carve that,” he said.

Toby reached out and touched the wood. It was warm.

“It’s what you gave.”

“Not willingly.”

“That doesn’t matter,” Toby said. “It has it now.”

“So if I open that—”

“You go back.”

Jude looked at him. “Will you follow?”

Toby didn’t answer right away. The Hollow had never lied. It bent, yes. Tricked. Hid. But it hadn’t lied. And the last time they had entered, they’d barely made it back. This time, they might not. And yet—

“Yeah,” he said. “I’ll follow.”

Jude nodded once, turned the handle, and stepped through.

Toby followed.

The Hollow was colder than before.

Not temperature, but sensation—like something had stopped beating. It felt like a place abandoned by its own rules, frayed and rotting at the edges. The mirrors had been replaced by hanging veils of thread. Thousands of them, suspended in midair, each strand trembling slightly as if plucked by invisible fingers.

Toby brushed one and felt a jolt of memory: his fourth birthday. A cake shaped like a pirate ship. A song his father had sung, off-key, making everyone laugh.

Jude touched another and gasped.

“What did you see?” Toby asked.

“Myself,” Jude said. “But not... me. Someone else, with my face. Smiling. Standing on the wrong side of the mirror.”

They moved slowly.

Each thread they passed seemed to tug at something—an idea, a piece of their childhood, a word left unsaid. It wasn’t painful. It was worse. It was seductive.

Then they came to the well.

It wasn’t the garden. Not anymore. The stone had sunk, collapsed inward, forming a mouth that breathed slowly. Around it stood shapes—bodies made of light and dust, some small, some tall, none solid. All watching.

The Name-Eater was there too.

Not in shape. Not even in sound.

In presence.

A pressure on the back of their skulls. A feeling like they were already being read.

You brought no gift.

Toby stepped forward. “We brought ourselves.”

That is not new.

“We came to take more names,” Jude said. “The ones you hold. The ones you’ve buried.”

The Hollow quivered.

What name do you give in exchange?

Jude flinched.

Toby stepped beside him. “We give you no more. The last name you took is the last you’ll take.”

The light around the well flickered. The threads overhead trembled. Then, from the void below, something rose—not the figure, but a memory.

Jude gasped. “That’s my brother.”

Toby saw him too. A boy, maybe sixteen, lanky and smirking, a backpack slung low. “He went missing five years ago.”

“Evan Carter,” Jude whispered. “I thought he ran away.”

He was given. Long before you knew. A debt passed down.

Jude shook his head. “No. My family didn’t—”

A name lost is a seed. It grows in shadow. Yours was only the fruit.

Toby’s blood went cold.

It hadn’t started with them.

It had never started with them.

They were just the ones who finally turned back.

He stepped to the edge of the well. “If you have Evan, give him back.”

A name for a name. You know the rule.

“Then take mine,” Toby said.

Jude spun. “No!”

Toby looked at him. “You’ve already given yours. You’re marked. But I’m not done being me. And maybe that’s what makes it worth something.”

Jude grabbed his wrist. “Toby—don’t.”

But he looked into the well and said clearly, “My name is Tobias Ellison. I give it willingly. Take it. And release Evan Carter.”

The Hollow screamed.

Every thread snapped at once. The shapes around the well scattered like leaves. The ground split—but this time upward, stones and dirt floating into the air like reversed gravity.

And then, silence.

A boy emerged from the well. Whole. Blinking. Confused.

Jude fell to his knees.

“Evan?” he whispered.

The boy nodded slowly. “Do I know you?”

Tears streaked Jude’s face. “You will.”

And behind them, Toby stood still.

He no longer remembered what his mother used to call him. He could still see Jude. Still remember him. But the rest was fading.

Jude stood.

Toby looked at him, eyes dimming. “Help me remember.”

Jude grabbed both of his shoulders. “We leave now. And I will. Every day. I’ll remind you who you are.”

They walked out of the Hollow.

Together.

The Hollow did not follow them back.

Or if it did, it lingered only in the way dark water clings to skin after you've climbed out, leaving you colder than before, changed in a way no towel can fix. The woods let them go without resistance. The door that had marked Jude’s name was gone, vanished like smoke after the final candle is snuffed. No whispers. No twisted shadows. Only the rhythmic sound of their footsteps, Evan’s slightly staggering gait behind them as he reacclimated to a world he had been stolen from.

Toby felt the difference immediately. The sky above them looked wrong. Not alien, not uncanny—just off, like they had returned to a picture of the world instead of the world itself. The stars were in the wrong places. A breeze carried the smell of rain when the air was dry. Somewhere far off, a dog barked, and Toby recognized the sound but not the feeling it stirred.

He didn’t say anything. He didn’t need to.

Jude knew.

They reached the edge of the woods as dawn broke, a thin strip of gold cutting across the trees like a seam between worlds. Evan stumbled and fell to one knee just outside the fence. Jude rushed to help him, gripping his shoulder tightly.

“You’re okay,” Jude said. “You’re out.”

Evan looked up at him, dazed, brow furrowed. “How do you know me?”

Jude’s breath caught. “Because I remember you.”

Evan blinked slowly, and for a moment, just a flicker, recognition passed across his face. “Jude?”

“Yeah,” Jude whispered.

Evan said nothing more, but he leaned into Jude’s side, and Jude supported his weight without another word. Toby watched from a few feet away, standing just beyond the last crooked fence post, the air around him strangely quiet.

He didn’t step forward.

Couldn’t.

His name was gone now. Not just the letters, not just the sounds, but the connection. He still knew things—math, history, fragments of jokes. But his sense of belonging was unraveling thread by thread. The world still made room for him physically, but not emotionally. People looked at him and saw a face, a shape, a shadow—not someone.

He didn’t blame Jude. Or the forest. Or even the Hollow.

He had chosen this.

That didn’t make it any easier.

The next day, the town stirred to life with another miracle returned.

The papers didn’t call it that this time. No headlines. No interviews. Evan had been “found” hiking out of the north edge of town, disoriented, dehydrated, but otherwise unharmed. The doctors said trauma had likely affected his memory. The Vostiks hadn’t spoken publicly since Nadine returned. Neither had Calvin’s family. It was as if the town itself had agreed—quietly, wordlessly—not to ask.

And people obeyed.

Because they were afraid of what they might learn.

The woods were fenced off by the end of the week. A crew came in and strung new wire, taller and tighter, with warning signs every ten feet. But the trees remained, looming. Watching. The fence was a suggestion, not a seal.

The Hollow was not gone.

Only dormant.

Toby felt it in the way shadows gathered beneath streetlamps, how reflections lagged a second too long in windows, how voices on the wind sometimes called out with no speaker behind them.

The spiral mark on Jude’s shoulder had faded, finally. It left behind a soft scar, barely noticeable, like a pale bruise that would never fully heal. Evan didn’t have a mark. But he walked like someone who had been broken and put back together by unfamiliar hands. His smile was still crooked, but slower now. Less certain.

Toby avoided mirrors. Not because he feared what he’d see, but because sometimes, when he did look, the boy staring back at him was still, utterly still, as if unsure who or what he was supposed to be.

And there was no name to ground him.

Jude didn’t let him drift.

Each day, he called Toby something different. Sometimes old nicknames—Tobes, T, Scout. Sometimes new ones—Ash, Echo, North. Sometimes just “you.” But he spoke, always. As if speaking kept Toby tethered.

Toby didn’t answer most of the time.

But he stayed.

They sat in the park again, a week later. Summer was ending. The cicadas were dying out. School would start soon. They had both aged in strange ways—still twelve on the outside, but older behind the eyes. Evan sat near the fence, sketching the shape of a circle on the back of a crumpled paper bag, humming something out of tune.

“You think it’s over?” Jude asked quietly.

“No,” Toby said. “But I think it’s changed.”

“How?”

“We’re not just names anymore. We’re... what’s left after the name’s gone.”

Jude nodded. “And what’s that?”

Toby looked out at the trees. “I don’t know. But it remembers us now. And I think it’s afraid.”

That night, Toby dreamed not of the Hollow, but of the garden before. The flowers whole. The statue standing tall. Names etched gently, without malice. The wind carried laughter instead of screams. And somewhere nearby, a voice whispered—not demanding, not cruel—just curious.

What name will you choose next?

And Toby, for the first time in days, whispered back:

“I’ll let them choose for me.”

Because sometimes, what’s taken isn’t the end.

Sometimes, it’s the beginning.

They began keeping a ledger of their own.

Jude found an old notebook—one of those thick, speckled composition books with half the pages already covered in doodles and spelling lists from years ago. He tore those out, one by one, until the book was blank. Then, with a red pen and his neatest handwriting, he began listing names.

Not the ones taken. Not the ones buried.

Names remembered.

Each day, they added to the list. Toby—who still didn’t speak his own aloud—would offer what he could: first names from classmates, neighbors, teachers, even long-dead relatives he remembered only from photographs. Jude wrote them all down.

Not in any order. Not alphabetically.

But the way Toby remembered them.

“You think it helps?” Jude asked one afternoon, lying in the grass beside the old fence. “Writing them down like this?”

Toby sat cross-legged, fingers smudged with graphite from sketching the shape of the Hollow’s door. “I think forgetting is what gave it power.”

“So we’re fighting it with memory.”

“Yeah.”

Jude flipped the page, revealing a drawing he’d done days earlier. It looked like the garden, before it fell apart—flowers blooming over stone markers, trees in a perfect circle, a clean sky above. “You think it ever was good?”

“I don’t know,” Toby said. “But I think it wants to be remembered as something more than what it became.”

Jude closed the notebook gently. “Then maybe we’re not here to destroy it. Maybe we’re here to change it.”

It wasn’t a revolution. It wasn’t dramatic. Just small acts. Quiet ones. They started leaving small offerings in safe places—coins wrapped in paper, poems folded like tiny cranes, chalk drawings in places they knew the wind would find. And the forest, strangely, didn’t push back.

At night, Jude would sometimes wake up hearing whispers—not the old ones, not the hissing, hungry demands of the Name-Eater, but something softer. Like thank yous. Like lullabies.

Toby didn’t hear the same things. But he began to dream again. And in those dreams, he no longer wandered nameless. Instead, he moved through streets and schools and woods where people recognized him—not because they knew his name, but because they knew his story. They called him what they needed to call him.

And for now, that was enough.

In late August, a third child returned.

No one had gone looking for her. She hadn’t been officially missing. But she had disappeared in the quiet way kids sometimes do—slipping between the cracks of adult perception, absent from class for a few days, then weeks, then a season. By the time someone noticed, she was back.

Her name was Mira Salazar.

She came back walking barefoot through the fog before sunrise, hands open and empty, eyes wide. When asked where she’d been, she answered softly: “I was with the garden people. They wanted to keep me, but I said no thank you. So they let me go.”

And just like that, the story shifted.

Because she had not been taken.

She had refused.

The town didn’t know what to do with that.

The police said it was confusion. A prank. A game gone too far.

But Jude and Toby knew.

The Hollow’s grip was weakening. The rules were loosening.

The names were learning to speak back.

One night, as summer edged into September, the boys returned to the edge of the woods. Not to enter. Not to test it. Just to be there. They sat at the base of the twisted oak that marked the old path into the forest—the one that had led them to the swing, then the race, then the door in the hill.

Jude had the ledger in his lap.

Toby held a smooth stone in his palm, one side of it polished to a shine. On it, he had scratched a symbol. Not letters. Just a circle, intersected by a short vertical line.

The new mark.

“What do you want to be called?” Jude asked him.

Toby didn’t answer right away. The wind moved through the trees. A bird called out once, then went still.

Finally, he said, “Call me Hollow.”

Jude looked over, eyebrows raised.

“Are you sure?”

Toby nodded. “It took my name. That part of me’s gone. But it didn’t take my shape. It didn’t take my will. I’ve walked through it. I’ve been it. I know what it is now.”

“And?”

Toby smiled. Not a big one. Just enough. “It’s not finished.”

Jude opened the notebook to the last page. Slowly, carefully, he wrote in red ink:

Hollow — the name that remained.

And with that, Toby breathed a little easier.

The town would not remember everything.

Adults would explain away the returned children. The forest would be declared off-limits, and people would nod while ignoring their own advice. Rumors would circulate, then fade. Halloween would bring a new batch of stories. Another year would pass.

But the ledger grew.

Jude kept it safe, tucked behind his bookshelf, hidden between two novels. And every week, the boys added more names.

Not because they were at risk.

But because they deserved to be remembered.

Because a name not forgotten is a name that cannot be taken.

And somewhere, in the roots of the forest, something old and buried shifted ever so slightly—less in hunger, and more in recognition.

As if the Hollow itself was learning.

Not to forget.

But to forgive.

Chapter Seven: Tending the Garden

Autumn arrived with silence.

Not the sinister hush of breath held too long in the dark, but the quiet that comes after hard work and harder truths. The trees turned red and orange at the edges first, then bled their colors into the forest’s heart. Leaves fell like whispered names. Some drifted through the cracks in the new fence; others settled on the old trails, paths Toby and Jude had once taken without understanding where they led.

The forest no longer spoke to them.

Not the way it had.

Not with voices that curled like smoke or echoes that wrapped around their ears. It was quieter now, like something trying to remember how to be gentle.

They visited less often.

There was no need for nightly vigils or frantic rituals. No urgent need to outwit the forest’s riddles or barter for names. But neither of them felt like they could walk away completely. They had taken something from that place, something bigger than a boy’s identity or a brother’s memory.

They had taken responsibility.

So they came on Saturdays, notebooks tucked under their arms, salt in their pockets, just in case. They brought food offerings now and then—fruit, sweets, coins wrapped in cloth. Not because they believed the Hollow would demand them, but because they had learned that giving with no expectation was a kind of healing.

“Do you think it still watches us?” Jude asked one afternoon as they sat by the tree with the knot shaped like an eye.

Toby—no, Hollow now—shrugged. “If it does, I think it’s learning to look without taking.”

Jude nodded, then reached into his bag and pulled out the newest ledger. The first had filled up two weeks ago. This one had a black cover, a red ribbon bookmark, and his initials carved into the inside cover—not for protection, just for truth.

They added three more names that day.

Two from old school rosters. One from a memory Hollow had held onto—his grandmother’s name, the way she used to sign cards with a little star next to the J. Jude copied them in with his usual precision, then closed the book with quiet reverence.

“You ever wonder if we’re just stalling?” Hollow asked.

Jude looked over. “How do you mean?”

“If this is all temporary. A pause before it starts again. What if the Hollow wasn’t trying to hurt anyone? What if it was just becoming something else, and it had to pull people in to figure out how to shape itself?”

Jude considered that. “Like... a forest trying to grow a new kind of tree.”

“Or a story that doesn’t know how to end.”

They sat with that idea for a while, letting it stretch into the space between them.

The wind picked up, stirring leaves across the ground. Somewhere deeper in the woods, a bird called out, then fell silent again. The forest had not forgotten how to be mysterious. But it no longer felt like it was hiding.

Hollow ran his fingers over the bark of the knot-tree. “I still dream about it.”

“The Hollow?”

“Yeah. It looks different now. Brighter. Still weird, but not cruel. The doors are smaller. Some of the mirrors show stars instead of people.”

Jude smiled faintly. “You think it dreams of us too?”

“I think it’s remembering how to hope.”

They began writing new rules.

Not the ones scribbled in library margins or muttered through cracked mirrors. These weren’t warnings. They were instructions—invitations. A way forward. A way for anyone who came after them to walk through the forest without being consumed by it.

Jude kept the list pinned to the inside cover of the new ledger. It read:

    Leave no name unwritten.

    If you take something, leave something better.

    Never enter with fear as your guide.

    Speak your own name with pride—but keep a second for silence.

    Help others remember who they are.

    Mark what is sacred.

    Tend the garden.

They didn’t call it protection. That word felt too sharp, too close to walls and locks and fear. These rules weren’t about keeping something out.

They were about letting things become.

October came.

Then November.

One morning, Hollow woke up and found he could hear his name again—not the one he had given up, but the ones that Jude used. The ones others had started using, too.

Hollow. Scout. Gray.

None of them were what he’d been born with. But each of them carried a piece of him. Not as a possession, but as a reflection.

And maybe that was what names were always meant to be.

Not chains.

Not bargains.

But bridges.

The forest bloomed one last time before winter.

It was subtle. No one else noticed it. But the boys did.

Tiny flowers grew in the place where the mirror had cracked. Not from soil, but from memory—delicate buds shaped like stars, white as frost. They didn’t pick them. They didn’t photograph them.

They simply watched.

And then they walked home.

Back through the grass, past the swing set where it had all begun, Jude’s hand brushing the chains that still squeaked with the wind.

They didn’t say goodbye.

Because the forest was no longer a threat.

It was a promise.

And it would remember them.

The following weekend, Hollow found a photograph wedged into the storm drain near the school.

It was weathered—edges curled, ink bled—but still intact. A class picture, maybe three or four years old. Twenty-one children smiled from the risers, arms slung across each other’s shoulders, eyes blinking in mismatched rhythm. Their names were written in pen across the bottom, just as they always were: first names, last initials, a teacher’s neat, looping hand.

He recognized some.

Others felt like strangers.

One face, a girl in the back row with hair pulled tight in two perfect braids, made his breath hitch. She had never come back.

Not because they hadn’t tried.

But because no one remembered to look.

He carried the photo with both hands, gently, like it might crack if he held it too hard. After school, he walked straight to Jude’s house and laid the photo on the kitchen table between them.

“Who do you remember?” Hollow asked.

Jude leaned forward, studying the faces. “Elena. Calvin. Rafi. That’s Samir. There’s Dana. But... this girl—” he tapped the braided one, “—she’s not in any yearbook. I checked when I was researching.”

“She was marked.”

“You think she’s still there?”

“I think she never left,” Hollow said. “Because no one pulled her name back.”

Jude turned the photograph over. On the back, barely legible through the water-stained paper, was a faint signature: Maribel. The last name had vanished.

They sat in silence, the kind that settles only between people who’ve shared something too deep for casual words. Then Hollow reached into his backpack and pulled out the second ledger—the black one. He turned to a blank page and began to write.

Maribel — forgotten, not gone.

He underlined it once, slowly.

That night, they walked to the edge of the woods with a new plan.

Not to fight. Not to demand. Not to offer names.

But to ask.

They passed through the breach in the fence, no longer sneaking, no longer afraid. The air was crisp, and the earth had turned soft beneath the fallen leaves. The trees didn’t bend in anymore. They stood tall, reverent, like sentinels waiting for word.

The forest wasn’t gone.

But it was listening.

They didn’t follow the old trail. Instead, Hollow walked where the photo told him—up a slope he hadn’t seen before, past a twisted tree that had once moaned in the wind but now stood silent and dry. They came to a shallow depression filled with moss and stones, not quite a garden, not quite a grave.

And there she was.

Not in body. Not in voice.

Just in presence.

A space that knew its own silence.

“She was here,” Hollow said.

Jude stepped beside him. “Then let’s name her again.”

They took a piece of chalk from Jude’s coat and drew the circle in the moss. Not the spiral, n
