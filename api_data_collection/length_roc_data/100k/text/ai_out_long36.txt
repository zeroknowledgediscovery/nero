Title: The Green Flame

Chapter One: The Mireborn

Mud caked his boots, and not the usual slimy gray of the Slitherfen—but a darker, heavier muck that clung like regret. Skrag shuffled forward, hunched low, as if his shoulders had grown tired of bearing his own misfortune.

“Stupid rain,” he muttered, pulling the hood tighter over his crooked ears. “Stupid sun when it’s not rain. Stupid... everything.”

Skrag was a goblin, and by all accounts, a proper one. He picked his nose with vigor, had a fondness for shiny things of questionable value, and spoke with an accent thicker than treacle. He lived on the edge of Blightroot Mire in a hollowed-out badger den, where he kept a fine collection of rusted spoons and broken mirror shards. And he was perfectly content with that, more or less.

Until the sky burned green.

It happened on a Wednesday. Or maybe a Fangeday. Time kept no schedule in the mire, and days slipped past like eels. One moment, Skrag was gnawing on a firebeetle wing, the next he was staring at the heavens, mouth agape, as the clouds split and a column of emerald fire lanced down to the earth miles away, somewhere beyond the Jagtooth Hills.

“Wot in the swamp-mother’s backside…” he croaked.

Something in his chest quivered. Not fear. Not exactly. It was the sensation a rock might feel if it discovered it could bleed.

He didn’t sleep that night. The frogs croaked wrong. The fog drifted counterwise. Even the willowtrees whispered among themselves, leaves rustling with ill omen. Skrag tucked himself beneath his moldy blanket and tried to pretend the world hadn’t changed.

But it had.

—

The next morning, or perhaps two mornings later, a knock came at his door. An actual knock, not the usual skitter-scratch of a swamp rat testing boundaries. This was a real, polite, rhythmic knock. Skrag blinked.

“No one knocks,” he mumbled, squinting toward the burrow's mouth.

He peeked out and immediately regretted it. A human stood there. Tall. Cloaked in gray. Hair like silver spider silk and eyes that shimmered with moonlight. She did not smell like rot or fungi. She smelled like… fresh parchment and cold wind.

“Goblin Skrag?” she asked, voice too smooth.

“Nope,” he said, trying to shut the burrow. She jammed her boot in the door.

“You are the Mireborn,” she said.

“I'm the Mire-cleaned-at-best. Now piss off.”

She sighed. “You saw the flame.”

“I see a lot of things. Once I saw a rat dance a jig ‘cause it ate too much saproot. Not prophetic, just poison.”

She stepped inside, uninvited. Skrag hissed like a startled newt.

“You’re the one foretold in the Fragment of Clauvor,” she said.

“Fragment of whobah?”

She pulled a scroll from her cloak, unrolling it with solemn grace. It was old parchment, frayed and lined with symbols that squirmed under the eye. Goblin glyphs. Ancient ones. Ones even Skrag didn’t know he knew—yet as he stared, his lips moved of their own accord.

“Green shall blaze and green shall bleed, from dirt shall rise the one not seen. Small in foot, sharp of wit, cursed with fire—world's last spit.”

His voice broke on the final word.

The woman stared. “You can read it.”

Skrag blinked. “Guess I can. Huh. That ain’t good.”

—

By dusk, they were traveling. Her name was Thalia, a Seer from the Highwind Monastery. She had dreams. Of a world ending in flame, of cities turned to salt, of skies cracking like boiled eggs.

“And every time, the dream ends with you,” she said. “You stand alone before the Maw, wielding the Green Flame.”

“Sounds like a stupid dream,” Skrag muttered.

They passed through Briarfang Glade, where the trees grew thorns thicker than a goblin’s wrist. Thalia moved with grace. Skrag hacked his way through with a rusted cleaver.

“So what's the Maw?” he asked, panting.

“It’s not a what. It’s a who.”

“Even worse.”

As they camped by a stream that glowed faintly blue, Thalia told him of the Cataclysm Cycle—the ancient rhythms of destruction and rebirth. Every seven thousand years, the world trembled. But this time, something had gone wrong. The cycle stalled. The world began to rot.

“And the only thing that can restart the cycle,” she said, staring into the fire, “is the Green Flame.”

Skrag picked at his toes. “You sure it’s not, say, a really big dragon or an army or something useful?”

Thalia gave him a sad smile. “You were born under the Miremoon. During the stillborn eclipse. You speak the Glyph-Tongue. And you were marked.”

She pointed at his chest. Skrag looked down. His tunic had torn during the walk, revealing a birthmark—a twisted spiral of green over his heart. He’d always assumed it was just a fungus stain that never scrubbed off.

“Great,” he groaned.

—

Chapter Two: The Hollow Road

Traveling with a human was hard. Thalia never once stopped to catch fireflies or forage for stinkroot. She insisted on ‘making camp’ like a proper person—no burrows or hollow logs, just tents and cold ground. Skrag missed his damp, smelly den more than he thought possible.

Worse, he started dreaming.

He saw cities of glass melting under green light. He saw himself, dressed in black, standing on a mountain of bones, holding a sword made of screaming metal. And once—just once—he dreamed he was a child again, playing in the swamp, before the world had asked anything of him.

They reached the Hollow Road on the seventh day. It was a ghost path, older than kingdoms, carved into the hills by a vanished people. The stones were etched with faded warnings: “DO NOT WALK THE ROAD AFTER DARK” and “THE SLEEPING STILL DREAM.”

Naturally, they walked it after dark.

“I don’t like this,” Skrag said.

“You don’t like anything,” Thalia replied.

“Not true. I like mushrooms. And naps.”

Something screamed in the distance. A low, chittering cry like glass grinding in a blender. Thalia drew her staff. It glowed faintly with runes.

“Keep close,” she said.

Skrag clutched his cleaver. “I’m regretting everything.”

The first Hollow came just past the fork. It wore the shape of a man but was too tall, and its face was all wrong—no features, just a black void.

It lunged.

Thalia chanted in Aetheric. Her staff flared, and the Hollow screamed as light tore through it. Skrag swung wildly, catching a second creature in the knee. It stumbled, shrieking.

They ran.

Through black forests and along ancient stones. Skrag stumbled, twisted his ankle, and nearly fell into a pit, but they made it out—barely.

Panting, bruised, bleeding from a shallow cut on his shoulder, Skrag collapsed by the roadside.

“This hero stuff is crap,” he wheezed.

Thalia sat beside him, brushing soot from her robe. “No argument here.”

They didn’t speak much that night. Skrag watched the stars. He didn’t know their names, but they seemed to know his. One of them blinked green.

—

Chapter Three: The Keep of Broken Names

The Keep was a ruin.

It rose from the ash wastes like a bone through blistered skin. Black stone, scorched banners, and doors too big for any living race. The wind here spoke in whistles and sighs.

“Why’re we here?” Skrag asked.

Thalia hesitated. “To find someone.”

“Who?”

“A ghost.”

They entered through a crack in the wall, climbing over rubble. Inside, the Keep whispered. Not metaphorically—actual whispers. Names. Thousands of them. A tide of lost identities.

“This place was once the Vault of Memory,” Thalia explained. “Every soul had its name written here, to keep it from fading.”

“So where’d they all go?”

Thalia didn’t answer.

In the heart of the Keep stood a dais, and upon it a shard of green crystal. It pulsed as Skrag approached.

“Don’t touch it,” Thalia warned.

“Why not?”

“It’s a soulfire shard. It’ll burn your mind.”

Skrag touched it.

Pain.

Light.

Memory.

Not his.

He saw a battle—the last defenders of the Keep, holding the line against a tide of shadows. A woman in silver armor shouting orders. A child with a spiral birthmark being carried away.

He stumbled back, eyes wide. “I was here. I was here before.”

Thalia nodded. “Or someone like you. The Flame chooses vessels through time. You’re the latest. Maybe the last.”

Skrag sat down hard. “I want to go home.”

“You can’t.”

He looked up. “Why me?”

Thalia looked tired. “Because you were born at the wrong time, in the wrong place, and that’s often how heroes are made.”

Skrag wanted to scream. Instead, he whispered: “Then let’s finish this.”

—

They journeyed for three more days before the mire gave way to firmer land. The air grew clearer, less thick with spores and gnats, but Skrag felt like he was leaving something important behind. Not comfort—there had never been much of that in Blightroot—but familiarity. In the mire, he knew every fungus by taste, every toad by name. Out here, the ground was dry, the wind sharp, and the silence full of invisible things.

Thalia walked like she knew exactly where they were going, though she barely looked at the path. Her gaze was often distant, locked on some vision only she could see. Skrag noticed how the grass bent slightly wherever she stepped, even when there was no breeze. He didn’t like that. It reminded him of the time he accidentally ate dreammoss and hallucinated a council of beetles arguing politics in his ears for a week.

On the fourth night, they camped beside an ancient stone carved with runes neither of them could read. The stone radiated a low hum, like a kettle just before it whistles. Thalia warned Skrag not to sleep too close to it, but of course, he did anyway. He liked the warmth it gave off, and it reminded him of his old nest where heat would bubble up from the bogwater. He curled near it, wrapping himself in a ratty blanket, and tried to sleep.

The dream was different this time. No fire, no collapsing towers. He saw a glade full of towering mushrooms, their caps glowing a pale, bioluminescent blue. At the center stood a creature—taller than any goblin, but with the same sharp features, same bent ears and greenish skin. Its eyes were white, pupil-less, ancient.

“You bear the seed,” the figure said in a voice like sloshing mud. “You are last of the line.”

Skrag frowned in his sleep. “What line?”

“Of fire. Of soil. Of the forgotten pact.”

When he woke, the stone was cold. Thalia was already packing up, her expression unreadable.

“You looked troubled,” she said without looking at him. “Dreams?”

“I dreamt of some goblin king or ghost or… something,” Skrag muttered. “Said I had a seed or a pact or—I dunno, it all sounded important. I hated it.”

Thalia’s eyes flicked to him for a moment. “You should remember it. Dreams from the Stones are rare. And never without meaning.”

“I prefer the ones with flying weasels and rivers of gravy,” he grumbled.

They traveled west now, toward the jagged outline of the Jagtooth Hills. Skrag had never been that far before. Goblins didn’t often leave the mire, and when they did, the world usually tried to bite them. But Thalia seemed unfazed by the rough paths, the steep ridges, the thickening forests. She walked with purpose, and Skrag followed because, deep down, he was more curious than afraid.

Two nights later, they passed through a burned-out village. Nothing remained but blackened frames and the charred bones of buildings. No corpses. Just absence. The wind made the wood groan like old men muttering secrets. Skrag poked through the wreckage, half-hoping to find something shiny.

“Who did this?” he asked.

Thalia knelt beside a scorched threshold, fingers brushing the soot. “Ash-born. They move ahead of the Maw.”

“Sounds unpleasant.”

“They are memories made flesh. Remnants of those consumed by the Flame, twisted and reborn as hunger.”

“You’ve got the worst bedtime stories.”

Skrag found a cracked teacup and put it in his satchel. Not useful, not valuable, but it felt wrong to leave it there, alone in the ashes.

They didn't speak much that night. Even the fire they lit seemed reluctant to burn. Skrag sat cross-legged, cleaning his cleaver with an old rag, while Thalia whispered into the night in a tongue he didn’t recognize. Her voice was soft but firm, like she was bargaining with something old.

When he finally lay down, he whispered to himself, “Maybe if I keep walking, I’ll wake up back in my burrow and this’ll all be a big swampdream.”

But he didn’t believe it. Not anymore.

—

By the time they reached the foot of the Jagtooth Hills, Skrag had begun to change.

He hadn’t noticed it at first. But his eyes had sharpened. His night vision, once useful only in dim muck, now pierced through fog like lanternlight. His ears picked up sounds farther away, and his dreams—those damn dreams—were becoming clearer. More consistent. More like memories than fantasy.

On the morning of the ascent, they met another traveler. A dwarf, broad-shouldered, with arms like tree trunks and a hammer slung across his back that looked big enough to crush a wagon wheel in one swing. His beard was braided in silver and bone, and his eyes were the color of dying coal.

He squinted down at Skrag. “Well I’ll be. A goblin and a witch, walking together like it’s a spring picnic. The world truly is ending.”

Thalia inclined her head slightly. “We mean no harm. We seek passage through the Kral Spine.”

The dwarf chuckled. “No one seeks passage through the Spine, lady. They endure it. Still, you don’t look like bandits, and he…” He gestured at Skrag, who was picking his nose with studied disinterest. “Well, he looks like a walking excuse.”

“I’m Skrag,” the goblin offered helpfully. “And you smell like cheese.”

The dwarf laughed, a great booming sound that startled birds from the cliffs. “Name’s Borun. Borun Ironsleeve. I was on my way back to the mines of Telharr when I caught sight of that green flame three nights ago. Figured something old was waking up.”

“It is,” Thalia said.

Borun looked between them. “Then you’ll need someone who knows the hills. These paths haven’t been safe since the quake, and the mountain’s been groaning louder every year.”

Skrag eyed him suspiciously. “You just offering help for free?”

Borun snorted. “You wound me, goblin. But aye, maybe I’m a little curious. Been a long time since something important happened around here. And I’ve got a feeling that stone of yours is at the heart of it.” He pointed to the spiral mark on Skrag’s chest, now faintly visible even through cloth.

They climbed together, the dwarf leading with surprising agility for his bulk. The path twisted through jagged rocks, past caves that breathed cold air and whispered echoes, and over cliffs so narrow Skrag felt his knees lock. Thalia walked silently, her robes billowing like ghosts.

Midway through the third day, they were ambushed.

It happened fast. A shriek overhead. Shapes dropping from the cliffs—pale things with stretched limbs and mouths full of too many teeth. Their eyes were crusted shut, yet they moved with unnatural precision.

“Hollowed!” Borun roared, swinging his hammer and sending one flying.

Thalia raised her staff and chanted, her voice cracking like thunder. A wave of white light erupted outward, staggering the creatures. Skrag, not for the first time, panicked. But something in his hand glowed green, and when he swung his cleaver, it bit deeper than it should have, slicing through one of the attackers as if the bone were butter.

He stared at the weapon. It steamed.

The battle ended quickly. The creatures fled or crumbled, and the trio stood panting amid broken stones and ichor that hissed where it touched the ground.

Borun eyed Skrag. “That was no ordinary blade-work.”

“I didn’t do nothing different,” Skrag muttered, wiping the blade on his sleeve.

“Your flame is waking,” Thalia said. “It reacts to threat. To instinct.”

Skrag looked at his hands. “I didn’t ask for this.”

“No one ever does,” she said. “But sometimes, the world doesn’t ask permission either.”

They climbed in silence the rest of the day. The peaks of the Kral Spine loomed above them, jagged and cruel. Somewhere beyond those peaks, the world waited to end. And for reasons Skrag still didn’t understand, it was waiting for him.

By nightfall, they reached a narrow plateau where Borun insisted they make camp.

The fire crackled low. Skrag sat away from the others, staring at the stars, wondering which one held the answers he didn’t want.

Behind him, Thalia’s voice rose in quiet song. A hymn in the old tongue, soft as moss.

Skrag whispered to himself, “I don’t want to be special. I just wanted to eat bugs and nap in peace.”

But in the wind, something answered him.

Too late for that.

Chapter Two: Ash in the Veins

The next morning brought a sky the color of tarnished copper. The sun struggled to rise, its light slanting through the clouds in dull streaks, casting the jagged rocks of the Kral Spine in shades of rust and shadow. Skrag awoke stiff, his blanket crusted with frost. The fire had long since died. He sat up with a grunt, his joints popping like twigs.

Borun was already up, hammer across his lap, sharpening the edge with a flat stone despite it being a blunt weapon. He claimed it was tradition, though Skrag suspected he just liked the noise. Thalia stood at the cliff’s edge, silent, watching the horizon with an intensity that made Skrag’s stomach turn.

He scuttled over, chewing on a strip of dried toad jerky. “You always that broody in the morning, or is today special?”

She didn’t look at him. “There’s smoke rising to the west. The village of Embralei, if the map is right. It shouldn’t be burning.”

Skrag squinted. The thin black coil spiraled into the sky like a finger pointing to doom. “Maybe they’re having a big stew?”

Thalia gave no answer, which told Skrag everything he needed to know. Borun rose with a grunt, his armor clinking. “If there’s trouble, we ought to move. Roads near Embralei run straight to the Black Stair. No good getting trapped.”

Skrag’s feet dragged with reluctance as they broke camp. The trail wound down from the plateau, past frost-bitten ferns and into a narrow pass where wind moaned through cracks in the stone. He noticed something unsettling about the wind now—there was a rhythm to it, almost a chant. Like the mountains were whispering warnings, just below the edge of understanding.

By midday, they reached the village.

Or what remained of it.

The wooden palisades had been shattered inward, not outward. A dozen huts smoldered, their rooftops caved in. Black ash covered everything. The smell—like burnt hair and sweet rot—clung to the nostrils. Skrag stepped over a half-melted cart, his fingers twitching toward his cleaver.

Borun crouched by a ruin, touching the scorched ground. “No fire marks. Just—consumption. Like the heat came from within.”

Thalia moved quietly among the buildings, her face grim. She paused by a well, placing her hand on the stone rim. “The Flame passed through here,” she said. “But not naturally. Someone drew it.”

Skrag looked around. “What do you mean drew it? Like a map? A spell? A summoning?”

She nodded once. “Not all fire is wild. Some is called.”

It was near the outskirts of the village that they found the first sign of life—a child, or what had once been one. The figure sat upright in the dust, untouched by the fire, eyes open but empty. Its skin had gone translucent, veins like rivers of soot beneath glass.

Skrag recoiled. “Is it dead?”

“No,” Thalia whispered. “It’s Hollowing. Becoming something else.”

Borun raised his hammer, but she stopped him with a word. “Too late for mercy. We must move.”

They left quickly after that. Skrag didn’t ask questions. He felt like something watched them even after they’d turned away, something from inside the child’s empty eyes. The wind grew harsher as they descended the hills, and though the sun still hung in the sky, the light grew darker, as if filtered through smoke none of them could see.

—

They camped that night in an old watchtower, long abandoned by whatever kingdom had once guarded the path to the Black Stair. Moss clung to the stones like a second skin. Thalia warded the place with runes that glowed briefly before sinking into the walls.

Skrag sat on a broken stool, sharpening his cleaver—not that he knew what he was doing. It just felt like the right thing to do. The blade, once dull and pocked, now shimmered faintly along the edge, like something inside it had awakened.

Borun watched him from the other side of the room. “You ever kill before this? I mean, proper killing. Not traps or rats.”

Skrag didn’t answer right away. He thought back to the Hollowed things on the road, the way their flesh tore too easily, the steam rising from his hands afterward. “I tried not to,” he said at last. “Even in the mire. There’s ways to scare something off without sticking it.”

Borun nodded. “Good instinct. But instinct gets drowned when you carry a fire like yours.”

Thalia spoke then, her voice low but clear. “The Flame is not only destruction. It is memory. A record of all things that burned before. It chooses its bearer not for strength, but for endurance.”

“Then it made a mistake,” Skrag muttered.

“No,” she said. “It rarely does.”

The tower creaked in the wind. They slept uneasy.

—

The next morning, the road led them through the Brine Folds, a region of jagged canyons and salt-choked crevices. The earth here wept brine, and nothing grew. Once, a great inland sea had covered this land. Now it was a corpse, and the air tasted like old tears.

They passed beneath stone arches carved with faded symbols. Skrag paused to examine one—an image of a creature coiled in flame, not unlike a dragon but with a goblin’s face.

“See?” he said, tapping it. “Even ancient folks knew goblins were important.”

Thalia frowned. “That’s not a goblin.”

“Looks like one.”

“It’s a fireling—a creature born of the first Emberstorm.”

Skrag’s ears drooped. “Still looked like a goblin to me.”

They pressed on.

That afternoon, they encountered a caravan—what was left of it. A trio of wagons, scorched and abandoned. Horses long gone. Signs of struggle, blood on the sand, but no bodies. Skrag crouched by a broken wheel, inspecting the char marks.

“These people didn’t run,” he said. “They were pulled away.”

Borun checked one of the wagons and grunted. “Empty. Not just the cargo—everything. Not a spoon left.”

“Looters?” Skrag asked.

“Too clean,” the dwarf replied. “More like a harvest.”

They moved on with heavier steps.

That night, they didn’t light a fire.

Thalia told them stories instead—quiet ones, like lullabies. Tales of old guardians who walked the sky, of the Whispering Root beneath the mountains, of the first Flamebringer who sealed the Maw with her own soul.

Skrag listened with wide eyes. “You ever meet her?”

“That was five thousand years ago,” she said gently.

“Well, you seem the type who’s seen a lot.”

Borun chuckled. “He’s not wrong.”

Thalia smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes.

—

By dawn, they could see the Black Stair.

It wasn’t a staircase in the traditional sense. It was a sheer cliff face marked by a jagged scar that spiraled upward—a path carved not by hands, but by force, by something tearing its way out of the earth. At the summit loomed a gate of obsidian, flanked by two great statues half-buried in rubble.

Skrag stopped walking.

His legs wouldn’t move.

Thalia turned to him. “We have to go up.”

He shook his head. “Nope. No more. This is the edge. I’m not climbing into whatever that is.”

“It’s the only way forward.”

“Then maybe forward ain’t the way.”

Borun approached, resting a heavy hand on his shoulder. “You’re scared. That’s fair. But the world doesn’t stop turning because we’re not ready.”

Skrag looked up at the Black Stair. The wind howled through it like a chorus of ghosts. His chest ached. That spiral mark on his skin itched like fire beneath a scab. Somewhere inside, a voice whispered.

Go.

He swallowed hard. “Fine. But I’m not carrying anyone if we fall.”

“No one’s asking you to,” Borun grinned.

They climbed.

Each step felt like a decision. The path was narrow, the drop sheer. Thalia led with steady grace. Borun followed, his hammer strapped tight. Skrag brought up the rear, muttering every curse he knew.

Halfway up, the world changed.

The air grew thick, like breathing through wool. The sky dimmed, though the sun still burned above. Shadows lengthened against logic. Time felt stretched. Skrag stumbled and nearly fell, catching himself on a jagged rock. He turned to look down—and saw a second Skrag staring back.

But it wasn’t him.

Its eyes burned green.

He looked away and kept climbing.

At the top, they stood before the gate.

It opened without touch or sound, stone sliding back into the mountain as if it had simply grown bored of being closed.

Beyond was darkness. Not the absence of light—but the presence of something deeper. Something old. Skrag’s fingers curled around his cleaver, though it trembled now.

Thalia stepped forward.

“Are you ready?” she asked.

“No,” Skrag said honestly.

But he walked through the gate.

Because the world was ending.

And he was the only one left to burn it back to life.

—


The gate swallowed them.

Inside was not a tunnel, not a hallway, but something between—a winding throat of black stone and sighing echoes, the walls slick and warm as if the mountain itself still pulsed with a buried heartbeat. The further they went, the more the light dimmed. Even the glow from Thalia’s staff seemed to flicker with hesitation, as though uncertain whether it ought to illuminate what lay ahead.

Skrag pressed his back against the wall whenever the path narrowed, his breath shallow. The air carried a metallic scent, dry and sharp, like blood on hot iron. In the silence, every scuff of his boots against the stone felt deafening.

“This place isn’t right,” he muttered, eyes darting.

Borun grunted behind him. “Nothing ancient ever is.”

They descended into a wide chamber, the floor made of hexagonal stone tiles, cracked and worn. The walls were etched with deep carvings, but they weren’t ornamental. They were names—thousands, maybe more—scratched in various scripts, some human, some dwarven, some neither.

Thalia ran her fingers across the nearest names. “These are the ones who entered the Stair before us.”

Skrag squinted. “They make everyone sign in?”

“No,” she said softly. “These were scratched on the way out. Not all who pass through this place are devoured. Some return—but they leave part of themselves behind.”

Borun leaned on his hammer. “So where do we go now?”

“The spiral path continues beyond this chamber,” Thalia answered. “It will take us to the Threshold, where the Flame tests its chosen.”

“Of course it does,” Skrag muttered. “Because nothing simple ever happens to me.”

They moved onward. The next passage grew narrower still. The walls began to pulse faintly with a greenish light, in rhythm with Skrag’s heartbeat. He noticed it first in his peripheral vision—small motes of brightness, dancing along the edges of the tunnel. They looked like fireflies, but when he turned to them directly, they vanished.

“Thalia,” he whispered. “Something’s watching us.”

She didn’t answer right away. Then, in a tight voice: “It’s not watching. It’s remembering.”

Skrag almost turned around then and there.

The path widened again suddenly, opening into a cavernous space unlike any they had seen. This was no ruin. It was pristine, preserved—an amphitheater carved into the bones of the world. In the center rose a platform of white stone, surrounded by tall pillars of obsidian. Hanging above the dais, suspended by nothing, floated a massive sphere of emerald fire. It turned slowly, like a thought spinning through an ancient mind.

Thalia knelt. Borun bowed his head.

Skrag stared.

It was beautiful in the way a storm over the swamp was beautiful—uncontrollable, dangerous, alive. His knees buckled.

“That’s it,” he whispered. “That’s the Flame?”

“It’s the heart of it,” Thalia said. “Not the whole, but the part that calls to you.”

Skrag stepped forward, unsteady, pulled like driftwood to a current. The fire flared in response. His mark burned against his chest, sending waves of heat through his ribs. His thoughts swam. His fingers trembled.

Borun grabbed his arm. “Don’t step on the dais without thinking. Once you touch it, you begin the Trial.”

“I don’t even know what that means.”

“No one does,” Thalia said. “Each Trial is different. It shows you yourself, twisted and true.”

“Lovely,” Skrag grumbled. “That’s just what I needed. More of me.”

But still he stepped forward.

The moment his foot touched the dais, the room changed.

There was no sound, no sensation of movement. One blink he was in the chamber. The next—he was elsewhere.

He stood in the mire again, yet it was wrong. The colors too vivid, the shapes too perfect. Frogs croaked in rhythm, and the mist hung like silk. The sky overhead was green, rippling like water.

And across from him stood another Skrag.

Taller. Straighter. His eyes burned with certainty, his armor sleek and unfamiliar. The sword he held pulsed with the same fire that floated in the chamber above.

“You’re not real,” Skrag said.

The other Skrag tilted his head. “Aren’t I? I’m the you you’d be if you weren’t afraid.”

“That’s a big if.”

The doppelgänger didn’t smile. “You think this is a mistake. That you were chosen by accident. You want to believe you’re unimportant so you can walk away clean.”

Skrag’s mouth opened, but no words came.

“But deep down,” the figure continued, “you know you were always more. Even hiding in that stinking den, collecting spoons, you knew. You saw too much. Heard too much. The Flame chose you not because you’re brave, but because you’re real. Unvarnished. You know what it means to crawl.”

Skrag narrowed his eyes. “If you’re me, why’re you talking like you ate a poetry book?”

The other Skrag stepped forward. “Because I already passed the Trial.”

“Then what’s the point of this?”

The figure drew his sword. “To see if you can.”

They fought.

It wasn’t like the brawls in the mire, all teeth and elbows. This was something deeper—every blow a memory, every strike a question. They traded jabs and curses. Skrag’s cleaver clanged against the sword, sparks dancing in the green-lit air. He bled. He fell. He rose again.

He saw the child in the village. Saw the Hollowed faces. Saw Thalia’s sorrow and Borun’s burden. He saw his burrow, empty now. He saw himself—not special, not powerful—but willing.

That was the difference.

He didn’t win the duel. He didn’t need to.

He dropped his cleaver, looked his other self in the eye, and said, “I don’t want to be you.”

The sword stopped inches from his throat.

The figure smiled, for the first time.

“Then you’re ready.”

—

He collapsed back into his body, gasping. Thalia was at his side, her hand on his forehead.

“You were gone for nearly an hour.”

Skrag sat up. “Felt like a week.”

Borun offered him water, which he drank greedily. The fire above the dais now burned brighter. Thalia rose and extended a wrapped bundle.

“This is for you.”

Inside was a gauntlet, made of metal and leather, stitched with runes. It pulsed with heat. Skrag slid it over his right hand, and it adjusted to his size with a hiss.

“It will let you wield the Flame,” she said. “Not command it. No one commands fire. But it will let you survive it.”

Skrag flexed his fingers. The metal glowed briefly.

Borun nodded. “You’re marked now. There’s no hiding anymore.”

Skrag stood, swaying. “There never was.”

They left the chamber by a different path—one that had not existed before. The walls shimmered, shifting behind them. The mountain closed its mouth.

They emerged into sunlight, though it felt like a different world. The wind smelled of ash and pine. Below them, to the south, sprawled a dark forest—dense, thick, ancient.

“Where to now?” Skrag asked.

Thalia pointed to the forest. “Through the Wyrdwood. Then into the Vale of Embers. The Maw waits beyond.”

Skrag sighed. “Lovely. More places that sound like death.”

But he followed them.

Because now the fire lived in him.

And the world had begun to burn.

Chapter Three: The Wyrdwood

The forest began without warning.

One moment, the trio was descending a rocky slope littered with scree and sun-bleached bones, and the next they stepped beneath an arch of twisted, barkless trees that bent toward each other like gossiping crones. The light changed instantly—cooler, green-tinted, as though filtered through water or memory. Birds did not sing. No insects buzzed. The silence in the Wyrdwood was not the absence of sound but the presence of listening.

Borun adjusted the grip on his hammer and muttered under his breath. Skrag, who usually welcomed silence—especially after too much of Thalia’s long-winded prophecy talk—found this quiet oppressive. The trees were too still. Their roots coiled above the ground like muscles, and their branches never moved, not even when wind gusted through the ravines behind them.

Thalia walked with purpose but slower now, her usual confidence weighted by something more cautious. “Stay on the path,” she said. “Even when it disappears.”

Skrag snorted. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“The Wyrdwood shifts,” she replied. “It doesn’t like strangers. It tests them.”

Borun grumbled. “I’d sooner test my beard in a firepit. Last time I was here, the trees tried to make me believe I was my own grandmother. Took me three days to shake the vision.”

Skrag blinked. “You look like someone’s grandmother.”

“Watch it, bograt.”

Still, they stayed together, following a faint path of flattened moss and faded stone slabs, half-swallowed by earth. Skrag noticed strange things—the way tree trunks flickered with images when he stared too long. He saw a vision of his old burrow, perfectly intact, even down to the chipped pot where he kept fermented mushrooms. Another tree showed a younger version of himself, sitting beside an older goblin with kind eyes he didn’t remember ever meeting.

“Don’t touch them,” Thalia warned, watching him.

“Didn’t plan on it,” he muttered. “Just… they keep showing me things.”

“They show what you want most,” she said, voice low. “Or what you fear. The Wyrdwood draws from you.”

They marched until the light began to dim further, though the sky was still barely visible above the dense canopy. Skrag wasn’t sure how long they had been walking—hours, maybe days. His stomach growled, but he didn’t feel hunger. His legs ached, but he didn’t tire.

Eventually, they reached a clearing. At its center stood a tree unlike the others—its bark glistened like obsidian, and its branches hung low, nearly touching the ground. From one branch dangled a rope with no end, fraying into smoke as it descended.

The three of them stopped, unsure.

“This wasn’t on any map,” Borun muttered.

“It wouldn’t be,” Thalia said.

Skrag tilted his head. “This a tree or a warning?”

Before anyone could answer, the rope stirred.

From the smoke coalesced a figure—tall, draped in tattered moss, a face hidden behind a mask of polished wood carved into a serene, expressionless smile. The mask tilted slightly, observing.

“Fire-bearer,” it said, voice as dry as cracking leaves. “Why do you come into the forgotten root?”

Thalia bowed slightly. “We seek passage through the Vale of Embers.”

The figure’s head turned. “And what does the flame want with ash?”

Skrag stepped forward, throat dry. “I didn’t ask it to want anything. It found me. I’m just trying not to die.”

A rustle passed through the clearing—leaves shivered though there was no wind. The figure stepped forward, and Skrag noticed its feet did not touch the ground.

“You carry the ember unborn,” it said. “That which remembers and yet has not lived.”

Borun narrowed his eyes. “Is that supposed to make sense to anyone but you?”

“Silence, stoneblood,” the figure intoned. “This forest remembers the first flame and the last. It knows what you do not.”

Thalia placed a hand on Skrag’s shoulder. “Let him speak. This is the Heart-Watcher.”

The name meant nothing to Skrag, but the weight of it pressed on his chest. The Heart-Watcher circled them once, trailing thin wisps of mist. When it stopped again, it faced Skrag directly.

“You seek the Maw. You seek the end.”

“I seek to stop it,” Skrag said.

“No,” the Watcher replied. “You seek to understand it. That is why you were chosen. Not to destroy, but to remember. To rekindle what was lost.”

Skrag shook his head. “I’m not a scholar. I’m not a hero. I lived in a hole and collected trash.”

“Even rot becomes soil,” the Watcher said. “Even refuse feeds the root.”

There was a pause, and then the branches of the tree above bent lower, nearly touching Skrag’s head.

“Will you drink?” the Watcher asked.

Skrag blinked. “What?”

Borun growled, “That sounds ominous.”

A hollow opened in the tree’s trunk, revealing a bowl of dark liquid, still as obsidian. The surface rippled with shifting shapes—faces, flames, and finally, a small green light.

“It is memory,” the Watcher said. “It will not lie, but it may wound. If you drink, the forest will let you pass.”

Skrag hesitated. Then, with a resigned sigh, stepped forward and scooped the liquid into his hands.

It tasted like smoke and sweetness, like tears and childhood. Then the world tilted.

—

He stood in a house.

Not his own. This was stone, with tapestries on the wall and a fire in the hearth. A goblin child sat at a table, drawing symbols in the dust. Across from him, a woman—older, regal in posture—spoke softly.

“You have the fire in you, my son,” she said. “Not yet, not for years. But when the time comes, you must remember who you are.”

The child looked up. “But I’m just Skrag. I’m not anything.”

“You are everything,” she replied.

The scene shattered.

He saw battles—hundreds of them. A line of goblin warriors, painted in soot and sap, facing down a tide of fire-walkers. He saw the same spiral mark, painted on every brow. He saw the flame passed from hand to hand, a gift and a burden.

He saw a throne of roots, and a crown of glowing fungus.

He saw himself—older, cloaked in black and green, standing before a council of beings he couldn’t name.

Then, silence.

When he opened his eyes, he was back in the clearing.

He gasped, falling to his knees. Borun caught him.

“What did you see?” Thalia asked gently.

“Too much,” Skrag croaked. “But also not enough.”

The Heart-Watcher nodded. “You remember now. You are of the Rootline. Descended from the Flamekeepers who first bound the Maw.”

“I didn’t ask to be part of any line,” Skrag muttered. “I just wanted peace.”

“Peace is the reward of those who endure the fire,” the Watcher replied. “You are not finished. But the forest will not stop you.”

The tree behind the figure split with a groaning sound, revealing a narrow path of stone, glowing faintly beneath a canopy of vines.

“Go,” the Watcher said. “The world waits.”

They passed through without further word. The path did not shift or mislead them now. The forest watched, but it did not test. Whatever it had wanted to know of Skrag, it had found.

As they emerged into the twilight of the outer wood, Skrag looked back once. The clearing was already gone.

He didn’t speak of what he saw for a long time.

Not until the Vale.

—

The landscape beyond the Wyrdwood was desolate.

The Vale of Embers stretched for miles—an expanse of cracked earth and crumbled ruins half-buried in ash. Columns of black stone jutted from the ground like shattered bones. Occasional bursts of fire erupted from vents in the earth, sending steam and cinders skyward.

“This was once a city,” Thalia said. “The capital of Calvoran.”

Skrag frowned. “Never heard of it.”

“It was buried before your kind had words,” she said. “A civilization that tried to hold the Flame. It broke them.”

They moved slowly, feet crunching over glassy debris. The heat rose in waves, not unbearable but constant, like a fever under the skin. Skrag’s gauntlet pulsed again, glowing gently as if feeding on the air itself.

As they passed a toppled tower, Borun paused.

“Something’s here.”

He was right. The ground trembled faintly. From beneath a pile of ash, a shape rose—tall, vaguely human, but wreathed in fire that flickered too slowly. Its face was a mask of fused metal. It raised an arm, and the Flame in Skrag’s gauntlet flared in answer.

“Ash-born,” Thalia said grimly. “Drawn to the Emberbearer.”

The creature lunged.

Borun met it head-on, hammer singing. Sparks flew. Thalia chanted, casting runes into the air that burst in waves of frost. Skrag stood frozen for a moment, heart pounding.

Then he raised his gauntlet.

The fire responded. Not wild, but clear—focused. A green flame erupted from his palm and struck the Ash-born square in the chest. It howled, a sound like a wind screaming through hollow bones. Then it burst into cinders and was gone.

Skrag stood panting, his arm smoking. Borun clapped him on the shoulder. “Now that was a proper hit.”

Thalia gave him a long look. “The Flame is waking in you faster than I expected.”

“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Skrag said.

“You don’t have to,” she replied. “Just don’t stop.”

The wind shifted.

Far across the Vale, beyond broken statues and melted gates, a mountain of black stone loomed.

At its heart, a mouth.

The Maw.

Skrag’s flame flickered.

And it whispered, Come home.

—

They made camp that night beneath the skeletal remains of a stone archway, one of the last standing structures before the true descent into the Vale. The broken ribcage of some ancient gate jutted from the earth like the knuckles of a buried titan. The fire was small, more for formality than warmth—here in the emberlands, heat needed no coaxing. The very rocks seemed to radiate a slow, simmering energy that settled in the bones and refused to leave.

Skrag sat with his back against a chunk of basalt, knees pulled to his chest, eyes fixed on the fire. It danced strangely—too slow, too steady, the green tinge from his gauntlet giving the flames an eerie sheen. He hadn't spoken much since the encounter with the Ash-born. Not out of fear or confusion, but something more elemental. That scream—the sound of something unraveling—had rung in his ears long after the cinders faded.

Thalia stirred a pot of broth over the flame, the steam thick with the scent of mountain herbs. She hummed under her breath, the same hymn she sang back in the watchtower. Borun sharpened his hammer again, not for effect this time, but as a ritual of calm. The steady scrape of whetstone on metal was almost soothing.

“I keep thinking about what it said,” Skrag finally muttered.

Borun looked up. “The Ash-born?”

Skrag nodded. “Didn’t have words, but I felt it. Like it knew me. Like it hated me, not because of what I did, but because of what I am.”

Thalia poured a portion of broth into a cracked cup and passed it to him. “The Ash-born were once people. Men. Women. Goblins. Dwarves. All taken by the Maw. It reshapes them, hollowing out what was true and filling it with fire.”

“Why?”

Thalia hesitated, then said, “Because that’s what the Maw is. It devours meaning. Turns memory to ash.”

Skrag sipped the broth and grimaced. “This tastes like boiled rope.”

Borun grunted. “It is boiled rope.”

They sat in silence a while longer, each staring into the fire. The quiet wasn't peaceful—just weary. The kind of quiet that wraps around you after a long day of carrying things that don't belong to you.

That night, Skrag dreamed again.

This time he stood not in the mire, nor in a battlefield of fire—but in a library. A massive one, stretching into impossible heights. Books lined every surface, some bound in wood, others in scales, others in translucent skins that shimmered with stored light. The air was thick with dust and song, and from the shadows came a voice.

“You carry the last story,” it said. “The last true one.”

Skrag turned. A figure sat at a table, quill in hand, its face hidden beneath a hood of green flame. “Your life is the closing chapter. And chapters are not always fair.”

“I don’t want to be a story,” Skrag said.

“No story does,” the figure replied. “Until it ends.”

He woke before dawn, heart pounding.

—

By midday they reached the edge of the Inner Vale.

It was a basin, a vast crater ringed with cliffs and crags, the air thick with rising smoke. The black mountain loomed at the center, impossibly tall, its peak lost in a crown of ever-burning cloud. Lava ran in rivers down its sides—not red, but green. Sickly and luminous, like the blood of something ancient.

At its base yawned the Maw.

It was not a mouth in the literal sense. No lips, no teeth. Just a vast, circular absence in the rock, as if something had swallowed the world inward. Fire belched from its core, but it wasn’t heat that made Skrag’s skin crawl—it was memory. Raw, unfiltered memory, screaming in echoes too vast to parse. It was like standing beside every funeral pyre ever lit.

“This is it,” Thalia said, her voice small against the scope of it all.

Borun shaded his eyes. “Can’t believe we came all this way to jump into a glorified cave.”

“It’s not a cave,” Thalia said. “It’s a wound. A place where the world broke itself open.”

Skrag didn’t answer. He stared at the flame and felt it stir within him, not violently, but like a beast long-chained, sensing the end of its leash. The gauntlet on his arm had turned hot, the sigils glowing brighter than ever.

They descended the final slope without speaking. The ash clung to their boots, soft as flour. The sky above them roared without thunder. And as they approached the rim of the Maw, a figure stepped from the shadows.

It was cloaked in black, its face hidden behind a mask of bone, smooth and featureless. It held no weapon, and yet the heat warped around it like a shield.

Thalia stepped forward. “Guardian,” she said.

The figure inclined its head. “Seer.”

Borun growled. “Another talky type. Figures.”

The figure turned to Skrag. “Flamebearer. We have waited.”

“I didn’t ask you to,” Skrag said.

“And yet you came.”

Skrag looked at the rim. “Do I have to fight you?”

“No. Your fight is within.”

The guardian stepped aside.

Thalia placed a hand on Skrag’s shoulder. “Once you enter, we cannot follow. The Maw tests all who touch its fire.”

Skrag took a deep breath. “You’ve said that before.”

Borun frowned. “And it’s never sounded good.”

Thalia looked into his eyes. “You can still turn back.”

Skrag shook his head. “No. I can’t. Not anymore.”

He stepped past them and crossed the threshold.

—

The world turned inside out.

There was no floor, no ceiling. Fire curled through nothingness, shaping images from his mind. He floated, then fell, then floated again. A thousand voices whispered his name. He saw the faces of every creature he’d encountered—Thalia, Borun, the Watcher, the child in the burned village, the other Skrag. All of them turned to ash.

He landed on something solid. A platform of memory. And in front of him stood his worst fear.

Himself.

But not twisted, not heroic.

Just… ordinary.

The mire-stained goblin who ran from his shadow and hoarded spoons.

“This is who you are,” the echo said. “And you’re not enough.”

Skrag stepped forward. “Maybe not.”

“You’re weak.”

“I was.”

“You’re alone.”

“I was.”

The figure trembled, and the fire in Skrag’s gauntlet surged. The flame wrapped around him—not burning, not searing, but holding. It became armor. Memory made real. He felt the power rise—not to destroy, but to endure.

He raised his hand.

The echo shattered.

The Maw screamed.

—

Above, on the edge of the crater, Thalia fell to her knees.

The flame erupted from the depths, a column of green fire taller than any mountain, silent and furious. It did not burn the land—it purified it. The ash peeled away. The sky cleared. For the first time in centuries, the sun touched the Vale.

When it faded, Skrag stood at the edge, breathing heavily.

Borun stared. “You came back.”

Skrag nodded. “Had to.”

Thalia looked at him. “Did you see it?”

“All of it,” he said. “It wasn’t about power. It was about remembering. About refusing to forget what matters.”

They stood together in silence.

The fire no longer raged.

And the world, finally, exhaled.

—

Chapter Four: Cinders and Crowns

The Vale healed slower than it burned.

In the days following Skrag’s descent into the Maw, the land seemed to sleep. No more eruptions scarred the earth, no more fire-born husks crawled from ash-heaps. The cracked plains cooled. Lava hardened to black glass, and steam stopped seeping from the broken ground. What remained of the ancient city of Calvoran emerged from beneath the soot like the bones of something long buried. No birds returned, no trees regrew, but the wind no longer screamed, and that alone was enough to stir unease.

Skrag stood alone on a ridge above the basin, overlooking the gaping wound that had, until recently, been the source of the world’s slow death. The Maw had not closed—it could not—but its hunger had abated. For the first time, the abyss did not reach for him.

He stared into its depths, gauntlet still smoking gently, and felt… nothing.

Not peace.

Not triumph.

Something else.

A tired sort of knowing.

Behind him, Borun coughed pointedly, scuffing one heavy boot in the gravel. “You gonna stand there all day looking poetic, or are we going to talk about what comes next?”

Skrag didn’t turn. “What does come next?”

Borun sighed. “Usually, when someone saves the world, there's a feast. Drums. Bad singing. You get a chair with a back on it and a title no one understands.”

“I don’t want any of that.”

Thalia approached from the other side of the ridge. She had changed since the Maw. Her eyes held the same weary focus, but the fear had gone. The flame no longer burned in her aura, and her staff no longer pulsed. Something about her felt finished.

“Whether you want it or not,” she said, “the world will come looking for its hero.”

“I’m not a hero,” Skrag muttered.

“You say that like it matters,” she said gently. “You stepped into the Maw and came out whole. That's a story now. It belongs to others as much as it belongs to you.”

Skrag finally turned to face them. “But the flame—it's still here.” He touched his chest, the place where the mark had once glowed brightest. Now it was quiet, dormant, but he could feel it like a second heartbeat.

“It will always be there,” Thalia said. “The Green Flame is not something you release. It's something you become.”

Borun folded his arms. “So what? Is he some kind of walking firebomb now? Or a god?”

“Neither,” Thalia said. “He is a keeper. One who remembers so others can forget.”

That idea sat poorly with Skrag.

He was good at forgetting. He’d spent most of his life pretending the past didn’t matter. But the Trial in the Maw had taken that from him. He did remember now. The faces of the fallen. The line of goblin flamebearers stretching back across the eons. The throne of roots beneath the mire. A legacy buried, overwritten by centuries of disdain and dismissal.

“You said before that goblins used to be part of something greater,” he said quietly. “Flamekeepers. Guardians. Is that true?”

Thalia nodded.

“Then why doesn’t anyone remember?”

“Because when the last Flamekeeper fell, the world let the memory die. The kingdoms rewrote their stories. The victors always do.”

Borun spat. “Typical.”

Skrag's fingers tightened. “Then maybe it’s time we write it back.”

The dwarf chuckled. “You? Start a history project?”

“Why not?” Skrag shrugged. “I’ve got a fire inside me and a world that’s forgotten what came before. I figure it’s my turn to teach.”

Thalia smiled. “You would not be the first reluctant prophet.”

“Don’t call me that,” Skrag groaned.

“Fine. Sage of the Soot?”

“Nope.”

“Flamefather?”

“That’s worse.”

“Green One of the Emberbound?”

“I will walk into another Maw, I swear it.”

They laughed—Thalia with grace, Borun with a belly-deep growl, and Skrag because the sound of it reminded him that he was still alive.

—

They traveled north, away from the mountain, into the lesser hills that marked the edge of the fractured world. No longer did they fear Hollowed things or flame-ghosts. The roads, though broken, were empty now, and the sky was less bruised. Skrag had never known peace to feel so strange.

At night, they slept in ruins or beneath the stars. Skrag took to recording things—scratches in stone, lines in dirt, later in a tattered notebook Thalia found in an abandoned outpost. He didn’t write well, but he wrote honestly. Lists of names. Fragments of songs. Stories he half-remembered from dreams that might have belonged to long-dead ancestors.

He wrote about goblins who lit torches when the world was dark.

About fire that healed, not destroyed.

About the time he walked into the Maw and saw himself.

One evening, as the stars blinked into view, he found Thalia sitting alone with the wind in her hair, her staff laid beside her like a retired sword.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, approaching slowly.

“Dangerous habit,” she replied without looking.

“If the Maw’s quiet now, what do you do?”

She exhaled. “I rest.”

“Just rest?”

“I’ve fought long enough. My dreams no longer burn. That’s enough for me.”

He sat beside her, knees hugged to his chest.

“You ever think about going back?”

“To the monastery?”

“To before. When you were just a girl with a name and no visions.”

Thalia shook her head. “I don’t think I was ever just that. Even as a child, I saw too much. I think that’s why I believed in you.”

“I wouldn’t have believed in me.”

“That’s why it worked.”

—

They reached the edge of the Worldscar a week later. There, the land split not from fire but from time—a rift where the continents had once fractured in the great quake. Old trade roads vanished into chasms, and mountains bent like broken fingers. Beyond lay the kingdoms: Helvran, Maloth, the river cities. Skrag could see their lights distantly at night, flickering dots against the void.

Borun pointed across one evening and said, “That way leads to noise.”

“I’m used to noise,” Skrag replied.

Thalia packed her things slowly that night. “The Flame will call again someday. Not now. Not for years, perhaps centuries. But it will stir, and the Maw may open.”

“And someone else will have to do what I did,” Skrag said.

“Maybe.”

He looked out at the lights. “But maybe this time, they won’t be alone.”

—

In the town of Briarhold, word spread like pollen.

A goblin came out of the ashlands, bearing a story in his hand and a green light in his eyes. He didn’t speak like a prophet or act like a king. He told jokes. He made strange tea. He taught children how to light fires that did not burn, only glow.

They gave him a room above the blacksmith’s.

They gave him space.

He wrote every night, pages and pages.

A history of things forgotten.

Of fire, and rot, and the roots beneath the world.

When travelers came asking if the tale of the Mireborn was true, he would squint and scratch his chin and say, “Nope. That Skrag fella? Total fraud. Lucky, really. Slipped on a rock and accidentally saved us all.”

And the children would laugh.

And the flame would flicker gently behind his eyes.

—

Far below, in a cave untouched by light, something shifted.

Not the Maw.

Something older.

It stirred once, then settled.

Waiting.

Not for destruction.

But for the next story.

And the next fool to carry fire.

—

Word traveled faster than footsteps, especially when wrapped in mystery. It didn’t take long before rumors of the goblin who survived the Maw reached the taverns of trade routes and the corners of courtly halls. They called him a fire-saint, a prophet of soot, a bringer of balance. Most of it was nonsense, embroidered by bards and drunkards who had never seen a goblin up close, let alone one bearing the Green Flame. Some claimed he had wings of ash. Others said he turned entire armies with a single gesture. One traveling merchant swore she saw him riding a great salamander made of stone.

Skrag, of course, knew none of this. He was too busy learning how to make stew that didn’t smell like wet roots.

Life in Briarhold had settled into a rhythm so unlike the swamp that it sometimes frightened him. Mornings came with warmth and dry air, not fog and gnats. There were markets with people who didn’t immediately throw rocks when they saw a goblin. Children peeked at him from behind barrels or under benches, wide-eyed and giggling when he pretended to growl and chase them off with a soup ladle.

He kept writing. In the evenings, he sat by the fire and copied what he remembered—legends from the Trial, fragments of glyphs that had whispered to him in the Maw. His handwriting was crude, but the words were steady. Memory, he had learned, was a kind of magic. The kind that didn’t need fire or chanting, only honesty.

Still, not everyone welcomed him.

There were whispers. A goblin with power was not something most folk were comfortable with. Even if they smiled at him in the market, they watched him leave. Even if they nodded at his stories, they gripped their coin purses a little tighter. The old habits of the world were not so easily burned away.

One afternoon, a stranger arrived in town.

He was tall, robed in red and brown, with hands like bark and a symbol sewn into his chest—an eye ringed in flame. He didn’t speak much when he arrived, only asked the innkeeper, “Where is the one who came from the Maw?”

The man was polite, his coins clean. That bought him directions.

Skrag met him in the public house, seated beside the stove with a bowl of boiled turnip and barley. He eyed the stranger warily as he entered, noting the silent way he moved, the way the other patrons seemed to unconsciously lean away from him.

“Can I help you, or are you just here to smell bad soup?” Skrag asked.

The man sat across from him. His voice was quiet, cracked with dryness. “You are the bearer of the last ember.”

“I’m a goblin with a bad knee and indigestion.”

“You carry the Flame. I felt it. Even this far north, it sings.”

Skrag squinted. “You with the Ash-born?”

“No,” the man said. “Worse. I’m what they left behind.”

Skrag set his spoon down slowly. “You’d better explain before I start yelling.”

The man removed his hood. His face was human, but barely. His skin was lined like burnt paper, his eyes glowing faintly green—not like the Fireborne Skrag had fought, but as if the flame had never quite left him. A mark, like the spiral on Skrag’s own chest, curled over his temple, warped and faded.

“I am a Remnant,” the man said. “There were others, before the Maw fully woke. We were drawn to its promise. Touched by it, but not consumed.”

“And now?”

“We wait,” he said. “We remember. Some of us want to rebuild. Others want to finish what the Maw started.”

Skrag leaned back, hand resting near the gauntlet hanging from his belt. “And what do you want?”

“To warn you.”

“About what?”

“The fire may rest, but it is never gone. The Maw quieted because you reminded it of its first purpose—but that memory will fade. And when it does, the world will forget again.”

Skrag was quiet for a long moment. “So what, I’m supposed to spend the rest of my life yelling at people not to light the wrong torch?”

“No,” the man said. “You’re meant to teach. Pass the flame, not as power—but as truth.”

Skrag nodded slowly. “You’re not wrong. But if you’re trying to start a cult, I’m not your goblin.”

The man smiled, and it was not unkind. “No cult. Just history. Keep writing.”

And he left, just like that. Gone before the next bowl of soup could finish boiling.

—

Skrag did not forget the warning.

That night, he added a new section to his notes—less story, more instruction. A memory of fire, bound not in fear but in care. A guide, in his own crooked language, for those who might one day find the Flame again.

He called it “The Emberbook.”

When Thalia returned months later, cloaked in travel dust and bearing scrolls from lands Skrag had only half-heard of, she found him asleep at his desk, pages spread around him like fallen leaves.

“You’re writing a grimoire?” she teased.

He snorted awake. “I’m writing a reminder. Something to read when everyone forgets again.”

She sat across from him, examining the pages. “Some of this is quite good.”

“I’ve got a thesaurus now,” he said proudly.

“You know how to use it?”

“No, but it’s heavy, so I just throw it at problems.”

They laughed again.

It was a good sound.

She told him news from the world—cities rebuilding, orders forming around old truths, not as tyrannies, but as collections of remembrance. Small fires lit in small corners. She even met another goblin in the east who’d read Skrag’s name carved into a burned doorframe and thought it was the name of a myth.

“Close enough,” Skrag said.

—

The years passed strangely.

Borun returned to his mountain home, where tunnels opened to new veins and dwarves sang old songs with new verses. Thalia wandered again, leaving journals in hidden places, writing prophecy not as threat but as story, wrapped in lullabies and lessons.

Skrag remained in Briarhold. The town changed slowly around him. The children he scared with spoons grew into teenagers who asked hard questions, then adults who brought their own children to hear the old goblin talk about a fire that remembered. Some of them didn’t believe. Others believed too much. Skrag treated both with the same dry humor and caution.

One spring, he climbed a hill behind the town, gauntlet long since dulled, and planted a single green stone at the summit. When asked what it meant, he just said, “That’s where I’ll light the signal, if the Maw wakes again.”

“Is that likely?” the girl asked.

“Not yet,” Skrag said. “But the world’s got a short memory. Just like goblins.”

He smiled.

And the wind carried it.

—

Far below the crust of the world, past roots and stone and sleeping embers, a glow pulsed once more. Not in anger. Not in hunger.

But in readiness.

It remembered a goblin who faced it without trying to conquer it.

And it waited.

For the next bearer.

For the next memory.

For the next fire.

—

Chapter Five: The Root of Fire

In the final days of the long summer, the earth itself seemed to breathe deeper. Leaves refused to turn. Rivers ran lower but more steadily, carrying warmth from places that should have already cooled. Across the wide and recovering lands, elders whispered that something was different in the soil. That it hummed faintly underfoot, as if seeds long forgotten were stirring without permission.

And somewhere, in a burrow beneath a house that used to belong to a blacksmith—though it now held a small library and a truly absurd number of carved spoons—a goblin dreamed of roots.

Skrag sat up gasping, sweat slicking the back of his neck despite the breeze rolling in through the cracked window. The dream was still fresh in his chest like a bruise. He had stood beneath the mire again, deeper than before, where the water became thick as tar and the trees bled green sap from their cores. Something down there had been calling. Not shouting, not demanding. Just… calling. And he had answered.

He wrapped himself in his patched cloak and stepped out into the night. Briarhold was asleep, the lanterns dimmed, the quiet hum of crickets replaced by a strange stillness. Not ominous—just waiting.

The hill behind town looked different in the moonlight. The stone he’d placed there seasons ago—the signal marker—was glowing faintly. Not pulsing like it had when the Maw stirred, but warming, like a coal remembered.

He touched it.

And felt something move through him. Not a vision, not the Trial. Something else.

Beneath the mountain, beneath the Maw, beneath the world… something old was waking up. But this time, it wasn’t fire.

It was root.

—

He didn’t wait for the morning.

By dawn, he had packed what he could—his notes, a clean pair of socks, three different dried fungi that might be edible, and his old cleaver, which hadn’t seen use in years. The gauntlet still fit, though the metal had tarnished and the leather cracked in places. It glowed once, then settled. Ready.

By the second hour past sun-up, Thalia arrived.

She didn’t knock. She never did. He opened the door to find her waiting with travel packs and her staff newly bound in vines.

“You felt it too?” she asked.

“It’s not fire this time,” Skrag said.

“No,” she agreed. “It’s older than fire. And deeper.”

Borun arrived later that day, dragging a cart full of provisions and complaining about knees and bad roads and prophecies that refused to stay fulfilled.

“I told you,” he grunted, “let the world rot on its own. But no, you had to plant a glowing rock.”

“You brought cheese,” Skrag pointed out.

Borun scowled. “I bring cheese to all end-of-the-world parties.”

They left before noon.

—

Their journey took them east, beyond the stone paths and familiar ruins, through the heart of the midlands where the fields had started yielding strange flowers no one remembered planting. Villages along the way had already begun to notice the change. Crops grew faster but tasted off. Trees leaned in directions that defied the wind. Children claimed to hear singing beneath the earth when they laid down to sleep.

In one town, a man showed them a gourd that pulsed with a heartbeat.

In another, an orchard had bloomed in a single night, fruit ripening and falling in silence, never rotting, just sitting in soft piles like offerings to something unseen.

“It’s not the Maw,” Thalia confirmed, running her hand across the stone of an abandoned well. “It’s something else entirely. Something that was buried when the Maw was born.”

“Something worse?” Borun asked.

Thalia looked to Skrag.

“Not worse,” Skrag said. “Not yet. But it’s hungry.”

—

They reached the Mire by the fourteenth day.

The swamps of Blightroot were different now. The trees still loomed, the air still buzzed with insect songs, but the decay that had once defined it was… sweeter. New shoots coiled through the mud in unfamiliar spirals. The mushrooms pulsed in patterns. The fog didn’t just drift; it followed.

Skrag led them through without hesitation. The paths of his youth had been swallowed long ago, but the land still knew him. It remembered.

In a clearing where once stood a grove of whisperwillows, they found it: a hole in the ground wider than a wagon, lined with slick green stone. Not a cave. A shaft. A root that led downward.

“It’s calling again,” Skrag said, placing his palm near the rim. “But it’s not calling me this time.”

Thalia nodded. “It’s calling us.”

Borun grunted. “Of course it is. Down into the earth, like a bad metaphor.”

They descended with care, ropes fastened to stone, torches lit more for tradition than need—the walls glowed faintly, streaked with veins of emerald sap. The air grew thicker, warm, alive.

The further they went, the more they saw.

Faces in the moss.

Glyphs half-carved in bark that grew from the stone itself.

And songs.

Wordless, low-pitched, harmonies in tones that vibrated bones rather than ears.

By the time they reached the bottom, they were no longer certain they were in the same world.

They stood in a cavern of roots.

Massive tendrils twisted through the earth like petrified rivers, pulsing faintly with green fire. In the center rose a tree—dead but not. Its bark was black glass. Its leaves, what remained of them, shimmered with trapped images, as if someone had caught memory and spun it into foliage.

“The Root of Fire,” Thalia whispered.

Skrag approached slowly. “I saw this. In my dream. Before the Maw.”

Borun frowned. “You said the Maw was the oldest thing.”

“I was wrong.”

The tree shuddered.

Not from wind. There was no wind.

It knew they were there.

Skrag stepped close, gauntlet raised. The flame flared green. The tree responded, opening along its base like a mouth made of wood.

Inside, a chamber waited.

No doors.

No warnings.

Just invitation.

—

Inside, they found history.

Carved along the walls were scenes older than the First Flame—of creatures half-plant, half-flesh, of civilizations that walked beneath the world instead of upon it. They saw images of the Maw forming, not as an accident, but as a rejection—a sealing-off of something too wild to understand.

“The Flame was created to burn the Root,” Thalia said slowly. “But it didn’t finish the job.”

Skrag ran his fingers across a carving of a goblin holding both a torch and a vine. “We weren’t just fire-keepers. We were bridgers.”

“They split us,” she said. “Made us forget.”

Borun pointed at a mural of a mountain breaking open. “And when the Maw rose, it took the memory of the Root with it.”

The chamber pulsed.

And something spoke.

Not in words.

In memory.

Each of them felt it differently.

Skrag stood in the mire again, watching a child plant a glowing seed.

Thalia saw her monastery in flames, then regrown with living walls that whispered songs to sleeping students.

Borun saw a tunnel opening into a vast root-veined forge where hammers beat not metal, but soil.

The voice was clear now, beneath the visions.

You rekindled the fire. Now restore the root.

Skrag stepped forward.

“What do you need from us?”

The answer was a pulse, deep and slow.

To remember. To rejoin. To let the root grow again.

And in that moment, Skrag understood. The Maw had been a break in the world, a cauterizing wound. But wounds could heal. Roots could regrow, if given the fire to feed on—not to destroy, but to nourish.

“I’m tired of endings,” he said.

The tree glowed brighter.

“So let’s begin again.”

—

They spent three days in the chamber beneath the Root, though time was difficult to measure underground. There was no sun, no stars, only the slow pulse of the tree’s memory and the low thrum of the world re-knitting itself. Skrag kept his journal open at all times, scratching down everything he saw, heard, or felt, even when the thoughts came in fragments, half-formed and strange. Sometimes it was images—a goblin-shaped silhouette guiding sprouts to bloom through stone. Sometimes it was smells—wet soil mixed with ash and a hint of old parchment. But mostly, it was names. Names of places he didn’t recognize. Names of people who hadn’t been born yet.

Thalia spent most of her time deciphering the glyphs etched into the tree’s hollow. They shimmered when she touched them, reshaping themselves as if they knew she was trying to understand. The glyphs were not just writing—they were memory. Roots of stories, branching and rebinding into new shapes. She read aloud sometimes, and when she did, the tree responded with warmth, like it approved of being remembered.

Borun paced like a caged bear, muttering at the walls.

“I don’t like it,” he said. “Roots don’t belong this deep. It’s like the world’s upside down.”

Skrag looked up from his notes. “Maybe it always was.”

Borun snorted. “You think we’re supposed to fix all this? Turn the world back to some ancient garden?”

“No,” Skrag said. “I think we’re supposed to remember what it was before it broke. And make something better. Not a garden. A balance.”

The dwarf stared at the tree for a long time. “Balance. Hmph. You sound like one of those elven monks who drank too much dew.”

“I’ve been hanging around Thalia too long.”

She looked up from her work with a sly smile. “I heard that.”

—

On the fourth morning—though they only knew it by the steadiness of their own rhythm—the Root opened a path.

A tendril of stone split at the far end of the chamber, revealing a new corridor. Not one of collapse or decay, but of deliberate growth. Luminous vines lined the walls. The floor felt warm beneath their feet, and the air held a scent like fresh rain.

They followed it in silence.

The corridor descended, then curved. It took them beneath the deepest layer of the Mire, far under the poisoned pools and sunken groves. Eventually, it opened into a wide hollow lit by a dome of bioluminescent moss. At its center stood a circle of stones, each one shaped like a toadstool, and in the middle—a pool.

Not of water.

Memory.

The liquid glowed faintly, and its surface held not reflections, but visions—glimpses of the world as it had been, and might be again. Forests with roots that reached the stars. Cities with living towers. People—goblins, humans, dwarves, all of them—walking side by side, not as rulers or refugees, but as keepers.

“The Deep Grove,” Thalia breathed. “The stories said it was destroyed before the first kings were crowned.”

“It wasn’t destroyed,” Skrag said. “It was hidden.”

He stepped forward, compelled by the pool’s soft call. The gauntlet glowed, the flame within it flaring not in defense, but in recognition. He dipped his fingers into the memory-liquid and felt it rush through him like wind through leaves.

And he knew.

The Flame and the Root had once been one.

Two halves of a cycle.

Growth and decay.

Memory and forgetting.

Fire had been the pruning blade.

But when fire forgot mercy, it became destruction.

That was the Maw.

That was the wound.

The Root had withdrawn, waiting for balance.

Waiting for someone who could bear the flame and listen to the soil.

Skrag stood.

“I understand now,” he said.

Borun scratched his beard. “Well, good. Because I’m still not sure which end of this is the business end.”

Thalia placed a hand on Skrag’s shoulder. “What happens next?”

“We light the Root.”

“You want to set it on fire?” Borun asked.

“No,” Skrag said. “We feed it. Let the flame remember what it was meant for.”

He raised the gauntlet.

The green fire curled from his palm in a spiral, reaching toward the walls. But it didn’t burn. It flowed into the roots, into the moss, into the memory pool. The chamber glowed brighter, not with heat—but with life.

Vines bloomed.

Fungi shimmered.

Glyphs unfolded across the stones.

And somewhere above them, far across the world, things began to shift.

—

In a temple long abandoned, an old tapestry caught fire without smoke, revealing beneath it an older image—of a goblin with one hand of root and one of flame, standing between two worlds.

In the Ironstone caverns, dwarven forges began to grow vines along their chimneys. The metal didn’t rust. It breathed.

In the fields outside Briarhold, seeds long thought sterile cracked open, blooming strange golden flowers that turned toward the wind, not the sun.

And in the minds of dreamers, in the hearts of children not yet born, stories rewrote themselves.

Not of a goblin who saved the world.

But of a keeper who reminded it how to grow.

—

They emerged weeks later into a world not wholly changed, but different enough.

Skrag’s mark had deepened, no longer just a spiral, but a braid—fire and root entwined.

Thalia’s staff had sprouted leaves, alive and singing softly when she slept.

Borun claimed his hammer hit harder, but also said it occasionally hummed when near plants. He didn’t like that part.

Back in Briarhold, things were quieter. Life went on. But the people listened more. They looked more carefully at the weeds between stones, at the moss along roofs. They asked Skrag questions. Real ones.

And he answered them.

Sometimes with fire.

Sometimes with silence.

But always with truth.

—

That winter, Skrag sat on the hill again, watching the stars. A small tree had taken root next to the signal stone. He hadn’t planted it. It had just appeared.

It bore fruit in the shape of tiny flame-tears.

He picked one.

Tasted it.

Bittersweet.

Perfect.

—

Chapter Six: The Echoes of Flame

Snow came late that year, as though reluctant to touch a world still pulsing with warm roots and newly awakened memory. When it finally fell, it did so softly—blanketing Briarhold and the surrounding hills in a hush rather than a chill. The villagers said the snow felt different, lighter, almost kind. Some claimed it never stayed long on the branches of trees grown since the Root’s awakening, and that the footprints left in it vanished before the wind could take them.

Skrag found himself watching the snow more than walking in it. From the window of his burrow—expanded now to accommodate more scrolls than spoons—he observed the village in quiet, trying to decipher how much had changed since they’d returned from the Deep Grove. The surface of things remained the same. The blacksmith still bellowed over his forge. Children still shouted as they chased each other through alleyways. But something in the air carried a deeper calm, a readiness. The world hadn’t turned peaceful. But it had learned to listen.

He closed his journal and stood, stretching his back until it cracked. His fingers were ink-stained, his eyes dry from reading by firelight. He hadn’t used the gauntlet in weeks—it now rested on a shelf above his bed, humming faintly only when storms rolled overhead or when he thought too hard about the past. These days, the fire slept with him.

There was a knock at the door. Not polite, not cautious. A firm knock. Confident.

He opened it to find a goblin.

Younger than him, but not by much. Her skin was paler, tinged with grey-green, her ears bent forward, eyes sharp. She wore no armor, but the belt at her waist bore a sigil he knew too well: the spiral of fire and root.

“You’re Skrag,” she said.

“Some days,” he replied. “You look like trouble.”

“I brought this,” she said, holding up a scroll sealed in wax. The seal was the same symbol as her belt. “From the Ember Conclave.”

“The who?”

“We’re rebuilding the old orders. Keepers of memory. Of flame and root both.”

Skrag took the scroll. “Didn’t realize someone was forming a club.”

She gave a dry smile. “You’re the first name in our stories. We thought you should be the first to know.”

He broke the seal.

The scroll was simple. A call to gather. A new Root Temple was being built in the hollow ruins of Embralei, the village once lost to the Ash-born. Survivors had returned to the place, guided by visions and dreams, and now a community was forming. They had questions. They wanted to be taught.

“They want a teacher,” she said. “They want you.”

He sat heavily on the nearest stool.

“I’m not a teacher,” he said quietly. “I’m a goblin who got too close to a fire and didn’t die.”

She stepped forward, her voice gentle but steady. “That’s what makes you exactly the teacher they need.”

He looked up at her. “What’s your name?”

“Fen,” she replied. “I’m a Mireborn too. Found your Emberbook in a burned library three years ago. Changed everything.”

Skrag leaned back, rubbing his face with both hands. “I’m not sure I like being history.”

“Then come make it present again.”

He laughed then, a sharp and sudden sound. “You know, you’re very convincing. You should probably warn people about that.”

“I’ll put it in the next scroll,” she said.

—

They left two days later.

Skrag didn’t take much—his notes, the gauntlet, a battered kettle, and a pouch full of dried fungi he claimed were medicinal. Borun met them on the road, hammer slung over his shoulder, chewing on a root that smelled like wet cedar.

“I figured I’d walk with you awhile,” the dwarf said. “Keep you from running off again.”

“You just want to make sure I don’t start a revolution without supervision.”

“Well, someone has to make sure you don’t declare yourself king of the mossfolk.”

Thalia arrived at dusk. No announcement. No formality. She walked beside them as if she’d never left, her staff still green, her smile still quiet.

“Thought you were resting,” Skrag said.

“I was,” she said. “Now I’m curious.”

—

The road to Embralei was different than it had been in fire and ruin. Life had returned, not quickly, not evenly, but honestly. Trees grew along the path where once only ash had lain. Travelers moved freely. They passed a caravan of scholars from the western steppes, arguing loudly about glyph grammar. A group of children ran alongside the road, singing a song about a goblin and a hammer that fought a mountain. Borun muttered that the rhythm was off.

Embralei itself was unrecognizable. Where there had been blackened husks and collapsed timbers now stood tents, scaffolding, and stone half-walls growing vines. The villagers greeted them not with awe, but with purpose. They had questions. Not about power. About meaning.

Why did the Root hide?

How do you carry fire without burning?

How do you remember when the world wants you to forget?

Skrag answered none of them right away. Instead, he built a hearth. A simple circle of stone and moss at the center of the growing village. Around it, people gathered nightly. They told their own stories. Of losses. Of hopes. Of moments where the fire called and they answered.

He listened.

One night, as the wind coiled through the valley and the first snow began to fall again, Skrag stood at the hearth and held out the gauntlet.

The fire lit easily, curling green above his palm.

He looked at the faces before him—goblins, humans, elves, dwarves, even a silent figure in robes that reminded him of the Remnants. All of them waiting.

“All right,” he said. “Lesson one.”

He threw the flame into the air.

It hovered.

It sang.

Not loudly. Just enough.

“Memory is not something you carry. It’s something you plant.”

The fire descended, resting inside the hearth.

And the snow never touched it.

—

In the years that followed, the Ember Conclave grew.

Not as a kingdom. Not as a temple.

As a reminder.

They kept stories. Tended roots. Guided those who found the flame inside themselves. They did not conquer. They did not demand.

They remembered.

Skrag never stopped writing. Not even when his hands shook. Not even when his eyes failed. He carved the last lines with a stick and a soft stone, in the grove behind the temple where only mushrooms dared to interrupt him.

When he passed, it was quiet. Expected.

The fire did not roar.

It simply rested.

And beneath the earth, the Root hummed in reply.

—

Years passed like rivers winding around ancient stones, slow but constant. The world did not change overnight, nor did the Ember Conclave aim to make it do so. Where once the Cycle of Flame had been bound to destruction, now it unfolded more like a spiral—circling through memory, growth, and rest. It didn’t erase the past. It folded it into the rootwork of the present. The Emberbearers, as they came to be known, were not warriors or priests, but tenders, caretakers of old knowledge, guardians of stories whose embers still glowed in quiet places.

Embralei became the first Rootstead, a town woven not just from wood and stone, but from intention. Its walls were grown from reinforced bramblewood, its paths paved with moss-veined stone that never froze, even in winter. At the center, the Emberhearth continued to burn, tended by a small circle of keepers trained in the dual disciplines of remembrance and restraint. No one lit the fire without a reason. It was not for warmth. It was for understanding.

New goblins came. They arrived shyly at first, unsure whether this place truly welcomed them. But word had spread—of Skrag, of the green fire, of a legacy that reached farther back than any map dared to draw. Some of them were Mireborn, like him, with the same sharp eyes and knotted speech. Others came from the scrap-mounds of the Gloomvales or the hive-mines of Dron Hollow, carrying wounds and names worn thin from erasure.

They didn’t ask for power.

They asked for belonging.

And in the stories that Skrag had left behind—scrawled in crooked handwriting, sung by children, carved into the roots of stone trees—they found it.

Thalia remained for some time, serving as a translator of memory more than a Seer. The flame had long since gone quiet in her, but her gift for weaving sense from ancient truths had only deepened. She became the steward of the archives, a place less about silence and more about questions—why certain flames appeared brighter in some, why memories clung to places with no record, how dreams and roots shared a kind of logic.

When she eventually departed—quietly, one summer morning with a staff grown full of green leaves—she left behind a single message scrawled into the arch above the Hearth:

"To remember is to resist oblivion. But to share memory—that is to live."

Borun, by contrast, never truly left. He made loud declarations of returning to his mountain hold every few months, only to find himself conveniently delayed by repairs to the Rootforge or the occasional festival that he claimed were an affront to decency. He forged ceremonial tools for the Conclave, crafting implements not of war but of ritual—fire-tongs, binding blades used only to sever lies from truth, hammers to split stones that whispered secrets. Dwarves began visiting more frequently, curious about the “swamp fire that sings.”

He never admitted it aloud, but he was proud. Especially when the children called him "Stone-Root" and asked for stories about the goblin who walked into the Maw and came out with memory in his hand.

And beneath it all—beneath the hearth, beneath the halls, beneath the roots that now touched every structure of the village—the original tree remained. Not dead. Not buried.

Sleeping.

Waiting.

Its dreams had grown stronger. The Emberkeepers often spoke of dream-seeds—visions that settled into the minds of those who slept close to the hearth. They awoke with knowledge they had never studied: old glyphs, names lost to time, songs in languages no tongue had spoken aloud in a thousand years. Some feared it. Most welcomed it.

One of the youngest Keepers, a boy named Leth with fire freckles and moss-colored hair, was the first to dream of Skrag.

Not the old goblin sitting by the fire, carving spoons.

Not the ember-wielder, arm raised in green light.

He dreamed of Skrag as a root.

A single, stubborn root.

Twisting into the deepest stone.

Breaking it—not with force, but with patience.

Leth told the others. They passed it along. And it joined the stories.

That was the way of it now. Stories didn’t end. They spiraled.

—

And then, one spring, something bloomed in the Mire.

The Blightroot marshes had always been slow to change, full of secrets too tangled for even the Rooted Flame to mend quickly. But change came anyway.

Where Skrag’s old den had been, a glade formed—a place of twisted branches bent into arches, with mushrooms growing in perfect circles that pulsed with soft green light. No one built it. No one claimed it.

Pilgrims arrived, drawn by dreams. Goblins mostly. A few others.

They called it the First Hollow.

Not in reverence, but in recognition.

It was a place of beginnings, not endings.

And at its center, growing from the very earth, a single stone sat—cracked, misshapen, utterly unremarkable except for the spiral etched deep into its face.

It glowed faintly when touched.

It pulsed when someone remembered.

And though no flame burned upon it, everyone who came there claimed to feel warm.

—

The world would forget again. That much was certain.

In time, the Conclave would fracture, its teachings diluted or dismissed, its symbols buried beneath newer beliefs and faster fires. Roots would be paved over. Flames would be stoked too high. Memory would become myth again.

But not yet.

For now, the fire slept peacefully.

The root curled deeper.

And somewhere, beneath it all, in a place untouched by maps or time, the echo of a goblin’s laugh moved through the stone like wind through leaves.

Still stubborn.

Still real.

Still burning.

—

The new era did not begin with trumpets or declarations. It began the way most lasting things do: quietly. With roots reaching through soil. With voices learning to speak old truths in new words. With fires that burned not to consume, but to illuminate.

The Ember Conclave, though still small, was no longer a mystery. Across the lands, especially in places broken by the old wars or the Flame’s uncontrolled hunger, towns began carving small hearths into their meeting halls—not for heat, but for reflection. They called them "emberseats," where disputes could be brought not to be judged, but remembered. Where truth was not forced, but unearthed.

A woman from the distant Ash Coast, once a war captain, came to Embralei to kneel at the Emberhearth. She carried with her a sword that had never cooled in ten years. When she placed it in the circle, the blade dimmed for the first time. She left with empty hands, but a new name: Windsong, for she no longer heard only fire in her ears.

A boy from the northern wastes, raised by silence and suspicion, arrived wearing a chain around his neck that he refused to remove. He said it kept the voices away. Skrag—or at least, the stories of him—had told him to come. At the hearth, the chain cracked like old ice. And the voices sang instead of screamed.

They weren’t miracles.

They were memories correcting themselves.

Each ember cast light, but only if someone stayed long enough to watch it dance.

In this way, the world tilted back toward balance—not entirely, not perfectly, but in deliberate degrees. The kind that don’t make songs or epic ballads, but do make lives worth living.

And through it all, the story of Skrag grew—not in grandeur, but in complexity.

No longer just the goblin who walked into the Maw.

He became a symbol of the Third Path: not flame, not root, but their meeting place.

The Tenders taught that fire needed root as much as root needed fire. That memory without growth was rot, and growth without memory was blindness.

They taught that small things changed great things.

And they told every child who sat at the edge of the hearth that the first Emberbearer wasn’t a king, or a god, or a creature of prophecy.

He was a goblin.

He was tired, and angry, and confused.

And he chose to listen.

—

In the end, it was the mushrooms that told them Skrag had passed.

They bloomed across the hill behind the temple in a perfect spiral overnight. Dozens of species, some not seen in centuries. Red-veined caps, spore-laced bells, tiny stalks that whispered when the wind moved just right.

No body was found. No burial held.

But everyone knew.

And no one mourned loudly.

Instead, they lit no fires for a week.

They simply remembered.

Children retold his stories with far too many interruptions and incorrect details.

Tenders gathered and read from his Emberbook—every word, even the parts where he’d made fun of his own handwriting.

Borun carved a new stone for the hill. Not a grave marker.

A bench.

“For Sitting and Thinking,” he chiseled on its side. “In Memory of Fire that Didn’t Ask to Burn.”

And for many years after, the bench remained warm, even in snow.

—

One hundred years later, when the kingdoms fractured again—not from war, but from forgetting—the Ember Conclave remained.

Their numbers had dwindled, reshaped, renamed themselves a hundred times.

But the root still grew.

The flame still passed.

And in the Mire, in a den now consumed by trees older than memory, a small goblin child with wide eyes and an old birthmark on her shoulder dreamed of walking down a long, spiraling road.

She saw green flame.

She saw roots pulsing with song.

And she heard laughter—hers, and not hers.

When she woke, her hands were warm.

And the first thing she said, to no one in particular, was:

“I think I’ve been here before.”

—

Chapter Seven: The Spiral Repeats

The world turned, as it always did, indifferent to the pace of memory and the shape of stories. Kingdoms rose and tumbled into dust, not from fire this time, but from the slow erosion of purpose. Even the strongest stone forgets why it stands if no one touches it. Centuries slipped by like water around old roots, and while the Ember Conclave never fully disappeared, it became something quieter—woven into the weft of forgotten corners, murmured in lullabies and etched in the cracks between floorboards.

By the time the northern skies turned red once more, few remembered where the first spark had come from. Fewer still understood the weight of the green flame or the gentle hum of sleeping root beneath their feet. They remembered names—but as metaphors. Skrag became a fable, a figure drawn in chalk on a cave wall, bent and broad-eared, holding a flame in one hand and a crooked stick in the other.

They called him the Fool-Keeper.

The Root-Clown.

Some painted him as a god.

Others as a trickster.

But a few remembered more clearly.

In hidden hearths, behind quiet homes, the Emberbook survived—not in its original form, but as fragments passed down, rewritten in hundreds of hands, translated into whispers and riddles. Its wisdom wasn’t doctrine. It was practice. Something you lived, not something you recited.

And when the flame came again, the world was, as always, unprepared.

This time it was not the Maw that opened.

It was the sky.

Great fractures bloomed above the western mountains. Green light leaked through, not fire, but memory in its rawest form—unshaped and hungry. People across the continent woke screaming, not from nightmares, but from dreams that didn’t belong to them. Fields withered overnight while forgotten songs began pouring from the mouths of sleepers. Entire cities paused, their citizens too overwhelmed by the weight of visions to function.

The scholars of the age had no name for it.

But the Conclave did.

They called it The Return of Echoes.

And they had been waiting.

—

Beneath the rebuilt Rootstead of Embralei, far below the gardens and song-rings, the root network that once cradled Skrag’s understanding pulsed again. The Tree of Memory, dormant since the day his bench was carved, bloomed for the second time in recorded history. Its bark shed black husks, revealing white-veined wood beneath. Light not from fire, but from knowing, shimmered upward through the branches like water flowing in reverse.

The tenders, old and young, gathered around it without being summoned.

They did not speak.

They did not weep.

They listened.

A new song bloomed in the soil.

And it had a name.

Ashna.

—

She was not born of prophecy. She was born of storms.

The daughter of two farmers who could not explain why their child spoke in riddles from the age of three. By five, she had memorized every stone in their house and named them all after forgotten monarchs. By seven, she sat alone under the same tree each morning and whispered apologies to the leaves.

No one told her where the Hearth had been. She found it anyway.

By ten, she was walking into homes without knocking, sitting beside grieving widows and humming lullabies they hadn’t heard since childhood.

By twelve, the Conclave sent for her.

She did not come.

At thirteen, she arrived unannounced at the gates of Embralei and asked, “Have you been tending the roots, or just polishing them?”

They gave her the old scrolls. She corrected three before her first meal.

Ashna was not kind. Not in the way Skrag had been. She did not soften her truths or warm her lessons with charm. But her memory was pure. Unfiltered. She remembered stories she had never heard, names no living tongue had spoken aloud in generations.

And when the sky broke open, it was Ashna who did not look away.

She climbed the old hill behind the temple, the one with the bench and the stone, and waited.

The villagers followed her.

Tenders. Traders. Farmers. Outcasts.

They all stood beneath the spiraling sky as the first threads of green light began to descend.

Not flame.

Not fire.

Memory.

And it was unbearable.

Thousands of years poured through the sky like molten history, bleeding into minds not meant to hold so much. Men clutched their heads. Children sobbed. Mothers forgot their names. The world began to tear—not from war, but from weight.

Ashna stepped forward.

And laughed.

Not mockingly. Not cruelly.

She laughed because she remembered the story of Skrag, the Mireborn Goblin who faced the Maw not with strength, but with stubbornness. Who stood before memory when it wanted to consume him and said, “No.”

“I will not forget myself,” she whispered.

She raised her hands.

And the green flame answered.

It poured from her, not as destruction, but as an anchor.

Every memory that fell from the sky found a root to rest in.

Not every story had to be carried alone.

Not every vision had to be believed.

Some could be shared.

The wind howled as the last crack in the sky sealed.

And then, silence.

—

When the world blinked open again, Ashna was gone.

No grave.

No trail.

Only a spiral of mushrooms on the hill and a faint warmth on the old bench.

The villagers planted flowers around it.

The tenders added a new page to the Emberbook.

And a young boy, newly orphaned and afraid of his own dreams, sat down on the stone and whispered, “I’m not ready.”

And the bench was warm.

And the root answered.

And far below, in the deepest dark, something remembered how to smile.

The years following the Return of Echoes were uneasy, not because the world fell into chaos, but because it didn’t. The people had expected ruin. Cataclysm. The kind of ending their ancestors had sung about, with screams and gods and the sky split in two. But the end didn’t come.

Instead, the sky healed slowly. The cracks sealed. The visions faded like old ink on parchment. The fields regrew, some richer than before, some touched forever by what they had seen. The memory left its mark—not in fire or ruin, but in questions. Deep ones. Quiet ones. The sort that echo in bones long after the shouting ends.

What did we forget?

What did we leave behind?

Who are we now?

And in the center of it all, the Conclave endured—not untouched, but unbroken. The tenders planted deeper. Their scrolls were not sermons, but seeds. Their teachings changed form, adapting to the needs of a world that now knew remembering was dangerous, and forgetting even more so.

A new generation stepped forward. They were not bound by the fire, nor drawn entirely by root. They called themselves the Spiraled, neither Conclave nor commonfolk, wanderers who taught through listening and led without walking ahead. They did not carry torches. They carried questions. And they began appearing in every city, every village, every hollow that had once been afraid of the dark.

When asked where they had come from, they would answer: “From a story that hasn’t ended yet.”

Some bore the mark—a faint spiral on the palm, or a green shimmer in the iris. Most had nothing but memory, passed hand to hand like fire between strangers.

And in this new world, memory became the only real inheritance.

Among the Spiraled was a girl named Mira who claimed to have been born during the last rain that fell upward. She was young, reckless, and often infuriating. But she could listen like no one else. She could sit beside someone in silence for hours, and when she finally spoke, her words landed with the weight of ancient stone.

Mira carried no books.

She carried a spoon.

When asked, she would grin and say, “Belonged to the first fire-walker. Said it stirred more than soup.”

She told stories in camps and taverns, not of heroes or battles, but of moments: a goblin slipping in mud and laughing so hard it cracked a curse, a dwarf who forged a bell no one ever rang but kept anyway, a human child who sang to a stone until it bloomed.

And always, always, there was Skrag.

Not as a legend.

As a reminder.

“Don’t be fooled,” Mira would say, waving the spoon like a wand. “He didn’t win because he was brave. He won because he was there. Because when the fire asked if he would burn or run, he just shrugged and said, ‘Let’s see.’”

People laughed. They cried. They remembered.

And after Mira left, they always found something had grown where she’d sat—a patch of moss, a sprout, sometimes a mushroom shaped uncannily like a crooked ear.

In the Mire, now called the Weeping Green, where the bogs had learned to hum and the frogs spoke in rhythms passed down from long-dead dreamers, a new root cracked th
