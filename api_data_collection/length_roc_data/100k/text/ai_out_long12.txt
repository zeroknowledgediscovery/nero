Title: Grease and Smoke

Chapter One: The Last Bolt

The wrench slipped with a metallic clang, scraping Jonah’s knuckle raw. He swore, low and bitter, then wiped the blood on his oil-stained jeans. The Chevy Caprice in front of him—black, sun-faded, and dented—was a lost cause, but he couldn’t give up. Not yet.

Jonah Grady had been a mechanic in the town of Ashwick for seventeen years. Long enough to watch the buildings peel and the people leave. Long enough to lose track of which rusted cars he’d fixed and which he’d buried under scrap. He ran "Grady’s Garage" alone since Pop passed. No customers today—just the wind rattling the tin roof and the ever-dripping coffee machine hissing in the background.

He sighed, looked at the cracked clock above the parts shelf—3:42 PM—and pushed the wrench back into the engine.

“Goddamn carb’s choked up,” he muttered. “Just like this town.”

From the corner of the garage came a sudden clatter.

He turned fast. “Hello?”

Silence.

Then: a slow crunch of gravel outside.

He stepped out, wiping his hands with a rag, squinting into the afternoon haze. A woman stood there, lean and taut like a tensioned wire. Leather jacket, dusty boots. A cigarette dangled from her fingers, unlit.

“You Grady?” she asked.

“Yeah. What’s it to you?”

She didn’t smile. “I need an engine rebuilt. Not fixed. Rebuilt. And I need it fast.”

Jonah studied her face. There was something sharp in her eyes, like she wasn’t used to asking for help.

“Depends what’s wrong with it,” he said.

She tossed him a set of keys. “You’ll see.”

The truck was parked two blocks down, she said. Left it idling, which was crazy, but he didn’t argue. As he walked, he turned the keys in his hand. The fob had no markings. Just plain black plastic. The kind of thing you got when you didn’t want anything traceable.

He found the truck—a battered, matte-gray Ford F-150. The engine was knocking like a death rattle. He shut it off and popped the hood.

Inside was a mess. But not just mechanical. There was something off—parts replaced with aftermarket pieces that didn’t belong. Wires that had been cut and rerouted. Jonah frowned. This wasn’t just a rebuild. It was a cover-up.

When he walked back to the garage, the woman was leaning against the wall, arms folded. Her eyes flicked toward him.

“Well?”

“This ain’t a job,” Jonah said. “It’s a goddamn jigsaw.”

“I’ll pay.”

“How much?”

She named a number. Jonah blinked.

“Cash?” he asked.

She nodded.

“What’s in it for you?”

She took a long time before answering. “Closure.”

Her name was Maeve. No last name, or if she had one, she wasn’t sharing. Said she was passing through. Said the truck belonged to her brother.

“Used to,” she added.

Jonah didn’t press.

That night, he stayed late in the garage, cigarette burning in the ashtray, fingers black with grease. He opened the truck’s engine wide, deeper than most mechanics would dare. He needed to understand what he was fixing—and why.

He found a small black box wired into the ignition system. Not standard. Not even close. Jonah had seen something like it years ago, when a Homeland Security van came in busted and they asked no questions. This was military-grade. Tracking, maybe. Remote kill switch.

He put it on the bench and stared at it.

Next morning, Maeve was there before he opened.

“You found it,” she said.

“You knew it was there?”

“I hoped.”

“You wanna explain?”

She leaned against the wall. Her face was paler than yesterday. Less guarded.

“My brother ran with people he shouldn’t have. Government folks. Off-the-books kinds. The truck... it’s a loose end.”

“Loose end they wanna tie up?”

“Something like that.”

Jonah felt his skin prickle. He wasn’t built for cloak-and-dagger. He built engines, fixed clutches, cussed at brakes. But the way Maeve looked at him—like he was the last thing standing between her and whatever hell was coming—he couldn’t say no.

He nodded toward the bench. “You want me to take it out?”

Maeve hesitated. Then nodded.

He started pulling the wires.

The men came on the third day.

Black Suburban. No plates. Three men in suits who didn’t introduce themselves.

Jonah met them outside, arms crossed.

“You Grady?”

“Who’s asking?”

“Where’s the truck?”

Jonah spat. “Sold it.”

The man in front smiled without humor. “That’s unfortunate.”

They didn’t search the garage. Just handed him a card with no name, no number. Just a red circle printed on the front.

“Call if you remember anything.”

After they left, Jonah found Maeve in the back, crouched behind an oil drum. Her hands were trembling.

“We need to finish this,” she said.

“We?” he said, but it came out weaker than he wanted.

By the fifth day, the truck’s engine was stripped and clean. Jonah had replaced everything suspect. The box was in a lead-lined crate under the floorboards. Maeve made calls in hushed tones, sometimes stepping outside, sometimes disappearing for hours.

She told him about her brother, Liam—brilliant, reckless, doomed. Recruited out of MIT. Worked on things he wasn’t allowed to talk about. When he tried to leave, they made sure he didn’t.

“They said it was a car crash,” she said.

“But it wasn’t?”

She shook her head. “I got this truck two days after the funeral. No note. Just keys in the mail. I know he left something in it. Something they want.”

Jonah looked at the half-assembled engine. “You think it’s in there?”

“Not anymore,” she said, and smiled. It was the first time she had.

On the seventh day, they ran.

The truck roared to life, smoother than it ever had. Jonah packed a duffel with tools, instinct more than thought. Maeve drove. The town faded behind them in the rearview mirror.

“You sure about this?” he asked.

“No,” she said.

But they didn’t turn back.

Somewhere in Arizona, they stopped at a rest stop. The desert stretched wide and mute. Jonah sat on the hood, watching the sun bleed into the mountains.

“You ever think about just... letting it go?” he asked.

Maeve didn’t answer. Just lit a cigarette.

He didn’t push.

Behind them, the truck clicked softly as it cooled. Inside the glovebox, beneath a false bottom, was a hard drive.

Jonah hadn’t asked what was on it. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.

But whatever it was, it had been worth killing for.

And now it was theirs.

Maeve didn’t sleep that night. Jonah could hear her pacing the garage floor above his small cot in the office, bootsteps soft and irregular. He lay in the darkness, staring at the ceiling fan wobbling slightly as it spun. The engine had been rebuilt, the black box removed, and the wires rerouted so clean it looked like factory work—but there was a weight in the air that hadn’t left with the suits.

At dawn, Jonah walked out into the soft gray light, mug of coffee clutched in one hand, and found her outside, sitting on the truck’s tailgate. Her cigarette had burned to the filter without being smoked. She stared at the road like it might carry an answer.

“You know,” Jonah said, sitting down next to her, “you keep looking at that road like it’s gonna tell you something.”

Maeve didn’t smile. She rarely did. “It might. Eventually.”

He took a sip, let the heat roll through him. “I don’t think they’re done. The suits. That box—whatever it is—it’s part of something bigger. You don’t put a government tracker in a truck unless you’re scared of what’s in it.”

“I’m not scared of them,” Maeve said quietly. “I’m scared of what they think I have. That’s the difference.”

Jonah looked at her sidelong. She wasn’t built like someone who spooked easy. There was an edge in her—like rebar wrapped in leather. But everyone had limits. Even metal bent if you hit it just right.

“You ever think about just leaving it? Throw the damn box into a lake and vanish.”

Her jaw tightened. “And let them keep whatever it is they buried? No.”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he reached into his coat and pulled out the small black box. It felt heavier than it should have, dense with something unspoken.

“You’re not telling me everything,” he said.

Maeve exhaled slowly. “Would you believe me if I said I didn’t know everything either?”

“Try me.”

She stared down the road again, and for a while, he thought she wouldn’t answer. Then:

“My brother used to talk about leverage. He said the only thing more powerful than a gun was proof. Not evidence—proof. The kind that makes the bastards sweat before they start to deny it.”

Jonah rolled the box between his palms. “So what’s in here? Proof?”

“Maybe. I think it’s just a key.”

“To what?”

She shook her head. “That’s what I need to find out.”

The silence stretched between them. Jonah glanced at the sky. The clouds hung low, bloated with the promise of rain.

“If you’re dragging me into something deep, Maeve,” he said, “I’d like to know how far the bottom is.”

Her eyes flicked toward him. “That’s the thing about the bottom, Grady. You don’t see it till you hit it.”

Later that morning, Jonah drove the truck out to an old service road that led nowhere. It was where he tested rebuilt engines—a forgotten loop of pavement surrounded by pine and silence. Maeve sat beside him, map unfolded on her lap, but her eyes weren’t on it.

He pushed the truck harder than usual, listening for every whine, every shudder. But it held together. The rebuild had worked. He hadn’t lost his touch.

After two laps, he pulled over and killed the engine. The silence came roaring in.

“I need to go to Denver,” Maeve said suddenly.

Jonah raised an eyebrow. “That’s six hours from here.”

“Five if you drive like a lunatic.”

He looked at her, then at the truck. “You think whatever’s in that box connects to Denver?”

She nodded. “My brother’s last call came from there. Burner phone. Thirty seconds of static, then a name.”

“What name?”

She hesitated. “Halvorsen.”

The name meant nothing to Jonah, but it obviously meant something to her. Her voice had dropped half an octave when she said it.

“You think this Halvorsen has answers?”

“I think he has secrets. And if Liam trusted me enough to send me the truck, it’s because he knew they’d come for me eventually.”

Jonah didn’t answer right away. He looked at the cracked windshield, the old pine trees swaying just a little, and thought about the kind of life he’d had. Predictable. Quiet. And empty.

“All right,” he said finally. “But if we’re doing this, we do it smart. No more blind guesses.”

Maeve offered him a crooked grin. “I knew you weren’t just some grease monkey.”

“I am,” he replied. “Just a really cautious one.”

Back at the garage, Jonah packed a few essential tools—a torque wrench, a diagnostic scanner, his lucky flashlight with the duct-taped handle. Maeve worked on her end: burner phones, cash, a separate plate for the truck. She moved like someone who’d done this before.

As they loaded up the truck, Jonah stopped her with a hand on her shoulder.

“Maeve,” he said, “you don’t have to do this alone.”

Her eyes met his. For a second, the hardness in her expression cracked. “Neither do you.”

They pulled out of Ashwick as dusk settled, the sun melting into the horizon like rust bleeding through paint. The truck rumbled steady beneath them, rebuilt heart pounding like it knew it had a second chance.

Jonah looked once in the rearview mirror. The garage sat silent, the town already half-forgotten.

“You ever think we’re just replacing one set of ghosts with another?” he asked.

Maeve adjusted the mirror. “Depends if the new ones scream louder.”

They drove in silence after that, the road stretching long and dark ahead.

By the time they reached the Colorado border, it was after midnight. They stopped at a roadside diner called The Laughing Jackal—half the neon sign broken, the parking lot cracked with weeds. Inside, it was all formica tables and low yellow light. A woman with a smoker’s voice took their order without making eye contact.

Jonah poked at his burger. Maeve studied the room like it was a puzzle.

“Why’d you leave?” she asked suddenly.

He looked up. “Ashwick?”

“No. Your life. The world. You’re good. Sharp. You don’t belong in some ghost town under a pile of oil rags.”

He shrugged. “Pop got sick. Someone had to keep the garage open.”

“And after?”

Jonah gave a bitter smile. “After, I just kept fixing things that weren’t mine.”

Maeve didn’t push. She just nodded.

“You?”

She took a slow sip of coffee, her expression unreadable.

“Ran away from something,” she said. “Then started running toward something else. Haven’t figured out which direction was worse.”

The woman behind the counter lit another cigarette and turned up the radio. Old blues crackled through the speakers.

“You think we’ll make it to Denver without them catching up?” Jonah asked.

“No,” Maeve said. “But we’ll be ready.”

In a motel that smelled like mildew and old rain, Jonah lay awake staring at the ceiling. Maeve slept in the other bed, one arm under her pillow, the other curled tight to her chest like she was holding onto something only she could see.

He couldn’t sleep. The weight of the black box pressed on him, even though it sat in the glove compartment of the truck outside. Somewhere down the road was a man named Halvorsen. Somewhere down the road were answers.

But he wasn’t sure anymore if answers were what they really needed.

Maybe, he thought, they just needed to make it far enough that the past couldn’t follow.

Maybe.

The motel room held the staleness of long-dead conversations and a thousand dreams dried on linoleum floors. Jonah woke before sunrise, blinking against the amber streetlight filtering through the blinds. He sat up slowly, careful not to wake Maeve, and stared at the red LED of the alarm clock blinking 5:14. His back ached from the sagging mattress. He'd never been much of a traveler, but he was starting to understand why people stayed moving—because the second you stopped, your body reminded you just how broken it was.

In the bathroom, the water sputtered before running brown for a moment. He let it clear, then washed his face and stared at the mirror. The man looking back at him had crow’s feet and grease under his nails that wouldn’t come out no matter how hard he scrubbed. His eyes were tired, not from the drive, but from the weight of something he'd willingly carried once Maeve walked into his life.

She stirred when he came out, sitting up with a sharpness that said she didn’t sleep much either. Her hand went instinctively to her side, where she'd stashed a revolver between the mattress and the wall.

"You always wake up ready for a fight?" Jonah asked as he tossed her a plastic-wrapped danish from the vending machine downstairs.

She blinked the sleep away. "Only when I’m not sure what side I’m on."

He sat down on the edge of the bed. "You sure this Halvorsen guy’s even still in Denver?"

"No. But I know who to ask." She peeled back the wrapper and took a bite, chewing mechanically. "There’s a guy named Dobbs. Ran security with Liam years ago. Used to be a field op, then got bumped up to logistics. Liam always said Dobbs kept one foot in the system and one out."

"Sounds trustworthy."

Maeve smirked faintly. "Depends on what you're trading him."

Jonah leaned back, hands behind his head. "So what are we trading him?"

She looked at him, her expression turning flat. "Whatever he wants."

There was something bitter in her voice—not fear exactly, but something older. He didn’t press. Not yet.

They rolled out of the parking lot by 6:30, the sun cresting over the hills in a wash of gold that made the road look like it was burning. The truck hummed, steady beneath them, its rebuilt engine smoothing out the rattle it had carried when it limped into Ashwick. Jonah felt the vibration in his bones, familiar and grounding. He’d built this. With his hands, his knowledge, his sweat. There weren’t many things he was proud of anymore, but this engine was one of them.

Maeve navigated through the outskirts of Denver like she knew the layout by heart. They kept off main roads, winding through industrial zones and service lanes, until they reached an old meatpacking district that had been mostly abandoned, then partially reclaimed by artists and people who couldn’t afford better.

They stopped outside a two-story warehouse with painted-over windows and a rusting metal awning that read “WEISS FEED SUPPLY” in flaking white letters. Maeve killed the engine and turned to him.

"If anything goes sideways, you get back to the truck and wait five minutes. If I don’t come back, you leave."

Jonah frowned. "You expect it to go sideways?"

"I always expect it to. That way I’m never surprised."

He reached behind the seat and pulled out a crowbar. "Five minutes. Then I come in."

Maeve gave him a look that bordered on gratitude, then slipped out of the truck and walked to the side door like she owned the place.

Jonah waited. Every second scraped at his nerves.

Four minutes in, the door cracked open and Maeve emerged, motioning him inside.

The air in the warehouse was thick with dust and a strange smell—metallic, like blood or old copper pipes. A man stood near the back, balding, shoulders hunched, fingers twitching near the hem of a heavy coat. He looked like he’d been up all night and lost an argument with sleep.

“This is Dobbs,” Maeve said. “Dobbs, this is Jonah.”

Dobbs nodded slightly but didn’t offer a hand. His eyes kept darting toward the windows.

“Your brother was a smart guy,” Dobbs said, voice raw like gravel dragged across concrete. “Too smart. That was the problem.”

“What do you know about Halvorsen?” Maeve asked, stepping forward.

Dobbs shook his head. “I know he disappeared. Officially retired, moved to New Mexico. Unofficially, he’s deep in something. Private contracts, asset repurposing, black-bag stuff. And he’s been talking to someone from Citadel.”

Jonah furrowed his brow. “Citadel?”

Maeve answered for him. “A shell company. Government front for projects they don’t want traced. My brother mentioned it in his notes.”

Dobbs pulled a small envelope from inside his coat and handed it to her. “Last address I had on him. Storage unit off Alameda. You didn’t get it from me.”

Maeve opened the envelope and looked inside. Jonah saw a faded photograph and a folded slip of paper.

“Why are you helping us?” Jonah asked.

Dobbs looked at him and, for the first time, seemed to see him. “Because Liam helped me once. Pulled me out when a mission went sour in Caracas. I owed him.”

He turned to Maeve. “And because if you’re really going to poke this beehive, you should know—there’s no way to do it quiet.”

The storage facility was guarded by a keypad gate and a flickering streetlight. Jonah pulled the truck around back, where the fence had been peeled open like someone had done it before. Maeve keyed in the number from Dobbs’ paper, and the door to unit 117 rolled up with a grinding complaint.

Inside was darkness and cold. The place smelled like dust, old wood, and mildew.

They stepped inside together. Maeve clicked on her flashlight, and the beam caught rows of boxes, metal cases, and a single battered desk with a green banker’s lamp tipped on its side.

Jonah opened one of the cases. It was filled with photographs—overhead drone shots, documents with most of the text redacted. One photo was circled in red: a complex deep in the desert, barbed wire and motion sensors lining the perimeter.

Maeve flipped through a binder on the desk. “This is bigger than I thought.”

“Yeah?” Jonah said. “Because I’m starting to think we’re already in over our heads.”

She turned a page. “This facility—whatever it is—it’s where Halvorsen went after Liam died. Look.”

She held up a printed email, faded but legible. It was from an internal Citadel address, referencing an asset recovery operation linked to "Subject 213B" and the relocation of data from an unauthorized source.

“What the hell is Subject 213B?” Jonah asked.

Maeve didn’t answer. Her face had gone pale.

“This was about Liam,” she whispered. “He didn’t just die. They used him.”

Jonah felt something cold settle in his gut. “Used him for what?”

Maeve looked at the open case again, then at the folder of emails. “For whatever that box in the truck connects to. They implanted something. Tracked him. Maybe even controlled him. Jesus…”

Jonah stepped back, heart thudding. “You’re saying your brother was a test subject?”

She nodded slowly. “And we’re holding the evidence.”

At that moment, outside, they heard tires crunch gravel. Headlights cut through the slats in the unit’s door.

“Time’s up,” Jonah said.

Maeve stuffed the folder into her jacket. “We’ve got what we need. Let’s go.”

They bolted for the truck just as a dark van rolled into view, side doors already sliding open.

Jonah floored the engine, tires screaming as the truck tore out of the lot. Bullets cracked the rear windshield. Glass exploded into the cab. Maeve ducked, cursing.

“Guess we’re not quiet anymore,” Jonah said.

Maeve pulled her revolver and twisted in her seat, eyes wild.

“We were never supposed to be.”

The truck roared into the night, carrying them both away from the truth—and deeper into it.

Chapter Two: Burn Line

The sun was already high by the time they stopped driving. Jonah pulled the truck onto an overgrown service road shielded by juniper and mesquite, the engine ticking as it cooled under the midday heat. Maeve stepped out without a word and disappeared into the trees. She didn’t go far—he could hear the dry grass crunching beneath her boots as she paced, her breath uneven.

Jonah leaned against the hood, staring at the cracked sky through a windshield spiderwebbed from the night before. They’d been lucky. The bullets had torn the rear glass but missed the fuel line. The truck had made it, but it wouldn’t again—not without more work. He had maybe two hours before the radiator gave out completely.

He reached for his tool bag, hands moving by instinct more than thought. He didn’t need to be told what came next. They were in it now—knee-deep—and the only thing keeping them ahead of whoever was chasing them was four cylinders, a box of fuses, and whatever wiring miracle he could pull from rusted metal.

“Do you think they followed?” Maeve asked as she returned, her hair tied back, face still pale from the adrenaline dump.

“I’d say we bought a few hours. Maybe less. These guys don’t use roadblocks and sirens—they’re not lawmen. They’ll come quiet. They’ll wait for us to slow down.”

She crouched beside him. “Can you keep it running?”

Jonah glanced at the radiator. “I can do better. I can change the damn thing. If we find a salvage yard.”

Maeve unfolded the map she’d stolen from the glove compartment of a gas station two towns back. Her finger tapped a town ten miles east. “Siler Junction. I’ve been through before. One garage, maybe two. Worth a shot.”

He nodded, started packing his tools. “We go. But after that, you tell me the whole story.”

She didn’t respond, but she didn’t argue either.

Siler Junction was a gasping relic of a town where the bones of the Old West had long since been picked clean by tourists and neglect. Two stoplights, three churches, and a single mechanic shop named Tommy’s Fix-It. The sign was crooked, half the letters sun-faded to pink. A man sat outside under a faded awning, drinking what looked like sweet tea from a mason jar.

Jonah killed the engine and stepped out slowly, letting the man get a good look at them. Maeve stayed in the truck, her eyes scanning every storefront, every passing car, every window.

“You Tommy?” Jonah asked.

The man squinted. “Depends who’s asking.”

“I need a radiator. Something small. Ford F-150, '09.”

Tommy wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Got one in the back. Ain’t new.”

“I’m not picky. You got a jack, I’ll swap it myself.”

Tommy gave him a long look. “You look like someone who knows what he’s doing. You military?”

Jonah shook his head. “Just a mechanic. Been one my whole life.”

The old man stood, stretching. “Well then, come on. I’ll show you what we’ve got. But if you’re bringing trouble, I got no use for that.”

Jonah followed him, ignoring the sweat already pooling beneath his collar. In the back of the garage, amidst piles of rusted hoods and half-buried axles, they found what he needed. It would hold. Long enough, anyway.

He worked fast, keeping one eye on the road, the other on the job. Maeve stood a few yards away, arms crossed, her stance wide like someone ready to bolt or fight. He’d seen that posture before—marines returning home, waiting for the world to snap at them again.

“You wanna talk now?” he asked as he tightened the last bolt.

Maeve knelt down beside him. “I didn’t lie, Jonah. But I didn’t tell you everything.”

“Start with the name. Halvorsen. What was he to Liam?”

She nodded, staring at the gravel. “He was Liam’s handler. CIA offshoot, but private—hired through Citadel. He wasn’t just a boss. He ran the program.”

“What kind of program?”

Maeve hesitated. “They were working on neuromodulation. Targeted cognition mapping. Imagine being able to rewrite a person’s reflexes, implant behavior patterns without them even knowing. We’re not talking hypnosis or MK-Ultra stuff. This was chemical, surgical, digital.”

Jonah set the wrench down. “You’re saying your brother was... programmed?”

“Modified. It started as memory retention training, accelerated learning. Then came the implant. Data-collection, tracking. He volunteered. They told him it was experimental, but safe. And for a while, it worked. He could recite code strings after a single glance. He broke encryption that took teams months.”

“And then?”

“They stopped asking. They started telling. And he couldn’t say no.”

Jonah rubbed his hands on a rag, slow. “So the truck—what he sent you—it was evidence.”

“Not just that.” She reached into her jacket and pulled out the hard drive they’d found under the glovebox. “It’s everything. Project logs. Names. Procedures. Data from the implant. All copied before he went dark. And Halvorsen? He’s the only one left who can prove it was real.”

Jonah stood, stretched his sore back. “So we find Halvorsen. And then what? You think he’ll just confess? Turn himself in?”

“No. But he’ll want to live. He’ll deal. I just need to make sure what Liam died for doesn’t disappear.”

They left Siler Junction an hour later. The truck ran smoother, quieter. The engine purred like it remembered what it was meant to be. Jonah didn’t speak for a long time. The desert rolled by, slow and endless. He watched the road, and Maeve watched the horizon, her thumb brushing the edge of the drive like a prayer stone.

They were twenty miles from Denver’s outskirts when the air changed.

The sound came first—a low thrum, like distant thunder but steady. Then the glint of sunlight on metal in the rearview. Maeve turned her head sharply.

“Drone,” she said. “Military-grade. They’re tracking us.”

Jonah’s hands tightened on the wheel. “Can you jam it?”

“I can try.” She opened the glovebox, pulled out a wrapped bundle of wires and a small circuit board. “Give me ten seconds.”

The drone buzzed closer. Jonah saw it now—sleek, black, predatory. It veered, slowed above them.

Maeve connected the circuit board to a cigarette lighter converter, then switched a toggle. A low click echoed through the truck.

The drone flickered—literally. Its lights blinked, then it swerved erratically before shooting upward and vanishing behind a ridge.

Maeve leaned back, breathing hard. “EMP pulse. Short range. We only get one.”

Jonah didn’t take his eyes off the road. “Then we better make it count.”

The truck shot forward, engine roaring as he pushed it harder than ever. The line between pursuit and escape blurred, and every mile ahead felt thinner than the last. Somewhere out there was Halvorsen. Somewhere out there was the truth.

And behind them, the silence was not peace. It was the sound of something coming.

They didn’t stop again until dusk, pulling into the shell of an abandoned gas station just off Highway 285. The structure sagged like it had been waiting to collapse for a decade, half the roof caved in, the sign overhead barely clinging to its rusted frame. Maeve jumped out first, checking the perimeter with the practiced efficiency of someone who didn’t trust silence. Jonah followed slowly, stretching out his back with a wince as he scanned the empty road behind them. The drone hadn’t returned, and no vehicles had tailed them—not that he could tell—but the tension hadn’t eased. If anything, it had worsened, thickening with the knowledge that they were still being hunted, even if they couldn’t see the predators.

Inside, the gas station smelled of mildew and scorched rubber. Broken shelves were littered with ancient candy wrappers, cigarette butts, and shattered glass. Maeve found a relatively intact office behind the counter and pulled a chair into the corner, placing her backpack within reach. She sat down heavily, exhaling a long breath as if she'd been holding it since Siler Junction.

Jonah stood by the window, peering through a crack in the boarded-up pane.

"We can’t run forever," he said after a while.

"I know," Maeve replied, rubbing the bridge of her nose. "That’s why we stop running tomorrow."

"You have a plan?"

She nodded, though her eyes didn’t leave the floor. "Halvorsen isn’t in Denver anymore. He left weeks ago. But I know where he went."

"Let me guess—deep in the woods, off-grid, armed to the teeth?"

"Worse," she said. "He’s in the mountains. Private retreat. Used to be a communications station, long since gutted and converted. No internet, no phone lines, just shortwave and hardlines patched through encrypted relays."

Jonah sat down on the floor, arms draped over his knees. "So what’s our move? Knock on the door and ask him nicely to give us what we want?"

Maeve’s voice was steady. "We don’t ask. We make him talk. And we take whatever he has before they do."

There was a flicker of something in her eyes when she said it—not anger exactly, but something colder. It reminded Jonah of the engine he’d pulled apart in Ashwick, the pieces slick with oil and years of neglect. Whatever was driving Maeve wasn’t revenge. It was unfinished business buried so deep it bled rust.

"You said he ran the program," Jonah said. "What makes you think he’ll still have anything left?"

She looked up at him now. "Because he’s the only one arrogant enough to keep copies. He’s not scared of them. He is them."

Jonah leaned his head back against the wall. "And if he’s already handed it off? If we’re too late?"

"Then we burn it all down anyway."

They slept in shifts, if sleep could even be called that. Jonah dozed on and off, haunted by dreams of metal arms twisting from the dirt, gears grinding in place of human voices. Maeve stood watch until the early morning, staring into the blue-black dark like she could will the sunrise into coming faster.

By 5:30, they were back on the road, climbing steadily toward the Rockies. The landscape changed with every mile—flat plains giving way to winding inclines, pine and aspen creeping in where desert brush had ruled the day before. Jonah drove in silence, eyes fixed on the road, the hum of the tires the only constant. He felt the altitude in his lungs, the way the engine strained ever so slightly against the incline. The rebuilt radiator was holding, but barely.

Maeve unfolded a printed map across her lap, her finger tracing the route. "He’s near an old fire watch trail, east of Twin Lakes. We’ll have to hike the last two miles. There’s no way the truck makes it through."

"You sure he’s there?"

"Unless he’s dead. And if he is, the place will still have what we need."

Jonah grunted. "Sounds like a good place to bury the truth."

"Or people."

They stopped in Leadville for supplies. Jonah filled the truck’s tank and bought two packs of jerky, a jug of water, and a flashlight. Maeve picked up a thermal blanket and a roll of black tape. She paid in cash, careful not to speak more than a few words.

The mountains closed in around them as they drove higher. The temperature dropped. By the time they pulled off the main road and onto the gravel path Maeve had marked, it was late afternoon and clouds had begun to gather overhead, thick with threat.

The truck bucked and jostled over stones and washed-out ruts, the suspension groaning with each lurch. They finally reached a clearing wide enough to leave the truck hidden beneath the trees. Jonah shut off the engine and let the quiet settle in.

"We walk from here?" he asked.

Maeve nodded. "Two miles, give or take."

Jonah grabbed his pack and slung it over his shoulder. He caught her glancing back at the truck, eyes narrowed.

"You thinking we’re not coming back?" he asked.

"I’m thinking if we do, it’ll be a miracle."

They hiked in silence for the first mile, boots crunching snow-dusted gravel, breath fogging in the cold air. The trail narrowed into a rocky incline framed by tall pines that creaked under the weight of the wind. Jonah felt the ache in his legs quickly, but he didn’t complain. Maeve moved ahead with purpose, scanning every bend in the path like it might jump out and strike.

When they finally saw the edge of the compound, it looked more like a bunker than a retreat—low concrete walls embedded into the hillside, narrow slit windows, a steel door half-hidden behind brambles and frost. The place gave off a stillness that made Jonah’s stomach twist.

Maeve crouched behind a fallen tree, pulling binoculars from her bag.

"One camera," she murmured. "Old model. No movement."

"You think it’s empty?"

"No. Just quiet."

They waited until the sun slipped behind the ridge. Then they moved.

Maeve led the way, slipping between brush and snow patches, circling to the rear where an exhaust vent protruded from the hillside. It was old, rusted through, barely wide enough for Jonah’s shoulders, but she pointed at it like it was salvation.

"That’s how we get in."

"You sure about this?"

"No."

But she went first.

The vent led them into a narrow corridor lit only by the blinking red light of a maintenance alarm. The air inside was cold and dry, thick with dust. Jonah’s fingers closed around the crowbar in his pack, just in case. Maeve moved like she’d been in places like this before—silent, methodical.

They found Halvorsen in a side room. He was older than Maeve had described—gray at the temples, eyes sunken deep into a face that had once been sharp but was now drawn and hollow. He didn’t move when they entered. He was seated in front of an old CRT monitor, typing something slowly with one finger.

"You’re late," he said without turning.

Maeve leveled the revolver at his chest. "You know why we’re here."

"Of course I do," Halvorsen said, finally turning. His voice was calm, almost clinical. "You’re here for your brother’s files. For what’s left of them."

"You know they’re coming, don’t you?" Maeve said. "You know we’re not the only ones who found this place."

"They’ve always been coming," Halvorsen said. "But this time, they’ll burn it all. Including me. Including you."

Jonah stepped forward. "Then give us what we need before they do."

Halvorsen smiled, slow and bitter. "It won’t change anything. The truth only matters when people care. And people don’t care about shadows."

Maeve’s voice dropped, shaking. "He died for this. You killed him with your silence."

"No," Halvorsen said. "I killed him with obedience. The same thing that kills us all."

He reached under the desk slowly, pulled out a hard drive, and held it up.

"This is everything I have. The rest is already in the wind."

Maeve took it, her hands trembling.

"They’ll trace you," Halvorsen said. "As soon as you power that up. You’ll have hours, maybe less."

"Then we better get moving," Jonah said.

As they turned to leave, Halvorsen called after them.

"You think exposing the truth will fix anything? It won’t. But it might destroy more than you’re ready to lose."

Maeve didn’t answer. She didn’t look back.

They were already running when the first tremor hit.

From deep within the compound, a low, humming vibration surged through the floor. Jonah grabbed Maeve’s arm and pulled her down the corridor as lights exploded behind them, the old concrete walls beginning to crack and groan.

They barely made it through the vent before the mountain began to swallow its secrets.

Behind them, Halvorsen and everything he had built collapsed into silence.

And ahead, the night waited.

Chapter Three: Static Veins

They didn’t speak as they ran. The mountain groaned behind them like some dying god, and every step on the rocky path felt like borrowed time. Maeve led, her face slick with sweat despite the cold, her breath ragged. Jonah’s legs screamed with every downhill stride, but he kept pace. There was no choice. The hard drive Maeve clutched against her chest like a holy relic had already become more than data. It was leverage. It was Liam’s legacy. It was bait.

By the time they reached the truck, the night had swallowed the sky. Clouds loomed heavy and low, smothering the stars. Maeve climbed into the passenger seat without a word, the drive still in her hands. Jonah turned the key, and for a heartbeat nothing happened. Then the engine roared to life—hoarse, but ready.

They didn’t look back as they drove, didn’t wait for whoever might crawl out of the smoke behind them. Maeve wiped her face with the sleeve of her jacket and finally spoke.

"They burned it. Halvorsen must’ve had a trigger—self-destruct, failsafe, something built into the system."

Jonah nodded, eyes on the narrow, twisting road. "He didn’t want it falling into the wrong hands."

"Too late for that. We’ve got it."

"Yeah," Jonah said. "Which makes us the wrong hands now."

They drove in silence for nearly an hour, passing through ghost-towns and half-lit truck stops. Jonah’s knuckles were white against the steering wheel. Every taillight in the distance looked like a target. Every engine behind them sounded like it was following.

Finally, they pulled into a desolate campground just south of Fairplay, tucked against the treeline. Jonah killed the engine and killed the headlights. The only illumination came from the dull silver sheen of the moon through thinning clouds. They both sat in the cab for a few minutes, breathing, still too wired to call it rest.

"You think they’re still chasing?" he asked.

Maeve shook her head slowly. "Not chasing. Predicting. They’ll know where we’re headed, not where we’ve been."

"Which means we don’t go where they expect."

She turned to him. "Then where?"

He leaned back, staring through the cracked windshield at the sky. "Somewhere no one wants to go. Somewhere off-grid. You ever hear of Donnor’s Hollow?"

Maeve frowned. "Sounds like a place you’d name a horror movie after."

Jonah gave a weak smile. "Exactly. Old mining town, wiped off maps in the ‘80s. Used to be a gold rush site, then a uranium claim. When the feds pulled out, the locals stayed behind until even they gave up. Now it’s just mountains and dust. My dad took me there once when I was a kid. It’s the last place anyone would look, because there's nothing left to take."

Maeve considered. "You think we can power the drive out there?"

"Depends. If I can jury-rig a converter, maybe. But we won’t have time to analyze everything."

She hesitated, then reached into her coat and pulled out a small notebook, pages worn and corners frayed. She handed it to him.

"Liam’s notes," she said. "Everything he couldn’t put on a drive, he wrote here. Passwords, server keys, safe points. If there’s a way to decrypt the files without tripping any alerts, it’s in there."

Jonah opened the book carefully. The handwriting was tight and precise, each word etched with care. There were sketches of chip diagrams, code fragments, and an odd line of poetry at the bottom of one page:

    A spark inside the vessel hums,
    The static veins will always run.

He frowned. "Was he always this poetic?"

"Only when he was afraid. He used metaphor to hide the truth. That line—‘static veins’—he used it to describe the neural threads they implanted. The interface that connected the subject’s mind to the hardware. His veins were the circuit."

Jonah shut the notebook. "So whatever’s on this drive—it isn’t just files. It’s a blueprint for how they built him."

Maeve’s voice turned quiet. "And how they broke him."

The road to Donnor’s Hollow wasn’t marked. Jonah drove by memory, squinting through fog that seemed to grow thicker with each mile. The truck struggled against the incline, tires slipping on gravel. At last, they crested a ridge and saw it below: a cluster of leaning wooden buildings, many collapsed, all silent. A rusted water tower stood watch over the wreckage, its legs bowed inward like a dying animal.

Jonah parked near what used to be the general store. The roof had caved in, but the side room remained intact. They cleared it quickly, then set up inside.

Maeve unpacked the hard drive and laid it on a folding table Jonah had rigged from old boards and a toolbox lid. He connected it to a backup laptop he’d brought from the garage—ten years out of date but tough as hell. The laptop hummed, screen flickering to life.

Maeve sat beside him, tension vibrating off her. "Try the first password in the notebook."

Jonah typed it in.

Nothing.

He tried the second.

The screen blinked. A prompt appeared: USER AUTH RECOGNIZED. ACCESS PROTECTED. RETINA VERIFICATION REQUIRED.

Maeve cursed. "I didn’t think... Liam must’ve locked it to his biometrics."

Jonah stared at the screen. "Is there a bypass?"

"Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on whether he used a hardware token or just encoded a retinal image."

Jonah leaned back, exhaling through his teeth. "So we’ve got the key, but no door to put it in."

Maeve stood abruptly, pacing. "Unless…"

He watched her carefully. "Unless what?"

She turned. "Unless we fake it."

Jonah stood. "You’re talking about cloning a retinal pattern? That's not something you do with duct tape and a soldering iron."

"No. But I know someone who can do it. Problem is, she’s in New Mexico. Santa Fe. And if I contact her, there’s a 70% chance she’s compromised."

Jonah raised an eyebrow. "Only seventy?"

Maeve didn’t smile. "We don't have other options. She used to work with Liam. Before everything fell apart."

"Then call her."

Maeve pulled a battered burner phone from her pack, stared at it a moment, then stepped outside. Jonah heard the buzz of signal trying to connect, the nervous staccato of her pacing just beyond the wall.

He sat in the quiet, staring at the flickering prompt on the laptop. The mountain wind moaned through the hollow buildings like a warning.

Fifteen minutes later, she came back in.

"She’ll meet us," Maeve said. "But we only get one shot. She’s spooked."

Jonah shut the laptop gently. "Then let’s not waste it."

They drove again at dawn, leaving behind the ruins of Donnor’s Hollow. The hard drive was hidden in the truck’s floor pan beneath a false cover Jonah had installed during the night. The route to Santa Fe was long and dangerous. They stayed off major roads, looping through valleys and ghost highways, sleeping in the cab when they couldn’t keep their eyes open any longer.

On the second night, they stopped at a ranger’s outpost turned museum, now closed for the season. Maeve barely touched her food. She sat at the edge of the overlook, feet dangling over rock and shadow.

"You still sure about all this?" Jonah asked, handing her a bottle of water.

She nodded without looking. "I didn’t come this far to quit now."

He sat beside her. "You came this far because you loved your brother. But what if this ends up being bigger than that?"

Maeve turned to him. "Then we make it matter."

Behind them, the wind whispered through the trees. Somewhere in the distance, the static veins were still running.

They rolled into Santa Fe under cover of night, the desert city alive with quiet motion—neon signs humming above closed cantinas, empty buses rumbling past shuttered galleries, wind chimes clinking softly from adobe porches like metallic whispers. The sky had that purple-black depth only found in places where the horizon stretched for miles. Jonah stayed hunched over the wheel, careful to obey every traffic signal, every stop sign. Paranoia wasn’t paranoia anymore—it was strategy.

Maeve directed him to an old laundromat on the outskirts of town, nestled between a pawn shop and a boarded-up florist. The sign above the door read Spin Cycle in chipped blue letters, though none of the lights were on inside. Jonah pulled the truck around back, where a battered Toyota sedan sat parked under a flickering security lamp. Maeve was already out of the cab before the engine was off.

“She’s inside,” she said. “Give me two minutes. If I don’t come out, drive away.”

“Not happening,” Jonah said flatly.

She looked at him, the kind of look that usually ended arguments. But this time, she just gave a short nod and disappeared through a side entrance marked EMPLOYEES ONLY.

Jonah waited, eyes scanning the street, fingers drumming on the steering wheel. Two minutes. That was the deal. Just two.

At two and a half, the door creaked open and Maeve emerged with a woman in tow—tall, mid-forties, hair clipped close to the scalp, wearing a baggy denim jacket and mirrored aviators despite the hour. She carried herself with a confidence that wasn’t showy, but dangerous. The kind that came from knowing too much and surviving anyway.

Maeve climbed into the passenger seat without a word. The woman climbed into the back and looked directly at Jonah.

“You’re the mechanic,” she said, voice smooth but tired.

“That’s what they tell me.”

She handed him a small black pouch. “Inside’s a portable biometric emulator. Custom firmware, multi-spectral lens. Give me Liam’s notes and ten minutes, and I can build a close-enough retinal sequence.”

Jonah started the engine and pulled away from the laundromat. “And what do you want in return?”

The woman smiled faintly. “To be left alone. After this, I disappear. You do your thing, I do mine.”

Maeve glanced back. “Her name’s Carmen Reyes. She used to run field ops for Halvorsen before she walked.”

Jonah glanced at her in the rearview mirror. “Walked?”

Reyes chuckled dryly. “I was supposed to clean up one of their test subjects. A girl—sixteen. Implant degraded, brain hemorrhaged, seizures every hour. She’d written Liam’s name over and over in a journal. I left the door unlocked instead.”

Maeve reached into her coat and handed over Liam’s notebook. “Page thirty-nine. He left some kind of retina hash. Embedded in a sketch.”

Reyes flipped through the book, nodding. “Yeah. This’ll do.”

They drove to a small motel on the city’s edge, the kind of place where no one asked for ID and the rooms still had analog TVs chained to the nightstands. Jonah paid cash and parked the truck at the far end, under a broken security light. Inside, Reyes laid her equipment out across the room’s scarred desk—lens modules, a soldering pen, a flask-sized processor that looked like it had been patched together with spare parts and black market tech.

Jonah watched her work, impressed despite himself. She moved with purpose, hands steady, muttering under her breath as she calibrated the lens. Maeve sat by the window, gun in her lap, eyes fixed on the parking lot.

“This’ll only get you one pass,” Reyes said, never looking up. “Once you connect this emulator to the drive, it’ll ping the internal verification system. If it accepts the hash, it’ll start decrypting. If it doesn’t... well, the drive might fry itself. Or call home.”

“And calling home means?” Jonah asked.

“Citadel gets a little red flag that says someone poked the bear. They don’t like being poked.”

Maeve turned from the window. “How long until we’re ready?”

“Five minutes,” Reyes replied. “Maybe ten. Depends on whether Liam’s drawing is as smart as he thought it was.”

She pulled a fiber-optic cable from her kit and connected it to the drive, then activated the emulator. A thin blue light scanned across the lens. The laptop screen lit up with cascading lines of code—no prompt this time, just raw system diagnostics.

“Looks like your brother was smarter than most,” Reyes said. “It’s accepting the signal.”

Jonah leaned closer. “How long until the files open?”

“That’s the good news,” she said. “Bad news is, they’re encrypted across six partitions, and half of them are rigged to wipe if accessed incorrectly.”

“Then don’t access them incorrectly.”

She gave him a look. “You think I haven’t done this before?”

Maeve tensed. “Someone’s outside.”

Jonah moved to the window, peering through the edge of the curtain. A black sedan had pulled in, lights off, engine idling.

“Company?”

“Looks like it,” Maeve said, rising to her feet.

Reyes didn’t flinch. “You’ve got maybe four minutes before they come knocking.”

Jonah reached for the drive. “Can we move it?”

“Not now,” Reyes hissed. “If we unplug it mid-sequence, we’ll lose everything.”

Maeve checked her weapon. “Then we hold the line.”

Jonah positioned himself by the door, gripping a crowbar he’d tucked in his coat earlier. It wasn’t elegant, but it made a point.

Reyes muttered curses under her breath as code scrolled faster. The laptop beeped once—sharp, metallic.

“That’s one partition down,” she said. “Come on, Liam, you beautiful bastard…”

A knock at the door. Not hard, but not friendly.

Jonah didn’t move. Maeve flattened herself against the wall beside the window, her revolver cocked.

A voice came through, muffled. Male, smooth. “We just want to talk. No one has to get hurt.”

Reyes kept working. “That’s always how it starts.”

Jonah glanced at Maeve. “Options?”

“Go out the bathroom window. Climb the fence behind the laundry room. That’s our out.”

“You gonna shoot your way through?”

“Only if they make me.”

The knock came again, harder this time.

Reyes yanked a USB drive from her kit and jammed it into the laptop. “Decrypting now. Files are dumping—one minute, maybe less.”

Jonah looked at the door. Shadows moved outside. At least two men. Maybe three.

Maeve stepped forward. “You buy us time,” she said. “I’ll get her out the back.”

“I’m not leaving you,” Jonah said.

“I’m not giving you a choice.”

The door shook as someone threw their weight against it. The frame groaned but held.

Reyes slammed the laptop shut and yanked the cable free. “We’re good! Let’s go!”

Maeve grabbed her by the arm and shoved the bathroom door open. Jonah turned just as the front door cracked down the middle.

He didn’t wait for it to fully give. He followed Maeve and Reyes into the bathroom, where Maeve was already sliding open the narrow window.

One by one, they crawled through—Reyes first, then Maeve. Jonah turned just in time to see the door explode inward and a man in black tactical gear surge through. Jonah flung the crowbar hard, catching the man across the face. He dropped, helmet rolling across the floor.

Jonah vaulted through the window and hit the gravel running.

They didn’t stop until they reached the Toyota. Reyes fumbled with the keys, hands shaking. Jonah helped shove her inside while Maeve covered them.

The engine started with a sputter. The headlights stayed off.

They vanished into the night as sirens began to rise behind them.

Inside the cab, the USB drive pulsed red in Jonah’s hand.

He didn’t need to ask if it was worth it. The answer was already burning in his palm.

Chapter Four: Chain Reaction

The desert outside Albuquerque stretched in every direction, a cracked and trembling silence painted in rust and ochre. Jonah had driven for three hours without stopping, following an old service road that curved away from the interstate like a vein grown wild. Behind them, the skyline had long since disappeared, and ahead, only dust and low hills waited under a lidless sky. The stolen Toyota creaked with every bump, suspension shot, one tire slightly warped from their rushed escape. They were ghosts on a forgotten road, and for now, no one was chasing.

Maeve sat in the backseat beside Reyes, the USB drive clutched tightly in her palm. Neither of them spoke. The heat had soaked into everything—the seats, their skin, the silence. Jonah finally pulled over at a roadside rest stop made of crumbling concrete and sun-bleached wooden benches. A roofless shack offered the only shade, casting thin bars of shadow across a sand-dusted map of the state that hadn’t been updated in two decades.

“We stop here,” Jonah said, voice hoarse. “Fifteen minutes. No more.”

Reyes stretched her arms overhead and winced. “I need to get this thing copied. If we lose the original, we’re done.”

Maeve slid out of the car and leaned against the hood, eyes scanning the horizon as if danger might rise up from the dirt. “Can you do it here?”

Reyes nodded. “I’ve got a second laptop. Air-gapped, battery-powered. It'll take about twelve minutes to mirror the drive and start the crack on the second layer of encryption. I can mask the ping, but if they’re monitoring proximity signals, they’ll know someone touched it.”

Jonah grabbed the toolkit from the backseat and set it on the bench, unfolding it with a snap. “Then let’s get it done before the window closes.”

Reyes got to work, hunching over the laptop like a surgeon. She plugged in the drive and launched her suite of decryption tools, all custom-coded, operating in near-silence. Lines of text blinked across the screen: partition mount logs, fingerprint verifications, mirrored metadata. Jonah watched for a moment, not understanding all the jargon, but recognizing the intensity in her face. She knew how thin the margin was.

“I used to think there was honor in all this,” Reyes said quietly, not looking up. “Secrecy. Order. Protecting the greater good.”

Maeve didn’t respond. Her face was set in stone, jaw locked.

Reyes continued. “Then I watched a sixteen-year-old girl vomit blood on a floor in Uzbekistan while Citadel debated whether she qualified as a successful trial. She was still breathing when they signed off on her termination.”

Jonah dropped his gaze to the cracked floor. “And Liam? Was he ever just a tool to them?”

“He was more than that,” Reyes said, her tone not quite reverent, but firm. “He figured it out before anyone else. That’s why they buried him. He stopped following orders. Started building a way out.”

Maeve turned then, slowly, her voice low. “What was his endgame?”

Reyes didn’t answer right away. Instead, she opened a second window on the laptop, displaying a series of file names that looked innocuous at first: generic terms like project_data_3 and client_summary_7. But behind the names were code strings that stretched for lines—hash-locked, checksum-verified, all tied to a single key.

“He was going to leak it. Not to a reporter. Not to the press. To the people inside. He built an internal floodgate—an auto-dump protocol set to release all data to a thousand terminals across government networks. A whistleblow from the inside, impossible to intercept because it came from a trusted node.”

Maeve stepped closer. “Did he finish it?”

Reyes nodded once. “He came damn close. But before he could execute the broadcast, Halvorsen shut him down. Not just fired—shut him down. His access was revoked, his devices purged, and then he died.”

Jonah looked up, jaw tightening. “So why didn’t Halvorsen destroy this?”

“Maybe guilt. Maybe leverage. Maybe he just didn’t know where it was. Liam kept this drive offline, hidden until Maeve got it.”

Maeve crossed her arms, the wind pulling at her hair. “And now?”

Reyes smiled bitterly. “Now we finish what he started.”

The laptop beeped. A progress bar flashed 100%.

“Done,” she said. “The clone’s clean. I’ve got two layers cracked. Three more to go, but the rest can happen while we move.”

Jonah helped her shut the laptop down and pack up. His hands were quick but precise. Every wire coiled, every drive tucked. The mechanic’s rhythm had become a survival instinct.

“What now?” he asked.

Maeve looked at the sky. “We head west.”

“West to what?”

“Liam didn’t just leave us data,” she said. “He left us coordinates.”

Jonah raised a brow. “For what?”

“A server hub. Off-grid, government-licensed but privately maintained. Somewhere in Arizona. It was part of Citadel’s early infrastructure before they moved deeper into black-site territory. If we can upload the complete payload from inside their own frame, it bypasses every firewall they’ve built. The system will see it as an internal update, not an attack.”

Reyes nodded. “He was smart. Upload from a trusted location, and the system auto-distributes.”

Jonah started the car. “Then we better keep moving before we run out of road.”

They drove south through Gallup, following the old highway that once served as a trade route between military depots and reservation outposts. The sky had shifted to a heavy gray, clouds boiling at the horizon, the wind kicking dust across the empty lanes. Reyes dozed off in the backseat, head resting on her shoulder, one hand still wrapped protectively around her laptop.

Maeve leaned forward, watching the road through the dirty windshield.

“I used to think my brother was paranoid,” she said. “He’d check locks twice. He’d write passwords in code. Wouldn’t use anything with a microphone. I thought he was losing it.”

Jonah adjusted the rearview mirror. “Maybe he was.”

“Maybe. But he was right, too. It wasn’t paranoia. It was just seeing the world clearly.”

Jonah didn’t speak for a moment, then said, “You blame yourself?”

“For not seeing it? For not stopping it? I don’t know. I think I blame everyone.”

The road narrowed into a mountain pass. Pines reappeared, tall and spectral in the growing fog. Jonah slowed the car, feeling the incline pull at the wheels.

“We’re almost there,” Maeve murmured. “The server site’s about twenty minutes up this road.”

“And then what?” Jonah asked. “We plug in, and hope the truth saves us?”

Maeve turned to him. “We’re not saving ourselves. We’re breaking the lie. That’s enough.”

They crested the ridge and found it: a fenced compound half-buried in rock, disguised as a weather monitoring station. The gate was chained but old. Jonah snapped it open with bolt cutters he’d brought from the garage.

Inside, the building was cold and dry. The hum of old servers still echoed faintly through the halls. It smelled of ozone and sealed dust.

Reyes powered up the system using her clone drive, bypassed the login shell, and plugged in the payload.

The screen filled with terminal windows—hundreds of threads opening in parallel. Protocols, encryption keys, data maps, lists of names, experimental logs.

A bar appeared:
UPLOADING TO NODE NETWORK... 2%... 7%...

Jonah paced the hall, unable to sit. Maeve stood beside the door, weapon ready.

At 36%, Reyes stiffened.

“What is it?” Jonah asked.

“We’ve got a breach ping. Citadel just caught the transfer.”

Maeve cursed. “How much longer?”

“Five minutes. Maybe less.”

Jonah glanced out the window.

Lights. Dust trails rising in the distance.

“Too late for running,” he said.

Maeve stepped beside him. “Then we hold.”

Jonah gripped the crowbar again. The old instinct was back now—fix or fight.

Inside the server room, data poured into the network.

Outside, shadows closed in.

And between them all, the truth prepared to wake.

Chapter Five: Fault Line

The first shot shattered the corner window, sending a spiderweb of glass across the floor like frozen lightning. Jonah flinched instinctively, ducking low and dragging Reyes back from the server rack. She didn’t stop typing, her fingers dancing over the keyboard even as the wind howled through the new opening in the wall.

Maeve was already at the entrance, crouched low, eyes locked on the fence line. The headlights they’d spotted earlier had resolved into three black SUVs, parked just beyond the gate. Figures moved between them—six, maybe seven—clad in dark tactical gear, rifles in hand, advancing in a fan spread across the gravel yard.

Jonah pressed his back against the wall beside her. “They’re coming in fast.”

Maeve didn’t look away from the door. “They’re not here to talk.”

Another shot rang out, chipping concrete above the server bank. Reyes ducked, her voice tense but controlled. “Upload’s at sixty-three percent. Don’t let them shut this down.”

Jonah scanned the room for anything useful—tools, wires, anything he could use as a weapon or a distraction. He spotted a rusted fire extinguisher near the door, ripped it from the bracket, and checked the pressure gauge. Still good.

“You thinking what I’m thinking?” he asked.

Maeve gave the faintest nod. “Blind them. Then move.”

He hurled the extinguisher through the broken window. It exploded in a cloud of white powder as it hit the ground near the SUVs, obscuring the advancing figures for just a second.

Maeve kicked the door open and opened fire, three sharp pops echoing through the yard. Jonah followed, ducking left behind a metal generator casing, scanning for movement. The air was thick with dust and extinguisher fog, the beam of a rifle’s flashlight slicing through the haze just ahead of him.

He didn’t wait. With a grunt, he rose and swung the crowbar low, connecting with a shin. The figure dropped with a cry, and Jonah kicked the weapon away. Another shadow moved to his right—he turned too slow. A fist caught his shoulder, spun him hard, but then Maeve was there, putting two rounds into the attacker’s vest. The man crumpled.

Reyes’s voice crackled through the comm on Maeve’s belt. “Eighty-two percent!”

“We need more time!” Maeve shouted.

Jonah grabbed the downed man’s rifle and rolled behind a rusted tool cabinet. “What if they cut the power?”

“They won’t,” Reyes snapped. “I rerouted the feed through a bypass. Only way to stop it now is to destroy the whole system.”

“Comforting,” Jonah muttered.

Another bullet tore through the siding above him. He peeked out, spotted two more agents moving toward the door. He fired, hitting one square in the thigh. The other ducked, returning fire.

The place was a warzone—silent for years, now echoing with violence.

Maeve moved like a ghost—swift, deliberate, deadly. She ducked behind the shell of an old satellite dish, fired three more shots, then retreated as return fire peppered the area around her. She was breathing hard, but her hands never shook.

Jonah felt the weight of the rifle in his arms. He wasn’t a soldier. He’d spent his life fixing things, not breaking them. But something in him had changed—some old line crossed in Ashwick, or maybe the moment Maeve walked into his garage. He fired again, more controlled now, pinning the agents behind a rusted storage tank.

Inside, Reyes worked like a surgeon, eyes scanning code, hands moving with terrifying efficiency.

“Upload’s at ninety-three percent!” she called out. “We’re close!”

Maeve pressed against the wall beside Jonah. “We need to fall back inside. Buy her the last minute.”

He nodded. Together, they moved—ducking and sprinting low through the debris. Bullets struck the ground behind them, kicking up dust, but they made it back into the compound. Jonah slammed the door shut and pushed a shelf in front of it.

“Thirty seconds,” Reyes muttered. “Come on... come on…”

Jonah leaned against the wall, panting. Maeve stood by the server, eyes on the display.

The bar crawled forward.

97%… 98%… 99%…

The ground shuddered as a small explosive detonated outside. The door buckled inward.

100%.

The terminal flashed green: TRANSFER COMPLETE. DISTRIBUTION IN PROGRESS.

Reyes slammed the laptop shut and yanked the drive. “It’s done.”

The door burst open a second later.

Two men stepped in—one aiming a rifle, the other holding a signal disruptor. Maeve fired first, taking the lead man in the chest. The second dropped to the ground but didn’t shoot—he froze, eyes wide as the realization set in.

“You’re too late,” Reyes said.

The man looked at her, then at the servers, still humming with activity. He slowly lowered his disruptor.

Jonah walked forward, rifle raised. “Turn around. Hands on your head.”

The man obeyed.

Maeve stepped closer. “How many are out there?”

“Two more,” he muttered. “But they’re pulling back. Your signal’s out. It’s done.”

Reyes walked past them to the main system. On-screen, hundreds of progress bars scrolled by—each representing a node, a server, a recipient somewhere deep in a network Citadel had once controlled. All of it was unraveling.

Jonah let the rifle drop to his side. “We just cracked it open.”

Maeve exhaled shakily, finally lowering her gun. “Liam did.”

Reyes looked at her. “And you carried it.”

They gathered the equipment, stripped out the drives, and left the building smoldering behind them. Jonah looked back once, watched as the server lights faded into the dust. It felt like watching a chapter close in real time—quiet, final, and heavy.

Three days later, the world began to react.

Encrypted files appeared on military and civilian terminals across the country—dossiers, project outlines, procurement records. Names long buried rose to the surface. Whistleblower forums lit up with confirmation from former agents. A Senate subcommittee announced emergency hearings.

Citadel went silent. Offices were emptied overnight. Contractors vanished. Halvorsen’s name was whispered, then shouted, then hunted.

Jonah and Maeve didn’t go back to Ashwick. They didn’t go anywhere people could find them. For a while, they just drove—west, then north, then nowhere in particular. Sometimes they spoke, sometimes not. It was enough to know the truth had lived.

Maeve kept Liam’s notebook in her jacket. She never let it out of reach.

Jonah found a little comfort in the engine's hum, the thrum of the tires, the landscape unfolding endlessly.

They weren’t heroes. They weren’t martyrs. But they had pulled the pin, cracked the system, and set the fire.

Whatever came next would come on its own.

But at least now, the silence was broken.

The compound burned slower than Jonah expected. The building’s thick concrete frame and buried wiring meant it didn’t collapse in cinematic fashion. It smoldered. It hissed. Parts of it breathed smoke for hours, collapsing inward like a dying lung. They stood at a safe distance behind a ridge, the Toyota idling behind them, Reyes hunched on the hood with the cloned drive in her lap. The sun was dipping behind the horizon, casting long, angular shadows across the desert. No one spoke. There wasn’t much to say.

Maeve broke the silence first. She stared at the ruins, her voice calm, flat. “We’ll be hunted.”

“Already are,” Reyes said without looking up. “But the game’s changed. The data’s out. The people who sent those men? They’re not trying to clean up a mess anymore. They’re running from it.”

Jonah crossed his arms, watching the faint orange glow pulse behind the smoke like the remnants of a forge. “And what happens now? We just go back to our lives?”

Reyes gave a quiet, humorless laugh. “What lives?”

Jonah didn’t answer. He looked out at the vast plain beyond, trying to remember the last time anything had felt ordinary. It wasn’t Ashwick. It wasn’t under the hood of a rusted-out Caprice. Somewhere along the way—maybe when Maeve first walked into his garage, or when he opened the engine of her truck and found that military-grade box—something broke loose in him. Now the world looked different. Not worse. Not better. Just exposed.

“Citadel won’t die easy,” Maeve said. “They’ll fracture, rebrand. Disappear behind another name.”

Reyes nodded. “That’s why Liam built redundancies. The data doesn’t just exist now—it replicates. Every time someone opens it, every time someone reads a line, it finds new places to live.”

Jonah turned back to them. “You think it’ll matter?”

Maeve looked at him, not with hope exactly, but something sturdier. “It already does. They lost control.”

They camped that night off the road, deep in a grove of cottonwood trees that whispered all night with wind. Reyes took first watch, perched atop the Toyota with a rifle across her knees. Jonah couldn’t sleep. He lay on his back, watching the stars slice the dark, listening to Maeve breathe steadily on the ground beside him.

His thoughts kept circling the same question: what if it hadn’t worked?

He trusted Reyes. And Maeve. And Liam, though he’d never met the man. But systems had a way of protecting themselves. Even now, some war room might be spinning new threads, feeding lies into press briefings, hiring firms to twist the facts into forgettable shapes. The upload had happened. The data had scattered. But people had to see it. Understand it. Care.

In the morning, Reyes was gone.

They found a note taped to the dashboard, written in tight, mechanical lettering.

"I have my own ghosts to bury. You’ve got the rest. Stay dark. Stay moving. And if they come again—finish it."

Maeve didn’t look surprised. She folded the note once and tucked it into her jacket.

“She did her part,” Jonah said, starting the engine.

Maeve nodded. “Now we do ours.”

They drove for three days, avoiding cities, moving by backroads and dirt trails. They listened to radio static, watched cheap motel televisions flicker with fragments of news. Nothing concrete, but there were signs. Congress calling for investigations into federal contracting programs. A leaked memo from a Citadel subsidiary. An analyst resigning in protest. The sound of the first hairline cracks in a fortress long thought unbreakable.

At a truck stop near the Arizona-Nevada border, Jonah stepped out while Maeve fueled up. A television inside the diner played a muted interview with a former intelligence officer whose face was blurred, voice distorted. Behind him, the words “PROJECT GOLIATH EXPOSED?” scrolled across the ticker.

Jonah watched it until the screen cut to commercial.

They were getting louder.

On the fourth day, Maeve asked him to stop in a wide valley near an abandoned farmhouse. The place looked untouched for years—roof sagging, barn collapsed, weeds as tall as children. She walked alone into the field beyond it, the sky overhead soft with layered clouds. Jonah stayed back, leaning against the truck, letting her have whatever space she needed.

She returned twenty minutes later, hands empty, eyes distant.

“There was a place like this near where we grew up,” she said. “Liam and I used to sneak into the silo and dare each other to climb the ladder. I always chickened out halfway up.”

Jonah didn’t press. He just waited.

“He was the brave one,” she continued. “Smart, reckless. Always thought he could outthink anyone. Maybe he could.”

“He didn’t outthink you,” Jonah said.

She looked at him, something unreadable in her expression. “He didn’t want to.”

They sat in the truck for a long time, the windows down, the breeze carrying the smell of sage and iron. Maeve finally turned to him and said, “There’s one more thing.”

Jonah raised an eyebrow. “Of course there is.”

“In the data,” she said, “Liam referenced a second drive. A backup. Not part of the main upload. Off-site, disconnected, meant for verification.”

“Where is it?”

She shook her head. “He never wrote it down. Just a phrase. ‘Left in the hollow heart.’”

Jonah frowned. “Poetic.”

“Infuriating,” she said, though there was a trace of affection in her voice.

“You think it’s real?”

“I don’t know. But if it is, it’s proof. Not just files or names, but maybe footage, or direct recordings—something irrefutable. Something that can’t be buried under jargon or denials.”

Jonah rubbed his chin. “Hollow heart. Could mean anything. A mountain. A building. Hell, maybe a literal hollowed tree.”

Maeve smiled faintly. “Or maybe it’s something only I’d recognize. Something personal. A place we knew.”

“Then we find it.”

She nodded once. “We will.”

Jonah shifted the truck into gear and pulled back onto the road. The sky was clearing now, the horizon sharpening into peaks and plateaus. Somewhere out there, something waited—a key, a confirmation, a final nail for the coffin they’d dragged into daylight.

They didn’t know what they’d find.

But they knew they wouldn’t stop until they did.

They followed the phrase like a compass, but the trail it drew wasn’t straightforward. “Left in the hollow heart.” Maeve wrote the words over and over again in her brother’s notebook, each time pressing harder until the ink bled through the paper. Jonah didn’t tell her to stop—he understood what she was doing. In the language of the dead, repetition was memory, and memory was the closest thing to resurrection they had.

They drove through the towns Liam had mentioned in fragments—Mineral Creek, Ridgeline Pass, old mining outposts now overrun with nature and dust. It was in those long stretches of silence between waypoints that Maeve began to speak more of the past. Not in long confessions, but in observations, small truths that surfaced unbidden.

“Liam hated onions,” she said one evening as they sat beneath a crumbling billboard advertising a gun show that had likely never happened. “Used to pick them out of chili one at a time. Said they were arrogant vegetables. Always trying to dominate the flavor.”

Jonah chuckled. “Your brother was a strange man.”

Maeve shrugged. “He was consistent.”

They slept in the truck most nights, back seats folded flat, bags jammed in the footwells. Jonah didn’t mind. He found the confined space comforting. Predictable. The world beyond the windshield had become too fluid, too filled with variables. Every person in a rearview mirror might be a threat. Every casual glance could be surveillance. But inside the truck, the only things that moved were them, and that was something he could fix if it ever broke.

They reached Pine Hollow after three days of driving. A forgotten mining site buried in the ribs of the Mogollon Rim, where red rock cliffs cracked open like old bones. The map showed a lake nearby, though it had long since dried into a stretch of white mud and cattails. The town itself was a single road, three buildings still standing, and a schoolhouse half-consumed by the hillside.

Maeve stepped out of the truck and just stood there, eyes wide, face unreadable.

“This is it,” she said.

“You’re sure?”

“It’s the only place he never brought up after he left home. And we came here as kids. Just once. Summer trip. He called it a ghost’s ribcage.”

Jonah followed her to the schoolhouse, watching her movements—calculated but not hesitant. She was remembering through her body now, letting the muscles lead where logic couldn’t. Inside, the air was stale, heavy with mold and mouse droppings. The floorboards groaned but didn’t give. The chalkboard still bore faint white lines, and a broken abacus lay strewn beneath the teacher’s desk.

Maeve moved to the front of the room and stared at the wall behind the blackboard.

“He drew here. Liam. I remember. The teacher let us draw on the back wall.”

Jonah raised a brow. “They let you kids behind the blackboard?”

Maeve didn’t answer. She walked to the edge, ran her fingers along the seam where the board met the plaster. Then she stopped.

“There.”

Jonah helped her pry it loose. The panel gave with a long creak, revealing a shallow recess. Inside was an old tin lunchbox, the kind kids carried in the ‘80s, Spider-Man faded to blue and rust. Maeve lifted it out gently, breath held.

When she opened it, the hinges squealed.

Inside: a sealed mylar pouch, a faded photograph, and a flash drive wrapped in wax paper.

Jonah crouched beside her. “He left it here the whole time?”

She held up the photo. It was of the two of them, maybe eight and ten years old, sitting on the front steps of this very schoolhouse. Liam was making a ridiculous face. Maeve looked like she hadn’t yet learned how to frown.

“It’s real,” she whispered. “He knew I’d come back.”

Jonah took the flash drive. “You think it’s the backup?”

“It has to be.”

They didn’t waste time. Back at the truck, Jonah plugged it into the offline laptop Reyes had left behind. The screen flickered to life, a single prompt blinking in the center:

    “I knew you'd look here, Maeve. I’m sorry.”

Jonah glanced at her. She didn’t cry. Her face didn’t crack. But she reached out, touched the screen with her fingertips.

The drive contained a video file and a document set. The file was labeled CITADEL_FALLOUT_214. Jonah clicked it.

The screen filled with Liam’s face—thinner, paler than in the photos Maeve carried, his eyes sunken with exhaustion but still sharp. He sat in a blank room with steel walls, a camera bolted above him. His voice, when it came, was quiet but deliberate.

“If you’re watching this, then you found the heart,” he said. “Good. It means I was right. It means you didn’t let them win.”

Maeve leaned in.

“I tried to stop it from inside,” Liam continued. “But I was too late. They took what I made and twisted it. My neural interface—the prototype—wasn’t for control. It was supposed to be a recorder. A way to capture thought, map it, preserve it for people who couldn’t speak. But they saw something else. They saw a way to track soldiers, reprogram instinct. Modify trauma. Rewrite allegiance.”

Jonah clenched his jaw. The scope of it was worse than even they’d imagined.

“They’ll keep hunting you, Maeve,” Liam said. “Unless you finish what I started. The data on this drive is the raw feed—undistorted records, timestamps, source code. It proves what they did. Who ordered it. Where it happened.”

He paused, seemed to hesitate.

“And there’s one more thing. A name.”

He looked straight into the camera.

“Jonah Grady.”

Jonah felt the bottom drop out of his stomach.

Maeve turned slowly toward him.

The video continued.

“If you’re with her, Jonah, then you deserve to know. You weren’t random. I picked you. I watched your work after your father died. I knew you kept the garage going out of guilt, not love. But I also saw how precise you were. How loyal. How you fixed things that should’ve been junked. You’re the kind of man who sticks, no matter how much it hurts.”

Jonah didn’t move.

“I left the truck for her. But I made sure it would break down near your town. Because I knew you’d help. I knew you’d see what was wrong—and fix it.”

The screen went black.

Jonah stared at it, unable to speak.

Maeve sat still for a long time. Finally, she turned to him.

“Did you know?”

He shook his head slowly. “No. Not a word.”

She nodded, more to herself than to him. “Then he was right. About you.”

Jonah looked at the schoolhouse, then the horizon. “So now what?”

Maeve opened the laptop, clicked on the folder marked RAW_LOGS. “Now we bury them.”

Jonah didn’t ask who she meant—Citadel, the suits, the system, all of it.

The hollow heart had given up its secret.

Now came the reckoning.

Chapter Six: Spark Gap

The sun dipped low behind the jagged ridge, turning the rust-colored hills of Pine Hollow into silhouettes, like ancient titans kneeling in the dusk. The schoolhouse, battered and leaning with its gaping wall, seemed to sigh with the wind. Maeve sat cross-legged in the truck’s bed, the laptop balanced on her knees, the screen illuminating her face in flickering white-blue pulses. Jonah paced near the tree line, boot steps soft in the dry grass, his hands clenched and unclenched rhythmically like he was trying to wring the truth from the air.

“You haven’t said much,” Maeve called over.

Jonah stopped, looked at her, then down at the dirt.

“I don’t know what to say,” he admitted. “Your brother left me a legacy I didn’t ask for. He chose me like I was a wrench out of a drawer—just another tool.”

Maeve gave a quiet snort, not unkind. “You think he chose you because you were convenient? Liam didn’t believe in chance. He believed in design. He trusted you to get me here, not just the truck.”

“That’s the part I don’t know how to live with,” Jonah said. “I didn’t even know him.”

Maeve closed the laptop and leaned back against the truck wall. “Neither did I. Not completely. But I don’t think he wanted us to know him. I think he wanted to be understood after he was gone.”

Jonah walked over and hopped into the bed beside her. The sky had gone full indigo, stars beginning to flicker above them like old secrets reignited.

“So what’s in the raw logs?” he asked.

Maeve clicked the laptop back open and angled the screen toward him. “Video feeds. Internal memos. Biometric files. There’s a series of test logs from what they called Phase 2, including subjects from outside the original military pool.”

Jonah leaned closer. “Civilians?”

Maeve nodded. “Some volunteered. Most didn’t. They were listed as ‘acquired assets.’ Medical patients, incarcerated minors, even a few flagged as ‘unwilling but viable.’” She clicked on a file labeled 213B_COMPLIANCE_TRIAL-4 and a video filled the screen.

In it, a girl—fourteen, maybe fifteen—sat in a chair under fluorescent lights, her hands trembling in her lap. Electrodes were attached to her scalp. A voice from off-camera issued commands. She followed each one without blinking, even as tears streamed down her cheeks. When she hesitated, a high-pitched tone filled the room and her hands spasmed.

Jonah turned away. “Jesus.”

“Liam tried to end this phase himself,” Maeve said. “He sent a formal protest. It was ignored. Then he copied the logs, encrypted them, and set up the backup trail. The heart. Me.”

Jonah was quiet for a long time. “You think if we drop this into the system now—another upload—they’ll let it die in noise? Say it’s faked?”

“They might,” Maeve said. “But that’s not the plan. This time, we go wide. Not hidden on servers. Not deep in encrypted folders. We drop it where everyone can see it. Social networks. Journalist inboxes. AI watchdogs. Leak aggregators. College forums. We drown them in their own records.”

Jonah exhaled slowly. “And then what?”

Maeve looked up at the sky. “Then we vanish.”

She handed him the USB clone, a thin black stick with a taped-over light. “Tomorrow, you take this to Tucson. There’s a student server cluster near the university. Old, unmonitored, but mirrored across half a dozen international domains. You upload it there, and we hit the other points at once.”

Jonah looked at her. “You’re not coming?”

“I’ve got something else to do,” she said. “There’s one name in the logs that doesn’t make sense. A liaison. Not Citadel, not military. Some kind of contractor. They called her Vega.”

Jonah blinked. “Reyes mentioned her. Once. Said Vega didn’t show up in records, but she was always in the room.”

Maeve gave a tight nod. “I think she’s still out there. And I think she’s still cleaning up loose ends.”

“You think she’ll come for you?”

Maeve’s voice didn’t waver. “No. I think she’ll come for you.”

They parted at dawn in a dry wash near the Arizona line. Maeve gave him coordinates, a burner phone, and one last glance before disappearing back into the ridge like she’d never been there. Jonah didn’t like it—leaving things unfinished—but he understood. Some people weren’t built for the same kinds of endings.

The road to Tucson was long and flat, a shimmering ribbon of heat and horizon. Jonah drove with the USB plugged into the cigarette lighter, the engine humming beneath him like a reluctant steed. He kept the radio off. There was too much noise in his head already.

He made it to the university outskirts by mid-afternoon and parked two blocks from the data center Maeve had marked. It was buried beneath a tech annex—an ugly brick rectangle with ancient HVAC units rattling on the roof. Inside, the stairwell smelled like old books and chlorine. The server room was exactly as promised: unlocked, underutilized, and humming quietly beneath flickering fluorescent lights.

He inserted the drive. The upload began without resistance.

Fifteen minutes in, a knock echoed down the hall.

Jonah froze, hand near his belt. No gun. Just instinct.

The knock came again. Then a voice.

“Mr. Grady. I’d like a word.”

Female. Calm. Controlled.

He backed away from the terminal slowly. The upload was at seventy-two percent.

“I don’t want trouble,” he called out.

The voice replied. “You’ve already made it.”

A shadow appeared at the door.

The woman was tall, lean, dressed in gray like she belonged to neither military nor civilian authority. Her eyes were dark, unblinking.

“You’re Vega,” Jonah said.

She nodded once. “Liam always underestimated the importance of timing. So did Maeve.”

Jonah stepped forward, between her and the server. “You’re not stopping this.”

Vega tilted her head. “It’s already stopped.”

The lights flickered.

Jonah turned. The upload stalled at ninety percent.

“You triggered a kill switch,” he said.

“No,” she said. “You did. The moment you tried to make it permanent.”

She stepped closer, something like sympathy flickering across her face. “We never needed to erase the data. Only to delay it. By the time the story comes out, no one will remember the shape of it.”

Jonah didn’t move. “That might’ve worked. But not this time.”

He grabbed the power cord and ripped it from the wall. The server sparked. The drive smoked.

Vega didn’t flinch. “What did you do?”

Jonah smiled. “Backed it up. Offsite. Real offsite. You know what EMP-shielded storage looks like in a junkyard? It looks like garbage.”

She narrowed her eyes. “Maeve was always sentimental.”

Jonah shrugged. “Yeah. But I’m not.”

He lunged.

The fight was short. Brutal. He wasn’t a soldier, but he was desperate, and desperation made people unpredictable. Vega landed two clean blows before he slammed her head against the metal rack and left her crumpled beside the flickering console.

He didn’t wait for backup. He grabbed the scorched drive, ran to the truck, and drove east without looking back.

Maeve found him two days later near a reservoir in New Mexico. He was bruised, sore, sunburned, but alive. The drive was safe.

They didn’t speak at first. They sat beside the water, letting the silence do the work.

When she finally looked at him, her voice was soft. “You kept it alive.”

“So did you,” he said.

They stayed off-grid after that. The upload went out in stages. The first wave of raw files hit public forums. The second surfaced in encrypted drops to former Citadel employees. The third... Maeve saved the third. It was Liam’s video, the full version, with his final words and confession. She sent it to every person Liam had once worked with, every contractor, every handler.

Citadel fractured. Not overnight. Not cleanly. But cracks ran deep and fast.

Lawsuits began. Hearings. Investigations. Some people went to jail. Some vanished. Others reappeared under different names.

The system didn’t collapse.

But it blinked.

And sometimes, that was enough.

They stayed at the reservoir for two nights, hiding in plain sight amid a cluster of other travelers who didn’t ask questions and didn’t give names. Campers, loners, off-grid survivalists—people who had made peace with uncertainty. Jonah repaired the truck’s suspension during the first afternoon, using scrap from a gutted camper shell and tools he’d scrounged at a junk shop an hour’s drive south. It gave him something to do with his hands, and more importantly, something to focus on other than Vega’s face as she crumpled to the floor.

Maeve didn’t ask about the fight right away. She watched him work, quiet and patient, sometimes reading Liam’s notebook, sometimes staring out over the glinting, muddy water with an expression that wasn’t quite grief. Jonah knew better than to try and define it. Grief was just one of many things people carried that had no visible weight.

It wasn’t until the second night, when the fire had burned down to embers and the wind carried only the sound of crickets and the occasional low murmur of the distant highway, that she finally spoke.

“What did she say?”

Jonah didn’t pretend to misunderstand. He stirred the coals with a stick before answering. “Said the upload wouldn’t matter. That people would forget the shape of it.”

“And do you think she’s right?”

He looked over at her, eyes shadowed but clear. “People forget headlines. Not truth. Especially when it burns.”

Maeve nodded slowly. “I’ve thought a lot about what happens after. What we do. If we just... fade back into the world.”

Jonah sat back, stretching his sore leg. “Could you?”

She didn’t answer right away. The firelight made her face look older, not from age but from miles traveled. “I think maybe I could. If I knew it stuck.”

“It did,” he said. “It’s still sticking. Every day a little more.”

She pulled something from her jacket pocket—Liam’s photograph, the one from the lunchbox in the schoolhouse. She stared at it for a long time before placing it into the fire.

Jonah watched as it curled, blackened, and turned to smoke.

“He wouldn’t want me to carry him forever,” she said.

“No,” Jonah agreed. “He just wanted to be carried long enough.”

They slept in shifts again, not because they feared an attack—those days, they both felt, were over—but because it had become part of the rhythm. Trust, for all its growth between them, was still something exercised in silence, not declarations.

The next morning, they packed without talking about where they were going. The decision made itself. They drove south, passing through places that barely counted as towns. A diner on the edge of an abandoned strip mall. A gas station operated by a man who didn’t look up from his newspaper. No one recognized them. No one looked twice.

Somewhere outside of Silver City, they stopped at a general store with a hand-painted sign that read Martinez & Sons – Groceries & Gear. Maeve went inside while Jonah refueled. He finished just as she came back out, holding a paper bag in one hand and a folded flyer in the other.

“You ever heard of Langton Ridge?” she asked.

Jonah squinted at the horizon. “Yeah. Old mining cooperative. Then it turned into some kind of artist commune, right? Fell apart during the recession. Why?”

She handed him the flyer. It was printed in monochrome on cheap paper, slightly crooked as if it had been run through a secondhand copier. The headline read:

RECLAMATION GATHERING — FOR THOSE WHO WITNESSED, SURVIVED, AND WON’T FORGET.

Underneath was a list of topics: digital whistleblowing, neural rights, black-box government oversight, adaptive memory trials. At the bottom, a time and date: one week from now. And the words: “All voices. No names.”

“It’s them,” she said. “The people we reached. The ones who saw the data and didn’t look away.”

Jonah turned the flyer over in his hand. “You want to go?”

Maeve hesitated. “Not to speak. Just to see. Just to know.”

Jonah nodded. “Then let’s go.”

Langton Ridge sat in a shallow basin flanked by steep cliffs and rows of old-growth pine. The road in was mostly gravel and switchbacks, the kind of terrain that made the engine groan and the tires chew rock. But it was beautiful, in a raw, untamed kind of way. The remnants of cabins still stood here and there—converted to workshops, studios, small bunkhouses.

The gathering wasn’t what Jonah expected. No stages. No cameras. No banners. Just clusters of people talking quietly, showing one another printouts, hardware, copies of leaked memos. Some wore masks. Some didn’t. There was no press. No official record. But there was purpose.

They stayed on the edge at first, observing.

A woman in her sixties approached them near a makeshift coffee table set up on the bed of a pickup. She had an artificial hand and a scar running from her neck to her ear, but her smile was easy.

“You here for the exchange?” she asked.

Maeve looked at Jonah. “Maybe.”

The woman nodded, not pressing. “People bring what they’ve found. Copies, testimony, tools. They take what they need, give what they can.”

“What are they building?” Jonah asked.

The woman looked out over the crowd. “Memory. Not the kind you lose. The kind that learns.”

She walked away before either of them could reply.

Later that evening, Maeve added a copy of Liam’s final message to a weatherproof box marked “TRUTH – UNCONFIRMED BUT VERIFIED.” She didn’t say anything as she slipped it inside.

Jonah watched her, arms crossed. “You ready?”

Maeve turned to him, a trace of weariness lifting from her expression. “No. But I think I’m willing.”

They left Langton Ridge the next morning before sunrise. On the way down the mountain, Jonah kept his hand steady on the wheel, eyes ahead. The road stretched on.

At a crossroads fifty miles later, he glanced at her.

“Well?” he asked.

Maeve tilted her head toward the west. “Let’s see where the road ends.”

And together, they drove on—not away from anything, but toward something that hadn’t yet been named.

Chapter Seven: The Weight of Ash

The desert shifted as they drove west. Long valleys folded into arid plateaus, and the red rock gave way to stretches of bone-white salt, the sun carving shadows into the seams of the earth. Jonah drove with the window down, the warm wind carrying the scent of dust and sage, the steering wheel hot under his palms. Maeve sat beside him, the passenger seat reclined, her boots propped on the dash, eyes hidden behind scratched aviator sunglasses she’d picked up at a flea market outside Deming.

Neither of them had spoken for the past hour. They didn’t need to.

Silence between them no longer held tension—it was weight, sure, but a shared weight, not one passed back and forth like blame. It had become a kind of language, and on that empty stretch of highway, it said all it needed to.

The sun was low on the horizon when they crested a ridge and saw the town below—small, half-formed, nestled in a basin where the desert floor sagged into scrub and forgotten roads. The GPS on Jonah’s cracked burner phone had stopped updating an hour earlier, but the coordinates matched.

Ramsay, Arizona. A town that hadn’t made the last census and wouldn’t make the next.

Jonah parked the truck on the edge of what had once been a main street. There were no cars, no signs of life. Just rusted awnings, wind-chimed storefronts with broken glass, and a grainy mural half-faded on a stucco wall—children holding paper lanterns under a desert moon. A ghost’s attempt to remember light.

Maeve stepped out and stretched, her hand resting briefly on the handle of her revolver out of habit, not threat.

“This is where the file pinged last?” Jonah asked.

Maeve nodded. “Liam’s backup node broadcasted a status check. Only once. Three days ago.”

Jonah surveyed the buildings. “And you think it’s still here?”

She didn’t answer immediately. “No one else has touched the signal. Which means if someone buried it, they buried it deep.”

They started with the church. A squat adobe structure at the corner of the main drag, its bell tower collapsed inward, the stained-glass window punched out and lined with spiderwebs. Inside, the pews were warped and rotting, the altar little more than a plank laid across two crates. Maeve walked straight to the back, behind the pulpit, and pried open a trapdoor beneath the floorboards. They descended into a root cellar turned storage room, the walls lined with canned goods decades expired and shelves of yellowed hymnals.

In the far corner sat a filing cabinet, half-buried in old blankets. Maeve opened the top drawer.

Nothing but dust.

Jonah opened the bottom drawer.

There, wrapped in cloth and tucked behind a row of forgotten paperwork, sat a familiar shape: another drive, identical in size and casing to the others Liam had left behind.

Maeve exhaled slowly. “He really did it.”

Jonah turned it over in his hands. “Think this one’s live?”

“We’re about to find out.”

Back in the truck, they powered up the backup laptop. Maeve connected the drive, and for a long moment, nothing happened. Then the screen blinked once and opened a simple text prompt.

    NODE V-013 ACTIVE. MANUAL ACCESS REQUESTED.
    ENTER PASSPHRASE:

Maeve typed without hesitation. The same phrase Liam had written in the notebook.

“The static veins will always run.”

The terminal accepted it.

Files populated the screen—dozens, then hundreds. But these weren’t raw logs or trial reports. These were correspondences. Video calls. Contracts. Financial records. More importantly, names—many they had seen before, but now tied to aliases, account numbers, routing codes.

Jonah scrolled through the list, eyebrows tightening. “These aren’t just employees.”

“No,” Maeve said. “These are shareholders. Beneficiaries. The people who turned Citadel into a business model.”

At the bottom of the list was a folder labeled: DORMANT ENCLAVES.

Jonah clicked it open.

Within were coordinates. Fifty-seven locations, scattered across the U.S., and beyond. Many of the names were blank. A few were tagged INACTIVE. But four were marked PENDING REVIEW.

“Still operational,” Jonah murmured.

Maeve’s voice dropped. “Still experimenting.”

Jonah leaned back, shoulders heavy with implication. “How much do we leak? How much do we keep?”

Maeve closed the laptop and looked out at the darkening town. “We give them just enough to break the wheel.”

“And the rest?”

She stood and walked into the middle of the road, dust swirling around her boots. “We hold it. Keep it hidden. Something to trade, if we ever have to. Something to bury if we don’t.”

Jonah joined her. The wind had picked up, warm and dry, hissing through the hollowed windows and sagging roofs.

“You think it ends here?” he asked.

Maeve gave a slight shake of her head. “No. This is just where it starts becoming something else.”

They left Ramsay before dawn. No photos, no signatures, no messages scrawled in dust. Just the drive, and the coordinates, and the shared silence of people who understood the line between purpose and burden.

They didn’t talk about where they were going next. Not yet. There was still too much road. Too much dust.

But somewhere out there, other people were waking up. Some with questions. Others with blood on their hands. The fire had started. The smoke was spreading.

And Maeve and Jonah—witnesses, fugitives, whatever history might call them—weren’t running anymore.

They were watching.

Waiting.

And when the time came, they’d be ready to light the next match.

The road out of Ramsay was barely a road at all—just a ragged line of gravel and sand that curled around a ridge and vanished into the heat-shimmer of early morning. They didn’t speak much as they drove, both of them staring straight ahead, each carrying the knowledge of what they’d found like a second spine. Maeve kept the drive wrapped in a bandana in the glovebox. Jonah adjusted the rearview mirror every few minutes, not because he expected pursuit, but because old habits didn’t die all at once.

Around noon, they stopped at an abandoned ranger station tucked in a bowl of dust and cedar trees, the kind of place meant to monitor brushfires before funding dried up and the ground stopped burning. The building was locked, but Jonah forced the door with the same quiet persistence he used to loosen a rusted bolt. Inside, the walls were bare, shelves stripped, drawers empty. But there was shade, and a table, and a water line that still spat lukewarm mineral-rich water when coaxed.

Maeve unrolled a topographical map across the table. The kind Liam would have carried, Jonah thought. The kind that made no room for guesswork.

“These four,” she said, circling the enclaves marked PENDING REVIEW. “They’re not just data centers. These are active facilities. I recognize the signatures embedded in their node tags. That means real people. Live tests. Ongoing oversight.”

Jonah leaned in. “You think they’re repeating the program?”

“No,” Maeve said, shaking her head. “They’re refining it. We made too much noise for them to start from scratch. But I’d bet ever
