Title: When We Were Ferns
Author: [Redacted]
Chapter One: The Creek Behind the Hollow

In the summer of 1998, the sun never really set in Willowbend. Not in the minds of the children, at least. It hung low, orange and wide as a yawning mouth, for hours on end, painting shadows on the cracked pavement and rusted swing sets. Days dragged lazily like beetles across the backyard fence, and the nights were filled with cricket chirps and whispered dares.

Tommy Granger and Evie Malone were best friends since before either of them could spell the word. Their mothers met in Lamplight Grocery on the corner of Mulberry and 3rd, back when diapers were still a relevant concern. From that day on, it seemed like Tommy and Evie were handed to each other by fate—or perhaps just bored suburban proximity. They lived three houses apart on Cedar Loop and navigated those few hundred feet with the urgency of diplomats on secret missions.

Tommy was lanky and pale, with knobby knees and a thousand questions. His front tooth never quite caught up with the rest of his smile, giving him a perpetual look of surprise. Evie had a constellation of freckles across her nose and eyes that changed colors depending on her mood—green when she laughed, gray when she lied. She wore oversized T-shirts from her older brother's drawer and had an irrational fear of dryer lint.

Their world, in the beginning, revolved around the creek behind the Hollow, a small wooded area just past the cemetery where kids weren’t supposed to go. The trees there whispered to each other in a language only kids could almost understand. The creek ran cold even in July, and its bed was paved in smooth pebbles and secrets.

"This one looks like a dinosaur egg," Evie announced one afternoon, holding up a lump of mossy stone.

Tommy squinted. “Looks like a potato that forgot what it was.”

“It’s a dinosaur egg. You just don’t have the imagination.”

“You don’t have the science,” he shot back, flinging a pebble into the current.

They sat cross-legged on a fallen log, their feet dangling just above the water.

“If we ever find a real dinosaur,” Evie said after a while, “we shouldn’t tell anyone.”

“Obviously.”

“We’ll keep it here, teach it tricks, feed it peanut butter and stuff.”

“It’d probably eat your face.”

“Better mine than yours,” she grinned, and they both knew she meant it.

That summer was full of inventions. They created a language made mostly of grunts and whistles. They mapped the forest on a scrap of cardboard and named the clearings after inside jokes. There was Mosquito Point, where Tommy got bitten seventeen times in one sitting. There was Lint Hollow, a soft mossy patch where Evie had once had a panic attack after seeing a ball of dryer lint in her backpack. And there was the “Fern Circle,” a ring of ferns so perfectly shaped that they decided it was magic. Only they were allowed inside. It was a rule.

Rules mattered. More than anything.
Chapter Two: Rules are Rules (Until They're Not)

Evie and Tommy had rules like other kids had video games. Rule #1: No lying—except when absolutely necessary (a clause added after the Great Spaghetti Incident of ‘96). Rule #2: No crying unless it’s over a pet or a grandparent. Rule #3: If one of us dies, the other has to avenge their death, even if it’s just by being really sad for a long time.

Rule #7 was important. It was about The Notebook.

Tommy’s grandfather, a retired postal worker who had lost most of his hearing and all of his social filter, gave him an old leather-bound journal one Christmas. "For your truths," he had said, with a crooked wink. The Notebook became their confessional, their logbook, their story archive. Everything went in there: dream fragments, overheard adult conversations, sketches of the Fern Circle. On page 73, there was a poorly drawn but deeply felt map of a future treehouse. On page 94, a blood pact.

They hid The Notebook in an old tin lunchbox under a rock by the creek. Every time they buried it, they did a short, solemn ritual. It involved clinking together juice boxes and a weird chant Evie made up that sounded vaguely Latin but was mostly gibberish.

The summer stretched on. Fireflies came and went. A boy named Aaron Rayburn moved into town and tried to climb the Hollow fence. Tommy pushed him into a patch of poison ivy for that.

“What if someone finds our notebook?” Evie asked one afternoon, legs dangling over the creek as usual.

“They won’t,” said Tommy, skipping a stone.

“But what if they do?”

“Then they’ll know what it’s like to be us. Might make ‘em better people.”

Evie didn’t reply to that. Instead, she reached into the water and pulled out a fish skeleton—just the spine and tail, almost artistic in its simplicity. She held it up to the sky.

“Do you think we’ll still be friends when we’re old?”

“How old?”

“Like…thirty.”

Tommy laughed. “Thirty’s not old. That’s just grown-up kid.”

“I don’t want to be a grown-up kid. I want to stay a kid-kid.”

He shrugged. “Then don’t grow up.”

“Deal.”

But people always say that, don’t they?
Chapter Three: Rain, and Other Cracks

On August 11th, it rained hard. One of those fast, angry storms that comes from nowhere and soaks the world in minutes. The trees bowed, the roads flooded, and the creek rose like it had something to prove.

Tommy and Evie met under the bus stop roof, both soaked through.

“We have to check the notebook,” she said, wiping water from her eyes.

“It’ll be fine, it’s in the box.”

“It’s metal. Metal rusts.”

“It’s supposed to rust. That makes it cooler.”

They went anyway, sloshing through ankle-deep water and hopping the fence to the Hollow. The creek was a raging, muddy mess, and their rock marker was gone.

Evie screamed.

Tommy dropped to his knees and started digging where he thought the lunchbox had been. Mud clung to his arms like wet skin.

“It’s gone. Oh god. It’s gone.”

“We’ll find it,” he said, teeth clenched.

But they didn’t. Not that day. Not the next either.

The Fern Circle was half underwater. The ferns flattened, trampled by the storm like the world had stepped on their little magic kingdom.

Something changed after that.

They still met at the creek. Still made up games. But Evie laughed less. Tommy grew quieter. There was a new edge to their silences.

Then came September.

School meant different classes. Different friends. Evie started hanging around Mira Halstead, a girl who wore eyeliner and knew all the lyrics to Alanis Morissette songs. Tommy got obsessed with space, spent hours in the library alone reading about quasars and dark matter.

They still met. Sometimes. But the Fern Circle remained empty.
Chapter Four: The Year That Wasn't

1999 came quietly. No apocalypse. No Y2K panic in Willowbend. Just fireworks over the lake and cheap champagne spilled on carpet by parents who would regret it later.

Tommy and Evie barely spoke that winter.

Not because of a fight, exactly.

Because life shifted.

Tommy's dad got a new job. Spent more time away. His mom started sleeping on the couch. Evie’s parents divorced after a screaming match that ended with a broken vase and three cop cars on the lawn.

Everything became smaller. More adult.

By March, Tommy was drawing black holes in the margins of his math homework. Evie was writing song lyrics in sharpie on her arms and refusing to explain them.

They didn’t go back to the Hollow until April.

The notebook was still gone.

Or so they thought.

But then—

“Tommy. Look.”

Evie held it. The leather was warped and cracked, but unmistakable.

“It was in my mom’s closet,” she said quietly. “I don’t know how it got there.”

They sat in the Fern Circle again—new ferns growing from the soggy earth.

Page 117 was new.

It was written in a messy, unsure hand. Not Tommy’s. Not Evie’s.

Just a sentence:

“You forgot the rules.”

One particularly sweltering day in mid-July, when even the insects seemed too tired to buzz, Tommy and Evie made the decision to run away. Not forever—just for a few hours. They packed a backpack with peanut butter crackers, two Capri Suns, and a small flashlight that barely worked unless you hit it first. Evie smuggled out a bag of gummy worms from her kitchen pantry and a plastic magnifying glass she claimed could start a fire if you aimed it right. Tommy brought the compass from his dad’s old army kit and a comic book rolled tightly into a cylinder. The plan was to make it as far as Gorman’s Field and camp under the stars until at least 10 p.m., which in their minds was basically the same as being feral.

They set out just after lunch, weaving through side streets and ducking past chain-link fences. The field, which was actually an overgrown lot behind a shuttered auto shop, looked like a patch of green defiance in a town built on cracked asphalt and quiet disappointments. No one went there except the occasional high schooler looking to sneak a cigarette, but to Tommy and Evie, it was their wild frontier.

They laid out a blanket in the tallest patch of grass, where the world couldn’t see them. Above, clouds drifted lazily like they had nowhere better to be. Around them, dragonflies skated on the air, and the sound of distant traffic was muffled by the thick summer hush.

"I think I could live out here forever," Evie said, chewing on a gummy worm.

"You’d miss running water in like, two hours," Tommy replied.

"I'd dig a well. You think I'm not resourceful?"

He chuckled and flopped onto his back, shielding his eyes from the sun with one arm. "You'd die of dysentery by day three."

"Whatever. I’d outlive you by a week at least."

They lay in silence for a while, letting the heat settle around them like a heavy blanket. Tommy thought about how quiet everything was, how the field seemed to hum with the kind of magic that only existed when adults weren’t watching.

Evie broke the silence. "Do you think people are born best friends, or do they grow into it like a skin?"

He turned his head to look at her. "Like a skin?"

"You know what I mean. Like, maybe when you’re born, you have this extra skin waiting, and it only fits when you meet the right person."

"I think that sounds gross."

Evie smirked. "It is kind of gross. But also kind of true."

"I think it’s more like gravity. You just kind of get pulled to each other. Not because you’re supposed to, but because nothing else makes sense."

She considered that. "I like that better. Gravity-skin."

"That’s not a thing."

"It is now."

They didn’t stay until ten. The sun dipped, casting long shadows that made the field feel less wild and more lonely. Around eight, Tommy’s stomach growled loud enough for Evie to hear, and they both laughed, packed up, and made their way back through the shortcuts and backyards they knew by heart.

When they reached Cedar Loop, the streetlights had flickered on. Tommy’s porch light was glowing, a signal that curfew had struck.

“See you tomorrow?” he asked, lingering by the curb.

“Obviously.”

Evie turned, then stopped. "Hey—if you ever run away for real, you have to take me with you. That’s Rule #8 now."

Tommy gave a mock salute. "Got it. Rule #8: No running away solo."

They each took a few steps back toward their homes, glancing over their shoulders until they disappeared into the light and shadow of their respective front doors.

That night, Tommy couldn’t sleep. He lay in bed with the fan blowing warm air onto his face and stared at the ceiling as the shadows played tricks on him. He wondered what it would be like to actually leave everything behind—school, his room, his parents who always seemed on the verge of arguing. He pictured him and Evie walking down a long dirt road, with no backpacks or plans, just going until the map ran out. There was something comforting in the idea that she’d be there, that wherever they ended up, it would be together.

Down the block, Evie was wide awake too. She sat cross-legged on her bed, flipping through a book she wasn’t reading. Her room felt small tonight, like it was shrinking inward, like the walls were whispering things she didn’t want to hear. She turned off her lamp and let the moonlight take over. On her windowsill, she had a little jar of creek water they’d scooped up last week, filled with specks of sand and one very tired-looking tadpole.

She whispered toward it, "Hang on, little guy. We’re all just trying to make it."

The next day, the world shifted—though at first, it seemed ordinary. Tommy came over to Evie’s house just after breakfast. Her mom answered the door with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes and said Evie had gone to the store with her older brother.

“Want to wait in the yard?” she offered.

Tommy nodded and sat on the front steps, kicking pebbles into the flowerbed.

Twenty minutes passed. Then forty.

Evie never came.

He went home by lunch, feeling a little hollow.

The next few days were full of small absences. Evie wasn’t at the creek, even though it was their usual spot. She wasn’t home when he rang the bell. Her mom always had a different excuse—soccer camp, errands, "just missed her." Tommy started writing in The Notebook alone, even though it didn’t feel right. The tin lunchbox remained hidden under the big flat rock, its contents now strangely sacred.

A week later, Evie finally showed up again.

She was different.

Not drastically—still in baggy shorts and mismatched socks—but there was something behind her eyes that hadn’t been there before. A little sliver of distance.

"Sorry I’ve been gone," she said, not quite meeting his eyes.

"It’s okay. I kept the creek safe for you."

They sat on their log in silence. The water babbled over stones, and a dragonfly landed on Evie’s knee. She didn’t move.

"My brother got into a fight with my mom," she said finally. "Like, a real fight. Not yelling. Stuff got broken."

Tommy didn’t know what to say. He never knew what to say about things that happened inside houses.

"Do you wanna talk about it?"

"Not really."

They let the quiet settle again, thick and a little bitter.

Finally, Tommy stood up and offered a hand. “Come on. Let’s go find a better rock.”

"For what?"

"For sitting. The old one has too many memories."

Evie hesitated, then smiled—just a little. She took his hand.

Together, they walked upstream, past the log, past the Fern Circle, into the part of the creek they’d always said was too grown-up to explore.

And maybe that was the point.

Maybe they were growing up anyway.

Even if they didn’t want to.

In early September, when the air started to cool and the smell of pencil shavings returned to every hallway in Willowbend Elementary, Tommy and Evie discovered that growing up wasn’t a switch that flipped but a slow war of erosion. The first day of fifth grade arrived in a cloak of gray sky, and both of them noticed—without speaking—that the world had changed in the months since the creek had flooded and swallowed their childhood relic.

Tommy had grown taller over the summer, shooting up in a way that made his arms look too long for his body. He’d also begun to develop an almost obsessive interest in outer space, checking out every astronomy book the school library had and filling the margins of his notebooks with stars and moons and theoretical wormholes. Evie, meanwhile, had found a sudden interest in her older brother's music collection, listening to cassette tapes of Nirvana and Soundgarden on a hand-me-down Walkman she kept clipped to her belt. She wore a denim jacket now, frayed at the sleeves, and talked less than she used to.

It wasn’t that they weren’t friends. They still walked to school together when they could, still cut through the path behind the playground where the fence had rusted through. But their conversations had become shorter, more fragmented. The kind of sentences that began without urgency and ended without answers.

"Did you hear Mr. Renner's leaving after this year?" Tommy asked one morning, adjusting the straps on his backpack.

Evie shrugged. "Probably sick of it. Wouldn’t you be, dealing with this place every day?"

Tommy didn’t respond. He wasn’t sure he would get tired of it, not really. There was something comforting about the school’s sameness, the way the halls always smelled faintly of paste and corn chips, how the lights buzzed softly in the ceiling like a lullaby. He liked patterns. Evie, on the other hand, was starting to pull away from patterns, and that unsettled him in ways he couldn’t articulate.

The biggest shift came with Mira Halstead.

Mira had moved to Willowbend from Indiana two years earlier and instantly became the kind of girl everyone orbited. Her hair was always perfectly combed, her handwriting elegant and looping like it had been forged by generations of calligraphers. She had a quiet laugh and a pair of glittering barrettes shaped like stars. Evie had always said Mira was "too put together" to be interesting, but now they were eating lunch together by the swings and walking home in the afternoons with their heads bent close in hushed conversation.

Tommy noticed the first time it happened and assumed it was a fluke. The second time, he convinced himself Evie must have forgotten. But by the third time, when he waited by the usual tree near the edge of the playground and saw her laughing at something Mira had whispered, he understood something was shifting—and he wasn’t being consulted.

After school that day, he walked to the creek alone. The air smelled of dry grass and old leaves, and the sky had the kind of depth that made him feel tiny in the best way. He sat by their log, now partially sun-bleached and splitting at the edges, and reached beneath the flat rock that used to hide the lunchbox. It was still there, though rust had begun to eat away at the corners, and the hinges creaked when he opened it.

Inside, The Notebook waited. It felt lighter than he remembered.

Flipping through it, he found pages he had forgotten—drawings of the treehouse, theories about what lay beyond the woods, dreams that felt as far away as other lifetimes. He stopped on a page near the back where they had scribbled their Rule List in red marker, the ink faded and smudged from water damage.

Rule #1: No lying (unless absolutely necessary).
Rule #2: No crying unless over pets or grandparents.
Rule #3: Avenge each other’s deaths, even if just with sadness.
Rule #4: The creek is neutral ground.
Rule #5: Secrets stay secrets.
Rule #6: Always share snacks equally.
Rule #7: No talking to Mr. Dunlap’s cat—it’s cursed.
Rule #8: No running away solo.

He stared at Rule #4 for a long time.

Neutral ground.

He had always liked that. The idea that no matter how bad things got, they could always come back to the creek and start over. Like the way rivers always returned to the sea. But now it didn’t feel so neutral. It felt like an echo chamber.

That night, Tommy added a new entry to the notebook.

“Rule #9,” he wrote slowly, carefully. “Don’t forget who you were when it mattered.”

The next day, Evie didn’t wait for him.

Tommy walked to school alone, his shoelaces flopping and his backpack too heavy. He saw her up ahead, walking with Mira again, and considered running to catch up. But something about the curve of her shoulders told him he wasn’t invited. So he kept his distance, letting her drift further into that other orbit.

For the rest of the week, he avoided the creek. Instead, he buried himself in the school library, reading about supernovas and neutron stars and celestial bodies light-years away. He began to imagine his thoughts like galaxies—distant, orderly, safe.

On Friday, Evie found him behind the art room, alone with a book in his lap.

“You’ve been disappearing,” she said, leaning against the brick wall.

“I could say the same to you,” he replied, eyes not leaving the page.

She folded her arms. “Look, I didn’t ditch you or anything. Mira’s just—she gets it. Stuff at home’s been... rough lately.”

“You didn’t tell me.”

“You didn’t ask.”

“I shouldn’t have to.”

For a moment, she looked like she might cry, but then her face hardened into something Tommy didn’t recognize. “You’re the one who stopped showing up. Not me.”

“You changed the rules.”

Evie laughed, bitter and short. “They were just rules in a notebook, Tommy. We made them up. You think the world cares?”

Tommy closed his book and stood. “I care.”

They stared at each other for a few seconds, long enough to remember all the times they hadn’t had to speak at all. Then Evie turned and walked away.

He didn’t follow.

That night, it rained. Not the wild summer rain of July, but the colder, whispering rain that fell in sheets and slicked the roads in silver. Tommy dreamed of the creek again, only it was dry—just a long stretch of cracked earth where nothing grew. In the dream, Evie stood on the far side, waving, but every time he tried to cross, the ground crumbled beneath him and she got smaller and smaller.

When he woke, the sound of rain was real.

So was the ache in his chest.

The next morning, he returned to the creek. The log was damp, and the ferns had begun to turn yellow at the tips. Autumn was coming. He opened the lunchbox, half-expecting the notebook to be missing, but it was still there, tucked between two smooth stones and a crumpled drawing of a flying dinosaur with Evie’s name scrawled beneath it.

On the last page, someone had written a single line in pencil, the handwriting unfamiliar:

“You forgot the rules.”

Tommy stared at the words, his breath catching in his throat. He hadn’t written that. Evie wouldn’t have, not in pencil, not on the last page.

A gust of wind blew through the trees, rustling the ferns and sending a few leaves skittering across the surface of the water. The creek, usually so familiar, suddenly felt like it was watching him.

He closed the notebook gently, placed it back in the box, and covered it with the rock.

Maybe they had forgotten the rules. Maybe they needed new ones.

He wiped his hands on his jeans and stood. From upstream, he thought he saw movement—just a blur of denim and a flash of red hair.

But when he called Evie’s name, the woods remained still.

Tommy didn’t go back to the creek for several days after that. It wasn’t that he was afraid—though there was something undeniably eerie about the words on that last page—but rather that he felt uninvited. As though the place they’d once claimed together had been handed over to some other force, something watching from the trees, just out of sight. He carried the image of the pencil scrawl with him everywhere, trying to match the handwriting with anyone he could think of. It was too sloppy to be Mira’s. Too neat to be his grandfather’s. Maybe a prank, he thought. Some older kid who’d seen them bury the lunchbox. Or maybe Evie, playing one of her games, trying to spook him into talking.

But when he asked her directly the following Monday, she just blinked and said, “What notebook?”

He stared at her, confused, half-suspecting she was joking, but she didn’t flinch. She sat at the edge of the blacktop, chewing a Twizzler and drawing little circles on the pavement with the toe of her shoe.

“You know,” he said carefully, “the one we always write in. The one under the rock.”

Evie furrowed her brow and pulled one earbud out. “You mean, like... the fake diary thing we did in second grade?”

“It wasn’t fake. We wrote in it all the time. The rules, the stories—your dinosaur egg drawing—”

“That was years ago.” Her voice was quiet, almost detached. “I thought you threw that stuff away.”

He felt a coldness settle in his chest, spreading like a fog. “No. You’re messing with me.”

She didn’t answer.

They sat in silence for a long while, the buzz of recess carrying on around them like white noise. Somewhere, a whistle blew, and a group of kids rushed for the four-square court. The sun was warm, but Tommy shivered.

“I saw writing,” he finally said. “New writing. It said we forgot the rules.”

Evie stood, brushing dirt off her jeans. “Maybe we did.”

And then she walked away, joining Mira and the others near the tetherball pole, leaving him alone with the weight of something he didn’t know how to name.

At home, Tommy pulled out his own notebook—not the leather one, but the battered spiral he used for homework and sketches—and started listing everything he could remember about the rules. He wrote down the original ones, then the ones they’d added later, and then tried to remember if there had ever been one they didn’t write down. Something unspoken. Something only they knew.

The more he thought, the more scattered the memories became. The Fern Circle. The chant Evie had invented. The blood oath. The night they made their pact under the comet shower. The glow-in-the-dark stars on her ceiling. The sound of her laugh when she was about to do something dangerous.

How could she have forgotten?

Unless she hadn’t. Unless she was pretending.

Or unless the notebook was doing something it wasn’t supposed to.

The idea crept in slowly, like water seeping under a door. He’d read about it once in one of his sci-fi books—objects that could hold memories, that bent the truth around them. What if The Notebook was more than just paper and ink? What if it had absorbed something from them—something it wasn’t supposed to—and was now trying to fill the silence they had left behind?

That night, he dreamed of the creek again. This time, it was different. The water was clear and slow, but there were voices under the surface—whispers, too soft to understand. In the dream, he reached into the water and pulled out the lunchbox. But when he opened it, it wasn’t the notebook inside. It was a photograph.

Him and Evie, maybe age six, sitting in the Fern Circle. Only, their faces had no eyes.

He woke up gasping, drenched in sweat.

Three days later, Tommy returned to the creek.

It had rained again, and the ferns were brighter for it, a wild green that seemed more alive than any plant had the right to be. He crouched by the rock, heart thudding in his ears, and carefully lifted the lid of the lunchbox.

The notebook was still there.

But something was wrong.

The pages had been rearranged. Or rewritten. Or both.

He flipped through them slowly, eyes scanning for anything familiar, and began to notice things that didn’t belong. A drawing of a house on fire. A page filled entirely with the word “REMEMBER” written over and over, slanting more violently each time. A map of the creek that included paths he was certain didn’t exist. And on the inside of the back cover, scrawled in large block letters:

"RULES KEEP THE MEMORY SAFE. BREAK THEM AND WE FORGET."

His mouth went dry. He slammed the notebook shut and sat back on his heels.

This was no prank.

Whatever the notebook had become, it had moved beyond them.

Still shaking, Tommy took out his own pen and wrote a new entry.

“Evie doesn’t remember. I do. I’m scared. Something’s trying to erase us.”

He closed the box and placed the rock carefully over it, hands trembling.

As he stood, he heard movement in the woods. A soft rustling. Not an animal—something steadier, with intention. He turned sharply, expecting to see Evie, or Mira, or even one of the high schoolers who sometimes wandered through with cigarettes and bravado.

But there was no one there.

Only trees. And the hush that comes just before something important.

Tommy didn’t run.

He just stood there, staring into the branches, waiting for something to step forward and explain what was happening.

Nothing did.

Eventually, he walked home, his head full of whispers he couldn’t quite hear.

Later that week, his science teacher, Mrs. Clary, assigned them a group project on celestial navigation. Tommy waited for Evie to join him, the way she always had. But instead, she partnered with Mira. The two of them sat at the back of the room, giggling softly and trading song lyrics between half-hearted notes.

Tommy ended up working with Aaron Rayburn, who spent most of the class asking if Polaris was a type of soda.

After school, Evie caught up with him outside.

“Hey,” she said, tugging on the strap of her backpack. “You okay?”

“You tell me,” he replied, a little more bitterly than he intended.

She sighed. “Look, I know we haven’t hung out much. It’s just—stuff’s different now.”

“Different doesn’t mean fake.”

“I never said it did.”

“You act like none of it happened. The creek. The rules. Like you’re not even the same person.”

Evie looked at him, and for a moment, something flickered behind her eyes. A memory, maybe. Or a ghost of one.

Then she smiled sadly. “Maybe I’m not.”

Tommy didn’t have a response.

They parted ways without another word.

That night, he opened the notebook again.

The last page had changed.

Now it read:

“She is forgetting. You have to remember for both of you. Or it will take everything.”

He stared at the sentence for a long time, then slowly turned the page.

Beneath it, in faint pencil, as if from years ago:

"If one of us disappears, the other has to find them. That’s Rule #10."

He didn’t remember writing that.

But it was in his handwriting.

Chapter Three: Rain, and Other Cracks

The first real cold snap came in early October, and with it, the air around Willowbend turned sharp and dry, like paper about to tear. Trees began shedding their leaves in bursts of fire-orange and amber, carpeting the sidewalks in a brittle hush. It was the season of windbreakers and lost gloves, of breath showing in the mornings and fireplaces glowing behind front windows. It was also the time when Tommy realized that something was fundamentally wrong—not just with Evie, or the notebook, or the woods, but with the very shape of the days themselves.

People had started to forget things.

Not in the usual absent-minded, late-for-an-appointment way. It was subtler, sneakier. Mrs. Clary, their science teacher, began referring to an old seating chart that no longer matched the actual students in her class. Tommy’s mother, when asked about his favorite childhood book, frowned and said she didn’t think he had ever liked to read. And when he tried to talk to his grandfather about the journal—the leather one he had given Tommy all those years ago—he received only a confused expression and a change of subject to a sports game that had never aired.

Tommy wrote it all down. Every oddity. Every conversation that didn't make sense. He had started keeping a second notebook now, one he carried everywhere in his coat pocket. A ledger of forgetting. A record of the cracks spreading through the world around him.

He had only seen Evie once that week, across the cafeteria. She was sitting with Mira and a couple of other girls, trading Halloween costume ideas and laughing at something too far away for him to hear. She didn’t look over at him, not even once. When she laughed, her eyes closed just like they always had, and it struck him that she might be happy—actually happy—without him. The thought was both cruel and freeing.

Later that day, as he walked home alone, Tommy passed by the vacant house near the edge of the neighborhood—the one that had been for sale for nearly two years. Only now it wasn’t vacant. A moving truck was parked in the driveway, and a man in a worn-out coat was pulling furniture from the back, though Tommy didn’t see a license plate on the truck. The man didn’t seem to notice him walking by, but Tommy felt his gaze anyway, a weight on the back of his neck like cold fingers.

He quickened his pace.

That night, Tommy returned to the creek with a flashlight and a new sheet of plastic wrap to cover the lunchbox. He had begun to treat the area like a shrine, a last defense against the unraveling he saw in the people around him. The flashlight cast long, warped shadows against the trees, and the ferns—once lush and inviting—now seemed brittle, as if they had lost faith in the soil that held them.

He crouched, opened the box, and flipped through the notebook.

Three more pages had appeared.

They weren’t blank, nor were they written in his hand. One was a list—names he didn’t recognize, followed by symbols that looked like moons and triangles. The second was a drawing of the Fern Circle, but the ferns were twisted, coiled like serpents instead of plants. And the third was a set of instructions:

"If she forgets the way, leave a trail.
If you forget her name, write it in blood.
If the woods speak, do not answer.
If the notebook burns, it is too late."

Tommy stared at the words until the wind began to stir around him, rustling the plastic in the trees, whispering through the reeds. He slammed the notebook shut and buried it deeper than usual, placing extra stones on top. As he walked away, he noticed something strange. The creek’s surface, always jittery and full of movement, was perfectly still. He knelt beside it and peered down. His reflection was missing. There was no face in the water.

Just the sky above. A full moon, too large for the season.

He stood, suddenly breathless, and ran home without looking back.

The next day, during lunch, Evie approached him.

Not in the way she used to—not with a grin and a plastic sword or a handful of gummy worms—but in a quiet, deliberate walk, like she was approaching something fragile that might bolt at any second.

"Can we talk?" she asked, her voice low.

Tommy blinked, unsure if she was real.

"Yeah. Sure."

They walked to the edge of the playground, where the maintenance shed cast a long shadow and the other kids didn’t go.

Evie stared at the ground for a long time before speaking. "Something’s wrong with my dreams."

Tommy nodded slowly. "I know."

"I see... versions of us. But not us. Not here. Other places. We’re older. Or different. Sometimes you’re gone. Sometimes I’m someone else entirely. And the creek—"

"It’s not just your dreams," he said quickly. "It’s happening."

She looked up at him sharply. "You remember too?"

"Yeah. And not just the dreams. People are forgetting things. You forgot the notebook, Evie. You looked me in the eye and said you didn’t remember it."

Evie’s mouth twitched. “I didn’t mean to. It was like... like someone erased that part of my brain. But then the other night I woke up and I was holding a drawing of the Fern Circle. I don’t even remember making it.”

Tommy swallowed. “I think it’s the notebook. Or something in it.”

Evie frowned. “You think it’s alive?”

“I think it’s watching.”

They stood in silence. Somewhere behind them, the bell rang to signal the end of lunch. Neither moved.

“I saw something in the woods,” she said suddenly. “A girl. At least, I think it was a girl. But her eyes were... I don’t know. Too dark. Like they were holes.”

Tommy felt cold again. “What did she say?”

“Nothing. She just stared. But I had the feeling she knew my name even when I didn’t. Like she was waiting for me to forget it completely.”

He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out his second notebook, flipping to the page where he had started a new rule list.

“I added Rule Ten,” he said. “If one of us disappears, the other has to find them.”

Evie took the notebook from him and read the page. After a moment, she nodded. “Then I want to add one too.”

She took out a pen and wrote beneath his entry in her tidy, slanted handwriting:

“Rule Eleven: If we forget each other, we have to find a way back.”

Tommy stared at the words. “Even if the world changes?”

Evie looked up at him, her eyes steady. “Especially then.”

They returned to class without speaking. For the first time in weeks, Tommy felt something he hadn’t in a long while. Not hope, exactly, but something adjacent to it. A thread connecting two drifting ships in a dark sea.

On Friday afternoon, Evie asked him to meet her at the edge of the Hollow after school. She said there was something she had to show him.

When he arrived, she was already there, wearing her brother’s hoodie and holding something under her arm wrapped in a pillowcase. Without speaking, she led him through the overgrown brush to the old part of the woods—the part beyond the Fern Circle they had always called “No Kid’s Land” because it felt like they weren’t supposed to be there.

They reached a clearing he had never seen before.

At the center was a tree. Enormous. Older than anything else in the forest. Its trunk was gnarled and hollowed out, and on the bark, someone had carved a single word in wide, rough strokes:

REMEMBER

Evie stepped forward and placed the bundle at the base of the tree. She unwrapped it.

It was another notebook.

Older than theirs. Bound in leather, but cracked and faded, and wrapped in a string of twine. Tommy knelt beside it, hesitating before touching it.

“It was in the basement,” she said. “Behind the water heater. My mom doesn’t know where it came from.”

He picked it up. It was warm.

Inside, the pages were full of entries. Names he didn’t know. Stories that didn’t make sense. Sketches of places that had never existed. And then—on page ninety-seven—a drawing of the Fern Circle.

Dated 1979.

“We’re not the first,” he whispered.

Evie nodded. “I don’t think we’re even the first this year.”

Tommy looked around the clearing, suddenly aware of how quiet it was. No birds. No wind.

Just the tree.

Just the word.

Just the weight of memory pressing in from all sides.

And somewhere in the back of his mind, a voice—not his—whispered:

“Rule Twelve: Never dig too deep. Or you’ll find what’s been waiting.”

Tommy barely slept that weekend. Even when he lay in bed with his eyes closed, the images of the old tree, the carved bark, and that second, ancient notebook flickered behind his eyelids like film reels caught on loop. His mind struggled to process the possibility that what he and Evie had stumbled into wasn’t just a strange corner of childhood fantasy, but something deeper—older. The revelation that the Fern Circle wasn’t unique to them unraveled the foundation of everything he had believed. He had thought their stories, their rules, were built on innocence and invention. But now it seemed more like they had stepped into a pattern, one that had been repeated again and again, each generation leaving behind whispers for the next.

Sunday morning, just as the sun peeled over the edge of the houses, he took out both notebooks—his personal one and The Notebook—and began comparing entries. The newer, mysterious pages in The Notebook seemed to correspond eerily with the older one Evie had found. The symbols were the same. So were the phrases—"Remember the path," "The names anchor the world," "The ferns remember more than you." Tommy didn’t know what to make of that. At first he wondered if maybe someone had forged the old book, planted it to scare them. But the handwriting varied wildly—some neat and cramped, some large and looping, others almost illegible. Different authors. Different times. The paper itself was brittle and yellowed, smelled faintly of mildew and dust, too convincingly aged to be a recent fabrication.

He spent most of the morning trying to trace a timeline through the entries. From what he could gather, there had been a group of kids in 1979 who used the Hollow in the same way—naming places, creating rules. One entry referred to a "Circle Pact" and a drawing of five kids standing around the tree. Another entry, dated 1980, was ominous: "We lost James in the Fern Circle. Don’t step into the ring alone. We didn’t know then. We do now."

Tommy showed Evie the line about James when they met up that afternoon in the clearing again. She read it over twice, her brows knit tightly.

“You think he got lost?” she asked, chewing on a piece of her hoodie sleeve.

Tommy nodded. “I don’t think they meant it metaphorically.”

She glanced back toward the Fern Circle, which they could just barely see from the edge of the clearing. The ferns were taller now than they had been just a week ago, and unnaturally green for this late in the season.

“I keep dreaming about the circle,” she said quietly. “Sometimes I’m standing outside of it, and you’re inside. Sometimes it’s the other way around. And sometimes, there’s someone else in the middle—someone we don’t know, but we almost recognize. And they keep saying the same thing.”

“What?”

“‘Don’t step in unless you remember your name.’”

They stared at each other, the weight of the sentence pressing down like the hush before a storm.

That evening, they created a plan.

They would document everything. Every sighting, every dream, every strange shift in memory or behavior. They’d return to the tree weekly, record the condition of the clearing and the ferns, keep time like sailors charting an ocean. Tommy suggested calling their journal “The Anchor,” and Evie agreed. The idea was simple: if the world was forgetting, they would remember harder.

At school, they were careful. They didn’t talk openly about the notebooks or the rules anymore, not even at recess. Mira tried to pull Evie back into their lunch group, but Evie, though polite, was increasingly distant. She still laughed, still made sarcastic remarks in class, but her eyes were different. Wary. Focused.

One afternoon, after an unusually tense math lesson, Evie leaned over during quiet work and whispered to Tommy, “I think I saw her again.”

Tommy didn’t have to ask who.

“The girl?”

Evie nodded. “Behind the gym. Just for a second. She wasn’t looking at me this time. She was looking up at the sky. But it was wrong. Like... like she didn’t know what the sun was.”

They arranged to meet again that evening.

It was colder now, the wind sharp enough to nip at their ears. They wore scarves and gloves and climbed the fence behind the cemetery to reach the Hollow, avoiding the usual paths. As they approached the Fern Circle, they stopped.

Something was there.

Not a person, exactly. A shape. A distortion. The air shimmered slightly above the ring of ferns, like heat waves off pavement, even though the temperature was near freezing. Tommy took a step forward, and Evie grabbed his arm.

“Don’t,” she said, her voice trembling. “We’re not ready.”

He hesitated, then nodded. They moved around the circle and continued to the tree.

When they opened the old notebook, another entry had appeared.

This one was dated 1964.

It read:

“It always starts with the forgetting. Then the rules break. Then the circle opens. If you see yourself inside the ring, don’t approach. It’s not you.”

Tommy read the words aloud and felt his stomach churn. “What do you think it means?”

Evie swallowed. “I think it means the ring is a door. And something is trying to come through.”

The idea seemed too large to hold, but also impossible to ignore. They spent the rest of the evening drawing diagrams, cross-referencing symbols from both notebooks, comparing maps. They noticed something strange: every child’s drawing of the Hollow—no matter what year—placed the Fern Circle at the exact same distance from the old tree. As if the tree were the center of gravity, and the circle just one of its moons.

They also discovered that Rule #4—The creek is neutral ground—was written in almost every version of the rules, from every decade. Tommy wondered aloud whether it was just coincidence, or whether some ideas stayed rooted no matter how much the world tried to forget them.

By the time they left, the sky had gone completely black, and the woods were uncomfortably still. Tommy insisted on walking Evie home, which she didn’t argue with.

As they reached her front porch, she stopped suddenly.

“Hey,” she said. “You remember that plastic dinosaur I buried in your backyard when we were seven? The one with the glow-in-the-dark eyes?”

Tommy blinked. “Yeah. You said he was our bodyguard.”

Evie nodded slowly. “Just making sure I didn’t make that up.”

She stepped inside, and the door closed with a soft click.

Tommy stood there for a moment, staring at the spot where she had just been, then looked up at the sky. No stars.

The next day, everything changed.

It started with the announcement at school.

Mr. Renner, the social studies teacher, had gone missing. Not just absent, not sick. Gone. His classroom had been left untouched, his car still parked at home, his phone disconnected. The principal called it “an extended leave of absence,” but even the teachers didn’t seem to believe it. There were whispers in the hallways, murmurs of police cars, unmarked vans, people in dark clothes asking strange questions.

Tommy looked to Evie during the assembly, and she gave him a single nod.

After school, they ran—not walked—to the Hollow.

This time, when they reached the clearing, the notebook wasn’t there.

In its place, resting where the roots of the tree split like open hands, was a photo.

Black and white. Grainy.

Five kids standing in the Fern Circle. One of them looked eerily like Tommy. Another wore a jacket identical to Evie’s. The others were unfamiliar—blurred faces, strange clothes, and a girl with her back turned.

On the bottom corner, scrawled in red ink:

“Some echoes are louder than others.”

Evie picked it up slowly. “I think we’re inside something we don’t understand.”

Tommy nodded, unable to speak.

The tree creaked behind them, though no wind moved the branches.

And far off, at the edge of the forest, something began to whistle a tune neither of them remembered, but somehow both knew.

Chapter Four: The Year That Wasn’t

By the time November settled in, Willowbend was a place of frostbitten windows and leafless trees, the whole town turning brittle and quiet under a blanket of early cold. The laughter of summer had been packed away in cardboard boxes along with Halloween decorations and folding lawn chairs, and the streets were filled with the kind of silences that didn’t want to be broken. People walked a little faster. Lights stayed on longer into the night. The wind had a way of slipping into houses even when the doors were closed tight.

Tommy and Evie began to feel that time wasn’t moving forward the way it used to. Days blurred together. Teachers started repeating lessons. The same lunch menu showed up three times in a single week. On Thursday, the principal wished everyone a happy Monday, and no one corrected her. At first, they thought it was just tiredness, maybe the weight of the season settling into people's bones. But then came the week that disappeared entirely.

Tommy noticed it first. He woke up on a Saturday morning and checked the calendar. It was marked November 18th. He could have sworn it was only the 12th two days ago. He asked his mom what they did on the 13th—she paused, frowned, and said she couldn’t remember anything specific. When he checked his school planner, the pages for that week were blank. No assignments, no notes, no doodles. Even stranger, his own handwriting looked different on either side of the missing days, like someone else had been holding the pen.

He ran to Evie’s house without thinking, clutching his notebook like a talisman. She answered the door half-asleep, rubbing one eye and blinking in confusion.

“I think we lost a week,” he said without preamble.

Evie stepped aside and let him in. Her house was unusually quiet. No music from her brother’s room, no TV murmuring from the living room. Just silence and the soft hum of the radiator.

In her bedroom, she showed him her calendar. The days from the 12th to the 17th had been ripped out—not crossed off, not scribbled over, but cleanly torn from the spiral. She swore she hadn’t done it. There was a note on her mirror in her own handwriting that read, “Don’t forget what we promised,” but she had no memory of writing it.

They sat on the floor, cross-legged, facing each other with the notebooks spread between them like ritual tools. Tommy pulled out the photo they’d found near the tree—five children in the Fern Circle, one of them blurry, one of them looking almost exactly like him. They had gone over it a dozen times already, but he felt compelled to show it again.

“We’ve been inside the circle,” he said quietly. “Not just near it. Somehow... we’ve already stepped in. We just don’t remember when.”

Evie’s face was pale in the gray light coming through her window. “Maybe that’s what it does. Maybe it makes you forget so you don’t know how deep you are.”

She opened the older notebook—the one they’d found at the tree—and flipped to the last marked page. The ink was faded, but the entry was chillingly clear.

“It took Marcus on the third crossing. We thought the notebook would keep the path open. It didn’t. The circle sealed behind us. I’m writing this in case someone finds it. If you do—don’t trust your own memory. It belongs to the Hollow now.”

Neither of them spoke for a long time.

When Evie finally did, her voice was barely above a whisper. “We need to find out who the others were. In the photo.”

Tommy nodded. “And what happened to them.”

The next week, they went to the town library. It smelled of old paper and floor polish and something faintly metallic, like old coins. The librarian, a thin woman named Miss Carol who wore sweaters with sequined birds, watched them closely as they browsed the archives. Tommy noticed that her eyes lingered longer than normal when he asked about old school records, and that her hands trembled slightly when she pulled down a box labeled “1970–1985.”

The files were mostly boring—typed class lists, faded photographs of science fairs and spelling bees, yellowed newsletters—but eventually, tucked between two stapled math worksheets, they found a black-and-white class photo labeled Willowbend Elementary, 1980, Grade 6. Evie gasped and pointed to the back row.

“That’s her,” she whispered. “The girl from the woods.”

Tommy leaned closer. The image was grainy, but her face was unmistakable. Same dark eyes, same unplaceable expression. She wasn’t looking at the camera. Her head was slightly turned, like she had heard something behind her just as the shutter clicked.

“She had a name,” Tommy said. “She was one of us.”

They checked the back of the photo. A list of names had been scrawled in ink—many too faded to read, but a few were clear. One of them: Clara W.

They spent the rest of the afternoon searching through every record they could find, trying to trace the names on the list. Most led nowhere. The files ended abruptly after 1981. The school yearbook for 1982 was missing entirely.

“Someone scrubbed this,” Evie said, flipping through the dusty folder again. “Or something did.”

Tommy agreed, though he didn’t say it out loud. He had begun to feel like the notebooks were watching him even when they were closed. Once, he’d heard them rustling inside his backpack without being touched. Another time, he swore he saw one of the drawings—an old sketch of the Fern Circle—shift when he wasn’t looking directly at it.

They left the library before sunset, both of them uneasy, both pretending not to be.

The week after Thanksgiving, Tommy’s dreams grew worse.

He stopped dreaming of the creek. Instead, he dreamed of the empty classroom, of sitting in a desk while the hallway outside stretched longer and longer until it reached into the forest. Sometimes, he saw himself through the window—his own face, watching from the shadows. Once, he woke up with the taste of dirt in his mouth.

Evie wasn’t doing much better. She had started carrying her older brother’s pocketknife with her. Just in case. When Tommy asked her what “just in case” meant, she said she didn’t know—but she felt better having it close.

At school, people became even stranger. Kids forgot their own locker combinations. A teacher asked a girl named Delia why she hadn’t turned in her homework—except Delia had moved away two months ago. The janitor quit without giving notice. He left behind a note that just read, “The lines aren’t holding anymore.”

On December 2nd, the creek froze over.

That had never happened before.

Tommy and Evie stood at the edge of the bank, staring at the smooth glassy surface, the water beneath frozen solid in place like a snapshot of time. The ferns had withered, brown and thin. The rock covering the lunchbox was dusted with frost, and when Tommy opened it, he found a fresh page in the notebook.

“Rule Thirteen: The circle chooses when to open. But it never closes behind the same person twice.”

They stared at the line, neither of them speaking. The implications were clear.

Evie broke the silence. “You think it means we’ve already gone through?”

Tommy shook his head. “I don’t think we’ve gone through. I think we’ve been going through, over and over. And each time, we forget.”

They stood in the cold, the silence deepening around them like a cocoon.

Evie’s breath curled in the air. “Then how do we stop it?”

Tommy looked at her, the only real thing left in a world that felt increasingly like a cracked mirror.

“I think we have to go through again. But this time, we don’t forget.”

“How?”

“We leave something behind.”

They both looked at the lunchbox. At the notebooks. At the frozen creek and the ghost of a forest that had seen too much.

That night, they stayed up late writing. Not just notes or rules, but letters—to themselves. Memories. Confessions. Every small truth that might anchor them if the circle took their minds again.

They folded them into plastic bags, tucked them beneath the log, sealed them with tape, marked them with red Sharpie: OPEN ONLY IF YOU FORGET.

Then they held hands and walked back toward the Fern Circle, where the trees no longer rustled in the wind, and the path behind them vanished the moment they stepped forward.

They didn’t step into the Fern Circle that night. Not yet. Though the trees leaned inward and the frost shimmered at their feet like powdered glass, something inside both of them hesitated—an unspoken understanding that the door would remain if they waited one more day, but they themselves might not be the same.

Instead, they sat at the edge of the circle and talked, not about rules or memory or Clara W., but about themselves. Tommy told Evie about how he used to cry when his mom left the house for groceries because he thought she might never come back. Evie admitted that she sometimes stood in front of mirrors at night just to make sure her reflection still matched who she felt like on the inside. They spoke softly, as though the woods had ears, and every few minutes they glanced up at the sky, half-expecting it to tear open.

“I don’t want to forget again,” Evie said, watching her breath spiral into the cold air. “Even the stuff that hurts. I want to remember all of it.”

Tommy nodded, his voice quiet. “I don’t think pain’s the worst thing. I think not knowing who you were—that’s worse.”

They promised, for the second time that year and maybe the third time in their lives, to hold on. Not just to the notebooks or to each other, but to themselves, to the versions they had become when no one else was looking. They promised it not with blood or chants, but in silence, the kind that makes two people feel like they are the only ones left in a world that’s still deciding if it wants them.

In the days that followed, the world continued to blur. Snow began to fall, though no one had seen any in the forecast. The news talked about strange magnetic activity near town, electrical outages, and an unexplained flock of birds found dead near the edge of the Hollow, their wings perfectly folded as though they had chosen to lie down and sleep. At school, things grew weirder still. Students forgot entire assignments, and one girl began screaming when she saw her reflection in a locker mirror. When the nurse asked what was wrong, she only said, “That’s not me.”

Tommy’s parents stopped asking questions. His mom, once so detail-oriented and careful, forgot how to cook her favorite chili and burned dinner twice in one week. His father sat on the couch most nights, flipping through channels without stopping, as if looking for something that had vanished between broadcasts. The town felt hollowed out, like something had turned it inside out and put it back together slightly wrong.

He stopped trying to explain it to anyone else. There was only Evie now. Only their plan.

On December 5th, they returned to the Fern Circle.

The air was warmer than it should have been. Not warm, exactly, but wrong—damp and heavy, like a greenhouse forgotten in winter. The circle itself had changed. The ferns, though frostbitten days earlier, were now alive and tall again, standing unnaturally still. The space inside looked deeper than it had before, as if someone had taken a knife and cut a perfect circle into the world.

Evie stepped forward first. She didn’t look back.

Tommy followed, stepping into the ring just as the light around them seemed to bend.

It didn’t feel like teleportation. It didn’t feel like floating or sinking or falling. It felt like a pause. A long, breathless stillness, as though time had taken a step back to watch what they would do.

Then the world snapped.

They were standing in the same spot, but everything was slightly… brighter. The trees were taller, their bark glistening like obsidian. The sky was a soft lavender shade, cloudless and quiet. The creek behind them was gone, replaced by a line of white stones. And at the center of the Fern Circle, where no one had stood before, was a girl.

Not Clara W.

Someone else.

She looked about their age, with eyes like storm glass and long braids tied with bits of ribbon. Her dress was old-fashioned, stitched by hand, the hem torn in places. She smiled when she saw them.

“Welcome back,” she said, as though she had been waiting.

Tommy and Evie said nothing. They were both frozen in place.

The girl tilted her head. “You’ve come further than the last ones. Most don’t make it past the forgetting.”

“Who are you?” Evie asked, voice tight.

The girl stepped closer, and though her feet moved, they didn’t seem to disturb the ground.

“I’m the one who remembers,” she said. “When the circle takes something, it has to leave a witness behind. I was the first. Or maybe the last. It depends on how you count.”

Tommy looked around, trying to make sense of what they were seeing. “Is this... the other side?”

The girl shrugged. “It’s the Between. Not the end. Not the beginning. Just the place where things that slip through cracks end up.”

She gestured toward the trees behind her. “You want to stop it. I know. Everyone does at first.”

“Stop what?” Evie asked.

“The forgetting. The looping. The part where you start to fade. You think if you leave enough notes, enough rules, enough breadcrumbs, you’ll find your way back.”

“Isn’t that how remembering works?” Tommy asked.

The girl smiled, but there was sadness in it. “It is. But the circle doesn’t play fair. It doesn’t forget you. It erases you. And once you're erased, you're not even a ghost.”

A long silence passed between them.

“But we made it here,” Evie said. “That has to mean something.”

“It does,” the girl agreed. “It means you’re close.”

“Close to what?”

“Your own echo.”

Tommy frowned. “What does that mean?”

The girl walked toward the center of the circle and knelt, brushing aside leaves to reveal a small wooden box. She opened it and took out a torn photograph. It was of Evie, alone in the Fern Circle, her eyes closed. Behind her, barely visible, stood a second Evie, blurred and expressionless.

“You’ve stepped in before,” the girl said. “But you didn’t leave a strong enough tether. That’s why the rules keep changing. That’s why the notebooks rewrite themselves. You’re bleeding between versions.”

Evie looked sick. “What happens if the tethers break?”

“You become part of the circle. Just like me.”

The girl folded the photo carefully and returned it to the box.

“But there’s still time,” she added. “You’re not echoes yet. You remember each other. That’s your anchor. Use it. Before the winter solstice. That’s when the circle resets. If you’re still inside when that happens...”

She didn’t finish the sentence.

“What do we have to do?” Tommy asked.

The girl looked at him with something like admiration. “Find the first door. The real one. You’ll know it when you see it. It leads out, but only if you both walk through together. Alone, it closes. Together, it remembers.”

The forest began to shimmer around them. The circle vibrated faintly beneath their feet.

“You have until the longest night,” she whispered. “That’s when the old rules return.”

And then she was gone.

Not vanished. Just... blinked out, as if someone had pressed pause and never resumed.

Evie reached for Tommy’s hand. “We go together. No matter what.”

He gripped it tightly. “No matter what.”

The world around them bent again, and the circle expelled them like seeds caught in wind.

They landed on their knees in the Hollow. Same ferns. Same tree. But the air was heavier. Older.

And the frost was gone.

The solstice was coming.

Chapter Five: Anchors in the Dark

The solstice loomed like a storm cloud suspended in time. With each passing day, the sky darkened earlier, and the air felt more like breath held too long. December clung to Willowbend like frost to a windowpane—thin, hard, and ready to shatter. Every morning the ground was glazed in white. Streetlights flickered like they were remembering something they couldn’t quite say aloud. And behind the town's quiet routines, a second world pulsed—just beneath the snow, in the corners of closed rooms, under the creek ice that never cracked.

Tommy and Evie stopped going to school. They told their parents they were sick, and the adults believed them too easily. Something was wrong with everyone—like a fog had settled not in the air but in their heads. Mr. Rayburn, the neighbor who always raked his yard in neat concentric patterns, had forgotten how to drive and simply sat in his truck most of the day, staring out the windshield with the keys in his lap. At the grocery store, the shelves never seemed fully stocked, and no one noticed. Conversations in town looped. Mrs. Gordon at the post office asked Tommy three days in a row if he was enjoying sixth grade. Tommy hadn’t been in sixth grade for almost a year.

The Hollow felt unchanged, though Tommy and Evie now knew that was a lie. The circle still shimmered at dusk. The ferns—unseasonably tall, unwilted by frost—stood in their perfect ring, as green as they had been in summer. The tree near the center had developed a dark split in its trunk, as though it had begun to open from the inside.

They no longer spoke of “what if.” The question had become “how much longer?”

Each night, they met in the woods and followed the girl’s words like breadcrumbs through a dream. The first door, she’d said. The real one. It was somewhere inside the loop they were trapped in. Not just the circle but something older—deeper. They combed through every drawing, every notebook entry, every photograph. They marked places on a map: the old train tunnel outside town; the hollow stump near the Fern Circle where they once thought a raccoon had lived; the intersection on Winder Street where lights blinked blue instead of yellow whenever it snowed.

On December 17th, they found something.

It wasn’t a door exactly. It was a scar.

They had returned to the creek, mostly out of frustration, hoping the ice might yield a clue. Instead, Tommy stepped onto a patch of earth near the ferns that crunched strangely beneath his foot. He knelt down and began to dig with his hands, the frozen dirt scraping his skin raw. After only a few minutes, his fingers struck something wooden. He cleared the soil. It was a piece of floorboard—rotted, sun-bleached. Evie helped clear the rest. Beneath the ferns, hidden by time and roots and soil, lay the foundation of a house.

A very old one.

And in the center of what would have once been a hallway, covered in frost and moss, was a door.

It was freestanding, standing up against nothing. No frame. No hinges. Just a single wooden door upright in the cold dirt, like it had been planted there.

There was no knob. No keyhole. Just a faded word etched at shoulder height in a language neither of them recognized.

Evie reached out but didn’t touch it. “Is this it?”

Tommy stared at the ground. “If it’s not, we’ve got nothing left.”

For the next two days, they returned to the door with every piece of information they could find—pages from the notebooks, scraps from their letters, even drawings they had made years ago as children. They laid everything out around the door in a circle, mimicking the shape of the ferns. Then they sat, side by side, waiting.

Nothing happened.

On the night of December 20th, Evie nearly gave up. She stood abruptly, pacing back and forth through the brittle grass, her voice shaking. “We’re not going to find it, are we? This isn’t a door. It’s a joke. A story someone else started and we’re too stupid to stop reading.”

Tommy didn’t reply. He sat cross-legged, his fingers turning purple from the cold, his eyes fixed on the carving in the wood. He was thinking—not about escape, but about memory. The notebooks. The circle. The loop.

“We’ve been trying to open it like a door,” he said finally. “But what if it’s not meant to be opened?”

Evie turned sharply. “Then what’s it for?”

“To remember,” he said. “It’s not a door out. It’s a lock. And the key isn’t a notebook. It’s us. Our memory.”

He stood and faced her. “We’re the last echo left. The others forgot. Or they vanished. We still remember. That’s what the girl meant. The door only opens together. And only if we remember.”

Evie stepped beside him, her breathing unsteady. “So what do we do?”

Tommy reached into his backpack and took out one final envelope. Inside was a letter addressed to them both, written in his handwriting but dictated by both of them over the past few days. It held everything—each version of their rules, the story of the Hollow, the photo, the name Clara W., the names they’d almost forgotten, the jokes, the secrets, the pact. He held it to his chest for a moment, then tucked it into the crack at the top of the door, between two planks.

The wind died.

The woods went completely still.

Then the carving began to glow—a soft, pale gold like candlelight. Not bright. Not burning. Just enough.

The door creaked once.

Then it opened.

Behind it was not another place. Not another world. But themselves.

Two children, younger—maybe eight years old—sitting in the Fern Circle with juice boxes and peanut butter crackers, arguing over whether a rock was a dinosaur egg or a potato. They were real, yet distant, like a scene through glass. The boy leaned forward, whispering something. The girl laughed. They looked up—and saw them.

Not scared. Not surprised.

Just aware.

The Evie in the memory raised a hand and waved. Not at them, exactly, but at the future.

Then the scene blinked out.

The door stood empty.

Tommy and Evie looked at each other.

“It’s not an exit,” she whispered. “It’s a return.”

“We're not supposed to escape the circle,” he said. “We’re supposed to complete it.”

Evie nodded slowly. “Then we go forward.”

Together, they stepped through.

When they woke, it was the first day of spring.

The snow was gone. The ferns were small again, peeking shyly through the soft earth. The tree stood strong, whole. No split. No carvings.

Their backpacks were gone. The notebooks too. But they remembered. Everything.

And that was enough.

They sat on their old log by the creek and didn’t say much. After a while, Evie leaned over, bumped her shoulder against his, and smiled.

“Do you think the door’s still there?”

Tommy glanced toward the Fern Circle. “Maybe. But I don’t think it matters.”

“Why not?”

He reached down, picked up a smooth stone, and handed it to her. “Because now we remember.”

Evie took it and closed her hand around it.

That afternoon, they drew a new map of the Hollow. Just the two of them. They didn’t mark the Fern Circle. Or the tree. Or the door.

They only drew one thing: a small, quiet creek, and beside it, two stick figures sitting side by side.

When they were done, they folded it into a tin box and buried it under a new rock.

Just in case someone else came looking.

Though the door had closed behind them and spring arrived with the grace of a long-awaited breath, Tommy and Evie both understood that the Hollow had not truly released them. Not entirely. The circle had completed, yes, but the echo of what they had seen—of what had waited behind that strange freestanding door—remained inside them. The rules they had written still whispered at the edges of their minds, like lines from a half-forgotten song. Even as the ferns receded and the creek returned to its easy babble, even as the sky softened and the snowmelt gave way to clover and mud, they couldn’t shake the feeling that time had folded around them.

At school, things appeared normal. Teachers resumed lessons without error. Lunches came with the correct cartons of milk. Even Mira Halstead, once so central to Evie’s detachment, seemed like a memory too far away to hold onto. She still sat in the same chair, still whispered to her friends during class, but when Evie passed her in the hallway, there was no flicker of recognition. Not anger. Not affection. Just absence, like Evie had been written out of Mira’s story mid-sentence.

Tommy noticed similar gaps elsewhere. The librarian at school no longer remembered helping him find the science books on quasars. His father, once lost in television, now asked him questions over breakfast, but always hesitated before using his name, as if plucking it from a jar of options. Even the dog across the street—Lenny, the grumpy spaniel who barked at everything—no longer barked at all.

Only he and Evie remained completely intact. As if their memories had been laminated by the circle itself.

They began meeting again by the creek, not out of fear, but from ritual. It became part of the new rhythm of life: meet after school, sit on the log, talk about nothing. They brought snacks again, like they used to, and even remade some of the old games, laughing when they forgot the original rules and invented new ones in their place.

“I think we might be the last ones,” Evie said one afternoon in April. “The last ones who remember the circle.”

Tommy nodded, tossing a pebble into the water. “Or maybe the first who made it back out with memory still intact.”

She stretched out her legs and leaned back on her elbows, staring up through the trees. “Do you think we were supposed to? Like, that’s what the circle wanted all along?”

He thought about it. Thought about Clara W., about the old notebook with decades of scribbled warnings and rule lists. About the freestanding door in the ground and the girl who greeted them like an old friend.

“I don’t know,” he said finally. “Maybe it wasn’t about what the circle wanted. Maybe it was about what we did when we found it.”

Evie nodded. “So what do we do now?”

He looked at her. “We keep remembering.”

“And if we start to forget?”

He smiled, just a little. “We’ve already made maps.”

The tin box remained buried. They didn’t check it. Didn’t open it again. That was part of the rule they never wrote down but both knew: once a map is drawn for the lost, you don’t use it for yourself. It wasn’t for them anymore. It was for the next kids who would feel the pull of the Hollow, who would dream of doors and wake up with soil on their fingers.

The weeks passed, and summer began to announce its return. The sun stayed out longer each evening, and the dragonflies returned to dance above the water. They spotted the first of the tadpoles in the shallows, and Evie squealed with delight like she was seven again. It was easy, in those days, to pretend that everything had returned to normal. But it hadn’t, not really.

They still felt the weight of it sometimes.

At night. In dreams. In the mirror.

Once, Tommy woke to find that one of the old drawings—the one of the Fern Circle they’d kept hidden in his closet—had changed. A second version of him now stood just outside the ring, half-faded, watching.

He burned the drawing the next day.

Evie, for her part, stopped drawing entirely for a while. She said the images kept finishing themselves without her. That her hand would move one way, and the pencil would go another.

And though they didn’t say it out loud, they both understood one truth, clear and cold and enduring as the creek in winter: the Hollow never truly let anyone go. It could be quieted. Forgotten. Even buried. But it always remembered. It was, in a strange way, alive—not as a creature, but as a wound.

A wound that reopened when memory was strong enough.

Or weak enough.

On the last day of school, Tommy found a folded note in his locker. It wasn’t addressed. It wasn’t signed. But the handwriting was his.

“You were supposed to forget. You didn’t. Now someone else will remember instead.”

He showed it to Evie that afternoon, and she stared at it for a long time without blinking.

“I didn’t write this,” he said.

“Maybe not now,” she murmured. “But maybe you will.”

They both knew what had to happen.

That night, they returned to the Hollow.

They walked with flashlights but didn’t use them. The moon was high, casting a clean, silver light across the woods. The trees were green and breathing, and the ferns stood still, waiting. The Fern Circle had regrown in the exact dimensions it had held before. The creek whispered nearby. Nothing shimmered this time. No glow. No distortion. Just the silence of a place that had been waiting, not for them, but for someone new.

Evie crouched near the edge of the circle and traced her fingers through the soil.

“We can’t stop it,” she said.

Tommy stood beside her. “But we can leave a warning.”

She looked up. “They won’t listen. No one ever does.”

“Then maybe we leave something they won’t forget.”

The next week, they returned with a plank of wood and a hammer. They carved a single word into it with a pocketknife.

REMEMBER.

Then they drove it into the earth near the trailhead—the path that led to the Fern Circle but wasn’t marked on any map.

They didn’t tell anyone what it meant. They didn’t add a story or a signature. Just a word, planted like a seed, waiting for the next pair of kids with more imagination than fear.

Because some echoes weren’t meant to be erased.

They were meant to be followed.

Chapter Six: Threads That Stay

Summer returned to Willowbend with its usual charm—a warm, syrupy slowness that made even time seem to pause and yawn. Lawnmowers hummed in the mornings, and the scent of cut grass mixed with charcoal and sunscreen. Children drew chalk galaxies on sidewalks. The corner store brought out its freezer display of popsicles. From the outside, nothing about the town looked unusual. And yet, beneath the golden rhythm of July afternoons, a quiet tension lingered like a splinter under the skin.

Tommy and Evie no longer visited the Fern Circle. They walked past the Hollow sometimes, but they didn’t go in. The trail still existed—part dirt, part memory—but they avoided it out of an agreement that didn’t need words. They had done their part. The notebooks had been buried. The letters written. The sign planted. There was nothing left for them to do but live.

They tried. Truly, they did.

They went to the lake with Evie’s brother and played card games in the shade. They watched horror movies in Tommy’s basement and yelled at each other during board games. They let their hair grow longer, scraped their knees during bike rides, and stayed up too late on porches drinking fizzy lemonade from glass bottles. It almost felt normal. Almost.

But there were moments—short, sharp, quiet moments—when one of them would drift. A blank stare. A flicker in the eyes. A sudden silence when nothing had happened to cause it.

Evie once stopped in the middle of a sentence, looked around the room, and asked, “Wasn’t there a picture on that wall yesterday?”

Tommy didn’t remember a picture. Neither did Evie after a few hours.

A week later, Tommy dreamt of standing in the Fern Circle again, but this time Evie was across from him, and between them stood the door. In the dream, she reached for the handle, turned it slowly, and said, “It’s not locked anymore. That’s the problem.”

He woke with a start, sweating through the sheets, the echo of her words bouncing in his chest.

The Hollow had gone quiet, yes. But it had not gone still.

By August, a new family had moved into the house on the far end of Cedar Loop. A boy named Will and his younger sister, Sophie. They were polite and a little shy, always riding their bikes in small circles on the cul-de-sac and whispering when adults came near. Tommy saw them one afternoon tracing their fingers across the faded letters of the REMEMBER sign near the Hollow’s trailhead.

He said nothing.

Evie saw them too. She said nothing either.

Later that day, she asked, “If they find it… should we stop them?”

Tommy hesitated. “We didn’t want to be stopped.”

“Yeah, but we were lucky.”

“Or stubborn.”

She shook her head. “I don’t think it was luck or stubbornness. I think it was both of us. If we hadn’t remembered each other, really remembered, it would’ve all come undone.”

Tommy nodded slowly. “Then maybe that’s the only way out. Not writing rules. Not notebooks. Just... not forgetting each other.”

They made a new rule that afternoon, the first one in months.

Rule Fourteen: If someone new enters the circle, we help them remember each other. No matter what.

They didn’t write it down.

They didn’t need to.

One day, just before school started again, Sophie approached Evie while she was sitting alone under the big oak at the park. She had a notebook in her hand. It was small and blue, covered in stickers.

"Did you guys used to play near the woods?" she asked innocently.

Evie looked up from her sketchbook. "Sometimes."

"My brother says there's a ring of plants back there. Like... a perfect ring. He says he dreamed about it before we even moved here."

Evie nodded slowly. "Maybe he did."

Sophie tilted her head. “Do you think it's special?”

"I think it's old," Evie said. "And powerful. And it listens."

Sophie smiled. "We made rules. For our game. Want to hear one?"

Evie’s heart thudded once, hard.

"Sure," she said softly.

Sophie opened her notebook and read: "Rule One: We go into the woods together. Never alone."

Evie blinked and smiled, though it came out sad.

"That’s a good one,” she said. “Hold onto it.”

She reached into her backpack and pulled out a folded piece of paper—a blank page torn from her old journal. On it, she wrote only one sentence:

"If the trees remember your name, tell them hers too."

She handed it to Sophie.

"For when you need it," she said.

Sophie beamed and ran off, her notebook clutched to her chest.

Evie watched her go, then leaned back against the tree, arms crossed, head tilted toward the sky. The clouds drifted above like boats full of silent passengers. Somewhere, birds chirped. Somewhere deeper, the wind stirred leaves that hadn't moved in years.

That evening, Evie met Tommy at the creek. The sun was beginning to fall, staining the water orange and gold. The ferns swayed gently in a breeze that hadn’t touched any other part of the forest.

“Do you think they’ll go through?” Tommy asked, skipping a stone.

Evie sat down beside him. “Eventually.”

He nodded. “Think we’ll be able to help them?”

Evie didn’t answer right away. She watched the light glint off the water, watched the shapes made by ripples as they spread toward the muddy bank.

“If they go together,” she said, “they’ll be okay.”

Tommy glanced at her. “And if they don’t?”

She looked down. “Then we leave the door open. Just a crack. So they can find their way.”

They sat in silence, the kind that no longer frightened them. A soft silence. The silence of endings that weren’t really endings, just pauses between pages.

Tommy lay back in the grass, hands behind his head, eyes watching the stars come out one by one.

“Remember when we thought the creek had dinosaurs?” he asked.

Evie laughed. “I still think it does.”

Tommy smiled. “You would.”

She nudged him with her knee. “Gravity-skin, remember?”

He chuckled. “Always.”

The night came slowly, wrapping them in its long, blue hush. Above them, constellations shifted into stories. Below them, the Hollow watched—not as a monster, not as a maze, but as something waiting to be understood.

The creek flowed. The trees stood. The circle slept.

And Tommy and Evie—older now, but still themselves—watched the world move forward, hand in hand, hearts still tethered by the only thing the Hollow couldn’t steal.

Memory.

The following weekend brought rain—a soft, steady downpour that soaked the town without fury. It wasn’t the kind of storm that split trees or turned streets into rivers. It was the slow, quiet kind that made the air smell like earth and washed the sky of whatever had lingered there too long. For Tommy and Evie, it was the first time they’d truly felt like the Hollow was resting.

The two of them sat on the porch of Evie’s house, wrapped in blankets, mugs of cocoa steaming in their hands. They didn’t say much. The rain filled the silence between them, and that was enough. Sometimes, memory didn’t need language—it only needed space to breathe.

“I’ve been thinking,” Tommy said, after a while, his voice low.

Evie raised an eyebrow. “Dangerous.”

He smiled faintly. “Do you ever wonder if we were supposed to find it? The Hollow, I mean. Maybe it wasn’t an accident.”

She leaned back in her chair, pulling the blanket tighter around her shoulders. “I used to think it was just luck. Like we wandered a little too far into a backyard that wasn’t ours. But now... I don’t know. I think maybe the Hollow finds you.”

Tommy nodded slowly. “Like it waits. And when it sees something—someone—who might be able to carry it without forgetting, it leans in.”

“And whispers.”

They were quiet for a moment.

“I don’t think it’s evil,” Evie said finally. “Just... old. And tired. And full of all the things people were too scared to remember.”

Tommy sipped his cocoa. “Do you think it wants to be remembered?”

Evie didn’t answer immediately. She stared out into the rain, watched it trickle down the sidewalk and collect in puddles that shimmered like melted mirrors. “I think it wants to be seen. Really seen. And maybe, just maybe, forgiven.”

Tommy turned that over in his mind. Forgiven. He had never thought about the Hollow as something that needed anything, much less something so human. But maybe that was the truth hiding beneath it all. The circle wasn’t just a trap. It was a history. A place that held all the things people left behind when they couldn’t carry them anymore—regret, grief, memory, hope. And every so often, it reached out to see if someone would remember.

“Maybe we’re not the last ones it’ll find,” he said.

Evie nodded. “But maybe we’re the first ones to survive it.”

The rain continued to fall, washing the sidewalks clean.

Over the next few weeks, they found themselves slowly rejoining the world.

School began again. Teachers stopped misnaming students. The clocks all ticked in sync. No more missing weeks. No more rewritten notes. The spiral began to uncurl.

Tommy rejoined the astronomy club, where he spent lunch hours teaching seventh graders how to find Andromeda with a compass and a patch of clear sky. Evie started painting again—nothing dark or foreboding, just small things: birds on telephone wires, creeks lit by sunset, kids on bicycles riding uphill. For the first time in what felt like years, her hands moved without resistance.

Sometimes they talked about the past year. Other times, they didn’t.

Once, when walking home, Evie stopped in front of the REMEMBER sign. It had started to crack. The wood was splitting near the bottom, and the letters had faded into the grain.

“We should replace it,” she said, but made no move to do so.

Tommy crouched down and ran his fingers over the peeling surface. “No. Let it be what it is. If someone needs it, they’ll see it. If they don’t, they won’t.”

“Doesn’t that scare you?”

He stood and shrugged. “It used to. But now I think... maybe some stories need to find the right ears. For the rest, the forgetting is a kind of mercy.”

Evie glanced sideways at him. “That sounded poetic.”

He grinned. “Don’t tell anyone.”

Autumn came quietly.

Leaves turned gold and drifted like feathers. The Fern Circle didn’t reappear, not in full. The ferns grew wild around the banks of the creek, but none formed a ring. Still, Tommy and Evie continued to visit—less often, and with less urgency—but the bond remained.

One Sunday afternoon, they sat on the old log again, shoes off, their toes dipped in the slow-moving water. A crisp breeze ruffled the trees, and somewhere nearby, a bird trilled a tune that neither of them could name.

“I think it’s over,” Evie said softly.

Tommy didn’t look at her. “The Hollow?”

“The forgetting. The loop. The way it pulled things apart.”

He nodded. “I think we unstitched it. Or maybe we stitched ourselves out of it.”

Evie smiled, a real one, deep and warm. “Same thing, maybe.”

They sat for a while like that—listening to the world without trying to explain it, watching the trees without measuring their shadows.

Eventually, Evie stood. “I’ve got a new rule,” she said, brushing dirt off her jeans.

Tommy looked up. “Oh?”

“Rule Fifteen: If we ever write this all down, we lie about the ending. Say we burned the notebook. Say the circle vanished.”

He blinked, then laughed. “Why lie?”

“Because stories live longer when you don’t give them a clean exit. Someone’ll come looking. And if they’re brave, they’ll find what they need. If they’re not, they’ll be glad it sounds fake.”

Tommy stood and offered a mock salute. “Rule Fifteen accepted.”

And with that, they turned away from the creek—not forever, just for now—and walked home, two figures lit by the slanted amber light of a world that had remembered how to heal.

The year continued its quiet unraveling, shedding the last of summer’s skin as September drifted into October. The wind carried hints of winter, soft and patient, and the light took on that golden tilt it always did in fall—longer shadows, sharper contrasts. Willowbend returned to its usual rhythms. The town’s annual Harvest Festival was held without incident, the scarecrows were dressed, the hayrides rolled out, and nobody mentioned the Fern Circle. Nobody mentioned what had been buried in the woods. Nobody remembered.

Except Tommy and Evie.

Their lives had grown outward again, like vines once restrained. Evie joined a local art group that met on Saturday mornings at the community center, where she painted in silence next to retirees and watercolor enthusiasts. She no longer drew trees with eyes or rivers that led to nowhere. Her work now was grounded, full of light and attention—still, however, layered with something unspoken. A mood, perhaps. Or a code.

Tommy, for his part, began volunteering at the library. He reorganized shelves, labeled dusty science books, and took secret pride in hiding little Post-it notes inside the spines of certain novels with cryptic lines like “Rule #4 is still in effect” or “The creek always remembers.” He had no idea who would find them. That was part of the charm. Sometimes, it wasn’t about knowing—it was about leaving traces.

One Tuesday afternoon in late October, the two of them sat behind the gym, half-watching a group of younger kids play tag on the field. Evie balanced a pencil behind her ear, tapping the edge of her sketchbook.

“I think the town’s finally forgotten everything,” she said without looking up.

Tommy sat cross-legged on the concrete, pulling grass through his fingers. “Yeah.”

“No more rewinding weeks. No vanishing teachers. No... girls with no eyes.”

“Not lately.”

Evie glanced sideways at him. “But we didn’t forget.”

“No.”

“So what are we now? Witnesses?”

“Survivors,” Tommy said. “Caretakers. Curators.”

Evie made a face. “Curators sounds like we’re running a museum.”

“We kind of are,” he said with a shrug. “Only the museum’s in our heads.”

“And the exhibits are made of nightmares.”

Tommy chuckled. “And peanut butter crackers.”

Evie closed her sketchbook and leaned back, staring at the sky. “You ever think about what we lost?”

Tommy paused. “I think about what we almost lost.”

“Yeah,” she whispered. “That, too.”

There were scars, of course. Not all visible. Sometimes Evie would lose a minute or two while painting, and when she came back, she’d find strange marks on the paper—shapes she didn’t remember drawing. Sometimes Tommy would wake with his hand clenched around a pen, notebook open beside him, pages covered in words written in a sleep-script that wasn’t quite his own. The circle had let them go, but not without reminders.

And then there were the dreams.

They were different now. Not nightmares. More like echoes. Tommy would sometimes dream of standing at the edge of the Fern Circle, watching children—other children—play in the clearing. They laughed. They built forts. One of them had Evie’s eyes. Another, his own crooked smile.

He would wake not in fear, but with a heavy kind of peace. A bittersweetness.

As if the Hollow had passed the torch on.

As if it was still choosing.

Halloween came and went with no strange phenomena. No shimmering trees. No time lost. Just costumes, candy, and giggling children stumbling down sidewalks in oversized shoes and vampire teeth. Tommy and Evie went trick-or-treating for the first time in years—not because they needed the candy, but because it felt like something old and good, something untouched. Evie went as a time traveler with aviator goggles and a stopwatch. Tommy wore a cardboard Saturn around his waist and a helmet made from a mixing bowl.

“It’s nice,” Evie said halfway through their route, “to dress up and not feel like I’m wearing someone else’s skin.”

Tommy smirked. “Even with Saturn crushing your ribs?”

“Especially with Saturn.”

They laughed and ran toward the next house, their feet crunching leaves in the dark. Later, they sat on Evie’s front steps, dividing their loot, the porch light casting long shadows. The sky was perfectly clear.

“Hey,” Evie said suddenly, reaching into her bag.

She pulled out a small item wrapped in wax paper. It was a peanut butter cracker. Not store-bought. Homemade. The kind they used to bring to the creek.

She held it out to Tommy, her expression unreadable.

“Where’d you get that?” he asked.

“It was in my bag,” she said. “Just now.”

They stared at each other. The wind picked up, just enough to send a few leaves spiraling across the lawn.

“I guess,” Tommy said after a long pause, “the circle hasn’t completely forgotten us either.”

Evie unwrapped the cracker, broke it in half, and handed him a piece. “Good,” she said. “I’d hate to think all that meant nothing.”

They ate in silence, surrounded by laughter and porch lights, their feet swinging off the edge of the steps like they had when they were children.

Because in some ways, they still were.

A few weeks later, a letter arrived.

No return address.

Tommy found it slipped into his locker at school, wedged between his binder and a stack of graded papers. The envelope was handmade, sealed with black thread, and inside was a single sentence:

“There’s another door.”

That was all.

No name. No date. Just the same handwriting that had once appeared in The Notebook—uneven, urgent.

He showed it to Evie that afternoon.

Her only reaction was a deep breath.

“Do we chase it?” he asked.

She folded the letter back into the envelope, then tucked it into her bag.

“No,” she said. “Not yet.”

Tommy didn’t push her.

The Hollow might have many doors. But they had learned something more important than how to open them.

They had learned when to wait.

And when to walk away.

Chapter Seven: The Shape of Echoes

Winter returned not with a bang, but with a breath. One morning the town simply woke to a layer of frost on windshields and a silence that felt a little heavier than it had the day before. Snow didn’t fall for another few weeks, but the sky dimmed early and stayed darker longer, and the smell of fireplaces curled into every neighborhood like a familiar ghost. People started to retreat into their homes again, talking in whispers about early nights and dreams they couldn’t quite remember. And through it all, the Hollow slept—or at least pretended to.

Tommy and Evie had grown used to the quiet now. Not the ordinary kind that came from an empty house or a library on a rainy day, but the kind that lingered after something enormous had happened. The kind that followed a storm that only you remembered. They had returned to their routines, their families, their carefully rebuilt lives, and they had done it well. But even normalcy, when built atop a forgotten fracture, has its limits.

They still met once a week, usually near the creek, though sometimes they'd just walk in long, slow loops around the outskirts of town. It wasn’t about watching for signs anymore, not exactly. It was about keeping a pulse. About listening for that subtle wrongness that no one else seemed to hear anymore.

It was on one of those walks, just days before the solstice, that Evie told him about the second dream.

“I was in the clearing,” she said, her voice low, gloved hands buried in the pockets of her coat. “But it wasn’t the same. The trees weren’t trees anymore. They were mirrors. Tall, silver, curved like glass bending in wind.”

Tommy walked beside her, eyes fixed on the sidewalk. “And?”

“And there were people. Sort of. Figures. They looked like me. Or like they used to be me. But they had no mouths.”

He didn’t interrupt.

“They just stood there. Watching. And then one of them reached out and touched the center of the circle, and a doorway opened again. But it didn’t open out. It opened down. Like a trapdoor.”

They reached the corner where Cedar Loop curved around the back of the park, and stopped. The wind rattled a loose chain on a swing set nearby.

Tommy turned to her. “Do you think it means something’s still open?”

Evie didn’t answer for a moment. Her breath came in visible clouds, fading fast in the winter air.

“I think the Hollow gave us back our memories,” she said. “But not because it was finished. I think it wanted us to carry them.”

They stood there together, the sun hanging low behind them, casting shadows longer than they were.

The day before the solstice, Tommy opened the letter again—the one with the sentence they hadn’t yet acted on. There’s another door. He held it up to the light and noticed, for the first time, faint indentations beneath the ink, as if someone had written something else first and erased it.

He shaded the surface with a pencil, gently.

Another sentence emerged.

“When one forgets, the other must follow.”

He sat back, cold spreading through his chest.

He didn’t tell Evie right away.

Instead, he returned to the creek that afternoon, alone for the first time in months. The water had slowed, crusted over in places, but not frozen completely. It flowed beneath the surface like a secret, just out of reach. He sat on the log they’d once called “the command post,” back when the woods were full of pretend battles and treasure maps. He listened to the water. And then he opened his notebook.

Not The Notebook. That one was long gone now, buried or lost or sleeping under another name.

This was his newest one—plain cover, no labels, nothing magical or mysterious. Just a place to write.

He flipped to a blank page and wrote a single sentence:

“If I forget, remind me who I was when I still knew your name.”

Then he closed the book and sat in silence, watching the shadows grow long and blue.

That night, Evie knocked on his window.

She hadn’t done that in over a year.

Tommy opened it without a word, and she climbed through, shivering slightly.

“I had another dream,” she said, breathless. “But this time I wasn’t alone.”

He moved aside, gesturing for her to sit on the edge of the bed. She did.

“I was in the Fern Circle again,” she said. “Only it wasn’t ours. It was... a version of it. A future maybe. And there was a boy there. He looked like you. But older. And he said my name like he was trying to remember how it sounded.”

Tommy sat beside her. “And then?”

Evie swallowed. “He asked if I still had the map.”

She reached into her coat and pulled out something wrapped in tissue paper.

Tommy recognized it instantly.

The old map. The one they had buried last spring.

“But we left this in the Hollow,” he said.

“I know.”

The paper was soft now, almost translucent with age, though neither of them could explain how. The lines were faded, but still there. The creek. The Fern Circle. The trail. One new addition, marked in dark blue ink:

A door beneath.

Tommy stared at it. “I think this is what the letter meant.”

Evie nodded.

They sat in silence for a long while, the map between them.

Finally, she whispered, “Do we go back?”

He looked at her.

“You’re asking like there’s a choice.”

She laughed, not bitterly, but with a kind of old knowing.

“I guess I am.”

They folded the map. Packed a bag. Left a note on the kitchen counter—simple, vague.

And just before midnight on the longest night of the year, they stepped back into the woods.

The Hollow had changed.

It no longer shimmered. It hummed. A deep, resonant vibration that echoed in their chests more than their ears. The ferns were flat now, pressed to the ground like hands reaching from underneath. The clearing glowed faintly, not with light, but with memory—shapes they recognized, moments replaying at the edges of their vision like transparent ghosts.

Their younger selves.

Sitting. Running. Arguing.

Laughing.

“I think this is what happens to the echoes,” Tommy whispered.

“They replay until someone watches,” Evie replied.

They reached the center of the Fern Circle. The ground beneath their feet was soft, spongy. A perfect ring of dead leaves had formed a new pattern—spiral, not circle. And at its center: wood. Not the freestanding door this time.

A hatch.

No lock. No handle. Just a small indent, like the press of a thumb.

Tommy reached down. Evie placed her hand over his.

Together, they pushed.

The hatch creaked open.
