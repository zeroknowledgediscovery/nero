In the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of their       residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little       sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,       deteriora _sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts       to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a       delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The       Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy.       The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an       indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are _all       _curtains—a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The       Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are       preposterous.        How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of       blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable       thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display       of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the       heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily       understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been       brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.        To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade of       costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an       impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or       of taste as regards the proprietor:—this for the reason, first, that       wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting       a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood,       confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather       avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry       may at any time be successfully attempted.        The people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough       diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being       the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,       to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,       looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two       entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of       an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole       test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test, once       established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable       to the one primitive folly.        There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist       than the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to       say, in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual       defect is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would       of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are       amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of       art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits       of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.        A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several       pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation       to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic       arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly       continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines       occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,       the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.        Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other       decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an       extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,       irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum, as well as the       proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.        Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still       very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the       apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the       forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary       man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard       discoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows       who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their       own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have       a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of       small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As regards       texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preterpluperfect       tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies. Touching       pattern—a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a Riccaree       Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct       grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of no meaning, _are       here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or representations of       well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of       Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or       ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly       Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen       in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge, sprawling, and       radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among       which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention       of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and       worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who, to spare thought and economize       fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then established       joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.        _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household       decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion       of taste just specified. We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.       The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady       light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or       what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do       wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely       thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp       proper—the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground-glass       shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is       a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted       it, partly on account of its _flashiness_, but principally on account       of its _greater rest_, is a good commentary on the proposition with       which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of       a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly       subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of       these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is       sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its       influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half       disenchanted beneath its evil eye.        In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its       leading feature is _glitter—_and in that one word how much of       all that is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes       _pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the       embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth,       even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning       glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle       in our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of       all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.        The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before       observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has       led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our       dwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a fine       thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one       who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and       especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror       presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,—a thing       always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent       in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here       aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its       sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four       or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,       a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter       upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing       effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,       would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be       altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the       same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be       startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.        It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man       of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The       corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.       As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among _our       _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the       spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have seen apartments in       the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”]       means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-molu’d       _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even _now_, there is       present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose       decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the       weather is cool—the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of       the room during his slumber.        It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a       shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of       furniture. It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is       at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the       other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep       recesses—and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a       crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual.       They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to       the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the       recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a       deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material       of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole       fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),       issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles       the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown       open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping       it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such       devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the       tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and       determine the _character _of the room. The carpet—of Saxony       material—is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson       ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that       festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground,       _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short       irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls       are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small       Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many       paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an       imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the       lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or       four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully.       The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant       effects.” _Repose _speaks in all. Not one is of small size.       Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the       blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad       but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed.       They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,       and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to       better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of       the chamber is injured. But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is       visible. In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a       reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary       sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson       silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light       conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,       also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed       altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the       sofas. This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has       been thought sufficient. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which       bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded       angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with       highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some       light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk       cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound       books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand       lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from       He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a       tranquil but magical radiance over all.      A TALE OF JERUSALEM        Intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos      Passus erat——                     —Lucan—_De Catone_      ——a bristly _bore_.                     _Translation._         “Let us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon       the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year of the       world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one—“let us hasten to the       ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of David,       and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of       the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the       promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the       sacrifices.”         Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or       sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.        “Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity in the       heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of       the worshippers of Baal.”         “That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the       Pentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people of       Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their       own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us       lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver       shekels per head!”         “Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the       Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,       has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,       to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”         “Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who belonged       to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of       _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a       thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less       gifted perambulators)—“by the five corners of that beard which, as a       priest, I am forbidden to shave!—have we lived to see the day when a       blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of       appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated       elements? Have we lived to see the day when—”        “Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted       Abel-Phittim, “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or       by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings       should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not       extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.”         That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which       bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly       fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty       hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the       solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its       inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square       towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and       twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the       wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,       between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a       perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the       precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived       on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the       turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the       besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an       eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by       several, that of the temple of Belus.        “Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,       “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the       wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”         “And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,       not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who       seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”         “Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman       soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions       of Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has       broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your       gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought       fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a       true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the       ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the       world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every       kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and       see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”         “El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the       centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against       the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth       the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of       the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is       it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or       Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or       Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or       Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”         “Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too       rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on       the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the       holy things of the sanctuary.”         By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden       basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the       giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but       owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of       their operations could be obtained.        Half an hour had already elapsed.        “We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this       period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be       turned out of office by the Katholim.”         “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the       fat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our       loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”         “Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase       money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?”         “They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they       have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,       Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either       still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to       place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while       their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.         *       *       *       *       *        “Booshoh he!”—as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the       extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was       the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.        “Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of       Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”         “It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the       bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes are       more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is like the       honey of Hebron.”         “It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee, “the       heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our       voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the       psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut!”         It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim       that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a _hog_ of no common size.        “Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,       letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the       Philistines, “El Emanu!—God be with us—it is _the unutterable       flesh!”_     THE SPHINX         During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the       invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement       of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around       us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in       the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we       should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful       intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a       day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some       acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily       the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every       messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.       That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could       neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less       excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted       himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at       any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was       sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.        His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which       I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which       I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into       germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my       bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he       was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been       made upon my fancy.        A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief       which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to       defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he       maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I       contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute       spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of       suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and       was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the       idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.        The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred       to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so       much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for       regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded       and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind       to communicate the circumstances to my friend.        Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an       open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view       of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded       by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My       thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom       and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,       they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon       some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its       way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense       forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own       sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes       passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor       in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and       calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I       fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than       even I did myself.        Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the       large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which       had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far       larger than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line,       because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one       of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the       general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of       a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as       the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an       immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been       supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this       hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those       of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward,       parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff,       thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in       shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the       rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the       apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each       wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above       the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale       apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper       and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief       peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s       Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was       as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body,       as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded       the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast,       with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming       evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I       perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand       themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so       expressive of woe, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the       monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to       the floor.        Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of       what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of       repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.        At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we       were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I       occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near       at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an       account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end—at first laughed       heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if       my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again had a       distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute       terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly—but       maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the       course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the       hill.        I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an       omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I       threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my       face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer       apparent.        My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor,       and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the       visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed       deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk,       with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative       philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.       I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the       idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in       the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the       importance of an object, through mere misadmeasurement of its       propinquity. “To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence       to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of       Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly       be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can       you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought       this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”         He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one       of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to       exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine       print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the       book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.        “But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster,       I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.       In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus       Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class       of Insecta—or insects. The account runs thus:        “‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic       appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of       the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and       downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair;       antennæ in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed. The       Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar,       at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia       of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”         He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself       accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding       “the monster.”         “Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face       of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.       Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for       the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider       has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of       an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch       distant from the pupil of my eye.”     HOP-FROG         I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed       to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to       tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his       seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They       all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well       as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there       is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been       quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara       avis in terris.        About the refinements, or, as he called them, the “ghost” of wit, the king       troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in       a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.       Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’ “Gargantua”       to the “Zadig” of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited       his taste far better than verbal ones.        At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone       out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental “powers” still       retain their “fools,” who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were       expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,       in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.        _Our_ king, as a matter of course, retained his “fool.” The fact is, he       _required_ something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the       heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to       mention himself.        His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value       was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf       and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools;       and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days       (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to       laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your       jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and       unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our       king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a       triplicate treasure in one person.        I believe the name “Hop-Frog” was _not_ that given to the dwarf by his       sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of       the seven ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men       do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional       gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that       afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king,       for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional       swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a       capital figure.        But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only       with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious       muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way       of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform       many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,       or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more       resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.        I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog       originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no       person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.       Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself       (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been       forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,       and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.        Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close       intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became       sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was       by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many       services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although       a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much       influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit       of Hop-Frog.        On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined       to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,       occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta       were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive       in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and       arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it       seems, without his assistance.        The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been       fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could       possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of       expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed       that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up       their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month,       in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except       in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never       could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found       it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all       events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and       Hop-Frog.        When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him       sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the       monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that Hop-Frog was not       fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and       madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his practical jokes,       and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it)       “to be merry.”        “Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the       room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here       Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. We       want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of       the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the       wine will brighten your wits.”         Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances       from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor       dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his “absent friends” forced       the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he       took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.        “Ah! ha! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly       drained the beaker. “See what a glass of good wine can do! Why,       your eyes are shining already!”         Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of       wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He       placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the       company with a half-insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at       the success of the king’s ‘joke.’        “And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.        “Yes,” said the King; “Come, Hop-Frog, lend us your       assistance. Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of       characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was       seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.        Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat vacantly.        “Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”         “I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,       abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.        “Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you       mean by _that?_ Ah, I perceive. You are sulky, and want more wine.       Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and       offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.        “Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the       fiends—”         The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers       smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and,       falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.        The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her       audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most       becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a       syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the       brimming goblet in her face.        The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,       resumed her position at the foot of the table.        There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling       of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was interrupted by a       low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once       from every corner of the room.        “What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the       king, turning furiously to the dwarf.        The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his       intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,       merely ejaculated:        “I—I? How could it have been me?”         “The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers.       “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his       cage-wires.”         “True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but,       on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of       this vagabond’s teeth.”         Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object       to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very       repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as       much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another       bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and       with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.        “I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very       tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just       after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just       after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd       noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one       of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our       masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately, however,       it requires a company of eight persons and—”         “Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the       coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers. Come!       what is the diversion?”         “We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and       it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”         “We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering       his eyelids.        “The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it       occasions among the women.”         “Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.        “I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that       to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of       masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will       be as much terrified as astonished.”         “Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a man       of you.”         “The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their       jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.       Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by       eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the       company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately       and gorgeously habited men and women. The _contrast_ is inimitable.”         “It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was       growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.        His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but       effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the       epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized       world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently       beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to       nature was thus thought to be secured.        The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet       shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of       the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion       was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by       ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang       was much more efficiently represented by _flax_. A thick coating of       the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long       chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king,       _and tied;_ then about another of the party, and also tied; then       about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining       arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each       other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear       natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at       right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the       present day, by those who capture chimpanzees, or other large apes, in       Borneo.        The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular       room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single       window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially       designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending       by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by       means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly)       this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.        The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s superintendence;       but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer       judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this       occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in       weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been       seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account       of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from       out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional       sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a       flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the       Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall—some fifty or       sixty altogether.        The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently until       midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before       making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however,       than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together—for the       impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to       stumble as they entered.        The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart       of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of       the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of       some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women       swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to       exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated       their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush was made for the       doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his       entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with       him.        While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to       his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure       of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung,       and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very       gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of       the floor.        Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the       hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,       of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus       situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting       them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the       intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically       and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the       hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an       instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far       upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable       consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and       face to face.        The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their       alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived       pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the       apes.        “Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself       easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I know them.       If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.”         Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the       wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,       as he went, to the centre of the room—leaped, with the agility of a       monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the       chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and       still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”         And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with       laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain       flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the       dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in       mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the       chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the       eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to       thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who       they were.        So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead       silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by just such       a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the       king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of       Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to       whence the sound issued. It came from the fang-like teeth of the       dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and       glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned       countenances of the king and his seven companions.        “Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see       who these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more       closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and       which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half a       minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the       shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,       and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.        At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester       to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made       this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.       The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:        “I now see distinctly,” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are.       They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,—a king who       does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors       who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the       jester—and this is my last jest.”         Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it       adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the       work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a       fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled       his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared       through the sky-light.        It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had       been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,       together, they effected their escape to their own country; for neither was       seen again.     THE MAN OF THE CROWD.  Ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir être seul.—_La Bruyère_.         It was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht       lesen_”—it does not permit itself to be read. There are some       secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in       their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them       piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of       throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer       themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes       up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the       grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.        Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the       large bow window of the D—— Coffee-House in London. For some       months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with       returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so       precisely the converse of _ennui_—moods of the keenest       appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs—the       αχλυξ η πριυ       επῆευ—and the intellect, electrified,       surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet       candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. Merely       to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many       of the legitimate sources of pain. I felt a calm but inquisitive interest       in every thing. With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had       been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring       over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the       room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.        This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had       been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on,       the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well       lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past       the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before been       in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me,       therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all       care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of       the scene without.        At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. I looked       at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate       relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute       interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage,       and expression of countenance.        By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied       business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way       through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly;       when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of       impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a       numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and       talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on       account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their       progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their       gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the       lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed       profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.—There       was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I       have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly       termed the decent. They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys,       tradesmen, stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of       society—men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their       own—conducting business upon their own responsibility. They did not       greatly excite my attention.        The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable       divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash houses—young       gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and       supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which       may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these       persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection       of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore the cast-off       graces of the gentry;—and this, I believe, involves the best       definition of the class.        The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady old       fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their coats       and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white       cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or       gaiters. They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right       ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. I       observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands,       and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient       pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability—if indeed       there be an affectation so honorable.        There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily       understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all       great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much       inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be       mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness of       wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.        The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily       recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the       desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,       gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate       clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still       all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a       filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two       other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded       lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of       the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. Very often, in       company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat       different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be       defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon       the public in two battalions—that of the dandies and that of the       military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and       smiles; of the second, frogged coats and frowns.        Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and       deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing       from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of       abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon       mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the       night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed       a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every       one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation,       some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a       cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the       glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided;       women of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal       beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in       Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with       filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the       wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at       youth—the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association,       an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid       ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards       innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches, reeling,       inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole       although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual       lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in materials       which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well       brushed—men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy       step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously       wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode       through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside       these, pie-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders,       monkey-exhibitors, and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who       sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all       full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the       ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.        As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for       not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its       gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly       portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief,       as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but       the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the       dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing       a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony       to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.        The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual       faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted       before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each       visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could       frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of       long years.        With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,       when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old       man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)—a countenance which       at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the       absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely       resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that       my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,       would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the       fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to       form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and       paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution,       of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood       thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense—of       supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated. “How       wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within that bosom!” Then       came a craving desire to keep the man in view—to know more of him.       Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my       way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I       had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. With some little       difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed       him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.        I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in       stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,       were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong       glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of       beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a       closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped       him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These       observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the       stranger whithersoever he should go.        It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,       soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an odd       effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new       commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the       jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I did       not much regard the rain—the lurking of an old fever in my system       rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a       handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held       his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked       close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning       his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and by he passed into a       cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so       much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his       demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than       before—more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way       repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at       every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. The street was a       narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour,       during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number       which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park—so vast a       difference is there between a London populace and that of the most       frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a square,       brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner of the       stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled       wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who       hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was       surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the       square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished       to see him repeat the same walk several times—once nearly detecting       me as he came round with a sudden movement.        In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with       far less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;       the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With a       gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively       deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an       activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put       me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought us to a large and       busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well       acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he       forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and       sellers.        During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place,       it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without       attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc       over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did he       see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke       no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. I was now       utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not       part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.        A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the       bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and       at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He hurried into       the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with       incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we       emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started—the       street of the D—— Hotel. It no longer wore, however, the same       aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and       there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale. He walked       moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh,       turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great       variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the       principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were       thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he       threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his       countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his       breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now       took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but,       upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his       actions.        As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness       and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a party of       some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped       off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane       little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in       thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which       brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from       those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome quarter of       London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable       poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light of an       accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen       tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce       the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones       lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.       Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere       teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life       revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned       of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old       man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. Once more       he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze       of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge       suburban temples of Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend,       Gin.        It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still       pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of joy       the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original       bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among       the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to       the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. It was       something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the       countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.       Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced       his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. Long and swiftly he       fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to       abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. The sun       arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most       thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D——       Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely       inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. And here, long, amid       the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the       stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not       pass from out the turmoil of that street. And, as the shades of the       second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in       front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He noticed       me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained       absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I said at length,       “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to be alone.       _He is the man of the crowd._ It will be in vain to follow; for I       shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the       world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and       perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘_er lasst       sich nicht lesen._’”         {*1} The “_Hortulus Animæ cum Oratiunculis Aliquibus Superadditis_”        of Grünninger.     NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD         A Tale With a Moral.        “_Con tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las       Torres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,       importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_—meaning,       in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure       personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We       presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be       a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there       until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely upon       the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and,       what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every       fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon       the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s object was to excite a       distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that       the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and       drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by       Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther;       by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch.       Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a       hidden meaning in “The Antediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views       in Cock Robin,” and transcendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it       has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound       design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for       example, need have no care of his moral. It is there—that is to say,       it is somewhere—and the moral and the critics can take care of       themselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended,       and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,”        or the “Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended,       and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:—so that it will all       come very straight in the end.        There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by       certain ignoramuses—that I have never written a moral tale, or, in       more precise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics       predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:—that is the       secret. By and by the “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them       ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution—by       way of mitigating the accusations against me—I offer the sad history       appended,—a history about whose obvious moral there can be no       question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals       which form the title of the tale. I should have credit for this       arrangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who       reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus       sneak it in at the fag end of their fables.        _Defuncti injuriâ ne afficiantur_ was a law of the twelve tables, and _De       mortuis nil nisi bonum_ is an excellent injunction—even if the dead       in question be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design,       therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad       dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was       not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his       mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant—for       duties to her well-regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies,       like tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the       better for beating—but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be       left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left       unflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a       baby from left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an       evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks       its quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,       and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was       getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in my       eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he       had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have       mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced beyond       that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand it no longer,       but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made       prophecy of his ruin.        The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he       used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At six       months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he was in       the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. At eight       months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance       pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until,       at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing       moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and       for backing his assertions by bets.        Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had       predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown with       his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when he came to       be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with       a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers—no. I will       do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. With       him the thing was a mere formula—nothing more. His expressions on       this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were simple if       not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to       round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever       thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty       to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was a       vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by       society—here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act       of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie.       I remonstrated—but to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I       entreated—he smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he       sneered. I threatened—he swore. I kicked him—he called for the       police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil       his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.        Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of       Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and       this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about       betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that I       ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a       dollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you       what you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly       still, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”         This latter form seemed to please him best;—perhaps because it       involved the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious.       Had any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have       been small too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure       that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in       question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a       man betting his brains like bank-notes—but this was a point which       my friend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.       In the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up to       “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of       devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always       displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries force a       man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was something       in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his       offensive expression—something in his manner of enunciation—which       at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy—something       which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to       call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant       pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical.       I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was in a perilous state. I       resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it. I vowed to serve       him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the       toad,—that is to say, “awaken him to a sense of his situation.” I       addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I betook myself to       remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at       expostulation.        When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in some       very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent, merely       looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his head to       one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he spread out       the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he winked with       the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut       them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I became       seriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, applying his thumb to his       nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of       his fingers. Finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.        I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse. He would be obliged to       me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He despised all       my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself. Did I still       think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against his character?       Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal parent aware, in       a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence? He would put this       latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself       to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother       knew that I was out. My confusion, he said, betrayed me, and he would be       willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not.        Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he left       my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him that he       did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been aroused. For       once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I would have won       for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head—for the fact is, my       mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.        But Khoda shefa midêhed—Heaven gives relief—as the Mussulmans       say when you tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I       had been insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,       however, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case of       this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my       counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But although I       forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself to give up       his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some of his less       reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I found myself       lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes:—so       profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.        One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us       in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross       it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and the       archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark. As we       entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and the       interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those of the       unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped.       He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively lively—so       much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion. It is not       impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals. I am not well       enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with       decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of       the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain       species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend,       and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve       him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came       in his way; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd       little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the       time. I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him.       At length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the       termination of the footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile       of some height. Through this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as       usual. But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted       upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the       air. Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The       best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and       as I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done by       Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a       braggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be       sorry afterward;—for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his       head that he could.        I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some       remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a       slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I       started, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into a       nook of the frame—work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a       little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more       reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of       black, but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly       down over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a       girl’s. His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and       his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.        Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk       apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very       odd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a       circumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”         To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact is,       remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known a       Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to say,       therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.        “Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?—the gentleman       says ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;       for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is       particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is       pretty sure to look like a fool.        “Dammit,” observed I—although this sounded very much like an oath,       than which nothing was further from my thoughts—“Dammit,” I       suggested—“the gentleman says ‘ahem!’”         I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did not       think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our       speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own       eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or       knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he could       hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those       simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?—don’t you hear?—the       gentleman says ‘ahem!’”         “You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a       pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are you       quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may       as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then—ahem!”         At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God only knows why.       He left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a       gracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all       the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated
